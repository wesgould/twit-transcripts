[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.440]   This week in Google, the show where
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.680]   we cover Google, the cloud, the Twitter
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.640]   verse, the Facebook verse, and all of the above Mike
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.720]   Elgin is with us in house.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.520]   I have you.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.680]   We're glad to be here.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.440]   Love the show.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.200]   Our news director, well, we love having you on.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.280]   You are a Google+ head.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.160]   I'm a Google freak, generally.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.280]   Me too, but I try to hide that.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.520]   You know why I like Google?
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.040]   Because I have to write a lot about news.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.640]   And Google makes news every single day.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.720]   Apple makes news twice a year.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.480]   But Google is such a newsworthy company
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.040]   to do all these crazy projects.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.560]   They have their hands at every cookie jar.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.040]   It's just a great company to cover,
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.840]   because they just do so much.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.280]   Hey, this is a red letter day for the first time in a long time.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.680]   Somebody's handed me a brush saying, could you brush your hair?
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.200]   Jeff Jarvis is here from London.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.360]   Nondinium, I should throw him the brush across the pond.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.120]   It's late at night.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.120]   Oh, is it--
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.280]   Oh, I like it.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.760]   You know, both of us look like crazy professors.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.200]   I'm the only person on the show who combed his hair.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.280]   Well, until just now.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.200]   You are a crazy professor, though.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.600]   That's the difference, Jeff.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.800]   What are you doing in London?
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.400]   Absolutely.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.760]   I do.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.800]   I was in Perugia, Italy last week for the International
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.560]   Gerbelsen Festival.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.680]   And then I came along to work at the Guardian for four days.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.000]   I am so jealous.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.960]   I've been watching Matthew Ingram's posts from Perugia.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.800]   Last year, O'Malley and Matthew.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.520]   Is this your first time at that conference?
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.400]   It is.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.600]   And Matthew knows how to live it up.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.560]   Matthew-- poor Matthew--
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.440]   I don't think it's a secret.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.840]   He got his backpack stolen for his train seat.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.880]   He was sitting in it.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.800]   But the hotel took pity on him, apparently.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.960]   He got the royal suite.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.320]   Nice.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.520]   What?
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.080]   I thought so.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.240]   No, I want my backpack stolen.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.160]   Well, good for him.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.520]   And Matthew ate very well and enjoyed his time in Perugia
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.760]   with his wonderful wife, Wendy.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.560]   And is he happy?
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.720]   Because he was picked up like six--
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.360]   I think five or six other former giga-omers.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.360]   He was hired by--
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.880]   Who?
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.520]   A fortune.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.080]   Fortune.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.120]   That ain't bad.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.360]   He was one of the six--
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.040]   No, it's great.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.480]   --gigome.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.320]   Alumni.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.080]   Good for him.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.520]   And you ask him about it?
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.680]   Is he happy about that?
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.280]   Yeah, he's happy.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.000]   Yeah, he starts pretty soon.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Well, I'm glad he got to go to Perugia.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.280]   I'm glad you got to go to Perugia,
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.720]   one of the most beautiful, middle-age, medieval cities
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.480]   in Italy.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.520]   Just stunning.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.800]   Indeed.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.720]   And is where many American students
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.600]   go to learn Italian before they do their exchange program.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.320]   My dad's sister went there to get ready for that.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.360]   Are they going to Italy to learn Italian
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.080]   or are they learning Italian to go to Italy?
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.680]   These kids.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.600]   You've got to want to know--
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.240]   Chicken and Egg.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.320]   I don't know which came first.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.040]   Also with us, we're really glad to have
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.360]   Danny Sullivan from Search Engine Land,
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.440]   one of the most astute observers of Google
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.160]   and Search in general.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.040]   And I've got a lot of questions for you.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.240]   This is a Danny Sullivan jammed week.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.120]   Got no answers.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.560]   I got to start with the breaking story, though.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.440]   Google finally announced its wireless carrier business.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.600]   We're going way back to the 700 megahertz auctions
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.640]   that the FCC did.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.280]   So long, we've been saying, if Google would just
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.440]   get into the cell carrier business,
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.040]   they could just destroy it, reconstitute it.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.960]   That's not exactly what they're doing this time.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.920]   It's called Google Fi.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.380]   And it's all fun.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.280]   So fun.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.720]   And it is-- FiD is not stand for Finland.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.800]   It is what we expected from Google, which
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.040]   is a new project Fi, a new wireless carrier based on,
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.160]   frankly, sprint and T-Mobile.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.320]   So they're really an MV.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.520]   It's just a fancy MVNO.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.920]   Fi stands for, finally, Google is an MVNO.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.960]   But it is going to be different.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.160]   For one thing, a flat rate, $20 a month.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.200]   That gives you talk, text.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.240]   By the way, unlimited international, as well as US text--
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.960]   It turns out, though, despite rumors,
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.720]   international will cost extra.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.040]   Well, so let me explain what's going on here.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.120]   So for $20 a month, you get unlimited domestic talk and text,
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.760]   unlimited international texts, low-cost international calls.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.720]   This is through T-Mobile.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.440]   This is what D-L probably is doing.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.560]   Wi-Fi tethering is included in the $20,
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.520]   and it's 120 plus countries.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.760]   But then there's the data component.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.000]   And that starts, you pick a package, 10, 20, 30 gigabytes
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.080]   a month.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.920]   You pay $10 per gigabyte flat rate.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.160]   If you use more, you pay more.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.080]   If you use less, they refund it.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.560]   So there's a little like ting in that regard.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.800]   This would easily be the least expensive mobile system.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.360]   Here's the catch.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.040]   You've got to have a Nexus 6 phone.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.280]   It's the only phone that works with it.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.120]   But here's why I love this.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.080]   Of course, we all have Nexus 6 phones, right?
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.680]   I don't.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.120]   You don't?
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.960]   I don't.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.600]   Jason does.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.880]   Just how old does.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.960]   That's your daily driver.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.760]   You know it is, and I've requested it, and invite.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.120]   I'm waiting to show you something.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.760]   Jones, they're missing, though.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.000]   Jason, so if yours goes missing, it's probably an accident.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.040]   Just don't leave it under the seat on a French train every time.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.000]   Jeff, you still carry the Nexus 6 as your daily driver, don't you?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.840]   Yep.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.000]   There it is.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.560]   Danny, what do you use for a phone?
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.200]   I actually use the iPhone 6 mostly.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.960]   If I had to go out with one phone, usually I go out with two.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.720]   And I would have the Nexus 6, but then the Galaxy S6 just came in.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.000]   So I flip-flopped them for the time being.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.280]   I actually really love the S6.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:17.560]   And although my key feature is that I can put a wallet case on both the S6 and the--
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.600]   and you can't do that with the Nexus 6.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.440]   And so it's like, if I want to have a single phone, then I want to go out, and I want to
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.640]   have all my credit cards and everything in it, then I need the wallet case.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.880]   So next time, make it a flat back.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.880]   But it's a nice-- it's a nice phone.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.680]   It's just big.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.520]   6-inch phone.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.520]   And it's not cheap.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.320]   It's not traditionally inexpensive.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.760]   The Nexus phone starts at $650 for the 32 gigabyte.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.760]   And then I think it's 700 for the 64 gigabyte.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:52.080]   But I guess, I would guess, that there's some sort of-- well, for one thing, it kind
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.400]   of the box does work on both Sprint and T-Mobile.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.960]   So that's one thing going for it.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.960]   LTE.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.640]   So what are the international costs, too?
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.640]   That's a good question.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.880]   I don't know what the international cost is.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.400]   Yeah, I haven't seen those numbers.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:13.880]   But to me, the thing that is the big, big news here is the fact that you have two carriers
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.320]   and Wi-Fi, and calls go seamlessly between them.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.040]   So if you're indoors and you have your home Wi-Fi and you're talking on the phone, and
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.120]   then you leave to go to work, it will switch over to one of the mobile carriers without
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.440]   dropping the call.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.840]   Now, imagine this extended beyond the Nexus 6 and beyond the two carriers.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.440]   Imagine if you could have three or four carriers.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.240]   Imagine if you could have all the carriers.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.240]   You just always have the best.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.240]   Awesome.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.200]   You would have amazing coverage.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:45.040]   And then the other innovation here is the clarity of the plan, because what carriers
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.120]   do is they play a shell game.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.120]   They hide fees.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.120]   Right.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.120]   Yeah, sure.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.680]   We'll subsidize your phone, and then you end up paying $1,200 for your iPhone because
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.800]   they just fold it into the wireless charges and who knows what you're paying for.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.120]   In this case, you get what you pay for.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.680]   You pay for what you get, and it's very clear.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.480]   And I think that's the threatening thing to the carrier model.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:11.080]   Alan Tepper in the chat room says that if you want to buy the Nexus 6 from FIS, part
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.960]   of the FIS experience, you can amortize the cost of over 24 months.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.320]   So that's not so bad.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.320]   No.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.320]   Go ahead.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.320]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.320]   I stepped on you.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.320]   No, no, I'm lying here.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.800]   I also ordered Karma with a founder of Karma.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.200]   And that is also a pay for the data that you use on a Wi-Fi or not.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:40.120]   And I'm delighted that there are now two pressures to get rid of this wasted data playing.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.720]   It's also month to month.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.680]   There's no annual contract.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.240]   So really, I think this is probably what Google's interested in, is kind of a shot
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.800]   across the bow on mobile carriers who've really made this a horrific experience.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.200]   Yes, they have.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.640]   And so I just think it's -- look what they've done with fiber.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.920]   Fiber involves digging trenches and things like that, getting massive regulatory approval.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:10.800]   With something like an MVNO, they should be able to grow this and expand it and sort of
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.400]   get better deals for international coverage and all that kind of stuff much more quickly
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.760]   than they've been able to grow.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.680]   And of course, the fiber project started out as a project.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.680]   Nobody really believed it.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.840]   People thought it was some future thing.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.520]   And then all of a sudden it was upon us.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.120]   All of a sudden they were digging trenches.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.480]   Suddenly, cities are actually going online with this thing.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.880]   So I think that this -- they're coy about it.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.280]   And they said, "Oh, this is just an experiment.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.280]   We're just trying it out.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.280]   It's very limited."
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.920]   But I think within a year or two, this is going to be a pretty significant option for
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.920]   people.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.760]   You'll also have to get a new SIM card, the particular project PHY SIM card, which if you
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.000]   think about it, a SIM card is traditionally tied to one carrier.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.320]   This SIM card will allow you to go back and forth between Sprint and T-Mobile.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.320]   We've seen Wi-Fi calling.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:01.840]   In fact, T-Mobile on the S6 and other phones has Wi-Fi calling, which I think works pretty
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.840]   well.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.000]   What's your experience with it, Danny?
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Have you played with it?
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   No, I haven't.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.880]   I usually -- it's one way or the other.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:17.360]   So the most that I've been dealing with, say, Wi-Fi stuff has been if I have been sending
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.960]   texts from my desktop because I use Google Voice.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.880]   So I'd go and I would connect that way, which is beautiful because I can be in another country
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.120]   and I'm still getting the same sort of stuff.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.080]   And times I've made calls that way, so I haven't used it.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:34.240]   What I am curious is, typically you turn to Wi-Fi because you don't want to use up your
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.240]   data.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.640]   So I want to watch a bunch of movies and everything.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.320]   You hook up to Wi-Fi and you don't even think about whatever the data is if it's open
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.560]   and you're free to use it.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.040]   So I'm wondering when they say, you know, it's one gigabyte, is that one gigabyte if I'm
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.040]   on an open Wi-Fi thing or is it one gigabyte regardless of how the data I'm using?
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.640]   Because you could actually start racking up more data usage that costs you money with
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.640]   this plan.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.640]   Interesting.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.640]   You can count your Wi-Fi usage and I can't find anything in the back on that.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.240]   That's really interesting.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.240]   That can't be.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.440]   No, they can't charge you for your own data.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.480]   Well, I don't think it can be, but you know, I don't think it can be, but it'd be nice
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.480]   to clarify that.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.080]   I mean, I'm going through the fact trying to figure it out with.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.200]   Yeah, I'm not looking at the fact that I am looking at the, well, and I guess they don't
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.600]   spell it out specifically, but they do say this technology connecting to the Wi-Fi hotspots
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.640]   helps keep your speed high and your data bill low.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.400]   So it's connecting to that Wi-Fi would increase your bill actually, then they might not make
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400]   that clear.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.320]   My assumption is probably not counted into it.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.440]   Yeah, I would immediately drop it if it did.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.840]   Yeah, that would be a big comment.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:46.720]   Here's in the FAQ, it says, "Does it cost extra to use my phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot?
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.640]   Project Fi does not charge any extra monthly fees to use your phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.920]   It's included.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.320]   You can use your phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot to share your data with any Wi-Fi compatible
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.320]   device.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.760]   The data you share will count toward your monthly usage data, but that's because when
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.240]   you're doing that as a Wi-Fi hotspot, you can only use LTE.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.920]   So that makes sense.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:12.280]   I will say that I use prepaid for both Verizon and the US and T-Mobile and the US, and I think
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.480]   a lot of people overlooked that the prepaid plans actually can be very good on Verizon.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:23.280]   I think I'm paying $45 a month, and that's giving me, I think, a gigabyte and a half of
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.200]   data, and then you buy additional data and three gigabyte things for $20 that last 90
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.840]   days, but it's actually a really, really good deal, especially when you compare it to their
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.360]   regular paid plans.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.240]   On T-Mobile, I have a plan that's costing me $45 a month, and that includes five gigabytes
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.440]   of data and unlimited call and text.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.080]   But you only know how to get that plan.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.320]   If you go past all the stuff they put up the top and you go at the bottom and go, "Oh,
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.160]   I'll take one of those things down here."
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.120]   This is the best, in my opinion, T-Mobile plan.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.920]   It's a prepaid also, $30 a month.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   Unlimited web.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.920]   That's the one I have.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.920]   Unlimited text.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.920]   That's the secret plan.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.840]   100 minutes talk, and since most people don't talk anymore.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.520]   They'll want to activate your hotspot, and then they're like, "Oh, yeah, we're going
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.360]   to tack on another $15," but it's still a pretty good plan.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.160]   You get your first five gigs.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.160]   But you're right.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.160]   That is the secret plan.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.360]   That's the thing that gets me when John, I can never say his last name, right?
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.360]   LeGere, LeGere.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.800]   LeGere, he goes off about how, "Hey, look at them.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   We're so great.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.800]   We're the interior.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.800]   We're breaking all the stuff."
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.720]   It's like, "You never mentioned that awesome plan that you have down there, and only if
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.840]   people know the secret plan exists, I wish you would just embrace it."
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.720]   You have to go to the prepaid plans on T-Mobile.com, and you'll see it down at the bottom.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.720]   You're right.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.080]   That's comparable to what we're talking about with Google.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:44.000]   No cases do these plans talk about federal and state taxes, which can be significant,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.760]   maybe as much as $8 a month.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.920]   Just consider that when you're selling the bills.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.400]   But the international thing, man, I just came back from Iceland.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:57.880]   When I ended up there, in the airport, bought the local SIM card, put it into my phone, and
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.880]   then I'm pretty good.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.960]   It's not like I'm trying to get phone calls, and I still have Google voice on the phone
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.480]   so I can see if I'm getting any calls coming into me that way.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.640]   But it's still like I don't get the local card or whatever, and I don't want to turn
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.000]   on the phone until I have it or whatever.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.640]   This will be awesome because this means you get your SIM from Google, you go abroad.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.680]   Yes, it's going to be limited to 3G speeds.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.160]   They don't mention that.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.160]   That's the T-Mobile deal.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.160]   You've got to read it in the fact.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.160]   You've got to read it in the fact.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.160]   Says it in the fact.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.960]   The ETA speeds are limited to 3G.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.120]   And then they call 3G.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.120]   Ready for this?
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.120]   256KPS, which to me is not 3G.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.040]   No, it's really Edge.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.040]   It's really 2G.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.040]   Yeah, that's Edge.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.040]   So, all right.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.920]   But still, you know, I get you by, I guess.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.640]   I'm going to be going to Europe in June.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:48.200]   I hope I can get my SIM and my invite before then because I would love to take that Nexus
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.600]   6 with me and give you a real world experience.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.880]   Jeff's traveling all the time.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.320]   I'm sure you would be a good person for them to give this to.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.680]   We get, it's interesting, and I don't know if there's a troll or the country.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.960]   Sprint is terrible in Petaluma.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.280]   T-Mobile is amazing in Petaluma.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.920]   But that might be exactly what this does for you.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.920]   Right.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.920]   You know, Sprint's great in Vegas.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.920]   T-Mobile is terrible.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.920]   Right.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.920]   Go to Vegas.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.920]   You've got a choice.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.680]   And on my experience with Wi-Fi, handoff is actually pretty good.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.640]   Republic Wireless does this.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.080]   And I had a Moto X on Republic Wireless.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.080]   It was pretty amazing.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.000]   Thinking a call on the Wi-Fi at home and intentionally got in the car and drove off as I'm talking.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.480]   I think I did this in my Before You Buy review.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.280]   I was leaving myself a voicemail message.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.280]   It was seamless.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.520]   At no point did you suddenly say, "Oh, now he's on the sales service."
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.520]   It was just seamless.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.360]   So this is totally doable.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.480]   Phones can do this very well now, I think.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.480]   So that's exciting.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.680]   We've been waiting for this.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:49.200]   Why is Google doing this, Jeff Jarvis?
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.320]   Trying to put the big guys in a vice.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.680]   Are they the shaming company?
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.920]   Is that their job?
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.920]   Let's shame the other guys.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.680]   Yeah, we're going to shame you in the mobile now.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.880]   We're going to shame you into a fast-paced-
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.880]   What's the business up a purpose for this?
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.120]   It's always very simple.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.560]   Google's business model could be simpler.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.760]   The more people use the internet, the more money Google makes.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.760]   Full stop.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.760]   Right, Danny?
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.760]   No, I agree with you entirely.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.480]   It's like make it easier for people to get online, stay online, always be online so
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.840]   that we can always be there for them, figuring out ways to make money from them while they're
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.840]   online.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:33.040]   Is this a cost service or is Google subsidizing this with revenues from Search?
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.240]   I bet it's at cost.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.000]   I don't like this, maybe.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.200]   Because this is comparable pricing to Karma.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.720]   Karma is just going to pay one big data bill a month to Sprint.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.960]   It's the way they just tried it to me.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.960]   It's pretty comparable.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.600]   I forget what the common prices are, but it's comparable.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.560]   I bet it's not a loser.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.280]   I bet it is very close to break-even.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.520]   This is the kind of thing Google does.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.520]   They launch something, they see if it catches on, and then they wait for the monetization.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:10.800]   It didn't even occur to Google to, for example, put advertising in Gmail till much later.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.480]   They've had it for a while and a lot of people were using it and they thought, "Huh, we
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.480]   could do this."
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:21.000]   I wouldn't be surprised if this is another experiment to see if it goes anywhere.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.600]   But regarding their business model, yeah, they probably have a secret bunker somewhere
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.480]   where they have a committee of geniuses sitting around going, "What is it that causes people
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.040]   to hesitate to use the internet more?"
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.040]   They probably have a long list of reasons.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.560]   One of them is people are confused about their data plans.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.040]   They really don't know how much it costs and so they hold back.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:48.920]   What happens is the average person wastes $23 a month on data they didn't use.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.560]   They see this situation where people are holding back on using the internet and then they're
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.040]   holding back too much and they're not even using the plans that they have.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.160]   This is because of confusion.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:06.040]   I think by creating all this clarity and by creating a situation where you're never out
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.840]   of range of a good signal, they can just get people.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.560]   They're just making it friction free in terms of using data on a mobile device.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:23.320]   I think that's sort of the grand scheme just to get people to use more data.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.280]   Is there a phone number on here?
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.280]   Where's that?
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.680]   Because there's a phone number somewhere on this website.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.680]   Under experience.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.840]   If you go to the experience tab and then scroll down at the bottom.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.560]   You see there's a number there.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.080]   Keep going right there.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.080]   What is that?
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.080]   Let's call that.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.080]   It's a 404.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.760]   That's Atlanta I think.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.760]   404-978.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.760]   You getting this Jason?
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:55.520]   Are they paying Lionel Richie for this?
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.280]   He's answering every call.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.880]   He and his band are answering every call.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.880]   That is hysterical.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:07.560]   So Google's actually giving out this number and when you call it you get Lionel Richie.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.400]   404-978-9316.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:17.160]   Does a pitch come on at some point or is it just Lionel singing the whole time?
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.760]   It just stops suddenly.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:27.400]   It's such a puckish sense of humor there over the real place.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.760]   Dave Chappelle has a hilarious routine on something like this.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.560]   He explains the reason why they always have 555 something something something on movies.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.040]   It's because everyone someone will call.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.040]   Any phone.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.040]   Put a phone number somewhere and people.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.480]   865-330-9 and every area code is unusable.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.440]   And Google's solution wasn't to use a fake number.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.400]   It was to use a number that actually Lionel Richie answers.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.240]   It's probably a Google voice number.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.280]   Wouldn't be that hard to set up with Google voice.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.280]   Wow.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.000]   No other tighter integration though into Google.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.080]   I guess because it's an X6 it's already pretty tightly integrated.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.720]   But you'd think that they do a tie in a Google voice or something.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.600]   There actually is some degree of integration.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.200]   The calls, texts and voicemails can all be sent to Google Hangouts no matter what device
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.200]   you're using.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.040]   So there is some attempt at integration with Hangouts.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.840]   By the way, Wumpermill says, "See, you do get a human when you call a Google number."
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.680]   It's not always a Python script.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.040]   Well, I think I'll get it and I'll use it.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:34.640]   I'm not sure what I'll give up by AT&T because I'm grandfather in a limited data.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.640]   That one.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.320]   At some point AT&T is going to shake you out of that tree.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.160]   They do not like you.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.480]   They just can't have to figure it out a way to get to you.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.120]   I'm in that tree with Jeff hanging on for dear life.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.320]   They better shake pretty hard.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.320]   I love that.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.320]   I came it up about a year and a half ago and I haven't missed it now because actually it
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.640]   turned out to be cheaper just to go to one of their share everything with your family
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.640]   plans.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.840]   I think you use it less than you think, don't you?
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:05.440]   Well, when I went to the plan, then it was like, "Okay, you've got 15 gigabytes."
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.360]   And then they did the 15 gigabyte and then they said, "Okay."
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.000]   And by the way, we're doing the special promotions and now we're doubling everybody's data which
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.080]   got me into that.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.800]   And then they keep rolling over the data.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.520]   So it's like, I was in the car the other day and I told the kids, "Yeah, go nuts."
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.600]   Streams have you streamed YouTube while we drive up there.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.600]   I don't care.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.600]   Shut up.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:32.560]   Lisa's son is on a shared data plan with Lisa, my wife.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.440]   And Lisa gets I think 9 or 10 gigabytes a month.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:42.160]   But Michael has no compunction about getting on the YouTube and running a playlist and
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.280]   it just runs all day.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.960]   He will blow through all 10 gigabytes literally in a week or two.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:51.600]   And it's crazy because she's gotten no more data.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:57.280]   So it is not impossible to blow through 10 gigabytes on a mobile device.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.280]   I can't wait.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.600]   We all hope we get an invite.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.200]   I don't know what Google's criteria are.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.960]   I imagine they do ask for your zip code that some of it will be coverage.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.000]   Obviously it'll have to be people with an X of six, although they don't vet that, but
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   I presume it.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.400]   And by the way, by the way, of course, I couldn't use my Google Apps account.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.400]   Really?
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.600]   Nope, has to be available.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.600]   Google Apps already logged in.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.880]   Oh, that sucks so much.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.320]   Lionel Richie is the secret ambassador.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.440]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:37.040]   I'm glad Danny Sullivan is here because yesterday was mobile getting mobile getting.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.200]   And I want to know what the what the upshot with the body count.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.200]   The butcher's.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   The butcher's bill.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   Yeah, is.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.200]   But first of word, let's talk about shaving.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.200]   Shall we?
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.080]   This is where all I didn't shave this morning.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.480]   Well, you got a shaving kit right there.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.480]   Looked up this more.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.480]   I should shave.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.120]   I looked up this morning and I and it was late and I said, oh my gosh, and I ran out
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.120]   the door.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.120]   You know what?
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.120]   I was writing code.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.720]   When you're coding, you're starting to look like a developer.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.840]   This is why developers look this way.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.720]   You just forget, you know, about grooming and time and all of this.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.400]   Fortunately, when I go home, I've got a fabulous Harry's shave awaiting for me.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.680]   You know, we're big fans of Harry's.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.480]   H R R Y S dot com.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.080]   When they started it just a couple of years ago, they said, we want to make shaving a
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.080]   better experience.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.600]   It's something we all have to do.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.640]   Something few of us love.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.600]   And having a dull or bad blade is just going to exacerbate it.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:37.280]   So Harry said, let's make sure we can make the best possible blades at a very fair price.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.880]   About half the drugstore blade, about $2 a blade.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.800]   And the way they do it, they bought the factory.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   There are two factories in the world, both in Germany, that make great blades.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:54.040]   So they bought the factory and they designed the blades to their specs for sharpness, high
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.680]   performance for comfort.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.680]   You know, there's knobs.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.720]   You could turn on that factory line to say, oh, yeah, we're going to make the disposable
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   blades now.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.520]   Turn it down.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.640]   But they've turned them all the way up to 11 on sharpness and performance.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.800]   And you get a great shave.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.320]   Better yet, Harry's delivers these blades to your door for free.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.440]   Well, not the blades, but the shipping's free.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.120]   And because they're more efficient, they make themselves the prices right.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.120]   Take a look at a Harry's kit.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.000]   In fact, if you go to harries.com right now, they've got two big kits.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.040]   This is the Winston.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.080]   The Winston kit is about what is it?
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.920]   $35 and then there's a Truman.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.920]   $25.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.920]   $25.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.920]   Less than I thought.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.760]   Then there's a Truman, which is 15.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.680]   In both cases, you're going to get a handle that carries Winston set as a metal handle.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.120]   The Truman set has a plastic handle.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.600]   You're going to get three blades.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.160]   This is all for 15 bucks.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.280]   You're going to get a bottle of the incredible Harry's foaming shave gel, which not only
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.200]   smells great, it works great.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.280]   Although they also have cream.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.800]   If you prefer cream, I use the cream.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.040]   Oh, look, he's got his Harry's.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.040]   Is that a Harry's?
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.040]   That's a Harry's.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.040]   That's the Truman.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.040]   You don't have nuts, but I try.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.920]   Because all I do is shave my neck.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.000]   I don't even use anything with it.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Why would you?
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   You don't need to.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.960]   It's a beautiful, sharp blade, very little pull, very little tug.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.480]   I'm going to do the same thing.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.080]   Who needs razor cream, shave cream?
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.080]   H-A-R-R-Y-S.com.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.040]   And by the way, 15 bucks, I said, for the Truman, make it 10.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.680]   We're going to take $5 off your first purchase if you use the offer code TWIG.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.520]   So that's a great gift for the guy.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.520]   Father's Day's coming up.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.440]   Maybe Dad would like a set of Harry's.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.880]   And for the developer in your life.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:42.200]   And for the developer who forgets to shave, because he's in the middle of a coating binge,
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.200]   just hand it to him.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.280]   Put it on his desk.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.880]   The bottle of mouthwash, two but toothpaste, you got it.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:53.040]   Harry's, H-A-R-R-Y-S.com.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.040]   And get $5 off, but you got to use the offer code TWIG at checkout.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.120]   We love Harry's.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.760]   Thank you, Harry's, for making shaving.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   Everything I do every morning, a much nicer ritual.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.680]   It's funny, I used to shave in the shower.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.680]   Once we got Harry's, I started shaving the sink, both to save water, because we're in
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.000]   a drought here.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.720]   But also because I like the ritual of it.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.120]   And the steaming water and everything.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.720]   And so it just kind of became a more aesthetic experience for me.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   I care more about it.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.440]   The water situation is so bad.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.760]   I switched to wine for all the water.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.680]   I bade in it.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.560]   That's a good idea.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.360]   It's more plentiful in this area.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.240]   There's more wine than water here in the Sonoma County.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.920]   So Danny, what was the prog?
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:43.840]   There were beer spots where you could bathe and hear.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.520]   The prog, the Czech Republic.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.120]   They love there, but they make great, great pilsners.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:56.440]   It sounded like that show Last Man on Earth when he had his margarita pool or whatever.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.680]   So Danny, what is mobile getting?
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.680]   What happened?
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.680]   What was mobile getting?
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.520]   Well, so yesterday, yesterday was mobile getting.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.560]   And what happened was back in February, Google said, "Hey, everybody."
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.400]   We think mobile results.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.920]   We think mobile is very important.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.600]   And in fact, when we are driving people from our search results to pages, if those pages
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.560]   don't render well in their mobile devices, we think that that's an issue.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:25.400]   And so we're going to use one of the big levers we have here at Google to help change
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:31.760]   the web out there by saying that when someone does a search in mobile on Google, we are
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.720]   going to give preference to sites that we deem to be mobile friendly.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.800]   And if your site isn't mobile friendly, then you might not rank as well as you're going
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.120]   to be doing in the past.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:46.600]   And so the idea is that Google wanted people to correct sites where you can read them,
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.880]   but you may have to do the double tap or you may have to switch the phone sideways and
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.240]   kind of stretch it out a bit or you kind of hard to click on links or sometimes you go
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.480]   to the page and like the flash doesn't load and everything.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.720]   All those things are things that Google thinks are not considered mobile friendly.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:06.120]   So they made this announcement in February that on April 21st, we are going to roll
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.800]   out what we call our mobile friendly update and that will start to reward pages that are
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.320]   mobile friendly from that point onward.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.960]   And that mobile friendly test page that you have up there is where anybody can check individual
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.920]   pages on their website to find out if they're mobile friendly.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.600]   If it comes up and it says, "Yes, you're good for that page."
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.760]   If it says, "Now you got problems," then it gives you some advice on how to fix it.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:30.200]   Is this unprecedented A that Google would announce so far ahead of time that they're
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.840]   changing their algorithm and being very specific about what changes are being made?
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.840]   And in fact, I'll get to that.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.880]   Let me say also, in addition to that test that you're showing there, if you log into
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:44.360]   Google Webmaster Tools, it gives you an analysis for your entire site rather than page by page.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.600]   So you're absolutely right.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   This was unprecedented.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.360]   Hey, our page is mobile friendly.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.360]   Excellent.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.360]   Yay.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.440]   That's why we're redesigning it at great expense.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.440]   [laughter]
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.360]   Oh, crap.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:00.320]   Some people might recall that Google had these updates like Panda or Penguin.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.240]   And you might even recall that people were hit by these things and they lost a lot of
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.560]   traffic like a demand media or whatever.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.300]   Those were updates or changes to Google's algorithm that were designed to go after spam
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.240]   or low quality content.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.080]   This isn't going after necessarily low content quality.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.920]   This is akin to things like Google has said where they are going to reward sites that
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.040]   are speedy or they're going to reward sites that are secure.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:26.000]   And it's of a nature and of a scale to the degree that Google says it will be like the
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   anti-spam fighting algorithms where it has an impact on many, many more pages in the
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   mobile results.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.160]   And it is absolutely unprecedented that they have announced so far in advance that on this
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.560]   particular day, we're flipping the switch, which is why mobile getting came out because
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.560]   we've never had that.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.880]   We've never had like, "Oh my God, get prepared.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.040]   It's going to be this day."
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.280]   And so I don't know who coined mobile getting.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.120]   We certainly have been using it as search engine land.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.880]   A lot of other people have been using it as well.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.440]   And that's what happened yesterday.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:31:00.200]   They flipped the switch and if anything happened, nobody knows yet because there's been no big
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.160]   reports of people saying, "Oh my site dropped out of the results or this hasn't been a
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.160]   huge thing."
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:09.120]   So we think that actually they may have been a bit slow in slipping it.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.840]   We also know it's going to take about a week until that it fully rolls out.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:17.320]   But we're watching to see if we get a sense of any brands or any changes that happen where
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.200]   people weren't prepared and they actually lose noticeable ranking and stuff like that.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.840]   Anybody who's done a redesign in the last few years will probably pass this test.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:30.960]   I'm actually stunned because Twitter TV did pass the test, so did LiveDots with.tv.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.960]   We do have...
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.520]   It's not too demanding.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.720]   Let me put it that way.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:41.840]   And the good news is, by the way, it is a page by page type of thing.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:45.640]   So if part of your site isn't mobile friendly, the rest of the site might be okay.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.440]   And also it's ongoing.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.960]   So there's no, well, mobile get-and-have and not going to wait until mobile get-and-to.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.120]   They're constantly crawling the web.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.120]   They're a great movie.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.120]   It would be.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.280]   When they sit on Sci-Fi channel, it's not like that.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.320]   So there's no waiting for that.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.320]   It's ongoing.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.920]   So if you make the changes today and Google come back tomorrow to your website and sees
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.120]   that they're there, then you should see some of your rankings get restored if they really
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.760]   were impacted.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:14.840]   It may be a bigger problem than some people think because the research firm Portant said
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:21.120]   that they tested the 25,000 top sites, what they consider the top sites, and 10,000 of
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.120]   them failed the test.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.120]   It was almost half.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.160]   And including the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.560]   Well, they expect a lot of government sites to fail, actually.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:35.200]   But commercial sites are always being updated and redesigned.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.000]   Mobile friendly doesn't mean mobile responsive, right, Danny?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.960]   It doesn't have to go that far.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.040]   It doesn't have to be.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.600]   It has to render in a way that people wouldn't feel uncomfortable reading on our mobile
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.600]   device.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.760]   But Google is recommending responsive.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.040]   They've definitely taken that side.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.240]   They understand that it's not always going to be the right case in some situations.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:58.920]   And it isn't in some situations, but they really are on the side of responsive and they
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.400]   recommend that people go that way.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.480]   We, so there's mobile friendly and there's mobile friendly, in other words.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.760]   In the old days, the way you would do it.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.800]   And I think my site, Leoville still does that.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.280]   I have a template for mobile.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.560]   And supposedly, when you come in on a mobile device, it will give you a very different-
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.560]   Right.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.560]   looking site.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.080]   That's the old way of doing it.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.120]   And now kind of not preferred.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.200]   The new way of doing it is having the site design in such a way, Squarespace does this,
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:31.720]   that when you, on any side screen, it adapts sensibly so that it gives you good results
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.960]   on any side screen.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.960]   Exactly.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.960]   And that's our new site will be mobile responsive.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.120]   I don't think our existing site is mobile responsive.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.360]   So, but I'm glad to see that that's not a requirement at this point.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.400]   Did you imply that it might get tougher?
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:49.400]   It could, but I mean, it's already kind of tough to begin with.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.400]   Right.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:55.920]   It's not hard to look at some of these sites that like our, our, our, my editor-in-chief,
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.360]   Matt McGee runs a site about U2.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.880]   It's a long-running fan site.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.880]   He's had it for 20 years.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.880]   And he actually did a case study that he wrote on Searching Jilan saying, "Hey, my
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.600]   site's probably going to get hit because this is a hobby that we do.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.600]   It's very proprietary with a lot of our databases and we literally don't have time to go through
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.640]   and resources right now to try to make it mobile friendly.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:19.680]   So potentially he's going to get hit even though if you go to the site, you can read
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.680]   it.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.040]   It's not like you can't do it.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.560]   You just have to do a bit more work.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:28.040]   And so it is, I think, quite a step to say, well, mobile friendly doesn't mean I can use
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:33.000]   it on the mobile device, but that I can, I can use it without extra steps.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.560]   That is a, that's sort of a big checkup.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.560]   Check.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.560]   Already, I think.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:41.760]   And we, when we did this story on Tech News today, 10 AM Pacific 1 PM Eastern, 1,800
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:47.200]   MHTSA Live.tv, we had a chat room full of people saying, "Who does Google think they
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.200]   are?"
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.320]   And, and you know, so this is the philosophical segment of this, of this, a part of the show
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.440]   where this is exactly what Google should be doing.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.440]   Is it?
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.440]   It absolutely is.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.440]   The biggest search engine on the blog.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:04.800]   Well, but yeah, but that, that means that should they start being a bully as well.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.040]   But Google does this in a lot of respects.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.040]   Those decisions.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.320]   They've been doing this with HTTPS.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.640]   They've been doing this with SHA-1.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.280]   They've been doing this in a lot of respects.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.760]   They have the product.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.000]   They have the use and they, they push that when they want to make you choose.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.520]   That's what Google search is.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.560]   That's the secret sauce.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.880]   They, they optimize the user experience.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:31.120]   So if they're, if they're not penalizing sites that are horrible on mobile, when you
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.840]   use a mobile device, then it's a kind of a dereliction of duty.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.160]   And then user experience is lower.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.440]   When I want to go to the top resource on a mobile device, I want them to give me a
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.960]   good experience when I get there.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.960]   And that's, I think, your question.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:44.960]   Question.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:45.960]   Question.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:49.600]   Do they deprecate you if you're searching on the web?
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.600]   No.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.280]   Only on mobile.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.040]   Only on mobile.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.800]   And so, okay, that's interesting.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:01.520]   So you can't really search on the web and expect to see your result.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.320]   You have to do it from a mobile device.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.680]   You have to do it on a mobile device or there's a simulator you can use.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.800]   It's better if you use a mobile device.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:11.440]   And by the way, it's not the only thing that happens.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.720]   So if someone were to search for say, Twig and you weren't mobile friendly because that's
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:20.040]   so brand oriented and it's pretty obvious that you're the right answer, you probably
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.440]   would still come up.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.960]   And if you really did have the right answer over other things, even if you weren't mobile
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.480]   friendly, you still might come up even if it wasn't a brand slash navigation thing.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:36.560]   But you can't put any work for me.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.560]   My blog is not mobile friendly.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.080]   I'll have my son fixing this up.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:45.080]   And by the way, you'll see your word press.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.080]   Here's what you do.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.080]   Here's, you know, go there and do this.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.920]   But if I search for Jeff's service, my site comes up first.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.920]   And that should continue to happen.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.920]   It really is an impact where you have generic searches that are happening where if there are
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.960]   not mobile friendly that that site, the one that's likely to lose out in this sort of
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:36:59.960]   stuff.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.960]   Boy, Jeff, your site sucks.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.960]   I know.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.000]   Page appears not mobile friendly.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.080]   Text too small to read mobile viewport.
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.080]   Not set.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.080]   I don't know what that means.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.080]   Links too close together.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.680]   Content wider than screen.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.320]   Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.320]   This is great.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.960]   How old was you mobile people?
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.360]   I want people to sit in their chairs on their ass and read me.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.280]   The heck are you mobile folks?
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.400]   Leo, can you send that page to Jeff's son?
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.000]   This is going to get on this.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.200]   What does that mean, Danny?
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.320]   Mobile viewport not set.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:36.840]   I think it's the where you define the size of the screen and how it's shaped.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.200]   If I remember correctly.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:43.240]   So you could say on a screen of this size of viewport to be this size.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.640]   Okay.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:48.800]   And you're looking on the right where it says you're how to make this friendly, your own
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:49.800]   word press.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.240]   It's very, very, very helpful.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.640]   In fact, there's some very straightforward stuff.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:01.440]   And I suspect the problem is the theme that you're using and you just, you'll just change
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.320]   to a more mobile friendly theme.
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.920]   I'm on my Leo Villas on WordPress.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:06.920]   And it's not the worry, Jeff.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:10.760]   Because if I search for you on mobile for Jeff Jarvis, I just get this big huge big
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.760]   big top.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.040]   Jeff, I'm going to Jeff head courtesy of Google plus.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.920]   So I mean, that image looks like it's from this week in Google.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:23.080]   I don't even need to go to your left side.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.080]   You've been scrolled.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.960]   I'll search for Gina Trapani and Leo Lepore.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.960]   That's nice.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.480]   People were associated with Jeff now.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.480]   Oh, yeah, you are.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.960]   And then there's Buzz machine number number one after you get past all the other Google
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.960]   stuff.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.960]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.960]   That's fair.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.960]   Oh, what's this Google doodle?
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.160]   Oh, yeah, you got to click on it.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.680]   That's the animal thing I was telling you earlier.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.680]   So this is Earth Day today.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.680]   Earth Day.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.680]   So just click on the load.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.160]   Which animal are you Earth, they quiz?
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.920]   What are you up to on a typical Friday night alone in my borough, rarely seen out, strutting
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.600]   my stuff, following the herd?
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.000]   I'm not alone in my borough.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.520]   I'm in my borough with my honey.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.600]   But I'll click alone in my borough.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.600]   So you've got honey.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:07.600]   So that's your probably a bear.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.600]   I'm a honey badger.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.360]   You and your best friend show up to a party wearing the same outfit.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.360]   No big deal.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.880]   How embarrassing fight fight.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.200]   I'm going to fight if you wear the same outfit.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:25.400]   a snack, seafood, fruit and/or insects, meat, or salad, what do you look for in a partner?
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:32.840]   Bright colors, loud grunting sounds, a complex system of glands, or old-fashioned values.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:36.880]   feats of strength your hobby, feats of strength, work around the house, swimming, none of
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:42.780]   the above, I think, feats of strength, I'm a honeybanger I know it, I know what I know
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.780]   it.
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.400]   I know it, your true friends know they can always call on you to scare a white lion's
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.200]   or fight a king cobra.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.400]   So I should share this, right?
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:56.440]   Oh yeah, I was checking, there's been about like, and you're a woolly mammoth, woolly mammoth.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.880]   Five or ten people sharing them for a minute.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:10.720]   I'm a honeybanger, honeybanger don't care and I don't care, share.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:16.320]   But it doesn't share my honeybanger picture, just the, this is the picture I want to show.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:21.080]   I'm going to share that.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.080]   That's fun.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.880]   Do they, they pretty much have a Google Doodle every day now?
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.160]   Yeah, it's getting that point.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:34.320]   I mean, there's always a 37th or 125th or, you know, 33rd anniversary to be celebrated.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.080]   They've taken the fun out of the Google Doodle.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.000]   Let's make it something special.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.840]   Two days.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.840]   Yep.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.000]   They should generate cash that spills out on your desk.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   That would be impressive.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.960]   I mean, let me, I'm going to tweet it, wait a minute.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.200]   Maybe if I tweeted, I'll get my honeybanger picture.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:41:02.120]   And that be said, when is Google Plus, what's going on with, with, with Google Plus?
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:08.960]   I just read some stats that show that it is not exactly a, well, there was a guy on Forbes
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:13.560]   who wrote a piece talking about how it's dead again.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.000]   I don't like the dead thing.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.640]   But he had, he tried out those stats which were giant.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.640]   No, it is absolutely not giant and.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.120]   Which isn't, by the way, a bad thing.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.680]   I often like social networks where it is an exclusive group of people.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.680]   Right.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:35.320]   Well, it's interesting because it's probably similar in size to Twitter in terms of the
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.800]   number of active users.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:41.200]   But Twitter has every single journalist, lots of famous people.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:45.520]   And the people you're going to find on Google Plus are often very, very smart and engaged,
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:49.840]   but they're less likely to be Lady Gaga or, you know, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.240]   Well, Jeff, this is a bad example because Jeff is on Google.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.760]   He's one of the people who's on Google Plus.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:57.800]   But, but we had this, you know, we, over the weekend, we had this big whoop-d-do where
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.640]   this guy posted this thing and said, oh, it's, you know, it's dead.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.800]   And then he just got hammered with traffic from Google Plus from people passionately
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.640]   arguing in favor of Google Plus.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.640]   And this happens every time.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:13.160]   That doesn't mean that they've got a huge audience, but super passionate users.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.400]   And so that's essentially where the dust is settled now.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:21.160]   And Google Plus is the place where people who are passionate about something, usually
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.800]   technology oftentimes, but every other thing go.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:30.640]   And we love it, but it's not sort of like a site for the masses.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.640]   And it's not a site for celebrities and journalists.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.920]   And it's not the site for everybody, which is what Facebook is.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:41.720]   So everybody sucks compared to Facebook in terms of numbers and engagement.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:45.640]   And Google Plus is, you know, it's good for the people it's good for, but it's, it's just
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:49.080]   not everybody's cup of tea.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:52.440]   You know, you see, the truth is that some people want to interact with people they already
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.320]   know.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.640]   And some people want to find new people.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.920]   And Google Plus is the place to find new people.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:02.840]   Facebook is the place to interact with people you already know.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:08.680]   And Twitter is the place where you don't really interact so much as get information and swap,
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:13.240]   you know, quite Twitter is not about conversation by any means.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:17.200]   It's funny because every time somebody does a threaded conversation thing like Google Plus,
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:21.760]   like Jai Koo, like I can go on and on friend feed, they fail.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.800]   People don't want to spend that much time.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:24.800]   No.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.680]   But the people who do, I think of the people that you and I kind of are interested in
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:34.680]   terms of engagement, I would say that's probably true of you too, Jeff.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.680]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.360]   It was a Google Plus post.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:41.080]   Google hasn't released any information about their stats, but somebody did some deep, some
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.440]   sort of deep data mining.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:48.040]   Well, they, they most now attempted a huge, huge report last week, which I mean, I don't
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:52.160]   even think we ended up covering in the end because we were sort of like, who cares at
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.160]   this point.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.760]   I mean, that's the latest kind of call of all.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.360]   I know, but you know, I think when you go back to Google Plus, I mean, my view of it is,
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:09.040]   it is the, it is the Google online store or it is, it's the place for Google fandom.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:13.440]   If you like Google products, Google products and services or whatever, that is your home
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:18.120]   for a lot of people that are there in the way that, you know, you can go to an Apple
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.120]   store.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.280]   Sometimes you see a lot of Apple fanatics or whatever.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:26.600]   But you know, I think the fact that sometimes the posts that get the most engagements are
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:31.680]   on the posts about whether or not Google Plus is dead or not is both tiresome and indicative
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:38.040]   of how little traction the services had broadly because you never, ever see that happening
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.040]   on Facebook.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.480]   Nobody says Facebook's dead.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.480]   Nobody says Facebook is dead.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.320]   And then the entire Facebook community turns out to try to say, Oh, no, it isn't.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.320]   You just not using it right.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.320]   You have done this.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:51.480]   And even on Twitter, you all see sometimes people would debate whether or not Twitter
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.080]   is going to get be dead or whatever.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.600]   And people will argue it a bit among a small select group of people.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:00.440]   Meanwhile, everybody else is all busy tweeting, you know, their stuff.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.320]   So I mean, I'm still on Google Plus.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:05.880]   I found that personally the engagement is down even though I haven't done anything different
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.760]   from day one.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.840]   You know, it sends traffic.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:11.840]   It does.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.840]   But it's just.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.280]   Well, I actually think that the Google Plus is not a good place to.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.600]   It's not a good way to send traffic.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:22.000]   Yeah, there's a lot of engaged people and you can send a lot of traffic.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.640]   But people on Google Plus don't want to leave Google Plus, which is the opposite of Twitter.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:31.040]   Twitter is almost always a link to somewhere else on Google Plus.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.280]   It's very difficult to drive.
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:37.680]   It's more it's easier to get people to comment and engage and share than it is to get them
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.840]   to watch a video or just click on a link.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.840]   And one of the reason there, I think there are two reasons why nobody has these arguments
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:46.240]   on Facebook.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.680]   One of them is that on Facebook, it's like oxygen is kind of there.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.040]   People don't care about Facebook itself.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.200]   Their people are there and that's why they're there.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.360]   And secondly, nobody loves Facebook.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.320]   Like the people who love Google Plus really love it.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.440]   So they're always champing of the bid to have that argument.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:05.360]   And so you're missing the main reason it doesn't happen is because it's patently not
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.360]   dead.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.360]   Yeah, right.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.360]   That's the main reason.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.080]   Whenever I hear people protesting, we're not dead yet.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.520]   That's in a way an acknowledgement that it will kind of looks dead.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:17.520]   Here's a question.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.520]   Here's a question for you.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.320]   When was the last time either Danny or Mike, what was the last time that they added a new
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.080]   feature to Google Plus?
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.840]   It's dead from Google's point of view, right?
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.000]   It's not dead.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   It's in it's in hibernation.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.160]   They're not going to do anything more with it.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.440]   And they're going to actually keep breaking out parts of it and spinning them off.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.640]   And like friend feed was in hibernation.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.360]   It won't they won't die.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:43.600]   I mean, like in five years from now, they might eventually say, Hey, by the way, that
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.480]   stream thing that we've been doing, that's the remaining part.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:52.920]   It's being sunsetted into Google, reader news, whatever it would be in.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:57.480]   Just to put this in perspective, the kind of the bottom line of the Stone Temple analysis,
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:01.760]   they took a little more than half a million posts just at random and analyze them and
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:08.280]   came up with a number that about the monthly active users, which is a number, you could
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:13.800]   argue its value that both Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and others use to kind of say, this
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.320]   is how big we are.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:20.760]   The monthly active users somewhere around 23 million people on Google plus, which sounds
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:27.240]   like a lot until you say 200 million at Twitter, 300 million at Instagram over a billion at
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.360]   Facebook monthly active users, 23 million.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.680]   It's not dead.
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:32.680]   It's not dead.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:33.680]   That's a lot of people.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.680]   That's 23 million.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:40.160]   That's more people than watch our show, but and we're not dead, but it's just not a scale
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.560]   of a Twitter or Facebook or even an Instagram.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.080]   Now those are public posts, right?
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:48.960]   Now Google plus, well, he talks about that too, this idea that maybe a lot of people
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:49.960]   are posting behind the scenes.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.680]   Well Google plus is a place of stage fright.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:57.880]   When you post something on Google plus, some, I don't know why, but it seems really consequential.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:58.880]   People are timid about it.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.880]   That's true.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.120]   Part of the reason is that people will jump on you.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:05.240]   It's a very critical, critical, criticism-oriented community.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:12.480]   And so anything, you post anything, you can say, you know, the sky is pretty and people will
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.720]   jump on you to disagree about it.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:20.480]   So a lot of people are shy and I imagine that the vast majority of engagement is not public.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:24.000]   And there's no way for anybody to measure that unless you go through and take a poll
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   or something.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   But it also doesn't matter.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.200]   I mean, that was the argument Google made when they launched, which was, "Oh, well,
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.720]   you can't see there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes," or whatever.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.280]   It's like, fine.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:38.160]   For the most part, if someone is trying to consider Google plus alongside other social
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:42.440]   networks as a social media manager, they don't see the value.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:47.200]   And that's been demonstrated even from the height of Google doing everything they could
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.200]   do to get you onto it.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.360]   And at this point, Google doesn't even seem to be trying to convince the social media
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.600]   managers that they should be doing stuff on Google plus.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.640]   I mean, it's just really don't.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.320]   I mean, it's not, you know, Beyonce is getting a free Google plus to wear on her wrist or
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.320]   anything like that.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.840]   It's just, you know, it's whatever.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:04.840]   It's there.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.520]   And the tools are being spun out or whatever.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:09.640]   And it's almost like we don't even want to talk about the Google plus as all streams
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:12.120]   and photos or whatever or stuff like that.
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:18.400]   From a consumer point of view, I guess they still try to get you to sign up for it when
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.400]   you get things.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.000]   But usually I see that stuff is like because you want your photos or you want this other
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.400]   stuff and things like that.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:30.680]   And so the, you know, in the past, and then the lastly, the big lever that they really
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:35.960]   had to let Google plus push beyond its weight had been the search results where they said,
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.960]   well, you know, authorships all hooked up and we're doing all these things.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:42.000]   And that got a lot of publishers to say, all right, I guess it really is worth my
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   time to do it.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.560]   When they took all that stuff away, even though the Google plus connection is still
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:51.440]   very strong for personalized search results and, you know, there's a reason why people
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.840]   are connected with you.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.520]   You may do better with it.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.600]   Even that doesn't even seem to be working for people.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:02.520]   So, you know, I'm actually, I always come across like this, you know, Google plus can
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:04.600]   do no wrong, but that is not the case at all.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:08.920]   I think there's tons of room for criticism of Google plus, but I think people criticize
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:10.920]   the wrong thing.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:15.840]   If you have any sort of hobby or enthusiasm, I guarantee you go to there and search for
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:20.920]   that enthusiasm, whether it's Macrame or basket weaving or, you know, robot building
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.600]   or beer brewing or whatever it is.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:27.840]   I don't care how obscure your enthusiasm is, you're going to find a teaming community
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:32.240]   of active people passionate about it, knowledgeable.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:36.760]   And by the way, you can search Google plus like hardly anybody criticizes Facebook, which
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.840]   you can't even search.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:42.760]   They can't even search the social network and nobody says a word about it.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:49.120]   The problem with Google plus is that they're, ironically, the algorithms are horrible.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:52.560]   You go to the notifications and you're getting stuff in other languages like Google doesn't
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.200]   even know I speak English.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:56.040]   Like how is that even possible?
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:59.640]   I go in there and I get all this engagement and there's this thing at the top that says
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.440]   show comments removed as spam.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.440]   They have an algorithm.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.440]   Right.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.560]   Twitter's in the news this week for introducing something like this that an algorithmically
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.560]   based way.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.560]   I just, I didn't put those accurately.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.120]   It's not accurate at all.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.120]   It's terrible.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.120]   Terrible.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:16.800]   They take, they take, in every sense, I have a lot of comments that are removed for no good
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:17.800]   reason.
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.120]   Great comments from good people are flagged as spam.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:25.640]   And I have to spend a huge amount of time slogging through there and re, you know, deflagging
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.480]   or whatever you call it.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:30.920]   How is it possible that Google can't get that right after all these years?
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.640]   These are the kinds of things that Google deserves massive criticism for.
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:38.360]   But if you're a user who cares if social media managers use it or not, if you have an
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:43.640]   enthusiasm, you want it and you're looking for a community to engage with over your enthusiasm,
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:45.920]   Google Plus is untouchable.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:49.400]   And that makes me sad because I come back to the well.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:56.080]   I've always wanted this place where people like me could gather elites, articulate and
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:00.480]   talk and not be flamed and not be trolled and have a great conversation.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.720]   Friend feed for that.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.640]   You know, the well was briefly.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.480]   Friend feed was that for me briefly.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.920]   Jai Koo was that for me briefly.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.840]   Google Plus had that promise.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.800]   Maybe there isn't going to be a place like that.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.640]   Maybe we don't need, maybe you should just have regular friends in real life.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.640]   It's a concept.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.240]   I'm not sure I'm ready to absorb.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:24.360]   Well, I think Mike has an important point that if Google has seen it, it is a very good
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:28.280]   platform for communities as opposed to actual relationships.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:31.080]   And they didn't, and everything about it.
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:36.320]   So they saw early days all of photography and they didn't do the right thing about it.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:39.920]   Is Google Group still here or is that gone?
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.080]   Because that's really what it's called.
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.080]   That's what Google Groups is.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.240]   Yeah, they still have Google Groups.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:48.360]   They should have replaced Google Groups with Google Plus, maybe.
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:49.440]   But give it a shot.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.440]   Like search for anything.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:51.440]   Search for a cupcake.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.440]   Search for a cupcake.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:53.440]   No, you're absolutely right.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:56.520]   It's like there's a big group that you and I are both members of.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:57.520]   The art of bread.
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.520]   The art of bread.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:52:59.520]   It's phenomenal.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:00.520]   But that's a community.
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:02.200]   But even if you don't use it, like communities, I think are a mixed bag.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:07.480]   But every stream is a search result.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.360]   The elegance of that is there's twins.
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:11.360]   There's our cupcakes.
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:16.920]   But I mean, the cupcake community on Google Plus is just foaming in the mouth with enthusiasm.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:24.080]   I mean, it's like a really vibrant, enthusiastic, engaged community around anything.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:28.120]   And it's like, it's not about, here's another cat photo.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.040]   It doesn't have to be.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.040]   Exactly.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:34.160]   You search for cupcakes, you're unlikely to see cats.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.080]   Or are you?
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.280]   You'll see cat cupcakes somewhere.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.120]   There's my cupcake post there.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:41.760]   What cupcakes with what?
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.080]   What cupcakes look like nachos?
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.000]   Nacho cupcakes?
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   What the hell?
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.160]   Anyway, 234 plus ones for my nacho cupcakes.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.320]   Cross in the streams at 43 reshears.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.320]   That's not bad.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:58.200]   So I, you know, I have a full of chicken, super bowl cupcakes.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.200]   I think not.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:06.280]   Anyway, so I think each of the social networks has something for, you know, there's a social
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.280]   network for everybody.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.720]   You're going to get this exact argument for people who are Pinterest.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:10.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.720]   Well, exactly.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:12.720]   It's very Pinterest-like.
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:18.040]   But the difference though, I mean, and I agree with you, if you, whatever is your home,
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.040]   that's good.
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:22.720]   And if you're finding a place that's there, that's wonderful.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:27.000]   You know, but no one questions whether or not Pinterest sends lots of traffic.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.480]   And I mean, they just don't, not, not, not the people who are in charge of, say, doing
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:35.000]   social media because that's their profession and trying to reach out to audiences.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.520]   And I get that that's going to be different from necessarily the people who are trying
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.520]   to use it.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:39.840]   But they just don't question it.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:43.600]   You know, Pinterest is a huge powerhouse with communities and with all this stuff as
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:44.600]   well.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:49.960]   So it's, you know, ultimately Google wanted, despite whatever they want to talk about saying
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:52.640]   Google plus was just a layer and all this stuff.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.340]   They wanted it to be a Facebook challenger.
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:56.000]   They wanted it to be a social destination.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.880]   And it just not stepped up to being that kind of a challenger to these other things.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:05.360]   And so either they're out of that space or it's going to be some time until they figure
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:06.960]   out another way to approach it.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.320]   I don't know which of those are.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:11.320]   That's not again the takeaway from the people who are there and that are active and doing
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:12.320]   everything.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.920]   But when, you know, we got Facebook earnings going right now.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:19.160]   Facebook is making oodles and oodles of money off of social based advertising.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.160]   That's not money Google's making.
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:23.360]   And that's Google money that they, money that Google wants and they don't have a product
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.360]   to get it.
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:28.800]   I mean, Google's rolled out all kinds of really go ahead Jeff.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:29.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.040]   I'm sorry for the like here.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.240]   I think it's not, I'll be thinking about this lately.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.560]   You're for your reaction to this.
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.440]   I don't think it's just social.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:39.840]   I think what Twitter has, you know, what's, what, what, what, what Twitter has, but what
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:46.600]   Facebook has is a street and, and getting somebody's attention for a time of the stream
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:52.600]   to keep strolling along and, and the chat communities and Twitter and all that.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.040]   But it's Facebook, but well, has the street.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.160]   That's where we want to get our content right into it and our advertising into it.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.720]   And that's the value of Google doesn't have a stream.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.240]   Well, and that's what I was writing about.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:03.240]   This is what I did in March.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:08.240]   I wrote this thing called the web of streams and I was talking about how when we got that
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:11.960]   new name that suddenly was photos and streams and it was like, yeah, you're right.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.400]   You know, you have an Instagram stream.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.560]   You got a Facebook stream.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.160]   You got a Facebook stream.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:19.160]   You know, you can argue to some degree that Snapchat when you go through it, you have a
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:22.000]   stream that's kind of going there and Yahoo's trying to do stream.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.040]   And it's like, what's the Google stream?
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:30.160]   You know, I think Google's best dream actually is YouTube and going back to what you said,
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.760]   Leo, where the kids, my kids will do the same thing.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:36.640]   They load up YouTube and it just goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:42.480]   But then I think where Google misses is that that's not the case when you're on say mobile
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:47.560]   where, you know, they might not, I think just let the mobile, let YouTube keep playing
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.560]   on the mobile device.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:50.400]   I just haven't seen that kind of behavior.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.880]   Maybe it's going off.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:57.160]   But what I kind of wonder is that they couldn't roll out what I call YouTube gram or something
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:58.160]   like that.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:00.960]   But basically, you know, you're flipping through and it's all short form video.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.960]   Hey, they missed the boat on Mira's head.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:08.400]   And Paris total Google had the technology and just didn't years ago was incredible.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:13.280]   And they could do that, but that's, that's different than the short form videos that are
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:18.320]   popular with Vine or that are popular with Instagram where I can consume this video on
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.800]   a mobile device.
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:20.800]   And it's 15 seconds.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:21.800]   And I'm done.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:25.680]   And when you do it in those small amounts, it also means it's very easy for advertisers
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:28.720]   to come along and say, Oh, by the way, we're going to insert this as well.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:32.000]   And they don't have that sort of thing for YouTube because there's just no division
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   of it.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.520]   And there's no, there's no strong thing.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.640]   I think I'm mobile to go.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:36.640]   I'm bored.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.880]   I just want to flip through YouTube stuff and be entertained and I need to keep channels swapping
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:40.880]   or whatever.
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:44.280]   I think that's an opportunity for them if they get it together.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.240]   But well, they, they're going in the wrong direction.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:50.280]   I mean, originally Google Plus used to auto update.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:55.100]   You could set up any sort of stream, any sort of search, any sort of any of your circles.
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:57.640]   And it would just sit there and every time there's a new item, we're just chunked through.
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:01.000]   I used to have Google Plus take up one third of my screen and it would just sit there full
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   time.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   And then they did a redesign and it doesn't work.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:10.240]   This is the late lamented track feature from Twitter going back maybe seven years.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.760]   Twitter used to have this thing where you track a topic.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:17.560]   And when they took it out, it was actually, it was early in the days of Twit, we were
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:23.640]   very much involved in the, in the Steve Gilmore's bear hug movement to get track back in Twitter
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:27.560]   a movement that was ill-fated because they never did bring it back.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.960]   There is something about that kind of thing.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:29.960]   I don't know why.
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:32.120]   It seems like that's something Google would embrace.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:37.320]   But yeah, what, you know, so what is, you know, clearly, if you're a company like Google,
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:43.960]   you don't want to say, we're going to chase after the app of the moment, that's crazy.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.440]   But maybe you don't have the people that could create the next big app.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.480]   Maybe that's not where those people end up.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:54.260]   I personally think the problem with Google Plus is that all the vision left with Vic
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:55.260]   and Dotra.
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:59.280]   I think what happened was that there was a massive bloody world war within Google between
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.800]   Sundar Pichai and Vic and Dotra.
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:07.280]   And Sundar Pichai won and Vic and Dotra left.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:11.280]   And so now they're grinding salt in Vic and Dotra's fields.
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.720]   What is Vic doing these days?
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.320]   He is living off the fad of a land, as far as I can tell.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:17.840]   He's still active on Google Plus.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:21.360]   But as far as I know, he hasn't taken a new gig.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:22.360]   Right.
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.520]   Even as a VC.
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:32.240]   But Vic and Dotra was on this and backed by Larry Page was on this sort of crusade to
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.520]   integrate every single Google property in a Google Plus.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:41.880]   And it was the internal politics that enabled him to start to achieve that.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:43.840]   And there was so much pushback internally.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:48.040]   And someday somebody should write a book, Jeff Jarvis, about what happened.
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:52.600]   But basically he ended up losing that battle and they've been since just decoupling it.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:56.880]   By the way, almost exactly a year ago, April 24th, 2014.
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:01.200]   So almost to the day one year ago that Vic and Dotra left Google Plus.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.760]   And I think it has been at least a year since there was any change to Google Plus at all.
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:05.760]   Well, that's it.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.440]   There have been changes here and there, pretty small stuff.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.440]   And some of them not good.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.120]   For example, they they they they they.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.920]   They've got the real name policy.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.920]   And that kind of that kind of.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.640]   That was the first thing they did.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:22.160]   The combination of continuing to be integrated with YouTube and also having real real names
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.680]   made Google Plus a lot more like YouTube in terms of crap comments.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:32.440]   And so the comments, you have to be more vigilant in order to weed out the lousy nonsensical
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.960]   comments nowadays because of those two changes.
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.640]   Those are not necessarily a change for the better.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:41.960]   I think if Google Plus had started out with no real names policy, you know, when when
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.760]   people were clamoring for it, they should have done it.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:44.760]   They didn't.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.160]   And they waited until nobody cared anymore.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.360]   And then they enacted the real names policy.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.880]   The timing was just way off.
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:56.440]   And so anyway, I just think it has a lot more to do with what's happening internally at
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.560]   Google and less to do with Google's true strategic objectives.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.680]   And I think it's just a terminology looking at what the result is to figure out what's
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.000]   going on inside of some black box.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.880]   Apparently, according to Bloomberg Business Week, Elon Musk had a deal to sell Tesla to
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.080]   Google in 2013.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:18.880]   I don't know if was it widely known that Tesla and this is from a Ashley Vance's book,
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:23.200]   Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a fantastic future.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.480]   Was it widely known that in 2013, Tesla was almost bankrupt?
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.600]   I don't think it was.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.520]   Not to my knowledge, it wasn't.
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:38.480]   According to the book, Danny Sullivan would know if anybody did.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:41.040]   If they were going to do Tesla, I would know that.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.880]   They were going to be bankrupt.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:48.320]   They had a profit in May 8, 2013.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.200]   That was their first profit announcement and weeks before, according to Ashley Vance,
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:59.600]   they had been on the verge of bankruptcy, struggling to turn pre-orders into actual sales.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:04.520]   Musk put his staff on a crisis footing to save Tesla and began negotiating with Larry
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:09.880]   Page, a deal to sell the company to Google.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:16.160]   Now it's possible that more is being made of this than the events merit.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.160]   How so?
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:22.040]   Well, Ashley Vance is selling a book and this is an excerpt from the book.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:27.840]   Essentially, as he says in the excerpt, Elon Musk and Larry Page are personal friends.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.840]   And so...
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:29.840]   Could have been over a drink.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.840]   They said, "You know what?
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.160]   Yeah, let's get together and just see if there's anything here.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.400]   Obviously, the deal didn't happen."
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:38.880]   So you don't know if they were in negotiations and they were on the brink of buying Tesla
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.840]   or if they chit-chat and said, "No, no, it will pass."
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.240]   Those are two very different things.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:50.760]   The story says that Tesla must have won at $6 billion plus a commitment for $5 billion
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.200]   in capital to expand factories.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.280]   Probably would have been a good deal, $11 billion.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.320]   I don't know if Tesla has justified that.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.360]   I think it will be eventually.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.040]   I called two years ago for Apple to buy it.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.880]   I think that would be a cool purchase.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.760]   There were a lot of rumors that that was about to happen.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.920]   And they never ceased.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.720]   But I just want to own an Apple Tesla somehow.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.800]   I don't know why, but we're going to take a break.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.800]   Come back with more.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.040]   How about building your own Apple Tesla with little bits?
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.040]   Could you do that?
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.280]   I don't know.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.960]   I have the little bit of the Lux kit.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.720]   It sure does a lot.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.720]   Five million possible circuit combinations.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.320]   Fifteen projects in a box.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:34.560]   You know, in triangulation on Monday, we talked to the producer and director of a new film
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.360]   called Coding, debugging the gender gap in technology.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:43.400]   And one of the things she said, and I completely agree with her, is part of the solution is
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:49.280]   to give kids, boys and girls access to things like little bits.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:53.960]   She actually mentioned little bits by name because little bits is so accessible and so
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.800]   much fun that it can get your kid into electronics projects.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:04.760]   The little bits, the Lux kit comes with a great book and a description of all the different
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:08.720]   pieces, the pulse, the sound trigger, the timeout, the fork.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.040]   What's neat about these is you can't put them together wrong.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.720]   There's no soldering.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:18.400]   So you kind of have immediate gratification even for a doofus like me.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.880]   When you're putting them together right, they snap together, but the magnets in here will
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:24.640]   prevent you from putting them together wrong.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:30.160]   And so it's easy enough to come up with just a kid of your own or to follow the instructions.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:35.240]   I think what will happen is, and by the way, color coding tells you what each part does.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.680]   So pink modules affect the modules after them.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:43.160]   The blue modules are the power, there's the power module.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.160]   The green modules are activities.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.600]   They do something.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:50.160]   So for instance, this green module is a speaker.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.440]   This is the pulse.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.560]   I think I've just invented something incredible.
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.520]   So just plug it in and see what happens.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:58.520]   It's so cool.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.160]   I want you to try these out.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:06.760]   A great gift for kids, whether they're yours, nephews, or nieces, even parents, coders, hardware
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.440]   hackers, makers, artists, and designers.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.440]   Love little bits.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.040]   You can get your dog to text.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.520]   Yes, you can.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:15.960]   Or make a robotic snack server.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:21.400]   Why buy electronic toys or gadgets when you can build your own and vent them yourself?
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:27.880]   There are over 60 modules that can be used in virtually limitless creative combinations.
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.000]   I just think the idea, whether a kid is going to become a maker or not, the idea that the
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:37.120]   kid understands a little bit better how things fit together, you just can't go wrong with
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.120]   this.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:41.520]   And you may be lucky because you may get a kid that goes, "Wow, I think I've got an idea
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:44.760]   for something I'm going to call the hyperloop."
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.640]   The base and the luxe kit is a great way to get started.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:51.040]   Space kit was worked on in partnership with NASA.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.600]   So it's a great way to explore Earth and Space science.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.600]   There is an Arduino coding kit for kids who are ready to start programming.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.280]   We love the Arduino.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.560]   Now the deluxe kit that I've got has 18 modules.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:05.280]   They snap together with billions of circuits, no wiring or soldering.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.640]   And you can make something in seconds.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.400]   There's a synth kit.
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:12.560]   Kids who like to make music and make sound and make noise love the synth kit.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:17.600]   And of course, Arduino is great for anybody who wants to program and manipulate the outside.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.000]   Well, I just think these are so great.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:27.200]   Now we're going to give you $20 off your first kit when you go to littlebits.com/twig plus
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.440]   free shipping in the US.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:35.760]   L-I-T-T-L-E, little B-I-T-S bits.com/twig.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:41.000]   Everyone can build electronics and learn about them with little bits and $20 off your first
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.960]   order makes it even more a little bit of it.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:44.960]   Little bit of it.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.680]   It's just little bits.com/twig.
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:52.400]   If you make something, would you Instagram me?
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.520]   Mr_loport.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:58.120]   And I would, I'd love to share, I haven't actually checked, but I would love to share
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:03.200]   some little bits projects from our twig listeners.
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.920]   There's not a health kit yet.
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:09.240]   But that must be just a matter of time.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.360]   So you had this story in search engine land.
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:18.560]   The story of the man who put Edward Snowden's den, secret den, inside the White House.
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:23.120]   And he went, how does that happen?
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.800]   That's actually a really interesting story.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:31.120]   So a reader tipped us to it saying, check this out or whatever, and we looked at it.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.320]   And it's not unusual.
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.480]   You might find a weird thing on Google Maps.
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:38.120]   It's unusual when you find a weird thing that's been verified by Google.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.120]   Wow.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.640]   That, that, that thing was literally like, Google verifies.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.160]   This is Edward Snowden.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.480]   By the way, it looks where the Oval Office is to be.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.920]   Yeah, actually, it's not where the Oval is because I had to go look it up.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.920]   I thought it was too, because it's all curvy like that.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.120]   He's about the Oval Office is actually in the West Wing.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:56.120]   Oh.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.120]   I think you'll see another curvy bit.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:00.000]   So I got to learn a little White House geography.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.160]   White House geography.
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.160]   That was my first thing.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:06.480]   And in fact, my headline originally I was starting to write Oval Office like, Oh, wait
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.480]   a minute.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.480]   So, oh, it's gone now.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.480]   Darn it.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.880]   What happened was there's a guy named Brian Sealy.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.400]   And I did a follow-up interview.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:20.480]   It might be linked at the end of this story, or you can search for him by the name.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:22.360]   But yeah, there it is.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:23.360]   How that long, I think.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:28.720]   So you might recall about a year ago, this thing came out where Google map somebody had
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:32.960]   made listings for the FBI and the Secret Service on Google that were verified and people
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.880]   started calling them the lead tips and things.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:39.800]   That was this guy Brian Sealy who basically was doing this because he's frustrated that
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:45.920]   Google does not take the security of their search listings more relevant or more more
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.920]   seriously.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:47.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.680]   And so he did a TED talk the week before this latest thing happened and he'd set this whole
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:57.000]   thing up so that he could show as part of his TED talk in Kirkland in Washington state
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.600]   how you can go through and do this.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:05.480]   Let me talk about my ex because we are a verified listing, the Twit broadcast.
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:11.720]   And the way it worked is I created the listing in Google Places and then they say, "Okay,
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:15.000]   so we can verify this by sending you a postcard."
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   And so they sent a postcard to that address and it had a code on it and I went back in
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.320]   and I entered the code.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:25.320]   And now that at least proves that I have access to mail at that address, that seems like a
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:27.200]   fairly good way to verify it.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.120]   There are other ways, but that's the simplest.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.120]   So how did he get around that?
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.320]   Well, that's where it goes wrong.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:38.040]   So they, you got to verify it by phone number or mailing it or whatever.
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:41.320]   So you do the verification by postcard, it comes to the physical address, you got this
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.760]   little pin code, you call in and you enter the code and they go, "Okay, well someone
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.720]   clearly was at that address to get the mail and that's what he did."
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:53.680]   And then you delete the listing or you don't delete the listing, you delete your ownership
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.240]   over that listing and you leave it all alone with the phone number that was also part of
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:09:59.240]   it.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:01.000]   So he made a listing that went somewhere he liked his house.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   He had it like a local real place.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:09.520]   So then after you've kind of released it and let the listing be an orphan, you go back over
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:14.360]   with a new Google account and you claim it and you claim it and because then you have
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:18.920]   to re-verify it, you re-verify it using the phone number which you still control.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:23.080]   Once you've re-verified it with the phone number, you can move that listing all the way across
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:26.240]   the country if you want to, which is exactly what he did.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:29.880]   And if you look at the number at the time, the number was a 206, it was the Seattle phone
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:30.880]   number.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.880]   In session in DC.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:36.440]   So that's how you ended up with the Seattle phone number where it was snowed in being
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.600]   in the White House.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:41.520]   And so it was interesting because after it happened, I didn't know who did it.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:44.800]   I thought maybe it was that same thing and I remember being on vacation when the other
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:48.960]   stuff had broken up about the Secret Service and then he called out on me on Twitter.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.240]   He's like, "Yeah, I know the guy who did it."
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.480]   So I called up the quick interview with him from there.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:56.600]   But what's interesting to me is that we went back to Google PR and Google PR.
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:00.680]   I was like, "Oh yeah, this is like a minor thing and rarely happens and there's a few
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:03.080]   people and we patch things up," whatever.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:07.600]   And he's like, "Yeah, they knew about this whole before I did the Secret Service stuff.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.920]   Then they closed it for six weeks after it.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.280]   Then they reopened it again.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.280]   So it's still sitting out there."
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:19.200]   And I do think there's some validity to the fact that it speaks to Google not maybe doing
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.360]   the effort that they could do with local.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:26.400]   It's one of those, Google likes to do things at scale.
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.920]   They want everything to be automated and everything to be happened and all it just magically
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:31.440]   come together, whatever.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.280]   And local seemed to be one of those things where actually it might be useful to have a
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:38.800]   lot of people involved with it, both from working with the local businesses and getting
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.120]   them online to making sure the information's verified or whatever.
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.880]   And until they make that kind of a commitment, I think you're going to have these kinds of
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:47.360]   weird oddities come up.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:54.880]   Now, most people don't see them happening, I suppose, but still, it is strange that you
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:59.640]   could let that sort of thing go through, especially when you knew about it over a year before.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:06.280]   So I could release my Twit thing and I could then, and the hole's still there, right?
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:07.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.800]   The loop was still there.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:15.360]   So I could release this move Twit into the White House, rename it, the White House Podcast
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.360]   Studio.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:17.360]   Yeah.
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:21.120]   And they would phone me and I would verify it and it'd be done.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.120]   Yeah.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:25.320]   Who do you want to put Twit at?
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.840]   I think Twit should be in Langley at the CIA headquarters.
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:31.400]   Or maybe in McLean at the NSA headquarters.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.560]   Or that new facility they just built in Utah.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:39.920]   Now, the downside for you, of course, is once you do that, it's going to burn your listing
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.160]   and you can't afford to do it.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:47.120]   But what his real concern is not that people are doing it with these attention-grabbing
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:51.320]   things, but they're doing it with smaller listings for fake businesses and they're actually
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.640]   making real money off of it.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.160]   How would they make money off of it?
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:59.240]   Well, you could set up a business as if you were a locksmith in a location where you don't
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.480]   actually have a location.
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:06.200]   You could potentially pretend to be in other business and let it get burned after you pulled
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:09.960]   in some people who are calling saying, "I want this business to come out," right?
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:17.160]   Like, can you imagine you make a fake listing for a florist or whatever and then you put
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.720]   it next to some other florist and then you start getting phone calls.
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:21.120]   People think they're calling that actual florist.
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.120]   You're like, "Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.120]   I'll send that out to you.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.120]   What do you want?"
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.120]   They're hijacked.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:28.840]   They're customers that thought they were reaching the other place or your pizza joint
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:29.840]   or whatever.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:35.040]   There are things that could be done if you're really going at it and there are the people
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.200]   who will go through and do that sort of stuff.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.520]   That's the real concern.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:42.080]   It's for trolls could use it to troll, basically.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.080]   Sure.
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:47.080]   Well, and also people who are in a business where there's just one person and they're competing
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:51.160]   against a big company, they could make it seem like they are also a big company.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.360]   In fact, it's just somebody in a basement somewhere.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.000]   Microsoft support, right?
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   You put your thing out there.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.560]   But you could always try.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:58.560]   I don't know.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:04.600]   Maybe kind of sympathize a little bit with Google that the damage is kind of not as
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.720]   diminumous in most cases.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:07.120]   I can't think of a search.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:11.240]   We don't know that because we don't know.
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:14.360]   They tell us that these things are really, really rare.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:19.200]   There's other guys like they're not rare and I'm really concerned about it.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:26.880]   The truth may lie and there's somewhere in between, but it doesn't seem difficult to
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:33.240]   say to Google, hey, if someone tried to chase or address and it's moving it from five miles
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:38.040]   from where it was before, maybe you ought to just ought to send out another postcard.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.040]   How hard is it?
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.880]   Oh, routine.
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:46.920]   Did point on map get moved more than five miles outside where it was, trigger, remove
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:50.920]   verification, send, renew verification postcard.
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:51.920]   Right.
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:52.920]   Oh.
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.840]   When is it?
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:58.080]   I think back to the future day is this here, isn't it?
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.080]   Is it October?
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:03.400]   I'll come in pretty soon.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.400]   Quartz has a great article.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:09.160]   Back to the future got right about tech in 2015.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.080]   Flat screen TVs, yes.
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.080]   Video calling.
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.000]   Believe it or not, we're actually doing that.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.240]   Biometrics 3D.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.280]   We don't have self tying shoelaces.
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.880]   Well, we do, but they're just expensive.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.880]   Yeah.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:20.880]   And we have yet to have drones.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:29.520]   They got right, but we have yet to get the floating hoverboard programmable home.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:31.600]   So here's a Google path.
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.840]   This also from quartz a Google patent.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:40.440]   A patent does not mean they're making it folks, but they have patented reactive paint
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:48.280]   that could actually turn a wall painted with photo reactive paint into a screen.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.280]   This is.
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.920]   So we'd use a projector.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.640]   This is actually a wider trend that I see happening.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:01.000]   There's actually a child's product called the Lumo interactive projector and it basically
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.720]   projects things onto a floor or a wall and then like a game.
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:06.720]   Kids can interact with it.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.760]   It's a touch display on the floor of the wall.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.360]   That's what hollow lens is going to end up to.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.360]   Microsoft augmented reality.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.360]   Yes.
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.840]   Microsoft has a patent for a Luma room.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:21.560]   Remember that which is projects peripheral vision gameplay content on the walls and ceilings
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.800]   and floors when you're using Xbox.
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:30.080]   I think that this is in, of course, the vision videos from Microsoft and Samsung are loaded
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:34.640]   with this kind of thing using walls and windows and desks and floors and surfaces as the next
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:35.640]   interface.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.960]   I think this is going to be so great when this happens.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.560]   Yeah, you know, I want the whole wall to be like a computer screen.
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:43.400]   I just think that's the coolest idea.
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.400]   We already have the technology.
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.880]   We just don't have it at a cost that's ready for the mainstream.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:52.160]   Did you see this is, I'm going to skip this out here and show you this is from Filco
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.560]   Ford.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.160]   They made this in 1966.
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:17:01.800]   What life will be like in 1999 AD and it's actually the most depressing, dystopic version
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:02.800]   of life.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:03.800]   This poor kids school.
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:06.000]   Oh, there's your computer by the way.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   Menu Tuesday.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   It's multi-screen.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.800]   You're turning knobs into this poor kid.
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:10.800]   This is the kid's school.
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:17.240]   He's all alone in a room and he flunks his test and he has to now go over to the other
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.240]   company.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:21.640]   Apparently there's one massive computer in the middle of the house and the poor kid
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:28.800]   has to go over to the other computer, turn a knob and go sit down at the other computer
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.080]   and take the lecture again.
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:35.760]   A little do they know in reality he'd be like flipping over to PewDiePie on YouTube.
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:38.240]   But PewDiePie, they did not predict PewDiePie.
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:39.240]   I can tell you that.
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.240]   Here's Mom, of course.
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.560]   I think in the kitchen I think that'd be much better there.
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:45.960]   Mom likes to cook and flowers.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:48.960]   Of course, it's 66 so it's an incredibly sexist vision.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.840]   Actually, that's not correct.
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:54.640]   What was happening there was Mom's actually a work at home developer and she's been flipping
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.760]   on this menu app and she is interacting with it right there.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:03.360]   We can reinterpret this and make the future be the way the future should be.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:06.800]   The plates are coming down out of the things.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.040]   That's just...
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.560]   Apparently the future is very physical and knob oriented.
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.560]   Yeah.
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.560]   Look at that carpet.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.560]   Check carpeting.
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:17.560]   They haven't solved that one.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.760]   By the way, is Philco still around?
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:22.080]   I don't think they...
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.080]   It's dinnertime.
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.320]   Wow, that is depressing.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:29.400]   It is the most depressing view of the future I have ever...
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:33.160]   I think it's interesting that almost all of the future visions involve like the computer
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.480]   was a knob turning in her face.
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.480]   What are these knobs?
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.080]   Yeah, well, that's what they knew, right?
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.640]   Look at that on his...
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.560]   And now the man is going to balance the budget.
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.560]   It probably is.
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.560]   Look at all the knobs he has to turn.
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:51.520]   Right, again, to be clear, that is simply her assistant who is back at the office who
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.520]   is taking her...
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:57.040]   He's received her programming instructions that she has created because she is the program
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:02.040]   and he is merely the key entry person who will be putting this in there.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:03.040]   Look at the stylist.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:07.040]   That's why she works at home, by the way, because she has been so successful that she can just
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:11.480]   do the stuff where she wants and this guy has to just take care of these things for her.
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.480]   More knobs!
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:16.960]   The other thing is that the computers are specialized, so there's a shopping computer
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.960]   and then there's a...
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:19.960]   Right.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:20.960]   Right.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:24.800]   And so they didn't envision that you could do a million times more than this with a smartphone.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.320]   The person who did this really didn't have much of a grasp of the present, let alone the
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.320]   thing.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.320]   Future.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.320]   This is a patch bay and knobs.
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:34.800]   Maybe Philco was in the knob, isn't it?
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:35.800]   Right.
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:36.800]   That's what I'm gonna...
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.240]   There was a great knob collapse of 1968.
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.120]   It was tragic.
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:45.000]   You might recall you had to go into the stores and there used to be the big knob testing
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.960]   things like the back tube, ten machine.
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:51.560]   So if you didn't have the right knob, you could kind of put it in there and...
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:52.760]   But now we have 3D printing.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:53.760]   It's just a knob.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.760]   Oh, the...
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:55.760]   Oh, here we do.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:56.760]   He's working out.
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.760]   Good job.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:19:59.760]   There's the family chain.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:00.760]   She works apart.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:01.760]   She works apart.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:02.760]   She works apart.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:03.760]   She works apart.
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:04.760]   She works apart.
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:05.760]   She works apart.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:06.760]   She works apart.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:07.760]   She works apart.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:08.760]   She works apart.
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:09.760]   Oh my God.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:10.760]   What is going on?
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:11.760]   Oh my God.
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.760]   I don't know if this is good.
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:13.760]   This doesn't look good.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:14.760]   What is going on there?
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:15.760]   He's stunning.
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:16.760]   He's getting some tiny, getting some tan.
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:17.760]   Wow.
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.760]   This is on it.
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:25.760]   This is the grimest vision of the future I have ever ever ever had.
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:26.760]   Now he's refreshed.
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:27.760]   Seen from...
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.760]   It's from Filco Ford you could search for.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.760]   I mean, do you think that could be my desktop with just the screens?
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:33.760]   Right.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.760]   But not the...
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:35.760]   The rest of it is...
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:36.760]   They had big screens, yeah.
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:37.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:38.760]   Oh, what's his name?
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:40.760]   He looks familiar.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.760]   Well, they got my haircut right.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.760]   That's why they got it.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:45.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:46.760]   Oh, it's what's his name.
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:47.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:48.760]   He looks familiar.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:49.760]   Well, they got my haircut right.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:51.760]   That's why they got it right.
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:53.760]   Oh, this is freaking up a map to go to Pebble Beach.
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:54.760]   Nice.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:57.760]   That's what I imagine the computer scene in North Korea looks like.
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:58.760]   You know?
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:20:59.760]   You know?
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:00.760]   You're not looking up for what's his name?
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:01.760]   What's his name?
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:02.760]   Here's what we're looking for.
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:03.760]   Wink and Martindale.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:04.760]   Thank you very much.
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:05.760]   The chat room got that one.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.760]   Wink and Martindale, Lars in Michigan.
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.760]   There are two chat room I knew you would.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:13.760]   I'm going to have to get about two strokes aside because I haven't been playing all winter
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:14.760]   and I'm a little bit...
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:21.760]   This is necessarily the mystery science future computer 4000, which is due to the narration
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:22.760]   of it.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:23.760]   We should.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:28.480]   Meanwhile, back at the office, the home office, she's wondering why he still hasn't finished
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.760]   the things that she's demanded.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.760]   Oh, she's making a pot.
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:32.760]   It's a 3D printer.
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:33.760]   It's pretty pretty.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:34.760]   Exactly.
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:35.760]   Thank you.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:38.520]   Oh, and look at the lovely pots she's been making.
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:39.760]   She's a talented artist.
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:40.760]   That one on the left looks like that.
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:42.760]   He's wall be rendered into the computer.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:46.760]   Yeah, I want to know what kind of pots they were smoking when I made this video.
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:47.760]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:48.760]   Isn't it fun?
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:50.760]   I just want the music from Ghost to be playing now.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:51.760]   This is what parties in 1999.
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:52.760]   Oh, look.
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:53.760]   There's a party knobs.
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.760]   What are they going to do there?
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.680]   Oh, I remember this scene from Logan's run.
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:00.760]   Is this for just six cut peers?
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.760]   Oh, I didn't mean to put myself on the circuit.
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:06.760]   Oh, dear.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:10.760]   Bongos of the future.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:15.760]   I can't say so much.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:19.760]   You're not having the birds making this piece of junk.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:23.160]   You know, this is another aspect of human nature that futures always get wrong.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:26.660]   For example, when they invented the telephone, they thought people in the country would listen
[01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:28.760]   to opera over the telephone.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:34.160]   The thing is that people don't stop and pay attention to things if it's not live.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:38.080]   Only live music causes everybody to stop talking, face the music.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:41.760]   If it's recorded or just on a projector, people will just talk to it.
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:45.040]   The other thing that is clearly wrong that you can see here is that no one is using their
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.760]   phones to take pictures of this people.
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.760]   Or themselves watching it.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.760]   There's no hashtag being displayed.
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:54.760]   How do I even know what I was saying about this?
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:56.760]   Although that could be on Tuesday.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.760]   I don't understand.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:02.760]   That could be Jeff Needles in Havana, like a mirror catting this to back home.
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:03.760]   It's true.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:04.760]   All right.
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.760]   There you go.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:10.760]   This is the home of the future year 1999 AD.
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.760]   That's beautiful.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.760]   From Filco Ford.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:16.760]   Boy, he's hitting some high notes there.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.760]   In the future, men will sing like women.
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:24.760]   [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.760]   At this point, they ran out of futuristic things.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:28.760]   So they're like, just go along on him.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.760]   And now we bring on the Congo group.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.760]   Let them sing for 12 minutes and we're done.
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:34.760]   Yeah, that'll be done.
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.760]   The stamp thing had to go 15 minutes.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:37.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.760]   Unbelievable.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:40.760]   People still applaud in the future.
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:43.760]   Apparently, women in the future have, I dream of genie hairdos.
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.760]   And they applaud when something's on TV.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:50.760]   It's like, why did anybody think that would ever happen?
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:51.760]   It's two way.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:52.760]   Hey, it was two way.
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:53.760]   It was two way.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.760]   Well, at least they're racially integrated.
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:57.760]   I was impressed by that, actually.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:58.760]   It is very integrated there.
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:23:59.760]   Oh, it's gone now.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:02.760]   What's the 1920s with the future will look like?
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:03.760]   Oh, well, I don't know.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:07.760]   Let's go even farther back in time.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:12.760]   I love the future from the pre-18th century future where everybody has a personal dirt
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:17.760]   and you know, you know, this we're doing right now, what we were talking about.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:21.760]   We were watching and we're even trying to, we're working here and we're watching a stream
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:22.760]   of YouTube videos.
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:26.760]   And I want to have to, the other, and YouTube did the right thing, by the way, which is
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:31.760]   instead of showing me a grid of possible videos to watch featuring women in bikinis, they've
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.760]   actually segued into another video.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:36.760]   I don't know when they changed that, but that's something that does encourage that kind
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:40.760]   of just sit here and watch the future.
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:45.760]   So this is the future, aka 1930 or 1940 in this first time.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:50.760]   1940, derigible trades will have propellers.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:59.760]   By 1950, we saw that DC, the guys just flew the gyrocopter.
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:00.760]   So let's go.
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:01.760]   The channel tunnel exists.
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:03.760]   It's a channel tunnel or carpal tunnel.
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:04.760]   I thought it was entering the carpal tunnel.
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:07.760]   I pulled down the table and all the plates were already there.
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:08.760]   All the plates were already there.
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.760]   In the future, the tables are already set.
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:11.760]   What's that?
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:13.760]   The gum went off a little prematurely, I think.
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:14.760]   Why?
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:15.760]   That is terrifying.
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:16.760]   What is that?
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:17.760]   It's a lady robot.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:18.760]   That's just animation.
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:19.760]   This is frozen.
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:23.760]   By 1960, boy, they really nailed the '60s.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:28.760]   Gears, resistance, building, down.
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:30.760]   Oh, I wish this vision.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:31.760]   That's spotlights.
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:33.760]   That's what happened in San Francisco.
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:35.760]   They built a bunch of elevated freeways, which they've seen.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.760]   Traffic camp, right?
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:43.760]   And there'll be biplanes everywhere in the city.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:44.760]   Frying all over.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:48.760]   You can't fly, which is one set of wings.
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:49.760]   Come on.
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:50.760]   Come on.
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:51.760]   This is crazy.
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:52.760]   What year is this?
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:54.760]   This is definitely the far future.
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:58.760]   Madonna is being anticipated early on.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:01.760]   If the sleeves, what does it?
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:05.760]   Apparently in AD 2000, we should be having a hair-raising time.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.760]   They'll still talk with that phony Hollywood accent.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.760]   They're so far as to believe that skirts are the better.
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.760]   Oh, and the same thing in the film, go forward from '96.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.760]   They all have that kind of weird pseudo-British accent.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.760]   That's the body to climatic changes.
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:16.760]   Why did they...
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:17.760]   I don't know.
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:18.760]   Well, they got climatic changes.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.760]   They look at...
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:20.760]   They were talking about global warming in the '20s.
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:21.760]   It's awesome.
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:22.760]   They knew.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:23.760]   They're the scientific research of the right to...
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:26.760]   The future bride in the wedding dress of glass.
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:28.760]   The wedding dress of glass.
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.760]   The future bride in the wedding dress of glass.
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:31.760]   The wedding dress of glass.
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:32.760]   That's the aluminium.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.760]   Aluminium.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:34.760]   Well, they got that right.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.760]   Johnny Ives is like that.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:38.760]   Electric headlights in her hair.
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:41.760]   I would kill if her wife comes out now to get married to her.
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:43.760]   That would be great.
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:46.760]   Coins, keys, and candy for cuties.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.760]   What is he wearing on his hands?
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:54.760]   Is it he needed back at the Game of Thrones dressing room right now?
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:58.760]   He's a direct outcome of the social, economic,
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.760]   and typical conditions then existing.
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:04.760]   The future would be laid out to a master plan.
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:05.760]   The show is completely devolved.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:06.760]   I don't know.
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:07.760]   This has nothing to do with twigs.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:08.760]   I know.
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:09.760]   I think it's completely fun.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:10.760]   We're going to stop right now and move on.
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.760]   I think there's a whole 'nother show here.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.760]   Watching YouTube videos.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.760]   Google Glass 2.0.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:19.760]   This is a patent from...
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.760]   Oh my God.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:21.760]   It looks like...
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:22.760]   What?
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:23.760]   No, I just can't even look at it.
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.760]   Like, I was only thinking the other day.
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.760]   Am I ever going to turn them on again?
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:30.760]   It looks like you're looking into the glass.
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:34.760]   They move the prism to the left and then they put the camera on the right.
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:35.760]   That fits it all.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:39.760]   I think what would fix it would eliminate this.
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.760]   It's balancing out the dorkiness.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:42.760]   Sorry.
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:47.760]   I was too leaned over with dork this way.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:48.760]   Now...
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:50.760]   You got dork on both sides.
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:51.760]   He's now with fun.
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:52.760]   Oh Lord.
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:54.760]   What would fix it?
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.760]   To make the camera removable.
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:58.760]   The problem that everybody has is the camera.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:09.760]   And for people who want notifications that they can shrink that prism down to the point where it's almost indistinguishable and make the camera either optional or non-existent, it would be great.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.760]   You'd have notifications you'd be able to see things you'd get, you know.
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:15.760]   But until they, as long as it's...
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:21.760]   Well, the other thing is that the tech press was proven hypocritical about the camera.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:27.760]   Everybody said it was an invasion of privacy, but the second Meerkat hit, all those same journalists were out there filming everything in sight.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:30.760]   Just like doing exactly what they said Google Glass would enable Google Glass.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.760]   The Meerkat would be the perfect app for Google Glass to do.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:34.760]   Wouldn't it?
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:35.760]   Hey Danny, is this new on Google?
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:40.760]   You enter in a geometric equation like X times sine Y.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:41.760]   It's a perfect giant calculator now.
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.760]   And you do a search for it and it gives you the graph.
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:46.760]   Ahhh...
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:47.760]   I can't keep track now.
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:50.760]   It's from Wolfram Alpha I think.
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:52.760]   It probably had that for a little bit.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.760]   That's kind of cool.
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:54.760]   I think so.
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:55.760]   Yeah, I love that.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:56.760]   Alright, I just checked.
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:58.760]   I do all my math on Google now.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:28:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:02.760]   It's usually a little less complicated than that.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:04.760]   It's usually like 5 divided by 13.
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:07.760]   You don't use sine calculations much.
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:14.760]   You know, sometimes it's like to do a little infinite number testing, but you know, the most part, I just stick with basic arithmetic.
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:15.760]   It was wild.
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:16.760]   The Google...
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:18.760]   Oh, I got 5, 10 fingers.
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:19.760]   That's a search result.
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:20.760]   Yeah, that's incredible.
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:21.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:22.760]   That's pretty amazing.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:26.760]   Well, the other interesting search result is that if you lose your Android phone, you can search for your phone.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:27.760]   You can Google it.
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:28.760]   Oh yeah.
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:29.760]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:30.760]   So what do I do?
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:31.760]   What do I do?
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:32.760]   Okay, so I have...
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:33.760]   What do I do to Google my phone?
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:34.760]   I lost my phone.
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:35.760]   You type "found my phone" in a Google search.
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:36.760]   Find my phone.
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:37.760]   Does it work for me?
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:40.760]   And you have to sign in again to get your phone's location.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:41.760]   Alright, I'm gonna sign in again.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:45.760]   And then it'll screw up because if you have multiple apps or if you have Google apps, it doesn't like it.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:50.760]   Well, because you know...
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.760]   I'd love to know where my next six is.
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:57.760]   I really want to start using that for "fi" because you sold it years ago.
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:58.760]   I wonder where it is.
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.760]   Who has my next six now?
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:01.760]   No, actually it's at home.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:02.760]   I'm glad I kept it.
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:03.760]   And there it is.
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:04.760]   And there you go.
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.760]   There's my Nexus 7 right there.
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:08.760]   It's actually in my hand.
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:09.760]   It's right next to me.
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:10.760]   Now I have a phone.
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:12.760]   What's an XT1058?
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:14.760]   That's the Moto X.
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:15.760]   Oh yeah.
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:16.760]   So there's the OnePlus One.
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:18.760]   There's the Moto E.
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:20.760]   A couple of Samsung phones.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:21.760]   The Moto X.
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:26.760]   GTT3113.
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:29.760]   You should have renamed them when you had them.
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:31.760]   It's just so hard.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:32.760]   I know.
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.760]   It's almost like when you're dealing with your Kindle.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:37.760]   It's the sixth Android device.
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:41.760]   You know, I just installed something on my 47th Kindle.
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:45.760]   My 47th Kindle.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:47.760]   I don't know how that happened.
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:51.760]   Every time you install the Kindle app it counts as one, I guess.
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:56.760]   It's good to know I have 47 Kindle somewhere.
[01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:58.760]   I just want to run down.
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:05.760]   Make sure we get all of these before we wrap it up and get our tips and tricks and numbers of the week in here.
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:06.760]   What are their big stories?
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:10.760]   Oh, let's give Jeff Jarvis a chance to raise his blood pressure real quickly.
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:12.760]   The French government.
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:13.760]   Whoa.
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.760]   That's all you have to say.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.760]   French, I had to wake up Jeff.
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:23.760]   French Senate back spit to force Google to disclose how its search algorithm works.
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.760]   Next they'll be asking Coke what its secret formula is.
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:27.760]   What is that?
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:35.760]   And then they admit that it's not legal within you EU law, so it's ridiculous, so it's just another show trial.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:39.760]   So they can't even, even if they voted to do that, they can't do it.
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.760]   No, it's ridiculous.
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:45.760]   This is the French Senate, they haven't approved the law, but this is a bill approved by the French Senate.
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:59.760]   And the other part of it that's really wonderful is that they would require Google to offer direct searches or links from Google.com, the home page, which Google doesn't put anything on there mostly.
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:00.760]   Right.
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:03.760]   To three competing search engines.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:06.760]   And one of those competing search engines has to be a French search engine.
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:07.760]   Are there any?
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:09.760]   There's there are there's voila.
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:15.760]   But then the French sold their search technology that the government held back like Quario over to.
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:17.760]   I mean, it's really going back in time.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:18.760]   But yeah, oh, yeah, voila.
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:19.760]   Does voila exist?
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:20.760]   It does.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:20.760]   It does.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:22.760]   It's the number one search engine in France.
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:23.760]   Of course it is.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.760]   And yes.
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.760]   Vo la inte.
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:28.760]   Just voila.
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:29.760]   Of voila.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:30.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:35.760]   I mean, when you say it's the number one French engine in France, you're joking, right?
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:36.760]   No, no.
[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:42.760]   It's the it's the highest traffic search engine that is owned by a French company.
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:43.760]   Oh, right.
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:44.760]   That's right.
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:45.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:46.760]   It's not.
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.760]   It's not between that and being the number one search engine.
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:51.760]   Bigger than any search engine that people have heard of.
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:52.760]   Voila mesotis.
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:55.760]   And it's so this is the this is the absurd.
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:57.760]   This would be required to be on Google.com.
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:01.760]   It's just it's look how you spell oops in French.
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:02.760]   Oh, UPS.
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:03.760]   Oops.
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.760]   So see you.
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:06.760]   It's under great.
[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:08.760]   That's what Google used to do, right?
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:12.760]   And actually you don't really this is the stupidity of say lawmakers.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:17.560]   Well, we'll put it on the Google homepage because not as many people who search on Google actually
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:18.760]   go to Google at the homepage.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:22.760]   They actually just get to it because they did their search from Chrome or everything.
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:27.200]   So what they really want is that these would be listed, say, at the bottom of Google search
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:30.400]   results, which people with long memories will remember.
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:33.160]   That's what Google used to do when they were starting out and they were a little tiny search
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:34.160]   engine.
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:38.680]   They used to say also try your search on all Stavista or excite or all these other things.
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:39.680]   I'm in an oops loop.
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:41.680]   And you know what?
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:42.680]   You can either use Google.
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:45.080]   I'd be like, yeah, you want us to put it there?
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:46.080]   Fine.
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:48.480]   We'll put it there because when we were a tiny little search engine, no one wanted to use
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:49.480]   it.
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:52.800]   We linked out the bigger competitors and that didn't seem to hurt us becoming the big thing
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.800]   you worry about.
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:54.800]   So yeah, whatever.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:59.880]   Well, you know, the irony, of course, is that is that Leo found voila by googling it,
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:01.240]   which really wasn't that hard.
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:02.240]   Let's be honest.
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:07.960]   voila, that far this does not seem to be a new story, but maybe I'm missing something
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:11.280]   according to the unofficial Google operating system blog.
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:15.920]   You can now export your Google web history, your saved search history.
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:18.120]   Couldn't you do that all along with takeout?
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.520]   I thought so, but apparently not.
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:20.800]   It wasn't one of those things.
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:21.800]   Okay.
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:26.400]   So, so it's an expanse of Google takeout is awesome.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:30.880]   Every and it seems to me that it's not such a big deal that you can get this because for
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.880]   a long time, if you go to your Google dashboard, Google.com/dashboard, you've seen all the
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:41.480]   things Google takes, you know, keeps track of and you can download it all.
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:42.480]   Although it's one big XML file.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.560]   I don't know what the hell you do with it.
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:51.640]   Well, it deals with probably is probably a proactive thing where Google can anticipate
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:54.840]   someone saying, oh, why can't get my Google search history?
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:55.840]   I'm being anti-competitive.
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:56.840]   Right.
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:58.320]   And it really is sort of an oversight.
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.880]   So yeah, people want to take it out.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:01.720]   Now you get that too.
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:04.440]   My advice for what you should do with it is delete it.
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:07.520]   Get rid of the evidence for crying out loud.
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:12.920]   Let me see if I do Google.com/dashboard.
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:18.840]   If I, so these are all the things that Google knows about you including location history
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:19.840]   and stuff.
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.840]   So is it search history?
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:22.840]   Is that what I'm?
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:25.880]   It's easier just to search for Google Web history on Google.
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:28.120]   It's you could never find where the dang thing is.
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:29.120]   There you go.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.800]   You can, by the way, disable this.
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:35.320]   You can remove search history items.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:39.560]   And if you wish, you can use Google takeout and download it all.
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:42.720]   I did this, by the way, like two days ago.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:46.080]   And I'm still waiting for it to actually generate this archive I'm supposed to get.
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.080]   So yeah.
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:48.920]   Well, that's another problem.
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:52.240]   I keep asking Twitter for an archive of my tweets.
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:53.680]   And they've never done it.
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:54.680]   Never.
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:55.680]   Not once.
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:56.680]   So.
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:01.000]   Um, do do do do do do do do do do.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.360]   Mobile get and we did.
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.040]   Is there an update to Chrome OS?
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:06.840]   Somebody was saying that Chrome OS was updated.
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:08.000]   I guess it's updated all the time.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.800]   What's the news there?
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.320]   Certification program for cardboard clones.
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:18.640]   That's a story from the future.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:25.680]   In the year 2015, cardboard clones will be certified by a company called Google.
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:26.680]   Oh my God.
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.840]   You're doing that voice is great.
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:32.400]   If you'd written that story before then what the hell?
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:37.840]   A company named Google has announced a certification program for cardboard clones.
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:38.840]   Yeah.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:45.960]   Here we see the young Maureen O'Hara trying her cardboard clone.
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:46.960]   What are the cardboard clones?
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:48.280]   A lot of companies make these, right?
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:51.000]   Dodo case made one almost right away.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.640]   LG is making one.
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:59.280]   I just say, by the way, I went out to F8 and I was using the, um, cause Oculus is coming,
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:00.280]   right?
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:01.280]   Right.
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:04.680]   So they had the little Oculus thing and they had where you could try on the Galaxy VR,
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:05.680]   yeah, whatever it is.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:10.400]   And you pop in a note for and yeah, but you had to have like a note for and it was like,
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:14.400]   it only worked with like the note for and then you had to pay off this expensive thing
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:17.160]   to put it on the note for then the note for got too hot.
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.960]   It was essentially cardboard.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:19.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:20.960]   It was cool.
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:22.920]   It was an expensive thing to put on an expensive phone.
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:29.160]   So you know, here's a hat mount for your cardboard.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:31.120]   That is awesome.
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:32.120]   That's the future.
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:33.600]   That is the future and the future.
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:37.240]   Your hat will have a virtual reality helmet built in.
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:38.240]   Wow.
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.240]   Feeling lost.
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:40.240]   Put on your baseball hat.
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:42.400]   You will see the world in a whole other way.
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:44.800]   A map will leap to view.
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.280]   Wow.
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:47.280]   So this is it.
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:49.840]   This is the new logo works with Google cardboard.
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.840]   That is the most down market.
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:54.160]   Well, coming at them now.
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:56.360]   Oh, it is going back.
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:57.360]   Okay.
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:59.360]   That's so down market.
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.000]   Yes.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.400]   Works with Google cardboard.
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:06.960]   Next we'll be working with Google Paste board soon.
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:08.660]   Cork board.
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:10.840]   Don't root your galaxy S6 edge.
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:12.000]   Danny Sullivan.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.320]   We knew this, but Max will stop working as well as Samsung wallet.
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.160]   One plus one no longer needs an invite.
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:19.640]   It's got an invite free.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:21.840]   First in the nick of time for nobody to care.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:22.840]   Exactly.
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:25.080]   Nice timing one plus one.
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:28.120]   Stronger so long for a long time you get a good and credit.
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:29.120]   Now nobody wants it.
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:33.600]   And by the way, if you're going to tell me that I can finally get your phone, but the
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.120]   next one is going to be.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:36.120]   Any minute.
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:37.840]   Then I don't want your phone.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.000]   I want the next phone.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.800]   So screw you double.
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:43.880]   They've really got to work on their marketing message.
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:46.120]   They have never done anything well.
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:47.120]   It's the odd.
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:48.120]   It's the odd.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.120]   The odd board.
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:51.520]   They are the odd board themselves.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.000]   This is an interesting story and wired.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.400]   I don't know how much this is.
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:57.040]   Kyle Wiens is writing this.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:59.600]   Who is by the way, if it's the same Kyle Wiens.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:00.600]   It is.
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:01.600]   I think it is.
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:03.880]   The guy in charge of I fix it, founder of I fix it.
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:11.480]   He has pointed out that John Deere and General Motors are planning to change the agreement
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:13.520]   they have with owners.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:21.040]   They have submitted comments to the copyright office saying that because computer code is
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:26.080]   so heavily written throughout your entire tractor that you, they wish to be able to
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:31.320]   say that you when you buy a John Deere tractor do not buy the tractor but an implied license
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:35.320]   for the life of the vehicle to operate the vehicle.
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:39.320]   He discovered this when a friend of his, he was checking out their incredibly, these
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.480]   are incredibly high tech tractors.
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:43.400]   They drive themselves practically.
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:46.000]   They are tied into GPS.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.720]   His friend, because he is a very technical person, asked him to help him tinker with it
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:51.720]   and he discovered that they don't let you.
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:52.720]   Because the contact.
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:54.080]   And this is not unusual.
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:56.160]   The diagnostic computers are sealed up.
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:57.160]   Exactly.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:59.560]   You have to buy very expensive equipment.
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:05.560]   But it turns out that there are laws for cars around repairability and stuff like that
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:07.120]   that don't apply to tractors.
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:12.000]   What happens is they subsidize, this is kind of an Amazon style business model, they sell
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.760]   the tractors at essentially below cost knowing that they're going to make a bundle on the
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:21.320]   servicing because they don't let the farmers do the servicing themselves.
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:23.320]   And so it's a racket essentially.
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:24.320]   Wow.
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:28.760]   It's a really interesting feature that he wrote.
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:31.600]   This is just an example of the DMCA gone wild.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:33.600]   Crazy.
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:34.600]   Good article.
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:40.040]   You got to read it to a kind of Wiens writing in Wired magazine, Sunline and Wired.com.
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:43.800]   I mean, that's crazy.
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:49.080]   That would be like saying you bought Star Wars on digital and you don't own it even though
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.920]   you thought you were buying it on digital.
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:51.920]   Oops, wait.
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:52.920]   You don't actually own it.
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:53.920]   Sorry.
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:41:00.120]   Well, maybe like buying a book on cameras on Kindle thinking I own the book, but you're
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.360]   telling me I only have a license for the book?
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:03.360]   Yeah, no.
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:04.360]   I only have a license for the book.
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:11.200]   Especially frustrating is that these tractors cost two, three, four hundred thousand dollars.
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.200]   They are just amazing.
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:15.240]   But they're still selling them for a lesson cost.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:20.320]   Well, the point is that they're able to reduce the cost of the tractor itself because
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:25.360]   it's like if you buy a car, they're making more on the financing plan.
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.360]   It's almost a six plan.
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:30.040]   You bought an inkjet printer and you had to use the ink from the inkjet printer from
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:31.040]   the company.
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:32.040]   Yeah, it'd be almost like that.
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:33.040]   Wouldn't that be awful?
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:34.040]   It'd be terrible.
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.760]   Like if you bought a coffee maker and you could only use pods for the coffee company
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:38.760]   that made the coffee.
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:41.120]   But look at how cheap printers are and how expensive ink is.
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:42.840]   It's the same model.
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:44.200]   But he's leading this whole cause.
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:45.200]   You can do something.
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:49.320]   If you want to get involved, go check out this article and he'll lead you to a site where
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:55.000]   there's petitions and so on because he considers himself a right to repair at lactobale.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000]   Yeah, I love Kyle.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.320]   And he's fighting God's fight there on that one.
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:02.360]   That's good for you, Kyle Wiens.
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:08.080]   Lead the article and then write your member or your Chirus critter, I guess.
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:10.680]   So what's going on with the Android Wear?
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:14.080]   Because as Apple Watch comes out, day after tomorrow, the first Apple watches will start
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:15.320]   arriving at people's homes.
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:19.480]   And of course, one of the things Apple Watch has is Wi-Fi, which is cool because it means
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:26.480]   you can leave your phone anywhere in the Wi-Fi network and the watch will continue to work.
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:28.880]   According to Mike Elgin on Tech News.
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:29.880]   It's great source.
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:35.480]   You're talking about this, the next version of Android Wear will support not only Wi-Fi
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:36.880]   but the internet.
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:45.040]   Well, the thing that's cool is that if your phone is at home and on your home Wi-Fi network,
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:50.800]   you can be at work in the future because this isn't backward compatible with older Android
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:51.800]   Wear watches.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:52.800]   You can't use it with existing.
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:54.080]   This would be for upcoming Android Wear watches.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:59.440]   But you can be on your work Wi-Fi network and your watch will talk to your phone.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.080]   It will go to the users of the public internet to communicate with your phone not just your
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.080]   Wi-Fi network.
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:06.080]   Exactly.
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:07.080]   And that's different from the Apple Watch, which requires...
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.080]   You can do that with this same network.
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:09.080]   You have to be on the same network.
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:10.080]   Exactly.
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:11.160]   So that is a really cool improvement.
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:15.720]   They also added a new gesture, sort of wrist flicking gesture to move from one car to another
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:16.720]   and a couple of other options.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:18.200]   And you can now draw?
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.200]   Yep.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:20.680]   They have handwriting a recognition for emojis.
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:25.640]   But the big thing is the Wi-Fi because this is something, you know, you go to the gym and
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:27.120]   you don't want to be carrying your phone around.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:30.560]   You can leave it in the locker and still use it as if it was on your personal.
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:31.560]   I love that.
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:32.560]   Yeah.
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:33.560]   So...
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:36.640]   Now, we had heard originally that maybe Wi-Fi would...
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:40.440]   The Wi-Fi was a capability of the existing Android Wear watches, because that's not the
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:41.440]   case.
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:44.560]   I think it is on one or two of them, but most of them do not have that.
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:45.560]   Okay.
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:46.560]   Actually, a lot of them do.
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:49.480]   Moto 360, it was guessed that it wouldn't.
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.480]   And it in fact does.
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:53.040]   The LG G watch does not, but the G watch are...
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:54.040]   The new one does.
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:59.760]   So if I have a Moto 360, I could get a software update that would enable this Wi-Fi.
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:00.760]   You have 360.
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:03.040]   You will get a software update that will enable Wi-Fi.
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:05.960]   Is that five more or less than that about Moto 360?
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:08.480]   5.2, do we know where this is?
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:09.480]   I don't know.
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:13.400]   I mean, that's the next update, which is supposed to come sometime in the next couple of weeks.
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:14.400]   What?
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:15.400]   Crazy.
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:17.400]   They're fighting it out over my wrist.
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:20.280]   You're going to have one watch at least on a trip.
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:22.080]   I'm going to have two phones, two watches.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:23.080]   Yep.
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:24.080]   You have two arms.
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:25.000]   No, you won't need two phones.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000]   You're phone at home.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000]   That's the thing about that.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.000]   You don't need any phone watches.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.000]   That's the thing about that.
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000]   Alright.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000]   It's good.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.040]   As always, competition is very good for end users.
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:36.240]   That's really great news.
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:37.240]   Alright.
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:38.240]   Let's take a break.
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:41.640]   When we come back, your tip, your tool, your number, we will wrap this up with the back
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:42.640]   of the book.
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:44.240]   Mike Elgin is here, our news director.
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:47.800]   He is of course the host of TNT Tech News tonight, every Monday through Friday.
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:53.440]   10am or Pacific 1pm Eastern, 1700 UTC.
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:54.760]   Gotta watch that.
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:45:01.000]   Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com, that mobile, unready site.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.760]   He's also the author of Public Parts, What Will Google Do?
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:06.720]   Gutenberg the Geek and his latest geek-sparing gifts.
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:09.960]   Always great to have Jeff, our professor.
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:11.480]   Professor Jarvis.
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:15.600]   And Danny Sullivan from Search Engine Land, who's probably been watching this search engine
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:17.600]   scene for longer than anybody else.
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:21.720]   Search Engine Land has always been the place to go to get the latest on what's going on
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:22.720]   with Google.
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:25.560]   Is it marketing land or marketing engine land?
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:26.560]   Marketing land.
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:27.560]   There's no engine in marketing.
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:28.560]   You can merge them all together.
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:33.560]   I said something like, my friend was like, "Why don't you work for a search engine marketing
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.560]   land?"
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:39.840]   I'm also obviously an avid snowboarder.
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:42.400]   Yes, that's my Bing snowboard actually.
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:44.040]   Oh my God, look at that.
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:45.040]   A Bing snowboard.
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:47.440]   Sometimes you're like, "You've got all that Google stuff.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:48.440]   You're so Google."
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:50.080]   I'm like, "No, you can't see it says Bing."
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:52.080]   It's so big you can't see the Bing.
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:53.080]   Yeah.
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:54.080]   He uses that 20% of the time.
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:55.880]   He's got a board that says Bing.
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:59.200]   Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:00.200]   You know, it's so funny.
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:03.840]   I watch House of Cards at the end.
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:04.840]   Images courtesy Shutterstock.
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:05.840]   Really?
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:06.840]   Movies, more and more.
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:07.840]   I'm seeing images courtesy.
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:09.320]   So what I realized, what are they doing?
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:13.600]   Shutterstock offers, of course, it's the place to get more than 52 million high quality
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:18.360]   stock photos, illustrations, vectors, but they also have millions of video clips.
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:21.680]   And I realized if you're doing House of Cards and you need an aerial shot of Washington,
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:23.680]   D.C., you're not going to hire a helicopter.
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:25.680]   You're going to go to Shutterstock.com.
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:28.560]   4K and HD video, very affordable.
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:32.760]   You pay once, use it, royalty free forever.
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:37.320]   Some of the best looking photos and videos, each is reviewed individually for content
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.480]   and quality.
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:42.800]   They get more than 385,000 new images every week.
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:44.120]   So there's always stuff new.
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:45.120]   Look at that.
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:46.600]   I think that's right from the--
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:47.600]   That's House of Cards.
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:49.640]   House of Cards right there.
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:55.400]   And the beauty part of this is you can get a free account right now if you go to Shutterstock.com.
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:47:02.640]   Use their light box to store images and photos and drawings and videos so that you're going
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:03.640]   to access them anytime.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:05.920]   Use them as kind of like an idea book.
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:06.920]   Share them with other team members.
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:10.240]   They've got a great app for both Android and iPad now.
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:11.880]   Webby award winning app.
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:13.280]   That's just gorgeous.
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:17.680]   But most importantly, when you have this many images, this many different clips more all
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:20.600]   the time, the best search ever.
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:25.280]   Google quality search better than Google quality because you can search for a topic
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:27.520]   but then drill down by palette.
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:31.240]   It's also better than Google search, Google image search because when you arrive at the
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:32.240]   photo, you can use it.
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:33.240]   You can use it.
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:34.240]   Subject.
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:36.440]   You can say, "I want two people in this one."
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:38.840]   You can say, "I don't want any people in this one."
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:40.480]   You can say, "One man, one woman."
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:43.440]   You can specify emotions.
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:44.440]   It is incredible.
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:45.600]   I want you to play with it.
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:49.200]   Just go set up your free Shutterstock account, Shutterstock.com.
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:50.920]   No credit card necessary.
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:56.560]   If you do decide to buy images, we've got a deal for you on image subscription packages.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:59.400]   Use the offer code Twig415.
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:04.040]   Twig415 and you'll get 20% off your new image subscription package.
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.320]   That's a great deal.
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:07.680]   The image subscription packages are for publications and others.
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:08.720]   You use a lot of images.
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:14.760]   We have the basic one which is I think 25 images a day and we use it all the time.
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:15.760]   Shutterstock.com.
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:21.160]   20% off image subscription packages on new accounts with the code Twig415.
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:25.680]   We thank you so much Shutterstock for your support and for providing great images for
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:27.800]   our use all the time.
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:31.480]   If you have a blog and you've got to have an image on every post, I think.
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:33.400]   Great for Google Plussers too, right?
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:36.320]   Here's something that a lot of people don't know about Shutterstock.
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:39.880]   If you have a blog where you write about technology, the brands are in there too.
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.720]   You can search for Facebook or Twitter or whatever.
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:47.520]   You get just hundreds of images that are relating to actual brands.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:51.280]   This isn't the iconography taken from the company.
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:56.080]   These are conceptual illustrations built by illustrators that you can use.
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:00.840]   I wanted to share a tool this week called Fostroid that I found.
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.080]   I think it was on Hacker News I found.
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:06.640]   It looks just like the Play Store, but all of these are open source Android apps.
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:10.480]   Many of them are like barcode scanner, EZON and K9 mail and VLC.
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.920]   These are on the Play Store.
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:18.480]   If you are interested in using open source, free and open source software, if you're interested
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:23.080]   in what kinds of free and open source software there is out there, this is a really great
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:26.560]   compendium of programs.
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:29.640]   Of course, all you have to do is check the side load box in your settings and you can
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:36.160]   download these directly from Fostroid.com.
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:41.000]   In particular, when it comes to security, I like to use open source because then you
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.520]   can verify that there's no NSA backdoor, no CIA backdoor and so forth.
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:51.080]   If you're looking for encryption tools or that kind of thing, this is a great place
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:52.080]   to go.
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:53.080]   Fostroid.
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:57.440]   The other thing I wanted to show which just came out today, Microsoft is true to its
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:03.080]   promise that they're going to support users wherever they are has released Microsoft Outlook
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:05.680]   for Android.
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:07.800]   This is the complete program that they bought.
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:09.640]   They have released this already on iOS.
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:11.600]   It's now out for Android.
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:13.880]   It's actually really sweet.
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:16.000]   I don't mean that sweet.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000]   It's really cute.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.240]   It's actually a very nice program.
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:24.840]   Supports OneDrive, OneBox, Box, I drop Box, iCloud, iMap.
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:26.720]   You could of course set up your Gmail account.
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:29.240]   Let me get back to there.
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:30.720]   Set up your Gmail account.
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:32.720]   But you can also use exchange.outlook.com.
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:34.280]   You can even use Yahoo mail.
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:36.360]   Is there anybody still using Yahoo mail?
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:37.480]   I won't log in right now.
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:40.640]   But if you go and look at it in the Play Store, it's free.
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:44.360]   You'll see it's that a company interface where you can swipe.
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:46.080]   If you like inbox, you might like it a lot.
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:49.080]   It also has a built-in calendar.
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:53.240]   If you want to go a little bit past what the Google Apps will do on Android, it might
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:51:00.240]   be worth checking out.
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:18.520]   I apologize for not breaking in war with my lag here.
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:22.680]   But I got one number which is Ruth Porat, the new CFO of Google.
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:25.560]   It has a $70 million pay package.
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:29.520]   Oh, that's up there with Angela Arendtz.
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:32.360]   Where did they get Porat?
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:35.000]   Oh, shoot.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.040]   She came from Morgan Stanley.
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:38.040]   CFO.
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:39.040]   Wow.
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:40.400]   That's a lot of money.
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:43.160]   Don't tell Lisa that CFO can get that kind of money, will you?
[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:46.560]   That's 10 times more than CEO Tim Cookbanks, I think.
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:47.560]   Is it really?
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:48.560]   Yeah.
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:52.040]   He's ranked as the highest bang for the buck in the industry.
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:53.040]   They get a good deal.
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:55.480]   I think it's a good deal with him, because believe it or not.
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:56.480]   Yep.
[01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:58.320]   And Angela Arendtz, their director of retail, costs more?
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.200]   Like 75 million or something like that.
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:02.200]   She's in there with Porat numbers.
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:03.200]   Those are Porat numbers.
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:04.960]   Not Borat.
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:05.960]   That's another person.
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:08.480]   The new CFO at Google.
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:10.760]   Mike, you have a thing or a tip or a tool?
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:11.760]   I do.
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:13.280]   Speaking of Facebook, we're speaking of Facebook.
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:14.280]   I don't think we are.
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:15.280]   We are now.
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:16.280]   We're now.
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:17.280]   But we will.
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:18.280]   We're called Hello.
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:20.440]   Speaking of Hello and Loughnell Rich.
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:23.080]   Hello, is it me you're looking for?
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:25.280]   This is built by the messenger team.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:27.600]   And basically it's caller ID.
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:29.920]   Even if you don't know the number of the person who's calling you.
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:34.360]   But if they have ever interacted with you on Facebook, Facebook knows who they are and
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:35.360]   will pop up and from Asia.
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:38.360]   And it's glad to tell you everything they know.
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:39.360]   Exactly.
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:40.360]   Oh, God.
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:44.040]   You can also search for people and businesses, local businesses and call with a single tap.
[01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:49.040]   This is currently in beta.
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:50.120]   It's available for Android only.
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:52.040]   It sounds like it might be a nice, as long as it's not too obtrusive.
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:56.040]   It might be a nice addition to the existing caller ID.
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:53:00.640]   Because of course, if you're a heavy Facebook user and Leo, I know you love the Facebook.
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:03.200]   I love it a Facebook.
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:06.560]   This is a good way for you to see who's calling you.
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:10.640]   You can block people that you don't want calling you and so on.
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:15.800]   So it sounds like they may be onto something they're trying to sort of, they've had several
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:21.880]   abortive attempts to be a phone interface with Facebook home with a Facebook phone and
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:22.880]   all that stuff.
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:27.960]   But this is a way where they're offering a tool that just does something kind of minimalist
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:33.200]   and leverages your so-called social graph from Facebook for an interesting caller ID
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:34.200]   function.
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:39.640]   I like the fact that it covers people who are not in your contacts database who you may
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:42.560]   not know their number but it still functions as if you do.
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:44.560]   So Facebook, hello.
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:45.560]   Hello.
[01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:46.560]   Today.
[01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:47.560]   Hello.
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:48.560]   I'm going to download it.
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:50.720]   It's only what add I presume caller ID for people you follow.
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:52.760]   No, it's anybody who is in their database.
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:53.760]   In their database.
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:54.800]   Interacted with you on Facebook.
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:59.320]   So if they've commented on one of your posts, they're added to the list somehow.
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:03.160]   At least that's how they've described it.
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:05.800]   And you can call with one tap, as I said.
[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:11.080]   And so it's, you know, they're sort of trying to get people to use.
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:15.840]   I think eventually they want, of course, everybody to use Facebook as their contacts
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:16.840]   database.
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:17.840]   Right.
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:18.840]   And so this is a way to start.
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:19.840]   Pause you later.
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:25.120]   I mean, it's, you know, people tend to keep their information up to date in Facebook.
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:26.120]   Yeah.
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:29.040]   People, I think, are reluctant to add their phone numbers to Facebook sometimes.
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:30.040]   Right.
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:32.440]   But if you're using Tinder.
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:33.440]   Sure.
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:34.440]   You know.
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:36.080]   Not that I am.
[01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.800]   But if you were, yeah.
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:41.640]   Danny Sullivan, you got any cool objects of interest?
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:44.200]   I've got a number for you if you want.
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:45.200]   A number 404.
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:46.200]   Go ahead.
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:47.200]   Yeah, not 404.
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:52.640]   Today, the Internet Advertising Bureau came out with their year in stats on how much spend
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:58.120]   has been happening in different kinds of online digital ads.
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:02.640]   And search was again at the top with 50% of all money that is spent that they track
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:03.760]   in the United States.
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:07.320]   So, you know, it's, it's anything but dead.
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:11.280]   Although the growth is not as strong as when you look at what's been going on with social
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:12.840]   because social is a smaller chunk.
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:15.560]   So there's a lot more spending starting to go into it.
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:19.040]   Or if you just take out mobile from all of this stuff as well.
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.160]   So that's sort of my number kind of simple.
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:25.840]   But after search, by the way, I'm looking here at the stories on search in Jelan.
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:31.840]   Search makes up all of 50, 50% of online ads been display ads make up 40% of it.
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:36.480]   You can then break down and look at desktop search is actually 38% of that share desktop
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:38.360]   display is 27%.
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:44.440]   One thing that surprised me was video spending is only 7% of online ad spend.
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:45.440]   Wow.
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:46.440]   You got to get that up.
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:50.200]   It's, you know, it might be a bit higher because there might be some mobile ad spend that's
[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:52.560]   in there because they don't break out the mobile part of it.
