[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Google made so much money on Friday.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.200]   It gained two Ubers, Kevin Tofel, and we'll explain and Ron Amadio will give his review of the new Android car.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.400]   It's all coming up next on This Week in Google Stay Here.

[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.200]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show where we cover the latest news from the Googleverse, but also social media in general.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.200]   Journalism and a whole lot more. Jeff Jarvis is not here. He has the week off. I think he's probably traveling, hither and thither.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   But of course we have excellent fill-ins for him. Let's start with Kevin Toffle. He's been on the show before you know him many years at Gigahome now at ZD Network.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   He's a contributing writer. It's great to see you, Kevin.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.200]   It's good to be here as always.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.200]   And also regularly on Tech News Tonight. I almost forgot.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   And to my left, Ron Amadio from ours. Technica, great to have you. Ron, he covers Android. Right? It's mostly Android, right?
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   Yeah, Android, Google, whatever.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   You do have a lot of skills.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   Whatever you like.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   Nice.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   I have to say Ron is the writer that all the other Android writers read.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   I agree.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.200]   If Amadio said, no, I'm completely with you, Kevin.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   Thank you.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   If Amadio says it, it's gots to be true.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.200]   It's gospel.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   Yeah, it's gospel.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   So speaking of Android, I got my phi.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   Got my phi on.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   Jeff Jarvis and I had both been bitching that we'd asked for invites for months.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   And that cuts happened to be on a couple of weeks ago before I went to Europe.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   I don't know if...
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   You were able to publicly corner him and demand it.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   That's what it takes.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   Okay, good to know.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   No, he says I have nothing to do with phi.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   As you know, Matt's kind of on leave anyway.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.200]   But he said, let me call somebody.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   Nice.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.200]   And I'm assuming that that's what happened because both Jeff and I got invites about a week ago.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200]   We both already have Nexus 6.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   In fact, I think the Nexus 6 was Jeff's daily driver.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   I had moved on to some more modern Android phones.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   Although coming back to the Nexus 6, I realized what an advantage you have if it's pure Android.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   Gosh, you know, I love the Galaxy S6 camera.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.200]   But that thing has all sorts of problems because of the interface, the skin.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   Same thing with the LG G4.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   This is just a rock solid.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   It's giant.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   This is a rock solid phone.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.200]   So I'm kind of glad to go back.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   And I decided to make this a pure Google experience.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   Not even use a different launcher.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   I'm using the Google Now launcher and the Google keyboard and all that stuff.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   Is it the same phone as the 6?
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   It is the 6.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   I didn't buy a new phone.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   This is the 6 I had.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   Yeah, you can go to the Nexus system image page and they have a download specifically for
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.200]   the Project 5.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.200]   Oh, they do?
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.200]   Yeah, where you can just kind of flash your phone to whatever the Project 5 software.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   Oh, I didn't know.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   Okay.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   So again, Ron, I'm audio to the rescue.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   But no, they should give you OTA's and stuff.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   But I didn't need that.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   I'm just using the 511 that was on this Nexus 6 forever.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.200]   And I put in the 5 SIM.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.200]   So you get a kit.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   Now you do have the choice of buying, not subsidized, but amortized Nexus 6.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.200]   They spread the payments out.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   But I opted just to get the SIM.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.200]   So they sent me the SIM.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   Came in a few days.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.200]   Put the SIM in here.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   And the phone almost immediately went from being T-Mobile, which is what I was using.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.800]   You see, it says, "Fi network," which isn't much of a surprise.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.200]   Since it is, in fact, T-Mobile and Sprint, that it chooses between.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.480]   There must be a way of knowing whether it's using T-Mobile or Sprint.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.080]   But I'm not sure.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.080]   Maybe that's in the APN settings.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.080]   Yeah, the APN settings.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.080]   All I could think of.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.080]   Let's check.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.520]   What are those when you rapidly switch between two different carriers?
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.520]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.720]   I think it's one of the reasons you can only do this in the Nexus 6.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.600]   Clearly, there's something going on.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   Here's cellular networks.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.120]   They put special hardware in this for projects.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.120]   Which is why I see only phone.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.680]   Which means that they knew about "Fi."
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.680]   Last year?
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.680]   Last year.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.640]   Yeah, there doesn't seem to be any way of knowing you can turn on or off Wi-Fi calling.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.400]   But that's kind of normal.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.200]   And under cellular networks, there's only one setting, turn on or off data roaming.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.840]   So I don't know where the APN settings would be.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.680]   Is it go back one, I think?
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.680]   Let's see.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.680]   It's more.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   I was just looking at more.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.680]   Did you wear any more?
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.680]   Where did it go?
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.680]   It's diddly.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.600]   There's kind of the APN settings somewhere because you've got to be able to customize
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.600]   the APN settings.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.720]   Yeah, they're automatic now.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.160]   So you really shouldn't have them as well.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.160]   Oh, maybe that's the case.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.560]   No, if you go to cellular network, there's an access.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.560]   Where's that?
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.560]   Okay.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.560]   Does that work?
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.560]   More.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.560]   And then cellular networks.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.560]   Right.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.760]   Yeah, I'll show you what I get on the project.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.400]   Five phone.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.960]   Show them what I get on the project.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.960]   Five phone.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.960]   Wow.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.960]   They hit all they know.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.960]   They are hiding it, baby.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.480]   Does anybody know what that does everybody know what that code is that you can enter that
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.240]   will show you the deep details?
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.080]   Up down, up down left.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.040]   Very good.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.040]   That's it.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.440]   You should be on build LVY48C for the newest project.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.440]   Five thing.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.120]   No, so I'm on LVLYZ28E.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.320]   So it works fine.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.240]   They didn't tell me I should get a new.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.400]   They didn't tell me anything I should get a new or anything.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.160]   Let me see if there's a system update.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.160]   No.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.240]   So you don't have to be on a special version of the operating system to do this.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.840]   It's just I'm up to date.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.240]   Five one one.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.480]   I would guess you're missing bug fixes.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.480]   OK.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.120]   Well, so but they didn't say anything.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.440]   Yeah, that's weird.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.440]   I don't know.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.920]   Five is weird.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.920]   I don't have one.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.920]   I have no idea.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.920]   They won't send me one.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.920]   Same here.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.920]   Google.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.800]   Let's let's try the special code.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   Star.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   Hash.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.320]   Real star hash.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.640]   Four six three six.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.160]   Is it hash star or star hash?
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.160]   Well, they said the opposite.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.520]   It's the opposite, isn't it?
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.520]   It's hash star.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.520]   Hash star.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.520]   Hash star.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.520]   That's what I thought.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.520]   It's the checker.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   Yeah, it works.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.520]   Phone information, battery information.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.520]   So let's see.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.520]   Phone information.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.280]   I'm on the fine network.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.760]   So this must be an MVNO thing because that's what they are, right?
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.120]   Is an MVNO.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.480]   But they're doing something that no one I've ever heard of is doing, which is sharing
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.280]   between Sprint and T-Mobile, depending on which runs the best.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.480]   And I can't see here anything that indicates which of the two I'm on.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.800]   You need to do a trace route.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   It's HSPA.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.440]   So look up the IP address.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.440]   Right.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.000]   HSPA is T-Mobile, right?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   That's going to be T-Mobile.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   That's T-Mobile.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.280]   It's not CDMA.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   So it will go.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.560]   It will fall back to CDMA, which is Sprint.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.840]   So I'm on T-Mobile, but without, you know, unless you knew that that's what that meant,
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.840]   you wouldn't otherwise know.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.840]   All right.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.840]   Okay, I can't say this.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.840]   That you don't know.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   You don't know.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840]   You don't know.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   You have to care.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.840]   Right.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.340]   It's just it says the fine network.
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.540]   And then you do get, of course, a project fi kit, which I'll show you here.
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:04.180]   This is all free.
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.760]   And actually you get, and others have reported this, it's kind of cool.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.060]   You get some special project fi headphones.
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:15.940]   Basically, I would turn it into a stereo.
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.140]   Turn eardrum solos into eardrum duets, it says.
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.340]   Don't know what that means.
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.300]   Oh, you can share.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.740]   So it's a, you can share two people could listen.
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:25.740]   Oh, you're right.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.460]   It's got a special connector.
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.460]   It's a splitter.
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.460]   It's a splitter.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.460]   Look at that.
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.460]   Nice.
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.140]   That makes it really fit funny in your pocket.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.540]   That's good.
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.900]   And by the way, these make excellent Tupperware containers.
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.300]   Yeah, isn't that wild?
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.180]   I didn't notice that.
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.660]   And it's the, the, the Fi color scheme, which is ugly as hell is white.
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:53.060]   This is, you also get a in case case that says project find it white with kind of.
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.060]   Iggy.
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.060]   Oh, wow.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.940]   Yeah, buttons, green and blue.
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.900]   You get the SIM in my case.
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:06.300]   And they also give you, which is kind of cool, a project fi battery.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.700]   It says all natural juice for your phone.
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.180]   Yeah, that's like the new, the new swag that everybody gives out.
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.180]   I have like 10,000.
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.180]   Yeah.
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.180]   Yeah.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.180]   Yeah, let's see.
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.180]   Let's just add a curiosity.
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.180]   It's interesting.
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.940]   It has a little thing to hang it on the shelf with.
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.300]   It's got to be a good 5,000, 8,000 milliamp hour battery.
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.460]   It's a crappy 6,000 milliamp hours.
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.860]   I have a 20,000.
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.860]   It's this size.
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.860]   Come on guys.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.860]   That's right.
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.860]   It's free.
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:33.860]   Right.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.860]   What are you going to do?
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.860]   Right.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:36.860]   It's free.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.420]   And wait a minute, this looks like it has, yeah, it does two USB connectors.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.820]   That's kind of nice.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.820]   Separate amperages.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.980]   Well, I'll put one app.
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:45.980]   I'll put 2.1.
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:50.380]   Oh, so it has a fast charge, which is good because the Nexus 6 does support quick charging.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.260]   So you would want to use the 2.1 amp connector.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.260]   All right.
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.260]   So that's the kit.
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.500]   I put in the SIM card.
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:04.940]   First thing it says is, do you want to port your Google Voice number over or do you want
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:05.940]   a new number?
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.820]   Now, this is where it gets complicated.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.100]   And do you want to jump off the cliff?
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.100]   Yes.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.780]   So my advice to you, if you use Google, I use Google Voice and I thought, well, I'm going
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.780]   to be the guinea pig.
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.780]   We'll try it.
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.300]   My advice to you is to not use your Google Voice number because you lose many of the
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.460]   Google Voice features.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.780]   The phone forwarding continues.
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:29.420]   So one of the main things I do with Google Voice is I use that as my number and then
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.460]   I change phones all the time.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.980]   And it's continuing to forward to three phones total.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.140]   So that's good news.
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.740]   But the other thing, there are a lot of things that are very cool about Google Voice, one
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:47.260]   of which is you can have use your Google context group people and give them different answering
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.460]   machine messages.
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.380]   You can change how the response will be.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.380]   Some people you'll pick up on some, you won't.
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.100]   You can have screening.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.420]   So if somebody calls my Google Voice number, they have to announce themselves and then
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.460]   I have to press one to pick up on it.
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.740]   All of that seems to have disappeared.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:12.460]   In fact, it looks like all you really get is the ability to do these are the settings.
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:18.540]   Voice mail call forwarding service address, which is the 911 address alerts.
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:24.660]   It'll tell you on device or email if you go past the data that you agreed to.
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.660]   And then call forwarding.
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.820]   I'm not going to show those numbers, but it forwards to two other numbers.
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:34.780]   So the really the big deal on this is that you only pay for the data you use.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.100]   So it's what was it?
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.580]   30 bucks for the Voice and Text Service Unlimited Texting.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.940]   And then 10 bucks a gigabyte for data.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:48.500]   You say ahead of time, as I did, how much data you think you'll use, I said 5 gigabytes.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:54.220]   But it's really irrelevant what you choose because you'll just pay 10 bucks a gigabyte,
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.420]   whether you use 10 or 20 or 50 or 100 or whatever.
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.860]   And then they'll rebate you the difference or I guess you give you a credit on the difference.
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.780]   That credit goes down to like the penny as well.
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.460]   I mean, it's a pretty detailed accounting of what you use.
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.180]   You can see as you go.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.500]   The other thing that's very cool is there's no extra charge for tethering and the tethering
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.500]   just counts against your data.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:21.940]   So this is a great MyFi device.
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.740]   International usage is the same as T-Mobile.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:31.100]   So 20 cents a call and 10 bucks a gigabyte, but limited to 256 kilobits per second.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.540]   That's how T-Mobile works as well internationally.
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.260]   So obviously using the T-Mobile network for international usage.
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.300]   It looks to be even the same countries.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.300]   So that's it.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.020]   I mean, that's it's I have to say it's very clean.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.100]   It's very simple.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.460]   I presume they have good support.
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:50.620]   The phone supports estimated weight is one minute email replies with one to four hours.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.220]   There's a project five community on Google plus which I still can't get into.
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.900]   I think you need to get an invite to get into the community.
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.540]   But other than that, that's it.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.100]   But the real caveat for anybody who wants to do this and I can see why you might want
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.340]   to do this is that you should probably get a new phone number if you use Google Voice
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.220]   because as far as I know, there's no way I don't know if there's any way for me to go
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.220]   back.
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.140]   I think I've lost my Google Voice number.
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.740]   So that really, go ahead, Ron.
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.140]   Is it a big difference?
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.740]   Do you care that much?
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.620]   Is it it's just a billing thing?
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.140]   Is the reason you should care that much?
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:32.620]   I mean, it seems it seems like a lot of effort on Google's part for not that huge of a differentiator.
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.140]   You mean, oh yeah.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.140]   Yeah.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.260]   So the price isn't that much better.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.500]   It's kind of what the service is the same as you're going to get from T-Mobile or Sprint
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.500]   in your area.
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.900]   Well, there's one big advantage though.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.580]   This also has seamless Wi-Fi calling transfer.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.580]   Yes.
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.580]   Yeah, OK.
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.460]   But my T-Mobile phone does that too, by the way.
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:58.140]   So that's just this phone in fact did it with T-Mobile as does the Galaxy S6.
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:02.540]   Any phone that can support Wi-Fi calling when you're on T-Mobile, T-Mobile will say, oh,
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.860]   you're going to be using Wi-Fi if you make a call and you can turn that off.
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.860]   But I've used it, the Wi-Fi calling is fun.
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.660]   And yes, seamless means that if I'm on a Wi-Fi call and I get in the car and I try this
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:15.140]   and I drive away, there's a handoff to the cell network and I continue the call without
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.140]   any interruption.
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:20.060]   Yeah, to me, that's one of the biggest advantages for people who have challenging coverage areas
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.380]   especially in the house.
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.380]   Yes.
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.580]   You basically have a triple network there between Sprint and T-Mobile and your own Wi-Fi.
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.580]   Yes.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.580]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.860]   And if you were in an area that had good Sprint but not a good T-Mobile but then you work in
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.740]   an area where it's flipped, this would be a good choice for you.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:39.260]   I think that the data billing, while not necessarily saving you money, is sensible.
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.500]   And if you use tethering, I think this is a good deal for tethering.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.420]   You don't have to pay extra for tethering.
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.340]   So I have to ask, I mean, we talked about this just before the show.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:53.460]   It seems to me that Google had a great thing with Google Voice and it's dying a slow painful
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.460]   death.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.460]   It's ignoring it.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.460]   I don't understand why.
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.380]   And I also don't understand why they couldn't integrate it better into this offering because
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.220]   now you're losing features.
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.220]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.740]   Well, remember there was always the rumor that they were going to kill Google Voice.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:11.180]   Like the last year, people kept saying with the merging of Hangouts and text messaging
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.540]   and all of that, that that was the end of voice.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.900]   Maybe this really is the beginning of the end for voice.
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.540]   It's not the end of the world for me.
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.780]   But I kind of liked having different answering messages for different people.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.300]   I do like the screening.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.220]   I guess that's gone.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.700]   And forwarding looks more like how you would forward yourself, except that you could forward
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.700]   to multiple numbers.
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:35.500]   It doesn't have that kind of additional feeling of like I can use different phones and so
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.500]   forth.
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.420]   And this phone now has my Google Voice number.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.340]   That's the Google Voice phone.
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:46.100]   That's attached out of that SIM, which is also a change.
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:51.060]   So I think probably if you decide to go with Fi and I think Fi is probably a good choice,
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.820]   if T-Mobile and Sprinter are good in your neck of the woods, you probably would want to get
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:59.700]   a new number and continue to, I think you could continue to use Google Voice, have it
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.180]   call that number, right?
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.180]   Yeah.
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.340]   You can use Fi just like any other carrier number.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.340]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:10.220]   The other thing they suggest, maybe you guys have an answer for that, they suggest you
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:15.140]   use the Google Messages app, not Hangouts for your text messaging.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.140]   That's so dumb.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.140]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:23.340]   I mean, one of the best parts of Hangouts is getting, or I mean Google Voice is getting
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:25.740]   your text messages on every single computer on Earth.
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.740]   Right.
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.900]   How does that work when you don't use Hangouts?
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.900]   Right.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.420]   Well, I think it still does it, which is really weird.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.340]   So I started using Messages as my default text messaging and I still, it acted as if it was
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.340]   Google Voice.
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.820]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:46.060]   So text messages to the Google Voice number would end up being like Hangouts go to everyone.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.100]   I wonder if you would get duplicate messages then.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.020]   Yeah, I went back to Hangouts, I thought.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.980]   It's just very, it's very disorganized and there's, you know, there's different groups
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:18:00.620]   that kind of have the same idea of let's do something different with your phone number,
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:06.700]   they're separate and they don't work together and it's very googly to do things that way.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.540]   They always like to make multiples of everything.
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.460]   Why are they doing Project Fi?
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.100]   What's in it for them?
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:20.620]   I would hope it's like the Google fiber plan where it's like, let's, it might have started
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.060]   out that way where it was like, let's go be this internet service provider and we'll
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:31.780]   do things so differently that the competition will have to change but I think Fi at some
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:36.140]   point got watered down more and more and more from, you know, MVNO rules and everything
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.900]   else that it just kind of turned into this.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.220]   It's kind of a need to sell carrier.
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.460]   I don't, it's not vastly differentiated.
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:49.300]   I'm sure they started with a very ambitious plan and it just never made it through however
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.620]   many committees to get here.
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.780]   Yeah, I think you're right, Ron.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.100]   And, you know, Google has tried to upend the carrier market for some time.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:02.900]   They started with the Nexus one and the plans have never worked out to, I think, with Google
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.620]   Envisioned and I don't think they're going to drive much change by doing this.
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.260]   So I'm a little lost on why they're really doing Fi, to be honest.
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:15.980]   The one thing that kind of backs up your thought, Ron, that the MVNO deals might have
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:20.340]   been what diluted this is that they want you to use messenger or whatever it's called
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:25.140]   instead of hangouts for your text messaging because hangouts, I don't think ever uses
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.540]   or no, I guess it can use SMS, can it?
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.980]   Yeah, yeah, they integrated that.
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.660]   But messenger is all SMS.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.660]   Right.
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.660]   Is it ever used data?
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.660]   No.
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.900]   So I wonder if the carriers are saying, now we want you to use, I don't know why would
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.460]   they, why would they care?
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.460]   I don't know.
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.860]   I think you might end up with like a weird message duplication thing.
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.140]   Yeah, I'm not going to take a chance.
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:49.420]   So I may might have fault SMS that be hangouts and I haven't had any problem.
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.660]   It works fine.
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.300]   Well, there you go.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.820]   There's a kind of a mini review of project Fi.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.020]   I mean, can't say anything negative about it.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.540]   I've been using T-Mobile anyway.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.260]   So it's exactly the same.
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.260]   Speeds are the same.
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.900]   Everything's the same.
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.900]   I travel.
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.700]   If you were Larry Page, you would demand 10x thinking and this is definitely not like
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.700]   a 10x thinking.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.700]   No, this is like point one, two, five thinking.
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.700]   Yeah.
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.300]   It just doesn't seem anything compelling.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.100]   And yet, Ron and I still want to invite.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.660]   You do, don't you?
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.180]   It's scarcity, right?
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.180]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.700]   Well, we're probably just completionists.
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.420]   Like this thing came out, we need to try it.
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.740]   It doesn't matter if it's good or not.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.220]   It is our job, right?
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.220]   Right.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.940]   Right now, you have to have an X is six either buy one if you don't have one or have one.
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.940]   And I was, I'm intrigued, Ron, that you say there's a special build for this because they
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.580]   know and nowhere do they mention that.
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.740]   Yeah, sure.
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.140]   You probably should get an OTA.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.140]   I mean, they go get no TA.
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:54.060]   Yeah, the Nexus devices have special carrier builds for all sorts of stuff.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.060]   I've got the page open.
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:59.140]   There's okay, there's T mobile and then there's all carriers except T mobile and then there's
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.140]   project by only.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.900]   So I'm going to guess because they have a special thing for T mobile that is like Wi-Fi
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:04.900]   calling or something.
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:09.940]   I already had it because I was using this with T mobile.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.340]   No, yeah, but there's a different bill for project.
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.660]   Should I go out and get it?
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:16.660]   How do I get it?
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.660]   You'd have to do it.
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:18.660]   You'd have to.
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.660]   You'd have to unlock your phone.
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.660]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.660]   And we could get the image if we have an X is six.
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.660]   Ron and I both I have an X is right.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:23.660]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.660]   But without the sim, it's kind of useless.
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:43.940]   The other thing that's kind of scary if I go to voice.google.com it redirects me to project
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.940]   fi.
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.620]   Oh, so that's it.
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.620]   You're done.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.620]   See you.
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.860]   You have abandoned us.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.860]   See you.
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.860]   So don't do that.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.500]   And now now I have to do it again.
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.860]   I have to try again because now I have to see what happens if you don't kill your.
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:04.580]   The actual Google voice site though, the desktop website is like a horror show now.
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:09.300]   It's like half of it is consumed by hangouts and it's like leave and go try hangouts.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.140]   And then the other half of it's people voice and it's a big it's a big weird mess.
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:17.020]   Yeah, it still works if you if you toggle all your settings, right?
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.740]   It's just super ugly and no normal person.
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:20.740]   Whatever.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.740]   Yeah.
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:22.740]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.020]   It's actually up for me right now and it does not redirect me to project fi.
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.020]   So Leo, I think they voted you off the island.
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.180]   I'm voted off the island.
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.180]   I'm gone.
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.180]   I'm history.
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.900]   Well, because I agreed to have my Google voice number ported.
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.540]   Now it ported for me in about an hour.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.580]   But I've heard from some people that say it hasn't ported for them for days, which
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.140]   means well, Alan Tepper, who sent me an email said he's it's been several days.
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.500]   He hasn't been able to use his phone for anything but Wi-Fi.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.940]   So that's something to keep in mind if you're going to affect.
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.140]   Don't port your Google voice number.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:56.220]   In any respect, it's a bad idea all around.
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.540]   All right.
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:03.860]   They alluded to that too, but they really haven't been very clear on what happens.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.220]   Obviously we're finding out now.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.220]   They're stuck though.
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.220]   They can't kill fi.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.740]   People bought phones to use Fi.
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.140]   They're stuck.
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.740]   Yeah, I guess so.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.580]   I mean, you don't see too many MVNOs go out of business.
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.580]   They tend to get bought soon.
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.500]   Yeah, no, he's going to buy it from Google.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.860]   It was going to buy a hybrid network.
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:24.860]   I don't know.
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:25.860]   MVNO.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.860]   All right.
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:32.700]   Google has announced its second earning, second quarter 2015 earning results.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.700]   This was last Friday.
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:38.580]   It feels like old news now, but it's been since we last gathered for this week in Google.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.660]   And the stock market celebrated on Friday.
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:46.260]   I saw like a huge, huge bump in the value of Google.
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.260]   I think it went up more than $60 billion, right?
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:56.060]   It was the largest, wasn't it like the largest stock market game by any company ever for like
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.060]   a day?
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.060]   In a single day.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.060]   Yeah.
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.060]   Stunning.
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.060]   And it was only an 8% growth.
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.580]   It shows you how big Google is.
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.340]   Revenues, $17.7 billion.
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:11.180]   That's a 11% growth year over year.
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:16.620]   I guess I should talk about profits if I could figure out where profits are.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:21.020]   Google profits are so boring because it's always like people either clicked on ads or
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.020]   they didn't.
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.260]   It's like, you know, you do Apple learnings and it's like we sold this many products and
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.260]   that's useful.
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.460]   But this is just like whether or not people clicked on ads.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:34.700]   I think the reason the market was encouraged, of course, was that it showed that Google,
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:42.180]   just after a long period of decline in the cost per click and troubles with mobile monetization,
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.740]   showed that they were doing okay, that they'd figured it out.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.260]   Yeah, they did better at mobile ads and people are watching a lot more YouTube.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.900]   I think it was basically the-
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.740]   The YouTube was the big story, right?
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.980]   40 minutes per viewer per day.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.780]   And everybody loves video ads.
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.220]   They're like, "No, they're not going to be able to teach you stuff for that."
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.660]   Can't get enough of them video ads.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:04.660]   Watch one.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:11.340]   Also, the other interesting stat was that Google was happy to crow is that YouTube is bigger
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:16.700]   in the very valuable 18 to 49 age group than any other cable channel.
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.740]   So bigger than ESPN, bigger than CNN.
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:25.300]   It is as big as a big cable channel.
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.300]   Okay.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:32.500]   Let's see.
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:39.380]   Revenues, Google member websites, total advertising revenues up 11% year over year, 3% quarter
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.780]   to quarter.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.780]   So that's good.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.220]   That's what you want to see growth.
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:51.540]   I did see a story last week related to this that Google is being more cautious in how
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.300]   many people it's actually bringing on as new hires.
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:00.100]   And I'm looking here and it does show the headcount obviously went up, but they're trying
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:04.420]   to do some- It looks like expense management now more so than they ever did before.
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.740]   I think it was in the New York Times that article.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:07.740]   Yeah.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.980]   Well, that would be prudent even when the market's going well, when things are going well,
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.580]   to not over hire.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:18.700]   Current headcount is 57,148.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.020]   That's up almost 10,000 from this time last year.
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:27.860]   So they've been growing in a torrid rate.
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:33.660]   Other little tidbits, if the euro weren't so damn weak, they would have made $1.1 billion
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.300]   more.
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:41.020]   The foreign exchange rate had foreign exchange rates remained constant.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:45.460]   From the second quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2015, our revenues in the second
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.580]   quarter would have been $1.1 billion higher.
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:50.580]   Thanks, Greece.
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:54.740]   When you get to this size, it's amazing.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.540]   An 8% growth means $60 billion in market value.
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:06.460]   I mean, Greece collapses and it's billions of dollars it's costing us an exchange rate.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:10.620]   The $60 billion thing, it's like Uber is like $40 or $50 billion.
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.580]   It gained more than an Uber.
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:13.980]   Like two Ubers.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:20.180]   That's a good way to put it.
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.180]   Are they back down?
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:25.860]   Because you know, Apple was going up up up until Apple announced that it only made lots
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.420]   of money last quarter and then they were stock tanked.
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:33.540]   The stock market is so strange.
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:39.420]   I presume your employers, certainly my employer, don't allow you to buy tech stocks.
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.540]   We can just watch in the sidelines.
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.620]   Thank God.
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:48.700]   Here's a list from Business Insider of companies complaining to the EU about how well Google
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:52.180]   is doing.
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:59.100]   The sour grapes, we're so angry.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.300]   AppNexus and OpenX have asked, I don't even heard of them, have asked European regulators
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.980]   to investigate Google's dominance.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:10.180]   According to the Financial Times, they went to the European Commission and said, well,
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.580]   angry, but mad.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:17.020]   Apparently, they're, I should go to this.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.820]   Unfortunately, the FT is behind a paywall.
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.100]   I have to read other people's.
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:28.740]   So these are ad networks over European ad networks.
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.740]   Thank you.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:30.740]   Thank you, Rupert.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.340]   Can't read the article.
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.340]   Let's take a break.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.940]   Come back with more.
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.500]   Google Plus is losing the photos.
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.860]   We can explain what that all means.
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:48.940]   We've now got a plug-in for Microsoft Office that means you can even be less dependent
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.140]   on Microsoft than ever before.
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.540]   Microsoft says, yeah.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.540]   And we'll talk about Eddy Stone.
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:58.460]   Actually, I'm really interested with you guys to think about Google's beacons.
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.860]   We try to understand a little bit better on Sunday on Twitter, but I want to hear the
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.060]   experts weigh in on this.
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:09.420]   So a show today brought to you by a company that'll help you be expert, lynda.com.
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:17.820]   3,700 on-demand video courses in every area, things like business skills, like negotiation
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:24.860]   and resume building, how to use productivity skills, how to use word office, Excel, photography,
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:32.540]   Photoshop, your hobby, courses on SEO, SEO tools, fundamentals, the universal principles
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:33.540]   of design.
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.180]   See, I'd love to take that.
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.060]   Google Drive, essential training.
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:40.620]   It's also essential training for Eclipse if you use that IDE.
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:43.900]   There's a lot of great stuff at lynda.com.
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:50.100]   All of lynda.com's courses are taught by smart people, people who work in the field,
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.460]   but they're also excellent teachers.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:56.420]   The videos have written transcripts so you can search the transcript for a particular
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.420]   part of the video.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.420]   That's kind of nice too.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.460]   They're kind of broken up in a way that you can do a little bit at a time or a lot of
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:02.460]   the time.
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:06.780]   You go beginning to end like a traditional course, but it's better than a traditional
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:11.540]   course because you can also just read or go through one chapter or one segment, polish
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.620]   up one skill in Photoshop.
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.620]   Lots of programming stuff.
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.780]   This is a course on C. Everybody's just for fun to learn C.
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.020]   See essential training.
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.020]   I love it.
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:26.620]   You can download those tutorials too and watch them on the go on your iOS or Android device.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.860]   They've got apps for every platform.
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.740]   Create playlists, of course, as you want to watch.
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.740]   Take notes.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.900]   They're stored on the site, so you've got them wherever you go.
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.900]   Go to ynda.com.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.380]   I mean, the best thing to do, try it free for 10 days.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:40.820]   10 days, they're run of the place.
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:48.620]   Every single one of those videos accessed easily, simply 3,707 courses, more than 100,000
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.060]   tutorials.
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.100]   The price is right when you buy, but this is free for 10 days.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:31:00.060]   Linda, LYNDA.com/Twig, TWIG, Linda.com.
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.820]   We love them, you will too.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.540]   Let's talk beacons.
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:10.540]   Apple made a lot of, hey, it's more than a year ago when they announced that all along,
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.140]   they'd been building in this beacon technology to iOS.
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:21.100]   In fact, every iOS device was both a sender and a receiver of beacons.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.060]   Yet nothing really seemed to have happened.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:28.540]   There was a lot of talk about how my people might put Ibeacons in stores.
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.260]   I guess some ballparks have Ibeacons.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:36.660]   You wrote an article on RSTechnica about Google's response to this, which was just
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.660]   announced.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:41.300]   It's an open source version of Ibeacon called Eddystone.
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:49.020]   Yeah, so Eddystone, I guess you would say, is going to do better than Ibeacon because
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.220]   it's open source and a lot more flexible.
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:59.980]   When Apple did Ibeacon, they wanted to make it like a differentiator for iOS.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:04.740]   When you're trying to sell this to companies that don't care and just want to reach everybody,
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:09.180]   like if you're a store in the mall and you want to send coupons to people, you don't
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.540]   care about just iOS.
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:12.340]   You want to reach all of your customers.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.180]   Yeah, and if half of your customers are using Android phones, that's not going to do
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.180]   you any good.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.280]   Exactly, right.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.860]   Some people try to come up with hacks to make this work on Android, but it's not officially
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:22.860]   supported.
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:31.260]   Apple actually went to some of these people and said, "Hey, you're an Ibeacon partner,
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.980]   so don't put it on Android or we will cut off your partnerships."
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:36.980]   Wow.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:41.340]   So Google had to do this if they wanted to play in this game.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:46.500]   Yeah, I mean, there were like, there's one other open source speaking standard, I think.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:51.820]   But this one's going to have Google's backing, so it's going to be built into Android.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.580]   And they'll have a version for iOS.
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.340]   So the cross-platform thing is going to be a big deal for all the companies that you
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.660]   actually need to adopt this for it to be useful.
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:07.060]   Besides being open, how is Eddy Stone different?
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:10.980]   Ibeacon needs an app to work.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:15.020]   So basically, you know, Apple's motto has always been, "There's an app for that."
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.340]   So in order to use Ibeacon, you need an app.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:24.340]   And if you're like a big Starbucks customer and you go there all the time, that's fine.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.580]   You'll have the Starbucks app.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.100]   But if you walk up to like a Coke machine and just want to buy a Coke or something, you
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.900]   don't want to have to install an app just to do this one thing.
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:38.740]   So Eddy Stone will do the app stuff and then it adds a couple different other modes to
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.300]   make this more useful for everybody.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.220]   So there's one that will work with a website.
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:48.620]   So basically, you know, the beacon pops out and says, "Hey, here's a web link for like
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.380]   this soda machine or parking meter or whatever."
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:55.260]   And you go there and you can, you know, pay for stuff or see a coupon or whatever.
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:34:00.660]   And there's a lot less friction there because you don't need to install an app.
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:07.220]   There's another mode that's really interesting that's for like personal use where you'll
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:12.220]   be able to have a beacon that only you can read and you'll be able to like attach it
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:16.220]   to your keys or your luggage and it'll be able to find where it is.
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.380]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:22.660]   So it's kind of like the Motorola key link but like a standardization of that.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:28.620]   And then the fourth mode is for people that have to manage all of these beacons.
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:33.620]   They'll be away for them to just kind of walk around and get battery information and where
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:38.060]   these things are and just kind of an easy way to throw together like a status board of
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:43.140]   what all your beacons are doing right now because that was, Google said they went out
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:48.220]   and talked to a bunch of beacon ecosystem people and that was one of the features that
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.220]   they really asked for.
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:52.460]   Just an easy way, when you have 50 million of these things, like an easy way to manage
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.780]   them and see what they're doing.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:59.980]   So with the four different modes, it should be a little more useful and widely adopted
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.420]   than I beacon.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.860]   But the big questions are what happens for spam.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.660]   Like if you just set one of these things up and it directs you to like a horrible website
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:15.020]   full of viruses for I beacon because this was all managed by applications.
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:20.260]   If a beacon is doing something bad, you can easily blame it on that app, uninstall the
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.220]   app, it stops detecting the beacon.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:26.100]   But Google's going to build like an operating system level beacon detector that goes out
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.060]   and finds everything and gives you like a list.
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:35.300]   And that doesn't have any traffic control on it that we've heard about.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.060]   So that's risky.
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.180]   We don't have the full picture yet.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.780]   I mean, it's really not.
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.900]   It's really not totally out yet to play with.
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.700]   But yeah, it'll be weird for somebody, you know, your phone is just going to pick up all
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.900]   this stuff.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:53.100]   It's only when you say show me you have to you have to you have to enable it.
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.100]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.980]   Yeah, you like kind of it's kind of like searching for Bluetooth devices.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.580]   Why would I what what are the benefits to an end user?
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.220]   Why would I enable it?
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.300]   Oh, I've wanted this for a long time.
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:08.700]   And I have why why because I want presence in my house.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.820]   I want to walk into a room and have the lights go on without using some other sensor.
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:13.820]   Well, okay.
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:17.540]   So this is this is the other use of it, which is your devices a beacon.
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.940]   It's not merely a recipient.
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:20.940]   It's a sender.
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:21.940]   Right.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:22.940]   Exactly.
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:28.100]   You can do that for like a weird testing mode, but for the most part, no, it's just one way.
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.060]   See, apples does do that.
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.660]   That's something that that I beacon does do.
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:36.380]   And in fact, that was the kind of the revelation two years ago when Apple announced I beacon
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.660]   is, you know, we've been building this in and oh, by the way, your phone and your iPad
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.500]   are beacons.
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:45.060]   So it could I mean, it could do what you want to do, Kevin, which is you walk into a room
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:49.220]   and a picture comes up or your music changes or whatever.
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.220]   But that's Apple.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:54.620]   It's one way, but it serves to kick you out to a two way communication system.
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:58.180]   So you like you'll get booted into an app or a webpage or something and then you'll
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:02.740]   be able to do the two way talking because it's a low power Bluetooth device.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.340]   They don't want the actual device to be.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.340]   Oh, okay.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.100]   So Kevin can have a little beacon in his room.
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:13.900]   Some sort of device that's in his room.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:17.100]   He walks into the room, the beacon says hello to his phone.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.700]   A conversation begins and then the phone can say I like the Beatles.
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:27.660]   Yeah, the beacons have the beacons have IDs, basically like big long numbers that are like
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.700]   unique to them.
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:36.580]   So all the beacons really ever say is hi, I'm beacon 12345 and then your phone on Eddie
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:41.780]   Stone at least goes up to the cloud and Google has a big database up there that says beacon
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:45.500]   12345 is this it's in this location.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.460]   It wants you to go to this webpage or open this app or do something.
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:53.660]   So you see the beacon, you go up to the cloud and you get all this like metadata around
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:57.300]   the beacon that you have to set up.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.980]   So I understand how it would work at a zoo or a museum.
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:06.860]   You walk in front of a painting and then your phone, if you're listening in the earbuds,
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.580]   we'll start playing a commentary.
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.740]   That makes sense.
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:14.540]   I could see in store you get near the Levi's display to can pop up a coupon.
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.540]   Right.
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:20.060]   I mean, part of it is like it kind of works like a QR code would, where yeah, where it's
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:24.020]   just here's a way to jump to the internet and get this, but you know, you don't need
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:28.580]   a QR code scanner and you don't need to physically, you know, know where the QR code is.
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.260]   It's like a QR code that comes to you.
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.940]   And then yeah, just GPS isn't that accurate.
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:37.540]   So these give you like a super accurate way to say I am here.
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.980]   I am at this bus stop.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:44.020]   I'm not in the restaurant behind the bus stop or the bus stop on the other side of the street.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.580]   I'm right here.
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.980]   And what can you do for me now?
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.060]   It's been out for two years.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.100]   Maybe I'm just going to know zoos.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:57.540]   It doesn't seem like I see a lot of bike and stuff.
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.300]   Some of the ballpark I think put it in.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.940]   Yeah, there's a ball.
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:01.940]   Yeah.
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:02.940]   Yeah.
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:03.940]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:04.940]   Something tells me you could wander into an Apple store and they would have.
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:05.940]   I'm sure they're using it.
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:06.940]   I'm sure.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.100]   I know this, but I'm sure.
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.940]   But that's one of the problems is unless there's a big sign that says, please install
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:15.940]   this app and turn it on, you wouldn't know.
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.940]   That's right.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:17.940]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:21.660]   There's a physical Apple store app now, right?
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.300]   And I guess you would need that to get the beacon.
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:28.660]   Like you need to know what app you need to get the beacon on iBeacon, which is weird.
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.660]   But okay.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:34.460]   The other problem I think Apple came up against is that they announced this two years ago.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:39.060]   And then like a month later, Edward Snowden's revelations started trickling out.
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:43.660]   And people said, yeah, maybe this isn't such a good idea.
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.540]   We don't want to be announced everywhere we go.
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:54.620]   Yeah, security or privacy is weird because the beacons could potentially track your Bluetooth
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:57.380]   ID and say, right, the idea was here.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.220]   You're broadcasting your unique identifier constantly.
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.780]   Yeah, I think I beacon has stuff.
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.500]   I think I beacon has stuff to stop that.
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.100]   I haven't heard about it for Eddie Stone.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.620]   It doesn't mean it doesn't.
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:10.620]   Just I haven't heard about it.
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:11.620]   I don't know.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:15.780]   Wasn't it Qualcomm that tried this right after Apple did with the gimbal platform?
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.700]   Yeah, but gimbal wasn't gimbal compatible with apples?
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.500]   I thought it was.
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:22.740]   I thought it was cross platform.
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.100]   I could be wrong with that.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.100]   Yeah.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.540]   But that hasn't gone anywhere either than I know of.
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:32.780]   I feel like the real problem that everybody who wants to do this is facing is this notion
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:35.260]   of privacy.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:40.220]   And I don't want to announce my presence and the fear that a lot of people have this will
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:44.780]   be solely used to sell them stuff.
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:47.260]   I mean, so is the internet.
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.260]   Welcome to the internet.
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.780]   You go to every page you go to as an advertisement.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:56.900]   But no, some of it just information, you know, mass transit information, bus stop subways,
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:01.700]   all that would be useful, you know, to be able to buy stuff easier, buy a Coke in a stadium
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:06.980]   without having to go anywhere and have it delivered to your seat or stuff like that.
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:07.980]   It's neat.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:13.060]   I mean, it's neat to be able to just kind of get a webpage that knows where you are and
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.220]   what you're in front of and people can do stuff with that.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.220]   It's, you know, I'm sure it could be used for good or evil.
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:23.700]   You mentioned that one of the resistance, resistances companies had to dealing with
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:27.980]   Apple's Ibacon is this platform exclusiveness.
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:32.620]   Are more people interested now in Eddy Stone because it's open?
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.020]   Google launched with a bunch of hardware partners.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:40.220]   So I mean, it's mostly a question of if businesses will be interested in it.
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.100]   So I don't know.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.740]   You'd have to sell it to them.
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:47.420]   But I talked to some of the hardware guys and they're like, yeah, we could build beacons
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:50.660]   that have Ibacon and Eddy Stone in it.
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:52.060]   And you can just get this one little box.
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.060]   It'll do both.
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.860]   They won't do both at the same time.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:55.860]   You'd have to like switch modes.
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.660]   Oh, that's no good.
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:03.100]   But I mean, I assume businesses would like it now that it's cross platform, but.
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:07.460]   So can I put Eddy Stone on an iPhone?
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:13.180]   As a developer, you can make an iPhone, Eddy Stone aware on, you know, Google has access
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.700]   to the Android operating system.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.860]   So it will be built into the operating system.
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.700]   They don't have access to iOS or just be at the Apple level.
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.780]   I guess it would work in that way.
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:24.340]   It would work a little more like how Ibacon does work.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:29.940]   You have this one app that is Eddy Stone aware and they wanted to build it into Chrome,
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:35.260]   I think the physical web stuff at least, which is kind of like the web page portion
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.260]   of this.
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:42.260]   So yeah, if Google goes and like Trojan horses it into some popular app they have, that could
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.260]   work.
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.500]   Well, Google now would be the one, right?
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.500]   Yeah.
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.500]   And certainly on Android, it makes sense.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:51.380]   And you point this out in the article that beacons don't have to buzz or alert you.
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.820]   They could just give you a Google now card.
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.420]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:00.980]   And Google says they have a couple of implementations right now of beacons stuff.
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.620]   So Google Maps will use it to suck down real time.
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:10.100]   Transit information of the transit thing you're standing in front of and you can use it for
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.380]   better location and what else.
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:18.540]   Yeah, Google now would use it for better location for cards.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:22.660]   So you know, you're in the restaurant and not at the bus stop and all that.
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:26.660]   And I presume the Google app on iOS would take advantage of it as well.
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:27.660]   I mean, that's.
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:29.060]   Yeah, Google search.
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.060]   Sure.
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.060]   Yeah.
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.260]   And then now cards show up there.
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:39.700]   So in fact, Google now has cards to show you where you're parked, but it's using GPS.
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.580]   I think beacons might be useful for that.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.220]   I'm just trying to think of uses.
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:49.500]   And the thing is I just haven't seen a lot of people adopting it.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.940]   Maybe this will make a difference.
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:57.540]   I guess I'm ahead of the curve on the smart home thing.
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.260]   So wait a minute, you have beacons in your house?
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.580]   I would love beacons in my house.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:02.580]   But you haven't done it yet.
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.580]   I haven't done it yet.
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:05.980]   I was looking at estimate, I think makes them.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:09.980]   I was looking at some tokens, but haven't done it yet.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.940]   So I see your echo over your left shoulder.
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:15.100]   You'd have Alexa say, Hi, Kevin.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.060]   Would you like your news briefing now?
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.140]   Alexa, office on.
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:21.140]   I have.
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:25.140]   Oh, is that you you're using for that?
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:28.140]   Actually, I'm using the lower costing win cub.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:29.980]   Ah, yeah, winks supposed to work well.
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.020]   Alexa, office off.
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:34.340]   But it just turns a light on and off.
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.340]   Doesn't do anything else.
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.180]   The bed doesn't start rotating.
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:42.380]   No, no, get very white music.
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:47.060]   I have a nest and smart things and a couple door locks and stuff.
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:50.820]   And I don't see why they all can't just use Wi-Fi for my location.
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.780]   Like when I connect to my home Wi-Fi.
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:53.580]   Yeah.
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.100]   Unlock the doors, turn the conditioning on.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.180]   Like that's that should tell it that I'm here.
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.940]   Quick set uses Bluetooth LA, right?
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.940]   That's how the quick sets work, I think.
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:03.860]   Quick sets.
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.340]   The quick set locks.
[00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:06.740]   Oh.
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:07.580]   Or no, I don't know.
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:08.500]   I think I use Zigg wave.
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.020]   No, no mine.
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.340]   Yeah, Z wave.
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.340]   Z wave.
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.100]   Yeah, the smart home stuff is the smart things.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.100]   Smart things will do both.
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:22.180]   But yeah, I think all my stuff is Z wave, which is just to communicate to the thing.
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:25.220]   But you know, you talk to the hub and then it unlocks everything.
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:29.020]   So that's the other use for beaking is Internet of Things kind of stuff like this,
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:31.260]   like home automation and so forth.
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.340]   I would hope so.
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:36.500]   I mean, I think it's more that these Internet of Things companies aren't very good.
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.020]   Like even Nest, you would think that would use Wi-Fi.
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:43.380]   You know, because I sit in front of this computer and the thermostats over there, I'll have
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:49.220]   my thing kick in the auto away when I'm here, when my phone's here, and it just doesn't
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:53.060]   use GPS, it doesn't use Wi-Fi.
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:54.060]   Why doesn't it do that?
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:59.420]   Just because they have not decided to implement it and there's not much competition and it's
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.700]   just not refined, I guess.
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:05.820]   They either need sensors to be reading where you are in your house or we need a beaking
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:09.220]   implementation to be put together with us.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:14.700]   So Google had already announced Weave, which is there Internet of Things protocol.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.500]   Does this integrate with Weave?
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:18.500]   Nope.
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.500]   No.
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:24.700]   Oh man, there's so many things going on now.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:28.220]   There's no way I'm rattling this off the top of my head.
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:31.340]   I'm looking at your article and I still don't understand.
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:32.340]   Yeah.
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.340]   There's...
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.300]   You got Weave, you got thread.
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:36.300]   Okay, okay, right.
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.460]   Thread is like Zigbee Z-Wave, it's a protocol.
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:47.100]   Right, Thread is an actual, like, bits through the air, wireless communication protocol.
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:52.260]   Eddystone is over Bluetooth, it's a form of communication.
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:57.300]   Weave is a... would you call it a protocol?
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:01.820]   I guess it's a format that goes over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.340]   So Weave is Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.860]   Eddystone is Bluetooth.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:08.020]   Thread is a totally different thing all of its own.
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:13.260]   The physical web is kind of like the URL portion of Eddystone.
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.260]   They're just kind of like overlapping.
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:20.220]   And then there's Burlow, which is an Android based Internet of Things operating system.
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:22.020]   They will save like door-lapping.
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.780]   And they wonder why nobody is doing this.
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:28.060]   Yeah, no, it's impossible.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:33.100]   Every company though, I mean Microsoft, Apple, Google, they all want to do this stuff.
[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:34.540]   They've all made big initiatives.
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:38.500]   There's HomeKit on Apple, there's all these things from Google.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:42.860]   Hey, why do they want to be in this?
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.940]   Is it that consumers are demanding it?
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:47.420]   Why isn't it taking off?
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:51.620]   It just seems like we've still got that kind of tower of Babel with all these different
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:55.460]   interacting protocols that don't interoperate.
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.220]   It just seems like a mess.
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:03.020]   I think that the best way to think of Google is not as a single company with a direction,
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:07.740]   but rather a bunch of different companies that are all under the Google banner.
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:11.700]   So if you look at that list, Burlow is from the Android team.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:15.620]   That's the Android guys idea of what the Internet of Things should be like.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:17.460]   We even thread our from Nest.
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:20.100]   That's their idea of what the Internet of Things should be like.
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:23.820]   These guys don't really talk to each other all that often.
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:29.540]   Google's happy to let them compete and have the best team win.
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:32.180]   They're never worried about unification, really.
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:34.700]   And see, this goes back to the whole Nest purchase.
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:40.220]   I mean, $3.2 billion just to get a smart thermostat and smart smoke detectors.
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:45.740]   I mean, I would have thought that group would have brought the platform to get these things
[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:49.580]   to communicate and they're not even working on the Burlow and the Weave stuff as far as
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.180]   I know.
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:56.460]   They bought Nest bought Revolve, which was a smart home hub company.
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.540]   They had every radio that you could think of.
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:04.660]   Yeah, and that's what's really the future of smart drones.
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:08.940]   I think it's you know, you make a lock that can lock and unlock over the Internet.
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:09.940]   That's fine.
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:10.940]   You're done.
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:11.940]   You don't need to upgrade that lock.
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.540]   But the smart home hub is something that you would want to upgrade that would get new
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:19.500]   software, new interfaces, things like that where, because right now the problem with all
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.460]   this is the interface.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:26.140]   Nobody really knows whether it should be like a dashboard full of toggles or something
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:31.700]   that happens automatically as you as you kind of come and go.
[00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:35.780]   It's just that's the part that needs to get figured out.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.780]   Here's a video Adrian gave us in the chat room.
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:44.620]   I think this is a Dutch commercial of why you you don't really want a smart home.
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:51.620]   Some bad guys coming up to the gate, which what opens they were about to climb over it.
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:56.620]   They're a little puzzled.
[00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:59.620]   They go up to the front door and it unlocks.
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:00.620]   They walk in.
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:05.500]   They even as they walk by various items in the house like a painting that lights up.
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.620]   They go, oh, I guess I'll take this.
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:09.620]   Rachinburg there.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:12.740]   Just put that in a bag and.
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.580]   Ooh, there's the automatic vacuum cleaner.
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:19.700]   The fire places come on in the TV.
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:30.860]   It turns out that this guy who owns his house is on stage doing a demo of how his home automation
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:33.540]   system can.
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:42.660]   And the only one with access is me.
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:48.380]   I don't know what even Apple Dawn means, but.
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:49.380]   That's great.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.380]   That's great.
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:55.500]   A little Dutch humor to tell you why home automation isn't all it's correct up to be.
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:51:02.020]   You know, smart things can control my door locks and that uses Google's fuse location
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:06.260]   provider which combines like Wi-Fi and GPS and all that to know where you are and unlike
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.380]   the doors when you show up.
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:11.780]   But Google's location thing does not know about Wi-Fi hotspots.
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:14.900]   So I brought the Wi-Fi hotspot with me to New York City.
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:20.300]   I'm in New Jersey and connected to the Wi-Fi hotspot and it came on and said, oh, you've
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.420]   arrived at home because you can.
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.420]   Oh, excuse.
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:27.860]   To your wife and my doors unlocked when I was like, no, and I'm just like, oh, that
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:29.860]   hand is not far off.
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:31.620]   No, it's not.
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:34.500]   What a mess.
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:35.900]   And you know, we're all early adopters.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:38.500]   So we play with all this stuff and smart things as an advertiser.
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.500]   I guess I should give that disclaimer.
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.860]   They seem like though they have figured out the idea that well, you've got to have everything
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.460]   talk to everything else.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:46.460]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.300]   The hubs are definitely necessary.
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:49.460]   It's cool.
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:50.900]   It's cool what it does.
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:56.380]   It's just, you know, there's bugs to work out and stuff to think about, I guess.
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:00.060]   Why do Apple, Microsoft and Google all want to get in this business?
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:03.300]   So they see this as being a very big business at some point.
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.500]   What kind of data are they really getting?
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.100]   I mean, they can already get location data.
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.100]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:14.940]   I assume when they bought Nest, that Google was going to kind of watch, somehow be watching
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:15.940]   you through your thermostat.
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:17.860]   They don't think they care about that.
[00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:18.860]   Right.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:19.860]   And it's like you have a smartphone.
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:22.740]   There was pretty much no worse privacy violation.
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:23.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.020]   Somebody wanted to be evil.
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:26.020]   You got Android.
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:27.180]   We don't need Nest.
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.180]   Yeah.
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.180]   Really.
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:33.180]   But no, I mean, it's software and they just want to jump on it and they make software.
[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:34.180]   That's it.
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:35.180]   I guess it's a way to make money.
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:36.180]   I don't know.
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.780]   I mean, well, I think maybe you hit the nail in the head when you said you can't think
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:40.380]   of Google as a monolithic company.
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:41.380]   It's not one company.
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:43.660]   It's just a bunch of people doing something they're interested in.
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.660]   Yeah.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:49.500]   And I'm sure, you know, when you work at Google and have tons of money to burn on this stuff,
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:53.300]   I'm sure you're like, boy, I sure wish my house would just unlock when I show up and
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.140]   the lights turn on and it plays me a song.
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:57.340]   And Google's like, we'll pay you to work on that.
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.340]   Right.
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:59.340]   Go for it.
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:05.700]   I think some of this is that that people like us, geeks and engineers are scratching their
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:09.580]   own itch, even though no normal human has any interest in this.
[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:10.580]   Oh, God.
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:11.580]   Yeah.
[00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:13.180]   This would be impossible to set up for a normal person.
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:14.180]   Yeah.
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:15.180]   More work than it's worth.
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:18.340]   It's not so hard to stick a key in a door lock and open your door.
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.340]   Yeah.
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:23.340]   I did a do-it-yourself home automation type system back in 2010 using Insteion, which
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:26.060]   at the time, I thought was the best solution.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.060]   And I got it working.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.380]   I mean, I could get my garage door to remotely opening clothes.
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:31.540]   I had webcams that I could access.
[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.020]   My lights would go on and off.
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:36.700]   You know, time to the daylight sunrise, sunset and so on.
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:40.500]   But you know, the average person would never have gone through what I went through to make
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:41.500]   it home.
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.340]   Nor spent the money at that time to.
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:45.180]   It's like building a model railroad.
[00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.460]   It's a specialty act.
[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:47.460]   Yeah.
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:48.460]   Right.
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:50.420]   And the centralization that they want to push is kind of weird.
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:55.460]   Like, I was looking into a light switch solution like Kevin just, you know, said some command
[00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:57.940]   to his Amazon box and his lights turned off.
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:02.380]   And I'm like, for real, like my hallway and bathrooms, the best smart light thing is
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:05.620]   just a motion detector hooked up to the light switch.
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.540]   You just screw into the wall and it's done.
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:10.140]   And you walk into the hallway and I had those for years.
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:11.140]   Right.
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:14.180]   And it's like, you don't need an internet connection or some hub or whatever.
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:18.340]   And that's like one of the best things that I've installed because it just works and it's
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:21.100]   there and it's fine and it's simple and a normal person.
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:22.100]   Right.
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.100]   Just get the clapper.
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:25.740]   My old house had the nest installed.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:26.740]   I had hue lights.
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.140]   I did a lot of that stuff.
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:31.380]   And the telling thing is when I moved, I didn't install it again at all.
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:35.300]   If you like, bulbs are in a box, the nest is just in a box.
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.820]   It's just, I just, that was nice.
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:38.460]   It was fun.
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:39.460]   You know what I did install?
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:40.460]   My whole thing is good.
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:41.460]   I'm going to do a, we're going to do an ad.
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:44.740]   Are you ready for a smart device?
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:47.660]   This is kind of like the thing that you mentioned in the bathroom and that just you come in.
[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:48.820]   The lights come on.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:50.260]   This is really what you need.
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:55.420]   This is the ring doorbell and I love it because it's got a camera.
[00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:56.420]   It's very easy to install.
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:58.820]   In fact, this is, this is how everything should be.
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:02.700]   It comes with everything you need to install it, including drill bits, screws.
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.420]   There's even a level in here and all of this.
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:05.420]   It's very simple to do.
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:08.700]   I install it myself and I am the farthest thing from a handyman.
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:13.140]   If you've got a wired doorbell, you just take the wired leads and it's ready to go.
[00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:17.820]   But this also has a lithium ion battery that you could charge via USB the last of the year.
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:22.260]   So you unclip it, charge it, clip it back on and last of the year.
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:24.140]   It's a normal doorbell.
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:26.260]   It will ring your doorbell and everything.
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:30.260]   But when you do that, the camera comes on and let me show you actually, I have it on
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:31.940]   my phone.
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:37.340]   Now it doesn't unlock the door and I kind of like that.
[00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:38.700]   We're not talking about unlocking the door.
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:44.980]   We're just merely talking about seeing who's at the door and talking to them.
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:46.220]   You can hear them.
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:47.220]   They can hear you.
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:49.420]   Here's my ring doorbell app.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:52.340]   You can have multiple doorbells attached to a single door.
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:55.380]   So here's somebody rang our doorbell last night at 653.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.380]   This is the other thing.
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:58.700]   Now you don't have to do this.
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:01.300]   They get a free month or something, but there's somebody in my doorbell.
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:04.740]   Oh yeah, he brought the Chinese food.
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:05.900]   So I could talk to him.
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:07.060]   He could talk to me.
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:11.140]   But for a security point of view, this is also awesome because it has a motion detector.
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:16.340]   So I can see when motion happened, not only missed doorbell calls, but when motion happened
[00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:21.500]   and go back and look at those videos, it turns out when bad guys rob your house, they almost
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:25.820]   always ring the doorbell first to see if you're there, right?
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:28.980]   So it's really kind of amazing what you get.
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:36.340]   This is ring about 95% of all home breakings happen during the day and it almost always
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:37.860]   starts with ringing the doorbell.
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:42.260]   With a ring doorbell, you can see and talk to anyone at your door from anywhere in the
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:43.340]   world.
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:46.140]   So when somebody rings my doorbell, this has been very useful.
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:49.620]   The UPS guy comes and I can say, yeah, just leave it there.
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:52.420]   I'm in the shower even though I'm at work.
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:54.060]   Rings motion detector will alert you.
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:55.860]   By the way, you can set it for sensitivity.
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:58.540]   So initially I had it real sensitive is picking up all the stuff.
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.220]   I turned it down until it was just right.
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.540]   So it was just people on my porch.
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:05.220]   It's kind of like a caller ID on your home.
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.420]   It is easy to install.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:11.020]   Now I'm a nitwit and took me about half an hour, but I think anybody knows what they're
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:12.780]   doing is going to be able to install it very quickly.
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:17.780]   Time magazine named the ring video doorbell, one of the top 10 gadgets last year and I'm
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:20.100]   going to get you 25 bucks off.
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:25.660]   174 bucks when you go to ring.com/twig.
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:26.660]   Do not be intimidated.
[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:28.420]   This is easy to install.
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:30.740]   It uses your Wi-Fi.
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:33.060]   Once the Wi-Fi is set up, there's nothing more to do.
[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:35.220]   It's painless.
[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:39.780]   Having done a bunch of this stuff, as I said, this is the one that I'm keeping with me.
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:44.540]   We're going to put one on the back door, on the front door of the office and you can
[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:47.380]   have multiple rings on a single app on your phone.
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:52.540]   Ring.com/twig.
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:55.620]   I've talked to a number of people who have installed it since we started doing the ads
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:58.700]   and they took a person and say, "Yeah, it was easy.
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:00.620]   Yeah, I love it."
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:01.620]   Ring.com/twig.
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:04.460]   Now that's home automation.
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:08.140]   It's not really automation, but it's just nice to be able to look out and see who's at
[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:09.140]   your door.
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:11.380]   Yeah, that is definitely a solution I've wanted.
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.380]   Who was ringing my doorbell and why?
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:14.380]   Yeah.
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:15.380]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:16.380]   Don't find a guy.
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.780]   We had a doorbell, but we'd never hear.
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:20.780]   So I mean, it would ring and I would never know.
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:24.460]   But now that not only is a doorbell ring, my phone's ring and I have ring on all of
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.580]   my devices.
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:27.100]   So you don't miss the ring.
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:30.020]   Somebody comes to my doorbell, the house lights up.
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:32.020]   That's cool.
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:34.980]   I know, I love it.
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:40.940]   Google did hire the execs from Homejoy.
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:43.940]   Homejoy shuttered its doors.
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:45.780]   This is another new business for Google.
[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:51.740]   What is Homejoy, besides the name?
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:55.060]   Professional house cleaning services.
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:59:02.220]   They closed their doors July 31st and then it was announced that Google had hired most
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:03.220]   of the team.
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:05.820]   So the idea is you use a smartphone app.
[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:07.020]   Oh, Robert Scobel likes it.
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:08.180]   It must be good.
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:12.020]   Use a smartphone app to schedule cleaners.
[00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:15.740]   It's an interesting idea.
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:19.220]   Google has hired the team.
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:23.020]   I guess they're not taking over the business.
[00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:24.020]   Yeah.
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:25.900]   What would the sales pitch be?
[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:28.900]   Uber for people that will come and clean your house.
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:29.900]   Uber for maids.
[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:30.900]   Yeah.
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:36.540]   I don't know that this is an indication that Google is getting into that market.
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:38.700]   They might just be good programmers.
[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:42.820]   Yeah, they do Aqua hires sometimes where they buy the company and the patent and the people
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:43.820]   behind it and all that.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:47.900]   This is a company that closed down and went out of business.
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:51.740]   And yeah, they could have just as easily said, "Hey, some engineers.
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:56.460]   Let's hire some engineers and not care at all about the idea because I mean it doesn't
[00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:58.100]   make much sense for them to do this.
[00:59:58.100 --> 00:59:59.100]   It's not."
[00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:02.700]   According to recode, Homejoy went out of business kind of independently.
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:07.980]   They had classified employees as contract workers.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.140]   Right, right.
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:12.340]   And with all these legal problems, why would you mess with it?
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:13.340]   Right.
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:17.220]   But Google did hire 20 people from the product and engineering team.
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:23.780]   So you got to wonder if there's something similar that Google wants to do.
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:27.580]   There are other companies who do this handy and thumbtack.
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.580]   Who was it?
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.580]   Was having a horrible...
[01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:31.580]   Oh, was it Christmas-sina?
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.340]   I think it was Christmas-sina.
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:36.300]   Had hired handy and then they didn't show up or something.
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.380]   And he couldn't cancel them very easily.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:44.420]   So then he used one of those services you use via text message to cancel handy.
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:45.420]   Like TaskRabbit or something?
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:46.420]   Yeah, it wasn't.
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:47.740]   It was somebody like TaskRabbit.
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:52.420]   I was watching this all play out on Twitter and I thought, "Chris, you live in the future."
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:54.780]   It's like, "What?"
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:01:00.540]   Anyway, Amazon is also launching an online portal for home services.
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:02.460]   So this is maybe this is a business.
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:07.460]   Speaking of Amazon, have you used JET?
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:08.460]   It's here.
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.460]   I just launched.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:14.900]   I don't know how this is a business, to be honest with you.
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:18.100]   They want to go up against Amazon created by the guy Tony...
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.100]   Was it Tony Lor?
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.180]   Is that his name?
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:23.820]   Who created diapers.com.
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:26.900]   You remember this sad saga of diapers.com?
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:27.900]   Huh?
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:29.900]   Sorry I had to have a sock.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:30.900]   Not socks.
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:34.220]   Saga of diapers.com.
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.180]   You wouldn't think I'd have a heckler here.
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:45.300]   But I guess anyway, that was the diapers by mail, you know, pamper's by mail store and
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:51.340]   Bezos targeted it, undercut it, put it out of business, then bought it very famously.
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:55.660]   And Tony Lor, who was the founder, I guess is maybe trying to get back at the Bezos with
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:58.100]   a new service called JET.
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.980]   There's been a lot of attention to this.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.980]   They've raised a lot of money.
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:05.300]   Obviously, the market's very interested in an Amazon competitor.
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.980]   They'd like to get in early on this one.
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.860]   But it's a club.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:13.500]   You have to pay 50 bucks ahead of time.
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.300]   So you don't need an invite now?
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.860]   No, they just went out of invite yesterday.
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:18.860]   Okay.
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:19.860]   Mm-hmm.
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:20.860]   Okay.
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:24.260]   The problem is, at least during the beta, they don't have any distributions or they have
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:28.580]   few distribution centers and they don't have many distributor deals.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.580]   So there's a big...
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.380]   So it's got a take forever to ship?
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:34.860]   Yes, and it's a big money loser because they have to buy the product and then ship it
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:35.860]   to you.
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:36.860]   So...
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:37.860]   I don't know.
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:43.020]   It seems like Amazon kind of owns this market, don't they?
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:45.140]   Yeah, Prime's fast shipping just makes me go.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:49.020]   I could go to the store where I could just press this button and it will just show up.
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:50.020]   Yes.
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:53.780]   And when you're a lazy tech journalist who works from home, you're just kind of, "I'll
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:54.780]   just stay here.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:55.780]   Be a hermit.
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:56.780]   Click.
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:57.780]   I find...
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:59.260]   I find...
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:00.780]   Even stupid stuff now.
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:01.940]   I don't go out and buy.
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:03.860]   I just haven't shipped to me.
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:04.820]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:05.820]   Plus even with...
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:06.820]   Even if you don't have Prime...
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:07.820]   Paper clips.
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:08.820]   Staplers.
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:09.820]   Yeah, a little stuff.
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:10.980]   A little stupid stuff.
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:13.900]   Even if you don't have Prime, you can usually get the best price on Amazon.
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:16.980]   I'm looking here at the Wall Street Journal's article on JET and they said...
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:18.980]   Not even the best price.
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:24.060]   Yeah, I mean, it costs JET twice as much as it charts the customer for the 12 items in
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:25.060]   the particular order.
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:31.540]   I mean, loss leader is one thing, but how long can you do that?
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:32.540]   Not very long.
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:36.220]   That's why they keep having to go to the market and getting more money, right?
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:37.220]   Good luck.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:39.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.660]   You know, I would love to see some competition for Amazon, but it's...
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:46.860]   There are some businesses where it's hard to beat an incumbent.
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.260]   Google's one, right?
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:51.220]   Search and search ads.
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:52.220]   And Amazon's another.
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:53.500]   It seems like Amazon really is...
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.980]   Unless you picked an itch and you saw what happened with diapers.com.
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:01.220]   He thought, "Oh, I can beat Amazon because I can beat them on one thing, diapers."
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:05.380]   And Amazon said not so fast.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:08.820]   Club price savings are pretty much anything you buy.
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:09.820]   I am...
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:10.820]   Yeah, I can...
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:14.260]   So more expensive and slower than Amazon.
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:15.260]   Sounds great.
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:16.340]   Where do I sign up?
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:17.340]   You got it.
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:18.340]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:22.580]   Somebody did some research and said some of the prices were lower than Amazon, some were
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:24.460]   not.
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:27.980]   But the real deal is if you've got Prime, and I presume anybody who would be looking
[01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:33.540]   at this server, Jett, would be a Prime member, you're just going to use Prime.
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.540]   Yeah.
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:39.900]   Pre- shipping over 35 bucks, they say free returns.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:43.220]   If you don't have Prime and you're not an Amazon person, that's fine.
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.660]   But I would think there's other...
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:49.580]   There's club pricing available through Sam's Club or CostCo and such.
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:52.540]   And they usually beat other people's prices as well.
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:54.020]   Amazon was smart.
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:57.580]   They didn't call it a club.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:01.380]   It was just free two-day shipping.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.580]   And it's twice as much, it's 100 bucks now.
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.180]   But they have so many other features of it.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:12.500]   And if you use Amazon, it's such a brilliant thing, Prime, because you get people to pay
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:16.660]   you to be locked in customers.
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:19.340]   I give them 100 bucks to get locked in.
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.100]   Yeah, but it's better than that.
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:22.500]   Because I get something.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.060]   It's a good membership card.
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:29.060]   All right, what else?
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:32.700]   Oh, I haven't got it yet.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:35.940]   Have you got timeline in Google Maps yet?
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:41.900]   Well, right on the Android app, you can just download it from...
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:44.260]   Oh, you have to download a new...
[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:47.620]   Okay, Ron, you tell me now, you're the expert on Android.
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:48.620]   No, no, okay.
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:51.540]   Because I've been waiting for it to be updated in the store.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.780]   It should come automatically through the store.
[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:56.540]   Android police runs a lovely site called APK Mirror.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.900]   We can just go and everybody...
[01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:02.100]   It's like crowdsourced uploads of APKs.
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:03.700]   You can just go there and download it.
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:06.420]   So it's being staged then?
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:10.020]   Yeah, it's Google Maps 9.12, which is where you want.
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:15.700]   So I don't have it yet on my Nexus 6, but Jason, just in Kliyanthas, our producer does.
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.780]   Let me go back and show it.
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:23.380]   So when you hit the hamburger, you now have an addition to your places and traffic.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:25.940]   And you pick which map you want, your timeline.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:26.940]   Whoops.
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:27.940]   And it shows you...
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:29.460]   Oh, this is cool.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.460]   All the places you've been.
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.660]   You haven't been many places, Jason.
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:33.660]   So that's today.
[01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:34.660]   Oh, I could pick...
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:37.900]   Yes, swipe left and right on the card at the bottom.
[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:38.900]   This is...
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:41.380]   I don't know what's happening now.
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:42.380]   Just tap on the screen.
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.180]   Okay, tap on the white part at the bottom.
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:45.180]   I could pick different days.
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:47.260]   Oh, this is what was in your dashboard.
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.260]   Mm-hmm.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:49.260]   Yes.
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:51.580]   Yeah, the desktop site updated to...
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:54.620]   For me, it updated today and it looks beautiful.
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:55.620]   It's really cool.
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:56.820]   Oh, let me look at that.
[01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:58.820]   Is that maps.google.com?
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:01.780]   Yeah, there's a URL for it.
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:07.020]   We'll just search Google location history and it should show up.
[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:08.700]   There was some fancy URL that got it.
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:10.700]   I've always loved that.
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:12.620]   Because you could go...
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:18.100]   See, let me just search a Google location history.
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.580]   Turn location history off or on maps.com.
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.580]   Yeah, it'll be the first link.
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:25.380]   Yeah, it's maps.google.com/locationhistory.
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:26.380]   Is what it is.
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.380]   Yeah, that sounds right.
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:28.980]   And then you can play it back too, which is fun.
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:34.580]   So I just got back from Europe, which it should show me my whole trip, right?
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:38.660]   Yeah, so there was an old version online and there's a new version that kind of looks
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.140]   like material design.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:41.140]   Oh, here it is.
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:42.140]   Trip to Amsterdam.
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:43.780]   So there's actually a button.
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:44.780]   I can click this.
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:48.660]   It says Trip to Amsterdam, Germany, Vienna, and one other country.
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.220]   And it pulls in your photos.
[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:51.220]   How cool is that?
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:52.220]   Oh, no, really?
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:53.220]   Very nice.
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:54.220]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:55.220]   There's the new one.
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:57.140]   Oh, my gosh, that's awesome.
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.140]   So let me see.
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.140]   How do I...
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:00.140]   Oh, there's...
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:03.060]   I flew to the airport and then I got in the boat.
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:05.580]   Now, okay, but it is confused.
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:06.980]   So this happens to me a lot.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:09.900]   So the boat has Wi-Fi.
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:13.540]   And the boat's Wi-Fi thinks it's in Amsterdam.
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.820]   So you see all these trips back and forth?
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:17.860]   I'm making Amsterdam.
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:23.260]   I'm going back and forth to Amsterdam in a matter of seconds, all the time, because every
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:29.420]   time I switch to the boat's Wi-Fi, it suddenly thinks, "Oh, I'll let's go back to Amsterdam."
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:36.260]   That's the exact same thing that happens to my smartphone thing, where you connect to
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.260]   your Wi-Fi and it's like, "Are you at home?"
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.500]   Because Google builds this database of Wi-Fi hotspots.
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.500]   That's what it is.
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:45.980]   It tries to find out where the location is, but they don't know about mobile hotspots.
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:48.060]   It's just all hotspots are stationary.
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.620]   And last time we had GPS, we'd hang this one and it was here.
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:51.940]   You've got to fix this, Google.
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:52.940]   This is crazy.
[01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:54.940]   But yeah, you'll get like...
[01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:59.900]   And there's assisted GPS and stuff where you'll get like vague location from your cell phone
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:03.260]   signal where it'll just jump all over the map.
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:04.260]   Oh, there.
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:06.060]   You broke the speed of light a couple times, I think.
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.620]   Yeah, I did.
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:10.220]   Because at 5.30, I was in Frankfurt.
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:14.660]   And at 8 o'clock, I was 1,000 miles away.
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.660]   That's crazy.
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:16.660]   Like this.
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:18.860]   So if you click on the little thing, you can edit it.
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:24.340]   I don't know why any normal person care about editing their location history in Google Maps,
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:25.340]   but you can.
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:27.020]   That actually is good.
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.420]   And then there's this button that says, "I was here."
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:32.220]   I presume that's one response, which is, "Yeah, I was here."
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:35.860]   Yeah, that's a thing where they're like, "We're not sure if you were actually at this
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:36.860]   building."
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:37.860]   I wasn't here.
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:39.660]   What would we talk about with the beacons?
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:40.660]   Remove stuff from there.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:41.660]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:42.660]   Okay.
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:45.100]   Like we talked about with the beacons, it's never quite sure.
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.100]   It's not super smart.
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:49.860]   What business you're in, because GPS just isn't that accurate.
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:52.460]   So I also did not go back to Frankfurt.
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:53.460]   Okay.
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:56.940]   So, yeah, you could sit here and correct it, but I don't know why.
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:01.740]   I was here at the museum.
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:03.660]   This is fun, though, that it puts the pictures in here.
[01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:05.660]   It's really cool.
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:09.980]   So is this like the old latitude product that they had?
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:13.220]   Yeah, there's another great product that Google killed.
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:19.620]   The latitude was like find your friends where you would tell you where it was.
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:22.180]   Which they're moving to Google Play services now.
[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:26.300]   I think it's currently in Google+ hidden that nobody knows about.
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:29.220]   And I think they're going to cut back from Google+ next.
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:30.220]   Oh, really?
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:31.220]   Yeah.
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:34.620]   Yeah, more culling of Google+ features.
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:39.060]   So I need to go through this and delete the spurious Wi-Fi locations.
[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:42.220]   And then I would actually have a useful little map of my travels.
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:43.220]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:50.700]   But my favorite thing that they added is you can now name places on the map in the new
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.260]   Google Maps.
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:58.980]   So if you have a favorite lake or spot or my example was my parents' house, you could
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:10:59.980]   label--
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:01.980]   You could say it's my parents' house.
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:02.980]   Oh, nice.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:04.740]   And it will show up on the map.
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.140]   And you'll see the text there.
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:09.940]   Because before all you could do is star stuff and you would have a bunch of stars that were
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:13.700]   like latitude longitude numbers, which was completely useless because you had no idea
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:16.060]   what any individual star was for.
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:18.820]   But now you can actually tag spots on the map and it will save them.
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:22.620]   And hopefully this will end up on all the other Google Maps clients.
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:26.180]   Because right now it's on the Android version.
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:27.700]   And it might show up in your location history.
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:31.260]   But I don't think it shows up on the desktop version of Google Maps yet or iOS.
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:32.260]   So--
[01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.380]   You know, and a bad thing.
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:38.620]   If you remove a location because it's a Wi-Fi location and there's pictures attached
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:43.420]   to it, I don't think it removes the pictures from photos, but it takes them out of your
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:44.420]   timeline.
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:45.420]   Right.
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:47.580]   It has those pictures because you upload them to Google Photos.
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:51.340]   It thought that I took those pictures in Amsterdam, but I didn't.
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:55.860]   But when I took out that stop, it went away.
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:57.860]   Anyway, play with it.
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:00.700]   It's another cool thing.
[01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:01.700]   I like that timeline.
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:02.700]   Here you can have your phone back.
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.860]   I think I have years of data on here.
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:05.860]   That's was fun.
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:06.860]   Yeah.
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:07.860]   Wow.
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:14.260]   And if you do it in the dashboard, it tells you things like you spent 47% of your time
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:15.260]   at home.
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:16.260]   Things like that.
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:17.260]   Yeah.
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:20.900]   It's one of the really-- like if you're freaked out by the amount of data, Google knows about
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:21.900]   Google.
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:22.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.620]   Location-- location history is one of the big ones.
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:28.860]   The other one is you can have a history of your voice searches, which is like your phone
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:29.860]   ran--
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:30.860]   Right.
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:32.980]   --turning on because it thought you said, OK, Google, and recording everything you say
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:35.060]   for like the next five seconds.
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:37.220]   It's fun to go through and see what it screwed up.
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:41.500]   And a lot of it's not actual-- it's just things that it heard.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:42.500]   Right.
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.900]   It would just be murmurs or shifting around in my pocket or--
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:47.460]   Yeah, there's a lot of butt dialing going on.
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:48.460]   Yeah.
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:49.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:52.100]   Big data, baby.
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:58.300]   Here's my voice and audio activity that it thinks I sent to Google.
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.180]   My voice is my passport.
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.180]   Yes.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.180]   Yep.
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:03.180]   Yes.
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:04.180]   My voice is my--
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:05.180]   OK, Google.
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.180]   Five nights at Freddy's.
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:07.180]   There's a search.
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.140]   Yeah, this is-- see, it's funny.
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:14.580]   It just shows you-- this is actually a test, a litmus test, to see if you're a person of
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:17.100]   the future or a person of the past.
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:21.820]   A normal person of the past would get horrified by this.
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:22.820]   Yeah.
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:23.820]   Right?
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:24.820]   Yep.
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:28.820]   But I think this is cool.
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:32.820]   So if you're brave, the ones you want to play are the ones that say transcript not available.
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:33.820]   Yeah, because you don't know.
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:36.300]   You're screwed up and it wasn't a Google search.
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.420]   Yeah, maybe I shouldn't turn those on.
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:39.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:43.380]   So this stuff is definitely weird.
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:44.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:48.140]   But that to me, I think that's cool that Google saved all that.
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:51.340]   Thank you, Google, even though you didn't tell me ahead of time.
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:52.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:53.700]   You opted in.
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:57.780]   There were some terms of service that you blew by and just hit next before.
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:58.780]   And that counts.
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:06.020]   I definitely know there was nothing that I signed up for that said, save everything I
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.140]   say to my phone for the rest of my life.
[01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:09.980]   I don't think that was in there.
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:11.460]   Yeah, it was somewhere.
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.940]   It was easy to turn off and easy to delete.
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:14.940]   It was there.
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:15.940]   They got you.
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:16.940]   It was there.
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:19.420]   Does Cortana do that?
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:24.860]   I think they all-- see, actually, this is what's different about Google.
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:26.740]   They all Siri, everybody.
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:31.660]   They are all being sent to the company and being stored.
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:34.900]   Only Google lets you hear it, though, again, after the fact.
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:35.900]   Right.
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:40.820]   And the reason I know you agreed to it is because it's part of the setup when you do
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:41.820]   an Android phone.
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:45.580]   It asks you every single time, again and again, again, hey, do you want to give us location
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:47.780]   history and all this other stuff?
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:49.620]   So you do have to set it up every time.
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:50.860]   No, yeah, but it's not--
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:52.500]   It could be more clear.
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:53.500]   It could be more clear.
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.580]   It could make a big deal out of it, sure.
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:58.100]   We are going to save these forever.
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:04.860]   It could be hidden in something like send data back to Google to improve our services,
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:07.460]   that kind of thing.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.980]   I think it's the time frame that probably freaks people out.
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:15.660]   I mean, I just looked and there were trips to Phoenix in Las Vegas that I took five years
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:17.740]   ago showing up in timeline.
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:21.060]   Imagine 50 years from now.
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:25.420]   I mean, we are-- I mean, this quantified self is happening whether you like it or not all
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.420]   the time.
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:30.220]   As you said, Kevin, you said-- or maybe it was Ron said it.
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.100]   This phone is the perfect spy device.
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:33.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.100]   That was everything.
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:36.420]   You won't bury time capsules in the future.
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:37.420]   This is your time capsule.
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:38.420]   Yeah.
[01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:44.580]   It turns out I've been saving every picture, every voice dictation, everything.
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:46.180]   The AP is doing the same.
[01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:50.460]   Apparently, the Associated Press has been saving everything and they have just uploaded
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:56.620]   half a million newsreel clips to YouTube.
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:57.620]   With ads?
[01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:58.860]   Well, who cares?
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:00.140]   I hope-- I don't care.
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:01.140]   Yeah.
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:02.780]   Make some money.
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:03.780]   That's amazing.
[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:05.740]   There's your British movie tones.
[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:09.060]   Here's the Prince of Wales at the Rio Carnival.
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:15.460]   I mean, just crazy stuff.
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:20.420]   Prince Charles came to the Rio Carnival expecting to see beautifully dressed there as the
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:21.420]   ad.
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:23.420]   Wow, it's a big one, isn't it?
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:24.420]   Wow.
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:25.420]   That's all right.
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.420]   I don't want it.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:27.420]   I mean, this stuff is great.
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:28.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:30.420]   From a nostalgic point of view, I think it's fantastic.
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:32.420]   I've had the history point of YouTube.
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:33.420]   Yeah.
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:35.420]   You've got the Hindenburg there and whatnot.
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:36.420]   Yeah.
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:37.420]   Good stuff.
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:42.420]   So, well, let me see which account this is.
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:43.420]   APArchive.
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:44.420]   YouTube.com/APArchive.
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:45.420]   Wow.
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:53.300]   Half a million videos and they're going to put more up there.
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:57.900]   And then the movie tone channel has footage from 1895 to 1986.
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:00.740]   That is pretty cool.
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:02.540]   We live in an interesting time.
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:08.900]   I mean, prior to whatever it was, 1930 or '40 stuff just wasn't recorded.
[01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:13.060]   You can't see Abe Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, but future generations will see everything.
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.060]   They can see everything.
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:17.060]   I think that's neat.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:20.940]   What are we doing?
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:23.260]   How are we doing on time here?
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:25.820]   I'm going to do another ad, but is there anything you guys want to talk about before
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:28.340]   I go to a break?
[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:32.060]   Any story in there that grabs your attention?
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:34.780]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:38.620]   I spent the last week with an Android Auto car.
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:39.620]   Who did?
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:40.620]   Yeah.
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:42.580]   Tell us about that.
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:44.580]   The Hyundai Sonata.
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:49.740]   I turned in my 8500 word review today.
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:52.420]   My editors are dealing with that.
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:54.140]   But there's lots of neat stuff.
[01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:57.700]   You're replacing John Syracuse, aren't you?
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:58.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:17:59.700]   No, for real.
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:01.180]   He's like my idol.
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:04.060]   I try to live up to that level of...
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:05.060]   Detail.
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:06.060]   In-depth.
[01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:07.060]   Yeah, sure.
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:08.060]   You're obsessive detail.
[01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:10.580]   So it's like some of it's weird, man.
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:16.340]   So Hyundai Sonata, and they've kind of passed this car out to everybody.
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:21.540]   And while you can run Android Auto on your phone and beam it to the car interface, just
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:22.540]   like...
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:24.620]   It's just like CarPlay, I guess.
[01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:31.580]   But the Hyundai Sonata itself runs Android, which I guess nobody else figured out.
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:36.460]   So like the stock infotainment system that you get from Hyundai is built on Android and
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:40.100]   does anybody want to guess what version of Android they're using?
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:42.300]   Oh, it ain't Gingerbread, I hope.
[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:43.860]   Better not though.
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:44.860]   Good call.
[01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:46.900]   It is Android 2.3 Gingerbread.
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:47.900]   No!
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:48.900]   What?
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:49.900]   No!
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:50.900]   So...
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:56.340]   Like one of the reasons we need these CarPlay and Android Auto is just these car companies
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:57.340]   don't...
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:59.540]   They're not good at making software.
[01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:01.180]   It's not even that.
[01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:02.740]   They are on a different time frame.
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:08.260]   They're on a geologic time scale, not on a Silicon Valley time scale.
[01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:13.060]   Top to bottom, the built-in infotainment system is a 2011 smartphone.
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:14.500]   You know, it runs Gingerbread.
[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:17.020]   The screen is 480 by 800.
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:22.300]   The processor is a single core, 1 gigahertz free scale processor.
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:24.420]   So it's basically a Motorola Droid.
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:26.540]   It's like eight inches across from 2011.
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:30.260]   And yet it's probably light years ahead of what the Hyundai used last year.
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:31.420]   Yeah, probably.
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:35.500]   But like it's a 2015 car, but you...
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:38.020]   When you turn on Android Auto though, everything just kind of...
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:41.500]   It's like welcome back to 2015.
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:42.820]   You know, step back into the '17s.
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:48.540]   I thought that the goal of both Android Auto and CarPlay was to take the smarts from my
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:54.980]   current phone and make that be the system in the car, as opposed to having the car having
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:58.660]   its own system.
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:04.260]   It's basically an app that runs on top of the existing infotainment system.
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:07.980]   So I can't use the apps on my current phone.
[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.140]   I have to use...
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:11.380]   I'm confused.
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:16.900]   No, it uses Android Auto on the car is an application.
[01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:21.020]   So you press the Android Auto icon and you launch into this new interface.
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:25.740]   It's a lot like Windows 8, where you have this old legacy interface and then you have
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:31.020]   this new interface on top of it that isn't as future complete.
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:33.380]   So you kind of end up hopping from one to the other.
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:37.060]   So Android Auto like phone and music and...
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:38.860]   Massaging maybe?
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:40.940]   Yeah, messaging and...
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:41.940]   Uh oh.
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:44.100]   Quick, get out of the house.
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:46.180]   RoboCop is arriving.
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:47.180]   What the hell is that?
[01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:48.180]   And...
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:49.180]   Fire smoke a lot?
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:50.180]   I think...
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:51.180]   Huh?
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:54.340]   I think your home is too automated now Kevin.
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:55.660]   Are you on fire Kevin?
[01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:57.660]   The home has reached sentience.
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:59.860]   It's coming for you.
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:03.260]   Alright.
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:04.260]   So let me...
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.860]   Now I'm really curious what you're saying Ron.
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:08.020]   So okay, I...
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:11.620]   In my Mustang, it was running Microsoft car.
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.740]   It probably had a really old slow processor.
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:14.900]   It probably had no memory.
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:17.100]   It certainly had slow storage.
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:18.100]   It ran software.
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.580]   You turn on the car, it boots up and now I've got maps.
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:21.980]   I've got different stuff.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:24.460]   Control the air conditioning.
[01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:31.260]   And as we've learned, I can also cause the car to die or break.
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:36.660]   This sounds like they're just updating that system with an Android OS.
[01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:38.620]   Is that not the case?
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:42.100]   Um, no, I mean you have to use in terms of...
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:43.100]   So there's two different systems.
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:45.580]   There's a stock infotainment system that you get with the car.
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:46.580]   Yeah.
[01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:47.580]   And then there's Android Auto.
[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:50.300]   And the stock infotainment system needs some kind of operating system.
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:52.300]   And it's just coincidence that they used Android.
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:53.300]   Oh.
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:59.420]   Android Auto runs on your phone and treats the car dashboard screen as like a computer
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:00.420]   monitor.
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:01.420]   That's what I...
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:02.420]   Yeah.
[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:05.020]   And that's what you want because that's going to be more up to date.
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.100]   Yes.
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:12.620]   But it doesn't control lots of things you want it to control because it's just on your phone.
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:15.220]   So you can't adjust the screen brightness.
[01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:19.540]   You can't mess with the air conditioner.
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:23.940]   There's all sorts of things that you need the stock infotainment system for that Android
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:25.700]   Auto can't do.
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:27.940]   And to me, Google has always...
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:31.500]   With Android, they've always been in the business of making operating systems.
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.060]   And Android Auto is not an operating system.
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:39.500]   It's just like an app that runs other apps that live on your car screen.
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:43.060]   So it's weird that they have this...
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:44.420]   They're already using Android.
[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:48.460]   And I wish Google would just make a version of Android that would just take over the whole
[01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:55.540]   car and wouldn't just be a thing that runs on top of an existing crusty old operating system.
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:23:02.020]   So I could listen though, I could put Pandora on my phone and then using that app on the
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:05.220]   car system, listen to my Pandora music from my phone.
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:06.220]   Right.
[01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:11.300]   Some Pandora specifically, apps need to be specifically written to work with Android
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:12.300]   Auto.
[01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:18.260]   Right now there are 17 total apps that you can download, including Google's.
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:20.580]   So there's not a ton.
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:22.420]   But they did...
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:24.220]   These developers can all add compatibility.
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.220]   It's pretty easy.
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.300]   You have to bug them to do so.
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:31.900]   And then yeah, you can switch from Pandora to SoundCloud to Google Music to Spotify to
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:36.060]   whatever you want, assuming all of those people get their apps updated.
[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:37.980]   Is there ways in there?
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:39.700]   No, just Google Maps.
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:40.700]   Just Google Maps.
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:44.460]   Yeah, because ways is the first thing you'd want to be able to do, isn't it?
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:46.660]   But Google Maps pulls in ways...
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:47.940]   Some in ways information.
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:48.940]   Some other data.
[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:53.060]   Oh, the really sad thing is the way developers are locked down.
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:58.180]   So because of all the safety restrictions, developers can only make two kinds of apps,
[01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:00.220]   messaging apps and music apps.
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:02.220]   And they don't even get control of the interface.
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:05.860]   They can plug into Google's existing interface template.
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:06.860]   And that's it.
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:12.900]   So a big part of the smartphone revolution was all of this innovation from third party
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:14.540]   app developers.
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:17.980]   And you're never going to see that on Android Auto because it's all...
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:21.540]   Well, the safety people say that you can only have this...
[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:22.700]   Well, I understand that.
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:26.300]   You don't want people face-booking from their center console and things like that.
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:30.780]   Right, but if you wanted to do something like a sports car app that shows you lap times
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:34.900]   and zero to 60 times and stuff like that, you'll never have that.
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:38.980]   You'll never have an app that finds the cheapest gas station and directs.
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:39.980]   Really?
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:41.700]   No, because it's only...
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:45.060]   Google has an innovation monopoly on the platform.
[01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:47.260]   It's apps do this and this and this and this.
[01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:50.060]   And third party developers can't add new features.
[01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:54.940]   You can plug in and send us your audio stream and we'll stick it in the music play.
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:55.940]   That's it.
[01:24:55.940 --> 01:24:57.380]   And that's for safety reasons.
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:58.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:00.500]   Because some of it's...
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:05.500]   They worked with the national highways, and there's all sorts of laws and stuff like that.
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:06.500]   But the thing safety...
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:10.140]   So Apple's solution will probably be similarly hobbled.
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:12.300]   Yeah, I haven't tried CarPlay yet.
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:13.300]   I want to.
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:18.340]   But yeah, I mean, there's a constant debate about what isn't safe, I guess, behind the
[01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:19.340]   wheel of the car.
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:20.340]   And it's like...
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:25.220]   That's okay, because I can just pull out my smartphone and I can do whatever I want to
[01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:26.620]   do while I'm driving.
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:30.180]   Right, if you make it too safe, people will just stop using.
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:31.180]   Right.
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:34.820]   So I mean, you have to strike the balance between functionality and safety.
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:37.140]   And it's weird.
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:41.180]   From a security standpoint, I would have hoped that they had gone with a newer version of
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:42.180]   Android.
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.180]   No kidding.
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:45.100]   And I bring that up only because just...
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:48.140]   Was it earlier this week or last week?
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:52.460]   And hackers took over a Jeep Cherokee, there's a big wire article, and you know, cut the
[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:56.140]   brakes and cut the transmission when the guy was going 60 miles an hour.
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:26:00.180]   I mean, I know that this is really a walled off, very sandbox type of...
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:01.180]   That's the case.
[01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:02.180]   That's precisely the problem.
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:03.780]   And we talked about this on security now.
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:05.300]   We've done it several times.
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:08.460]   Is that most cars use Canbus as a...
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:13.260]   They have a single Canbus in the car that connects everything, the entertainment system,
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:17.140]   along with the car's own computer systems.
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:24.660]   And so because they're all on the same network, I mean, it's very difficult to keep one from
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:26.180]   affecting the other.
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:31.940]   So if you can hack the media system, which is what happened in this case, in fact, they
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:36.260]   hacked it in such a way that you could do it remotely because these cars, these particular
[01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:41.660]   cars in many cars nowadays, were on a cell network, they're on the Sprint network.
[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:48.340]   So you can hack the car to know exactly where it is, where its IP address is, and then where
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:53.220]   it is in location, and then you can start messing with it.
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:55.980]   Yeah, I was shocked when I found out it was Android.
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:59.860]   I was sure it would be like QNX or Linux or some...
[01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:02.180]   And some car manufacturers are using QNX.
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:04.220]   I know how to use.
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:09.460]   But that doesn't solve the problem necessarily because you still got this common bus.
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:10.460]   Right.
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:14.260]   I took a system dump of the car once I found out it was Android.
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:15.740]   So I have a copy of this.
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:16.740]   Did you really?
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:18.740]   Yeah, and maybe because...
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:23.420]   That seems like a bad thing on the face of it.
[01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:28.060]   What people have always wanted to do is run Android Auto on devices that they have, because
[01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:34.220]   right now you need to either gut your car or buy a brand new car.
[01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:40.060]   And since the part of it that lives on the car is called the Android receiver, the Android
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:41.420]   Auto receiver library.
[01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:45.900]   So somewhere in the system dump is like that file, and I'm hoping someone smart could figure
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:51.300]   out what to do with it and you know how to make it run on a cell phone or something.
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:52.300]   Which would be neat.
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.900]   Yeah, if you really like gingerbread.
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:56.340]   No, no, no.
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:28:00.780]   It's just like Android Auto lives on your phone, but there's special code in the car that kicks
[01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:02.220]   it over in an Android Auto mode.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:07.220]   Well in that reason, another issue, how long before somebody's hacked it to remove limitations?
[01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:08.220]   Yeah, right.
[01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:11.220]   And I don't know, maybe that'll be nice.
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:16.060]   The text messaging interface is horrible on this.
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:20.260]   They don't display any text at all, so you just get a text message and you press on the
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:23.500]   thing that says new text message and it reads it to you.
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:28.460]   And when you don't have context for a text message, when you press on it and it's like,
[01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:29.460]   "Okay."
[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:30.460]   And like that was the entire...
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:32.460]   It's not very helpful.
[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:33.460]   Right.
[01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:36.980]   What was I talking to this person about?
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:42.580]   And my favorite thing is if you get a URL, there is no special handling.
[01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:44.980]   HTTP colon slash slash.
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:48.860]   It will be an outlet in its entire period.
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:51.340]   So it makes you like hesitant to press the message.
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:55.180]   Like, "Oh God, is it just going to read letters for the next like two hours?"
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:56.180]   Yeah.
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:57.180]   Wow.
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:02.340]   But I mean, car infotainment systems are a very, very low bar.
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:06.260]   So once you get any of the smartphone era stuff on your dashboard, you're just like,
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:07.820]   "Oh my God, it's so much better."
[01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:08.820]   Yeah.
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:09.820]   Yeah.
[01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:12.980]   It's a little buggy, but as a first-gen product, it's really great.
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:16.740]   Well, it just shows you how three or four years ago Silicon Valley was so far ahead of...
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:17.740]   I mean, these...
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:22.980]   I don't know what the design timeframe is for cars these days, but it could be years.
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:23.980]   Three, four years.
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:24.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:26.580]   Between design and release.
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:30.620]   So of course, you know, gingerbread was probably current when they designed it.
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:33.700]   I'm sure it was.
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:36.860]   Google Plus is taking photos out August 1st.
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:41.740]   You will be compelled to use Google's new photos app or Picasa of all things.
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:43.940]   It's still around.
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:45.580]   What is going on with Google Plus?
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:50.700]   Are we slowly seeing it being torn a sundur bit by bit?
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:53.940]   I think it gets back to what we were talking about earlier in the show.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:55.580]   Google's trying to do a lot of different things.
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:30:04.020]   A lot of people working on ways to make things better and just see confusion rather than anything
[01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:05.260]   else in the strategy.
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:07.660]   I'm disappointed to see this happen to be quite honest.
[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:08.620]   I loved Google Plus.
[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:13.580]   Do you guys feel like Google Plus is less than it used to be?
[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:18.620]   I'm probably using it less because there's not a lot of great tools.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:22.140]   So like on Twitter, I can automatically have my articles posted and I've got...
[01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:26.740]   I keep looking up because that's where tweet deck is and there's 10,000 columns of people
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:27.900]   saying stuff.
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:29.380]   With Google Plus, it's just a web page.
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:33.780]   So it's hard to keep track of and use and stuff like that.
[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:37.860]   It's less useful because of how close off it is, which is weird for a Google thing.
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:40.420]   Usually they're not so kind of insulated.
[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:41.740]   No, don't touch our stuff.
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:42.740]   Don't have an API.
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:44.900]   Don't do any of that.
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:49.900]   I still find the most valuable engagement there on Google Plus, though, out of all the
[01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:50.900]   networks.
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:53.860]   Everybody's experience is obviously going to be different.
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:58.860]   But for the type of things I talk about and share and want to read about, great engagement.
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:01.060]   Yeah, the comments are great.
[01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:06.700]   It's nice being able to do more than 180 characters or however much it is because I'm
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:09.140]   worthy, I guess.
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:12.180]   But it's just harder to use.
[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:13.260]   It's nicer.
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.740]   I love the community.
[01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:17.220]   But the interface is tough to use.
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:21.460]   And it seems like it's only going to get worse as Google abandons it more and more and more
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:23.860]   as they kind of scale back.
[01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:27.260]   Like I guess they wanted to brute force their way in a social buy building Google Plus and
[01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:28.540]   everything else.
[01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:30.300]   And they decided that's a bad idea.
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:33.900]   And now they're just stripping it out of everything slowly.
[01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:35.860]   And it's painful.
[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:37.660]   Mm hmm.
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:40.700]   Oh, see what else?
[01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:43.300]   Did you see the tweets from Erica Joy?
[01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:44.300]   I know you did.
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:46.180]   Of course, because you follow all of this.
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:54.540]   She was an employee, was an employee at Google and Erica Baker, I'm sorry, and made a spreadsheet
[01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:58.260]   which she shared containing salary information.
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:00.860]   She says it's spread like wildfire.
[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:03.980]   She's in a series of tweets on Twitter a couple of days ago.
[01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:04.980]   Spread like wildfire.
[01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:07.780]   Before I left, she's now at Slack.
[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:14.660]   Before I left about 5% of Googlers had shared their salary on that sheet.
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:18.620]   The last four got equitable pay based on data and the sheet she wrote.
[01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:22.060]   The world didn't end everything didn't go up in flames because salary got shared.
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:23.820]   However, her manager didn't like it.
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:29.180]   She had to point out to her manager that it was illegal for the manager to punish an
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:31.700]   employee for sharing salary data.
[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:33.300]   That's protected speech.
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:40.060]   However, apparently, I didn't know this, but Google has a little personal bonusing feature.
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:45.900]   Any employee at Google can bonus any other employee 150 bucks just because they did a
[01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:48.660]   good job, a little good job bonus.
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:53.180]   Her manager was blocking those, preventing her from receiving.
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:59.060]   She says as many as seven different bonuses from other Googlers.
[01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:03.260]   She said one got through because it was so vaguely worded.
[01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:06.700]   Kind of an interesting story.
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:11.140]   I wonder how big all of those numbers were.
[01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:12.140]   Yeah.
[01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:14.860]   The spreadsheet, I guess the spreadsheet might be public.
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:17.340]   I don't know if the spreadsheet is public if you can.
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:18.340]   I didn't see it.
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:20.140]   I looked for it briefly when I saw the story.
[01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:21.740]   I was obviously curious.
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:27.900]   I mean, it wasn't so much to see how big the numbers were, but to see what the disparity
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:32.540]   was perhaps between people basically do the same job or have the same title.
[01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:37.460]   She said other Googlers started creating pivot tables to show how that was in fact happening,
[01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:41.820]   that some people were not getting paid appropriately.
[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:46.180]   It's Google's unquenchable thirst for data turned on itself on the management.
[01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:47.180]   Yeah.
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:48.380]   You just release all of this to your employees.
[01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:49.380]   Yeah.
[01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:51.900]   I'm sure they had all sorts of tables and charts and everything else.
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:55.340]   It was really an interesting thing.
[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:59.220]   She's talking about it now because she no longer works at Google, but she sounds like she's
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:07.020]   a little reluctant to be too public about this until after she left.
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:08.660]   The peer bonus is not going through.
[01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:12.980]   It was not so good.
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:15.780]   All right.
[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:17.860]   Let's see.
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:19.340]   Congratulations to Jason Howell.
[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:20.500]   He's on vacation, by the way.
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:25.060]   Jason Clanthes has been producing my shows for the last few days.
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:28.300]   I think Brian Burnett is a TD-ing as he is.
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:29.300]   That's correct.
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:34.740]   But Jason managed to nevertheless get into the world's attention with this post he put
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:40.060]   on Instagram, Jason's up in the mountains somewhere, but he posted a picture and he
[01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:44.740]   found it at his parents' house of him and kindergarten, wearing apparently a t-shirt
[01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:48.100]   featuring the Playboy logo.
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:51.100]   And it made it two awkward family photos.
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:53.220]   Congratulations, Jason.
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:58.220]   You're a winner.
[01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:59.220]   That's really cute.
[01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:00.540]   I like the picture of Jason.
[01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:01.540]   He's a cuteie.
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:02.540]   That's great.
[01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:03.540]   Boy, Jason.
[01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:05.260]   We're going to take a break.
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:11.380]   If you gentlemen have some suggestions, tips or picks, inside information you'd like to
[01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:13.500]   share with us, we can do that in just a second.
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:17.700]   But first a word from ziprecruiter.com.
[01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:21.140]   If you're hiring, ZipRecruiter can make it a lot easier.
[01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:25.660]   Now we all knew, of course, that the internet has changed hiring.
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:29.780]   I mean, these job boards make it a lot easier to both look for work and to look for an
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:30.940]   employee.
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:36.020]   But how do you know which job board's the right for you and the job that you're posting?
[01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:37.260]   ZipRecruiter simplifies it.
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:43.180]   You post to 100 plus job boards with a single click of the mouse plus social networks like
[01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:45.060]   Twitter and Facebook.
[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:47.540]   It is so slick.
[01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:53.820]   And as soon as you post, you're able to scan through four million current resumes.
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:58.060]   You've been submitted to ZipRecruiter by people who are looking for work.
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:00.020]   And the beauty part is you're not going to get phone calls.
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:04.180]   You're not going to get emails in your inbox because ZipRecruiter's interface handles it
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:05.180]   all.
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:09.180]   You can quickly screen rate and hire.
[01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:12.780]   Within 24 hours, you'll have candidates rolling into ZipRecruiter's easy interface.
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:18.900]   No one or more than 400,000 companies, including TWIT, you ZipRecruiter.
[01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:20.740]   Melinda sent us an email.
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:25.180]   She says, "We've received several highly qualified candidates from ZipRecruiter.
[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:28.300]   So happy our company signed up with them.
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:29.660]   We're excited to see what comes next.
[01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:32.620]   Thanks you so much for your customer help line also.
[01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:33.620]   It's so very helpful.
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:35.260]   Well, thank you for your email.
[01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:36.260]   That's nice.

[01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:02.620]   Love him.
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:08.220]   His work at Gigalm, you were part of that, geez, that whole explosion there, the implosion
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:09.300]   of Gigalm.
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:14.140]   I was actually, because I'm based in Pennsylvania, but I was actually at the office that day
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:15.140]   for the...
[01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:16.140]   Yeah, I was.
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:18.860]   I was in San Francisco for the Apple Watch event.
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:19.860]   Yeah.
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:21.980]   Yeah, that was the last story filed, wasn't it?
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:23.220]   The Apple Watch event.
[01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:24.220]   It was.
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:26.140]   It was the last story filed was mine.
[01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:27.140]   It's still there.
[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:28.860]   That's kind of nice.
[01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:30.500]   So the site didn't go down?
[01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:33.060]   No, the site did not go down.
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:38.740]   And the site has actually been purchased and is supposed to relaunch in August.
[01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:44.140]   Knowingly has purchased the company or the assets of the blog that is.
[01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:48.540]   But they're not going to rehire the staff.
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:49.540]   Not to my knowledge.
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:50.540]   Yeah.
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:51.540]   Not to my knowledge.
[01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:52.620]   But everybody seems like they've landed well.
[01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:56.940]   I know a number of folks went, including Matthew Ingram, went to Fortune.
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:57.940]   Yes.
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:02.300]   So I'm glad that I've seen Janko's work in Variety now.
[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:03.300]   Mm-hmm.
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:04.820]   And of course, you're at ZeeDinette.
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:06.220]   So I think that's great.
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:07.220]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:12.660]   I mean, that's the best possible outcome is to see all of your colleagues land a job.
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:13.660]   And it's interesting.
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:17.780]   We had such a great group that we still talk almost every day as it is.
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:19.860]   Oh, that's just three, four months later.
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:20.860]   So.
[01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:22.940]   Well, that's how this has have Twitch started.
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:28.340]   After this after tech TV fell apart, I still wanted to talk to all my colleagues.
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:33.620]   And if you have an organization with great people, it's inevitable that, you know, they
[01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:35.780]   land on their feet, I think.
[01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:38.220]   So and boy Gigome had the best team ever.
[01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:39.220]   Just to be with us.
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:40.220]   It was nice.
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:41.220]   It was nice.
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:42.220]   Yeah.
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:44.900]   And you had TIP or Trik or Tull, you'd like to share with us?
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:51.140]   Well, the last time I was here, you and I talked a lot about my passion of the Beatles.
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:52.460]   Yes, which I share.
[01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:54.060]   Yes, which I know you share.
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:56.180]   So this time around, I didn't bring a tech tip.
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:01.100]   I brought a podcast that I hope you have never heard because if you haven't, you are
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:02.260]   in for treat.
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:09.180]   So if you or anybody else enjoys the Beatles, I would look at alphabetical.com and it is
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:16.980]   for gentlemen who do one podcast per Beatles song and alphabetical order.
[01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:18.620]   They are in the L's now.
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:23.340]   So they've been doing this for months and months and just a lot of great insights to
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:28.500]   what was going on at the time and maybe some interesting facts about the about the song.
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:29.500]   I love that idea.
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:32.980]   Lady Madonna, there was only one day of the week that wasn't mentioned and turns out it
[01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:33.980]   was Saturday.
[01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:35.540]   I did not know that until I heard that episode.
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:36.540]   No.
[01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:40.420]   Well, I mean, you really have to be a Beatles diehard obviously, but it's just it's just
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:47.620]   an interesting approach to a podcast on a topic and the same group of guys, they do
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:52.580]   another podcast about the Star Wars movies where they literally each episode.
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:59.380]   They talk about one single minute of all and then the next podcast is the next minute
[01:39:59.380 --> 01:40:00.380]   of that movie.
[01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:01.380]   Okay.
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:02.380]   I was going to say the sounds just like that.
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:03.380]   But it's the same people.
[01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:04.380]   Star Wars minute.
[01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:05.380]   Exactly.
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:06.380]   It's the same.
[01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:07.380]   It's the same people.
[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:12.860]   So there's two good podcasts to listen to that you can really learn a lot of cool things
[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:13.860]   and insights about.
[01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:17.380]   I'm willing to say this is what podcasts are invented to do.
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:18.380]   Absolutely.
[01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:20.020]   Yeah, that is awesome.
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:24.300]   Just obsessive passionate fandom.
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:25.300]   Nice.
[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:31.900]   It's the alphabetical ALPHA BEATICLE or CAL.
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:32.900]   Yes.
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:41.840]   Oh, yeah, of course, AL like alphabetical with a beat in a B in no, alpha be with an
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.700]   EA stuck in the middle.
[01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:44.700]   Yes.
[01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:45.700]   Okay.
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:48.300]   I like it.
[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:51.260]   Ron Amadio ours.
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:52.260]   Technica.
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:57.060]   We're waiting for your 8500 Ward review of Android car.
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:58.060]   Yes.
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:40:59.300]   I hear that's coming Friday.
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:00.700]   Maybe as we wait.
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:03.300]   You got anything else to share with us?
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:06.540]   No, not a thing.
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:07.540]   I don't know.
[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:08.540]   Jason's off.
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:10.900]   I would get an email that says, Hey, think about this.
[01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:12.100]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:13.900]   We didn't mean to jump you on that.
[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:14.900]   Sorry.
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:15.900]   I don't know.
[01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:16.900]   I'm I'm I'm excited.
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:21.580]   You gave us one already, which is the cool thing in the maps that shows your timeline.
[01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:25.780]   So I think I'm going to let you off the hook for that one.
[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:26.980]   There's a Hearthstone expansion.
[01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:29.180]   They announced, wow, we're on the air.
[01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:30.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:31.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:32.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:33.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:34.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:35.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:36.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:37.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:38.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:39.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:40.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:41.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:42.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:43.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:44.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:45.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:46.180]   I don't know.
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:49.700]   I don't understand why you play a card game with a computer to me.
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:52.220]   I mean, I feel like don't you want to.
[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:55.180]   Is there is a possibly Hearthstone as a card game?
[01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:56.980]   No, I'm sure.
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:00.140]   Yeah, I think people have made physical physical cards, but no man.
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:03.180]   Like you put a card down on like the whole screen shakes and catches fire.
[01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:04.180]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:07.940]   And you know, they have all sorts of weird mechanics that wouldn't work in a real card
[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:08.940]   game.
[01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:09.940]   That makes sense.
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:10.940]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:13.780]   And you know, they constantly release new stuff.
[01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:16.260]   Were you a world of Warcraft fanatic?
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:23.100]   Yeah, I was just going to say it's Warcraft, which I've always been super addicted to.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:25.940]   So actually, this is how I would do it is watching YouTube videos.
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:26.940]   I think you're right.
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:30.220]   Because I don't want to it's strategically so complicated.
[01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:32.380]   I just want to watch somebody play.
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:33.380]   Right.
[01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:35.380]   Yeah, but you know, you learn about it.
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:36.380]   I guess you do.
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:37.860]   Who am I to mock you?
[01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:39.940]   I watch chess tournaments on TV.
[01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:43.180]   Well, the worst is they're doing out.
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:45.820]   They're going to do a Warcraft movie now live action.
[01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:50.820]   It's like, you know, humans versus orcs and they're going to try to film this.
[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:52.540]   And I don't know.
[01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:54.620]   Did they never see the Halo movie then?
[01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:59.020]   Yeah, more video game movies that are going to be so incredibly awful.
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:02.740]   I don't think we've seen the end of this trend either, frankly.
[01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:05.420]   Well, I shared my Google Fi.
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:07.620]   So I think I've shared something as well.
[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:10.900]   So I think we can wrap this puppy up is what I think.
[01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:12.300]   I want to thank you both for being here.
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:13.300]   I appreciate it.
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:14.300]   Will Jeff be back next week?
[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:16.740]   I'm sure he'll be back from his travels by then.
[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:17.740]   Yeah.
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:22.780]   So we'll and maybe we're getting close to the time when Gina Trappani stops by two every
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:23.780]   month.
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:25.340]   So we'll find out next week.
[01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:29.500]   We do this week in Google, of course, every Wednesday, right after Windows Weekly.
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:30.820]   That's round about one.
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:38.940]   I'm going to say 1.30 p.m. Pacific for 30 Eastern time 2030 UTC Wednesdays on twit.tv.
[01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:39.940]   Please watch live.
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:44.700]   Join us in the chat room if you can, but if you can't, we can make on demand versions
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:48.380]   available reluctantly, but OK, audio and video available.
[01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:49.380]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:53.740]   In fact, that's how most of most of you listen twig.twit.tv/twig.
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:56.820]   Or wherever you get your podcasts.
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:59.380]   Thanks to Brian Burnett for filling in on the board.
[01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:02.740]   Thanks to Jason Klyantis for filling in for Jason Howell.
[01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:03.940]   Where's your Playboy t-shirt?
[01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:06.260]   You need to have it if you're going to really fill in for Jason.
[01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:09.420]   You have to have a Playboy t-shirt.
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:10.420]   And be seven years old.
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:11.420]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:13.420]   We'll see you next time on this week in Google.
[01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:14.420]   Bye bye, everybody.
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:17.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
