[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.100]   The whole gang's here, Stacey Higabotham's back,
[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.800]   Aunt Pruitt's back, Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.640]   A little bit more about Elon Musk.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.620]   Turns out his whole plan is just to flip Twitter
[00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.000]   in a couple of years.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.680]   We'll also talk about working from home
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.600]   versus working in the office,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.240]   and why ARB and B's new policy is great.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.080]   A look at internet access from T-Mobile and Verizon.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.040]   They've got it in for Comcast,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.000]   and the origin of the word sneeze.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.120]   It may surprise you.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.320]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.880]   Podcasts you love.

[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.240]   - I miss y'all, but I'm glad to be back today.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.600]   - I love your red coral necklace.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.160]   - Oh, I'm trying to spice it up.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.000]   Ta-da!
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.160]   - It does look like little tiny spice chilies,
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.000]   but it's not.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.400]   I can tell it's coral, right?
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   - It is coral.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.640]   It does like little chilies.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.480]   That's nice. - Great.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.760]   Glenn Fleischman, your neighbor,
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.840]   filled in for you last week.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.680]   - Thanks, Glenn.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.440]   - It was fun having me. - Lots of typography talk.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.280]   - Yeah.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.720]   Who boy, you didn't miss a thing?
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.280]   (laughing)
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.080]   Hey, it's back to it, prove it.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.320]   We missed you too.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.160]   - Oh, thank you.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.440]   - It was a tough show with no and no Stacey,
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.040]   twit.tv/hop.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.880]   - That's right.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.840]   - He was going around the other day,
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.520]   taking 8K videos of people.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.000]   - Beautiful 8K from the cabin.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.280]   - Think of the bags in a mys, look at that bad.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.000]   - Is there sure do on the 8K though?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.200]   Well, that's what it is. - You look much better
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.640]   on this particular. - In today, in 720.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.480]   - Yeah.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.920]   - And whatever we're in here.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.880]   - Let's stay with 720P.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.160]   - Hey, we put it in the slack,
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.000]   and we're gonna upgrade the cameras here.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.440]   - Not 8K, please.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.560]   - It's official. - Oh my God.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.520]   - We wanna see what Leo would look like
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.440]   after the zombie apocalypse.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.440]   - Yes. - And possibly when he's,
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.600]   I'm gonna go with near death from a lung infection.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.120]   - Yes. - That's what I look like.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.600]   - Exactly.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.240]   Also from the beautiful New Jersey,
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.680]   the Leonard Taill Professor for journalistic innovation
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.480]   at the Craig.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.880]   (audience cheering)
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.960]   - New Mark Graduate School of Journalism
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.840]   at the City University of New York.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.160]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.920]   - And I want credit for having a product line on the show.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.960]   - I love to spot his book.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.720]   - Oh, London Curney. - Oh, okay.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.960]   - Little book about a, let's say,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.760]   a typographical tour of London.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.080]   - Oh, how fun.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.880]   - He is so nerdy.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.720]   - Oh, yeah. - Actually,
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.560]   we're gonna have him back.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.000]   I think he's gonna be on Twitter in a few weeks
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.440]   'cause I'd never met him.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.880]   - Oh, he's really kind.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.200]   When I first started out as a journalist working,
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.800]   like in the tech press,
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.400]   he reached out for something,
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.920]   or he commented on one of my posts.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.160]   He did, he knew a lot of wireless stuff.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.840]   And I was gonna be in Seattle and I was like,
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.280]   hey man, you wanna meet up?
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.960]   And he just was so kind.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.000]   He walked me through some technology stuff.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.120]   I mean, just a genuinely nice person.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.880]   - Yeah, most of us, I guess she's saying, but yeah.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.960]   - No, but I agree.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.800]   - No, no.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.040]   - Niceer than you and me, that's for sure, Jeff.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.880]   - Yeah.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.720]   - He was really great.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.560]   We had a great time.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.800]   We were talking about phones.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.240]   - He's meant for the Twitter network, yes.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.080]   - Yeah.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.720]   - But don't steal him from Twig.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.920]   - No, no, well, he--
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.320]   - He could be other grown-up table.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.160]   - He could be another show too.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.000]   - Yeah.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.480]   - Hey, hey, I personally think this show
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.680]   is the grown-up table.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.160]   - I agree with anyone else.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.000]   - I agree with you.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.840]   - Thank you.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.680]   - This is where the grown-up table--
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.920]   - This is where we talk about the boring things.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.760]   - You don't see me.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.600]   - This is what you're saying, yes.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.680]   - On Sunday night, you're only gonna catch on--
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.920]   - Well, we could change that actually.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.600]   Have you ever done Twig Stacy?
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.440]   - Yes.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.280]   - Especially yes, right?
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.120]   - I've done it once.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.240]   I say no.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.000]   - You say no, 'cause I hope we ask you, 'cause--
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.520]   - Oh yeah, no, no, I--
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.360]   - But that's, I'm like, I choose this table.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.200]   It's the table table.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.400]   - Well, you can't do it this Sunday, it's Mother's Day.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.720]   So I won't let you--
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.800]   - I'm actually working, I'll be at a conference.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.640]   - Really?
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.480]   - Oh.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.560]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.400]   - You gotta--
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.600]   - Going back to a lot of conferences all of a sudden,
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.040]   now that things have opened up--
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.880]   - Miracles now.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.720]   - I'm busy.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.520]   - It is possible I am vaccinated, I'm triple vaxxed,
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.920]   I'm gonna get quadruple vax, but I'm waiting.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.760]   I don't know when to get it.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.960]   Anyway, bottom line, I'm going to a conference next week.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.800]   - Where's that?
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.920]   - The week after that, the next week is in Vegas.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.760]   - Oh, fun.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.480]   - Siemens realized live, I will be the MC, y'all.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.320]   - Oh, how fun.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.160]   - Really?
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.000]   - Oh, okay.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.840]   - Nice.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.680]   - Big in and dancing.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.160]   - Now Siemens is famous for making skated devices,
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.840]   they're a German hardware company, what is this about though?
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.160]   - This is their OT technology conference,
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.840]   but you know what they also make?
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.960]   Oh wait, I should double check this.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.880]   - Every time I see Siemens, I think about being--
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.200]   - I think they make power on infrastructure.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.720]   - Yeah, they make power on infrastructure,
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.000]   and I think they make the Washington State Fairies.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.360]   - Oh, wow.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.800]   - Yeah, they're one of those like Hyundai--
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.640]   - Glomberates.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.600]   - They're, you know, the Koretzu giant German.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.080]   - Yes, Siemens makes the Washington State Fairies boats.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.920]   - Wow.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.800]   - Possibly other fairies boats, but definitely.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.920]   I just remember walking by the ferry one day
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.000]   and being like, what?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.320]   Siemens here, huh?
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.280]   - So let's see, this looks like fun.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.280]   Siemens realized live, and it's gonna be mostly IoT things, yeah?
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.680]   - Yes, it's industrial IoT.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.200]   My next conference is in Dallas,
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.520]   which is less of an exciting place,
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.960]   but the conference is gonna be more exciting.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.800]   It's gonna be about smart homes.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.080]   - Oh, wow.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.920]   - Matter?
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.640]   - Does he have mom and dad?
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.560]   - No, mom and dad live in Houston.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.760]   - Look, there she is.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.600]   - That's Texas.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.880]   - Right there in the speaker section.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.080]   Look at that, host moderator.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   - How fun.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.680]   - Mrs. Higginbach.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.520]   - Ooh. - I got it.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.920]   Oh, look at where it's the same necklace.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.920]   (both laughing)
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.240]   - I want you to talk to the head of strategic partners
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.520]   of Red Bull Racing.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.240]   - I'm a, that's the, that's the--
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.960]   - Is that a horn on it?
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.920]   - No, no, it's Zoe Chilton.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.640]   She must work with him,
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.800]   but Red Bull, of course, has the champion.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.960]   - Yeah, stop him.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.320]   - Racing for them.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.160]   - He's pretty good.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.720]   - Yeah, she's 'cause he's so good.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.560]   - Yeah.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.600]   - Anyway, great to have everybody here.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.560]   One of the reasons Stacey wasn't here last week
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.560]   is she did not wanna talk about Twitter.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.400]   I did.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.240]   - It's true.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.760]   I was like, oh, good news.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.600]   - I did.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.120]   - No, I was not bad.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.960]   I forgot to call on your piece that you sent in DM.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.480]   - Oh, I was looking forward to it.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.280]   The Twitter troubles continue with Elon Musk.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.960]   The staff is up in arms as you might imagine.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.600]   Part of the problem is if you take it public,
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.720]   their compensation, which is based on stock,
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.920]   suddenly becomes a little iffy.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.760]   - Private.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.760]   - Elon's-- - Private.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.320]   - Yeah, take it public.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.000]   - You said if you take it public.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.280]   - Vicey versus, yeah.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.640]   Although the reason I was thinking that is 'cause Elon,
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.080]   who's trying to get the rest of the money together,
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:19.920]   has been-- - Yeah, it's like
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.480]   in a couple of years, I'll make it public.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.800]   - He's been reassuring investors.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.520]   Don't worry, we're gonna go public in three years.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.440]   Like, oh, great.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.280]   That's good.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.560]   After what happens, so he's basically saying,
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.120]   yeah, I know, I can't make any money on it,
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.480]   but we're gonna shine it up, polish it up.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.240]   We're gonna sell it back to the stock market.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.080]   And then-- - New kitchen counter.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.000]   - It would be beautiful. - With a lot more.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.320]   He's basically saying he's gonna flip Twitter.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.800]   You nailed it.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.560]   Flipping Twitter.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.880]   - So title.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.480]   - There should be a new-- - Peter Brad,
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.600]   Discovery TV show.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.480]   You know, social media flippers or something.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.320]   - Flipping, so nice.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.920]   (both laughing)
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.840]   - Poor Argo All had to reassure the staff,
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.920]   which who said they, he seems very,
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.280]   very tired and unhappy.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.680]   - Well, I mean, he just got the gig.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.440]   - Well, wait a minute. - The amount of stuff is happening, right?
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.760]   - And he's got a golden parachute,
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.280]   I think $44 million.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.120]   - Oh, shit.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.960]   - Yeah.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.200]   - He's gonna be okay, right? - Yeah, I'm kidding.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.120]   - Would you be sad and tired if you knew in six months?
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.480]   I got $44 million and a lot of time on my hands.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.160]   (both laughing)
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.120]   - A miserable, a miserable.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.120]   - For the most part, he stuck to the script,
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.760]   says platformer, this is Casey Newton's blog.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.400]   This was a simple business deal designed
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.880]   to provide the most benefit to shareholders
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.720]   that one point apologized before, once again,
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.480]   using the word fiduciary.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.040]   - Oh. (both laughing)
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.720]   - Excuse me, but I'm gonna use the word fiduciary again.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.600]   He said, he began by saying,
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.600]   please stop leaking to the press.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.880]   He made a low key effort to rally the troops
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.480]   while acknowledging he had little idea
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.200]   how Musk might change the company.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.440]   Newton writes, we don't know the specifics of change.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.440]   I don't want us to go in believing nothing will change.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.480]   He quotes him.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.440]   Here's the company's current employees to stick around.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.280]   (both laughing)
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:19.280]   - Is it unfair to assume that Musk is going to make
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.560]   that a better business, Twitter a better business?
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.160]   - Some say Musk may lay off more than half the staff
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.000]   in an effort to cut costs.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.280]   But Twitter is a business, right?
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.520]   I know we use it as a social media platform.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.840]   - It's a money-lose deal.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.240]   - Right, so the-
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.320]   - But it actually doesn't lose money, right?
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.760]   - Well, it doesn't make money.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.760]   - Here, I'm gonna have cash money.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.440]   - Well hold on, are they, do they report Twitter?
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.360]   - Well, they're just reported.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.200]   - Project reported.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   - Oh, let's see what the Twitter results are.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.960]   The stock is up to $49, which tells me
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.080]   that market doesn't believe they're gonna get $54 a share
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.920]   from Elon.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:05.280]   The stock, I'm looking for the quarterly results.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.120]   Do you have them somewhere?
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.320]   - Still underperforming.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.520]   - I thought they just released it.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.600]   - I'm looking for it.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.440]   - All right.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.280]   - But I'm very, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.440]   - Let's say it. - Twitter latest filing
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.240]   at Bith's Losing Advertisers on TechCrunch.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.280]   - Okay.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.120]   - May three.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.520]   - Okay, so-
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.440]   - So they're losing advertisers.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.000]   Let's see what else is going on.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.240]   But again, is still a business?
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.400]   What is wrong with someone saying,
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.800]   "Hey, my business is failing
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.040]   and I'm trying to make my business better."
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.960]   So if someone wants to buy this business
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.920]   and make it better and have at it, what's wrong with it?
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.280]   - This is just an SEC filing.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.120]   - It's SEC filing.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.560]   - Yeah, it's not a quarterly result.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.000]   It's core advertising business could now be at risk
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.240]   as a result of Musk's takeover.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.920]   In addition, employee hiring and retention efforts
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.040]   and other factors at risk.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.880]   - Yeah.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.040]   - So it's a business that never historically
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.440]   has made very much money.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.640]   It has a lot of mind share.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.640]   That's the value, right?
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.320]   Is the brand is worth something.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.800]   Employees are upset and possibly leaving
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.720]   for a variety of reasons.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.560]   Partly because-
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.920]   - It has like any other business.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.080]   - Yeah, but you're complaining.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.960]   - Would you spend $44 billion of your money on it?
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.800]   - No, I wouldn't.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.240]   - But what I'm saying is look at like Dell
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.600]   and all of those other companies
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.440]   that they went through some form of a transformation.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.680]   - Yeah, Dell took it better.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.080]   - Took Dell private, yeah.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.200]   - Dell took him private though.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.760]   He took a private with a strategy.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.080]   His strategy was convergence
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.400]   and he's actually implementing that strategy.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.240]   - It's huge.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.840]   - Sorry, thank you.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.240]   Executing on that strategy.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.840]   - Well, it's like Dell is perfectly fine.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.680]   I was just-
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.160]   - No, no, it's okay.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.000]   - It's okay.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.080]   - I was just trying to fill the blank.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.680]   - But your blank was right.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.920]   - My blank is just blank.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.440]   - And by the way, did the same thing
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.880]   because he took a private in 2013
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.560]   and five years later put it back on the stock market.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.520]   - Yeah, that's what you do.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.960]   He basically wanted to take it out of the public.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.880]   Yeah, out of the public eye.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.720]   But I don't feel-
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.480]   - Oh, I see the idea being,
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.540]   "We're gonna put a big sheet over it and fix it
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.540]   and then unveil it."
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.600]   - Flippen, his concern was Wall Street
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.880]   had such short-term thinking
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.200]   that they were not valuing the company's investments properly.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.920]   And I'm sure every CEO thinks that, right?
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.760]   (laughs)
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.720]   I'm sure he did.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.880]   But he actually had a plan in Australia
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.600]   because his whole thing was building out
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.200]   converged computing strategy for cloud infrastructure.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   He actually has done that.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.680]   - I do remember in 2013 when he did that people were saying,
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.920]   "Oh, he's overextended.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.160]   This isn't gonna work.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.480]   This is a really risky move."
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.160]   People were just skeptical.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.000]   - I didn't say that.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.840]   - They were just skeptical.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.480]   - I said that he would do well.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.320]   And you were right.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.640]   - I know exactly what he was doing.
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.480]   - Yeah, you were right.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.320]   - 'Cause we could see it.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.680]   - So Ms. Stacey, is the problem that this is Elon Musk?
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.720]   - Just taking this problem?
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.480]   - Well, people say the same if it were, say,
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.200]   I don't know, what's his name, Buffett?
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.960]   - Elon doesn't seem to have a plan.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.960]   Like Michael Dell came in with a plan that he articulated
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.040]   and had been articulating for months ahead of time.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.480]   And the other thing is, I'll just be honest,
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.480]   Elon Musk does not have the gravitas.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.320]   - Right.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.960]   - And not even this theoretical gravitas.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.720]   This man's like a total,
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.520]   you cannot take him seriously with a lot of things.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.880]   And there's also the fact that he's got
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.880]   multiple other businesses to run.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.960]   And historically, his businesses have not met
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.960]   their deadlines in some of the execution
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.320]   has not been awesome.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.720]   So like, and I drive a Tesla.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.960]   I was excited about Starlink, for example.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:00.880]   I'm not denigrating Elon Musk for being a visionary
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.400]   in lots of things that he does.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.720]   But I also don't think he's the,
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.840]   he's not someone I'm like,
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.280]   oh yeah, that's a guy who's gonna turn around
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.040]   on a struggling social network.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.520]   - Well, it's worse than that.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.360]   He said things that we know are gonna be damaging.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.000]   Take off the moderation that gets it to be finally
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.680]   a decent place, invite back bad people,
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.960]   do things like require identification,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.400]   which hurts the vulnerable.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.480]   - So what about open source indie algorithms?
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.520]   Is that a bad thing?
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.520]   - Yes.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.360]   - Well, what is that?
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.200]   - Silly.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.560]   - Well, first of all, Elon has no idea what open source means
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.880]   because back in the early days of Tesla,
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.960]   he said we're gonna open source our car.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.760]   He did not open source it.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.000]   He just essentially said about, he licensed it.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.520]   So he doesn't understand what open sourcing means.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.400]   But you wouldn't want to, first of all,
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.040]   you probably couldn't open source the algorithm.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.560]   He's saying it's like Coca-Cola.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.400]   It's just the secret recipe.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.400]   It isn't that simple.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.560]   But even if you did, the real beneficiaries of that,
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.600]   in my opinion, and others, is the spammers
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.520]   who would then gain the algorithm.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.000]   It's the same reason Google doesn't tell people
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.200]   how it works, Facebook doesn't tell people how it works
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.880]   'cause all that does is encourage gaming.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.760]   - Gaming in the system.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.600]   - Okay.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.440]   - Yep.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.280]   - There enough.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.120]   - It's a different matter.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.680]   I mean, but a better answer to question,
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.680]   and this is why I keep harping on blue sky
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.680]   because that is a plan that says,
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.640]   let's make Twitter and other social media into a protocol
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.440]   so that people can post wherever they want.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.880]   Hello, Kevin Marks.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.960]   And then we could come along and say,
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.360]   oh, I'm gonna find all the good people
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.000]   talking about cameras.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.120]   I'm gonna find them here and here and here and here.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.200]   And I'm gonna use these criteria
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.800]   and put it together in a new, value added,
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.000]   and social world camera thing, right?
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.920]   Now that's a strategy.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.080]   That's more than just saying, oh, no, no,
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:47.920]   I'm making an open source.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.760]   - Well, it's interesting
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.920]   'cause we talked about that on Sunday,
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.720]   Corey Doctorow and Owen Thomas and Tim Stevens
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.240]   were on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.200]   And Corey said, I asked about blue sky.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.400]   Corey said, it's interesting
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.960]   'cause the way blue sky is structured,
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.400]   Elon does not control it.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.440]   It is already funded so Elon cannot take the funding away.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.520]   And there's no guarantee--
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.800]   - Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.640]   - Yes.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.360]   And there's no guarantee that what blue sky does
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.600]   would end up being under the ages of Twitter anyway.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.720]   - Mm-hmm, yes.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.600]   So blue sky is kind of a, you know,
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.520]   skunkworks R&D project that is really heavy out of,
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.280]   it's a hedge, it's gonna be out of Elon's.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.120]   - Oh, okay.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.560]   - Which is good 'cause blue sky looks to me
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.920]   a lot more like Mastodon.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.400]   We were talking about Federation.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.240]   - Yeah.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.280]   - And Mastodon, which is, we run a Mastodon server,
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.160]   one of thousands, Twitter.social.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.880]   Everybody, so you couldn't steal,
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.920]   you couldn't take Mastodon 'cause you'd have,
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.640]   you know, there's nobody owns it.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.480]   - Right.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.720]   Gene, who does the software,
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.960]   is a, you know, independent software developer in Germany,
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.760]   I guess you could buy him,
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.160]   but the software's open source,
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.480]   the source of a fork got there.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.320]   - They're going.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.320]   - Yeah.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.360]   - And because, this is the beauty of a federated server
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.240]   like blue sky or Mastodon,
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:07.240]   each server owner, me in the case of Twitter.social,
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.080]   decides what goes and what doesn't go.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:09.920]   - Right.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.040]   - And if you don't want to,
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.600]   if there are some servers I don't like on GAB,
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.720]   for instance, runs on Mastodon.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.560]   - Yeah.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.800]   - So I know, I can say,
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.720]   I don't want to see anything from GAB.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.200]   They can moderate it any way they want.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.240]   But if I don't want to see it,
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.400]   I just say in my settings, no GAB.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.240]   And then nobody--
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.440]   - Your users, I sign up for Twitter.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.480]   - No, you could do it in,
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.560]   this was an, I opened it to me.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.400]   - I'm going to server level.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.640]   - It is at server level, yes,
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.520]   I actually don't federate with GAB, so,
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.320]   but I might turn that back on because it turns out,
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.480]   you can also do it as an individual.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.280]   So you can be on any server and say,
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.640]   but I don't want to see traffic from server X, Y, or C.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.560]   So you really have total control over what you see.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.200]   I think it's a really, it's a beautiful system.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.360]   Let me see if it's here.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.360]   - I've been getting a lot of notifications
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.680]   for people following me on Mastodon.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.520]   And I just want to say here that folks,
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.000]   I hardly ever hop into Twitter, social.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.320]   - Well, come on in, come on in.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.160]   We have a nice--
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.280]   - One more time in Twit.Community.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.640]   - Well, that's a good place to.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.960]   That's a forum.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.280]   I love both of them. - That's where I spend more time.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.560]   So jump over to Twit.Community is,
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.600]   it's free to sign up and somebody I know
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.600]   and sit next to me here,
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.080]   walk you through the approval process,
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.640]   just like Mastodon.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.480]   - Yeah.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.800]   I am a fan of federation in general.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.840]   And that's what Blue Sky's about.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.880]   Corey was very strong.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.000]   Although there was a funny little twist,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.040]   because when the Supreme Court decision was leaked,
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.840]   a number of people pointed out
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.120]   that all Justice Alito is saying is,
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.880]   well, 'cause Corey was saying,
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.960]   just like the United States is a federation.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.560]   And each state has its own rules.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.840]   And Corey said, and this was before it was leaked,
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.000]   you just move, if you don't like the rules of your state,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.200]   you move to another state with different rules.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.320]   So if you don't wanna be in Texas,
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.000]   you moved to California or Washington State, as you did.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   I don't know why.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.440]   I don't think it was because of that, Stacey.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.680]   But that's--
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.280]   - Actually?
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.600]   - It was, okay.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.960]   - It wasn't, no, it wasn't so--
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.800]   - No, sadly.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.640]   - Because that was--
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.920]   - When the decision came out, it became very clear.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.000]   Not that's a kind of a luxury to say,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.120]   well, I'm not gonna live in this.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.920]   - Yeah, you can't just be like, y'all,
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.480]   just move if you don't like it.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.720]   - Yeah, that doesn't work for most people.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.960]   Especially the people who are most deeply disadvantaged by this.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.560]   But so it was kind of a little twist
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.960]   on this idea of federation.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.480]   But there are reasons the United States is strong.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.160]   We do have a federated union.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.560]   And each state does get to make a lot of its own rules.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.440]   And in fact, I think that's not a bad thing necessarily.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.880]   Anyway, not to get political.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.160]   And not to get into Twitter.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.000]   Sorry, Stacey.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.480]   - We do talk about Google and this show, folks, I promise.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.280]   - Is there any Google at all?
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.120]   - That's Google I/O.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.480]   - Actually, there's a lot of Google
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.600]   because Google's quarterly results came out this week.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.600]   - Yeah. - And Google I/O.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.080]   We're gonna do, Jeff, thank you for joining us.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.600]   - Jeff, can't wait. - So the Google I/O keynote is,
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.320]   I don't get to be there with Jason and having the stacks.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.040]   I don't get any free phone or anything, but I'll have you.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.200]   - Well, that's not our fault.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.920]   That's Google in their infinite wisdom
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.760]   decided not to invite the press.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.920]   I guess it's kind of a weird hybrid I/O this year.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.440]   But the only people in person will be Google's employees
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.120]   and carefully curated.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.480]   - Will they both only be nothing but cheers?
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.080]   - As it sounds like the Apple kind of thing.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.840]   - Yeah, you know.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.560]   - I thought there would be a couple,
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.080]   I never mind, I don't know.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.880]   - I mean, I'm not invited. - I mean, I'm not invited.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.720]   - Yeah.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:51.000]   Nobody I know was invited, so figuring.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   - Nobody could possibly be going.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.880]   - It will be May 11th through 12th,
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.880]   both live and online.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.800]   And we will be covering the keynote
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.600]   at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern,
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.920]   1700 UTC on Wednesday.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.920]   - A week from today.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.920]   - A week from today, May 11th.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.680]   - Do we want to say what we're looking forward to?
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.680]   - Very sick of you.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.720]   - Jeff Jarvis and Jason Howell and I will be doing the play
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.560]   by play.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.000]   You could join us if you wanted Stacy, but I figure.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.640]   - I think I'm doing my job, my other job.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.160]   - Yeah, I think you're not a big.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.800]   - I'm doing that thing, you know.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.320]   - The thing you actually, I'm sorry.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.240]   - I got a thing.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.080]   - I got a thing.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:30.920]   - I'm washing my hair.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.880]   I can't, couldn't, but other.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.240]   - You know, I love to, but.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.720]   - Husband, don't I have a thing?
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.560]   - I have a thing.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.200]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I was trying that.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.200]   - I have a thing.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.640]   - We're doing that thing.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.400]   - I'll be, I'm seeing my conference.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.960]   - I know, I know, we know.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.800]   - You know, you already told us at a time, so you're covered.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.640]   You're safe.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.720]   What will we expect, cool IO?
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.560]   I think a pixel watch, pretty cool.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.000]   - I'm excited about the watch,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.040]   the final bring together of the Fitbit acquisition,
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.480]   the hardware, the software,
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.960]   - Oh, that is a good way to look at it.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.800]   - Yeah.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.000]   - Everything related to that.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.840]   - And.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.880]   - I mean, from what we've seen,
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.840]   it's actually a really attractive watch, don't you think?
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.280]   - It's, I mean, all watches are too big for me.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.120]   - Yeah.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:16.960]   - That's just, you know.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.800]   - It's the floppy.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.040]   - I've got floppy wrists.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.200]   (laughing)
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.520]   Delicate wrists, they can't support a watch.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.080]   - And that's one thing I would never say about these watches
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.480]   is most of the time they're always a little bit too small.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.600]   It's nice to see these larger face.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.040]   - For a big guy like you, and my hands are big.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.000]   - Oh, geez, you know, something like that looks okay.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.440]   You know, this one.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.520]   - Is that the picture watch?
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.400]   - Can you only open your hands up next to each other?
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.680]   I'm curious to compare this on.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.760]   - You don't even want it.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.600]   You don't even want it.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.440]   I'm like a child.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.040]   (laughing)
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.360]   Child's hands.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.200]   (laughing)
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.560]   Little tiny baby hands.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.520]   (laughing)
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.560]   - Mr. Trump.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.760]   - This is why I still use these tallies.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.560]   - I have to wait to use these old mice too,
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.400]   'cause these old mice actually fit my hands better.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.240]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.320]   How tall are you?
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.080]   - I'm just 6'2", I'm not very tall.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.040]   - Just 6'2".
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:06.880]   Okay.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.720]   - That's like the average height.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.720]   So your hands are not out of proportion.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.440]   - Okay, 5'10" is the height of the average man.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.280]   - That's my height.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.120]   - Yeah.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.040]   - You're not 5'10".
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.400]   (laughing)
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.200]   - I watched before I got old.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.440]   (laughing)
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.280]   - I used to be my hero.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.360]   - It was really about this surgery you could do.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.200]   - $75,000.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.280]   - I saw that baby, huh?
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.720]   - He'd get three gain, three inches, huh?
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.200]   - My hands would then even be smaller.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.120]   (laughing)
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:32.960]   - Relatively.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.880]   (laughing)
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.240]   - It'd be like really tiny.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.400]   - I'm sorry, chat room.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.520]   I thought 6'2" was roughly an average.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.920]   - Is it even sweet?
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.400]   - Less his heart.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.240]   - Yeah, that's a classic.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.160]   - 6'2" average guy, 6'2", right?
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.200]   - I thought so.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.400]   - And your hands.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.880]   - My hands are really big.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.520]   - So are they bigger than like a normal 6'2" person?
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.560]   - I think so.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.400]   I've always been told that.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.960]   - They seem pretty big.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.960]   - You have puppy dog hands.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.800]   - Where's Jason?
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.640]   Get Jason in here.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.480]   - Football. - 'Cause he's.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.320]   - Football catch in hands.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.320]   - How old is 6'6", right?
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.320]   - Nice, 6'8".
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.440]   - 6'8".
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.040]   And have you compared hands with him or anything else?
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:07.880]   - I have no.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.720]   - Wait, no.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.560]   (laughing)
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.480]   - No, I will hang up if there's no difference.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.960]   - Excuse me sir, I don't have to.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.800]   - Let's see.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.400]   - Jason's in the house?
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.240]   - Yeah.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.080]   - Wow. - Yeah, it's great.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:18.920]   It's like real.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.600]   So their hands are the same size.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.880]   He's a little smaller.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.440]   - Yeah, it's slightly smaller.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.440]   - Yeah, you got mega hands.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.280]   - It's got really big hands.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.440]   - Your hands like stretched.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.720]   (laughing)
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.560]   - Good job.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.560]   - Thank you, Jason.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.360]   - Thank you, producer Jason Howl, Mr. Reagan.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.200]   - That's great.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.040]   - Yeah, it's nice.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.040]   We have people in the house.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.400]   It's really nice to have people around it.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.560]   Really, it's great.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.840]   - Sorry, Mr. Reagan.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.920]   - I'm sure our listeners really appreciated
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.360]   that he hand-compreters and people.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.800]   - I'm sure we have people around us.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.320]   - I'm sure we have people around us.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.960]   - I'm sure our listeners really appreciate it.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.520]   - I'm sure our listeners really appreciate it.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.360]   - Yeah.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.800]   - He hand-compreters and people.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.480]   - Especially the audio listeners.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.800]   - Exactly, they're like--
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.880]   - If you're listening an audio,
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.520]   you're probably imagining giant hands.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.360]   - Yeah.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.200]   - You know, the imagination.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.040]   - You're not wrong.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.040]   - And then I walked through the door.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.360]   - You're not wrong.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.360]   So this is a, what, lost, it was a lost pixel watch,
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.960]   was left in a bar or something.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.880]   - Like the iPhone.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.720]   - Yeah.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.600]   Except that that seems a little far-fetched.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.800]   I think probably intentionally left behind by a Googler.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.400]   In fact, we know who left behind now.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.640]   I think they found out.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.480]   - Oh, they did.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.560]   - Yeah, but these are pictures from,
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.560]   I think it was Android police that got the pictures.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.840]   I think it looks pretty good.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.520]   - I dig it.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.600]   - Yeah.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.200]   It will be obviously Android Wear.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.720]   This is the thing, it's amazing.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.440]   Google's never made a watch.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.200]   I stunned me.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.840]   - Have you tried Android Wear?
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.680]   - Android Wear.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.800]   - Sorry, Android Wear, it's terrible.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   - Well, I bought the first one.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:46.680]   - You can tell Google's never made a watch.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.080]   - Remember the Moto 360?
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   I really liked it.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:49.920]   - It was a bit bad.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.520]   - I have the new Samsung Galaxy 4 Classic,
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.440]   which is that weird Android Wear/Samsung.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.280]   - It's a little bit of a...
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.120]   - It's a little bit of a...
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.440]   - But it's Android Wear, and it's quite good.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.760]   So, big battery, the battery in my Galaxy Watch
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.920]   is 247 milliamp hours.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.560]   According to 905 Google, 300 milliamp hours
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.000]   for the Google Pixel Watch.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.120]   - But what does that mean in days?
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.560]   - Weeks, probably not more than all day battery life, really.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.600]   - But okay, so we'll see.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.720]   For people that want to get these watches
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.720]   and sleep in them for sleep tracking and things like that,
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.280]   what's the point?
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.400]   - So, Google's...
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.840]   So, here's where I'm excited.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.800]   Sorry, I'm interrupting, I'm sorry.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.320]   - No, no, all I said was up.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.320]   - The Nest, the Nest to...
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.160]   - The qualify for interrupting.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.320]   You can talk whenever you want.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.800]   - Google has the Nest to hub
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.080]   with the solely radar for sleep tracking.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.600]   So, it's possible Google could be like,
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.840]   "Hey, you get the watch, you get this guy,
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.760]   you charge your watch, this guy watches your sleep,
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.000]   compile all the data, you get it, it's great."
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.240]   - Well, also, what a lot of people do with the Apple Watch,
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.400]   which also is only all day,
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.160]   is it charges fast enough that you can wear it all night
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.320]   and charge it while you shower and get ready for work,
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.360]   and then they'll rip back on.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.200]   - That makes sense.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.160]   - So, they charge within under an hour.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.080]   So, I think that that's another solution.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.960]   - So, I read somebody said that of all the sleep trackers
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.800]   they tried, the Google Nest hub, was the best.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.280]   You use that, right?
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.320]   - I don't have it, I'm not using it right now,
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.280]   but when I used it, it was very good with my...
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.800]   It compared well with my Fitbit.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.600]   - Do you have to have the one with the camera?
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.840]   - No, it's with the solely.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.920]   I mean, they all have cameras.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.120]   - No, no, I have one that doesn't have a camera,
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.600]   but it might have the solely.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.760]   - Oh, yeah, it's only sleep tracking.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.200]   One is the Nest hub second generation.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.560]   I can show it well in my camera.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.400]   - Yeah, yeah, I see it.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.280]   I have it right here on the...
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.760]   So, that's not a camera.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.120]   That's the solely.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.000]   - That's also a camera.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.640]   No, the solely, I think, is actually one of the others.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.480]   - Oh, okay.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.320]   - Or both of the others.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.160]   I can't remember.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.400]   - So, that's part of the problem
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.920]   is a lot of people don't want a camera
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.440]   in their bedroom watching them.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.280]   Fair enough.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.960]   - But you can physically turn the camera.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.640]   - And it will still work with the sleep sensing?
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.720]   - Yeah, 'cause the sleep sensor,
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.960]   solely is a radar.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.120]   - Right. - So, they're using RF,
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.720]   not a camera to track your...
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.680]   It tracks your respiration.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.120]   - Does it also record audio too?
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:22.960]   - It does.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.800]   - It records.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.640]   - They want to listen.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.400]   It will know if you snore, right?
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.960]   - Yeah, it tracks your snoring and it records it
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.600]   and does all of the data processing locally on the device.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.440]   - Okay.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.320]   - And then it'll just send you...
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.880]   And you can, I believe, store the recordings of your snores.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.720]   - Okay.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.960]   - You don't, like, so if it hears other things
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.400]   in the middle of the night, like my dog's color jingling,
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.680]   it did not pick that up.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.760]   Or if it did pick it up, it didn't record it
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.320]   or do anything with it.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.280]   - So, I am gonna...
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.360]   - Are you ordering any of the records?
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.120]   - Yeah, because I have so many sleep trackers
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.560]   and I want to compare them.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.320]   So, I have the, what is this?
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.280]   Is this Surta or Beauty Rest or something sleep tracker
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.840]   that's from motion X?
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.680]   That's under the mattress, the paddle.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.200]   I have my eight sleep mattress, which is...
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.040]   - Cover.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.440]   - That's gonna be like next to my,
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.320]   that should be the most accurate.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.480]   I just ordered this, I guess I thought I had it,
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.520]   but I guess I have the first generation.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.520]   So, I ordered the second generation to replace it.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.360]   They're only 99 bucks, it's not hugely...
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.360]   - You have to install Google Fit.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.440]   Right now, you have to use Google Fit
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.520]   to get that data to see, you know.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.600]   - Okay, got a Pixel Cine.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.320]   - I never liked the Google Fit app.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.160]   - Seems like all the data...
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.000]   - Yeah, like it does.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.320]   - The apps gave me more information than Google Fit.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.160]   - Oh, I like Google Fit.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.520]   - Did it update it?
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.920]   - Well, I've used, I think Amazon Health Google Fit
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.880]   and Apple Health are all pretty comparable.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.720]   - They're all okay.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.720]   - But you're a...
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.760]   You're actually a fitness guy,
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.400]   you might have a different opinion.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.840]   - I did not like Google Health.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.880]   - Oh, yeah, I'm sorry, Google Fit before.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.880]   - Yeah, and it kinda...
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.240]   The real key for me on all of these
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.080]   is that they connect with enough devices.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:03.920]   - Yeah.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.120]   - 'Cause I have like all the different things that, you know,
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.320]   so yeah, and it's giving you a daily.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.760]   - Steps didn't do that before.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.600]   - Yeah.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.440]   - All right, maybe I should install it.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.360]   - Well, but it tracks your steps and stuff
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.640]   only from your phone, not from your watch.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.320]   - Well, it might if you had a...
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.480]   - Well, that's why we're getting excited.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.320]   But the other thing...
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.040]   - It doesn't work with a Fitbit?
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:28.240]   - You can pull in, it actually can you?
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.240]   For like the last time I checked,
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.640]   it would not let me do it.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.640]   - That's sad.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.560]   Well, now that Google wants to fit...
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.000]   - But it does work with my...
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.080]   This was right after they bought it actually.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:41.040]   But now that it does pull in my Nike training workouts,
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.960]   which I feel that are hard...
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.240]   Those workouts are hardcore enough for you, yeah.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.880]   I feel like you'd be like,
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.400]   oh, well, this is sort of challenging
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.080]   because they absolutely break my body.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.680]   (laughing)
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.800]   - No, I don't know what to do.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.800]   - No more.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.280]   - I'm measuring my heart right now,
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.000]   but putting my finger on the camera.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.840]   - That doesn't work.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.680]   - Really?
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.640]   That doesn't work?
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.560]   Look, it looks pretty good.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.240]   It's like a sine wave.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.920]   It's pretty good.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.760]   - Does it match your heart rate on your watch?
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.360]   - Well, I'm gonna find out.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.080]   So that's why I wanna try all these devices
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.560]   and see which is the most accurate.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:21.600]   I also wear the Aura ring for sleep tracking.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.480]   - Yes, I wear your heart rate now.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.160]   - I'm doing a freaking TV show right now.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.000]   Would you?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.840]   He's up, please.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.680]   - He's on here.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.000]   (laughing)
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.080]   - Well, that went in a four.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:31.920]   - I've seen it.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.760]   - What now?
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:37.480]   - You guys are so mean.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.560]   - No, I'm worried about shooting me.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.080]   - Well, my resting heart rate's like 56,
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.080]   so don't worry about me.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:43.920]   I'm okay.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.760]   - Okay.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.600]   - Nice.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:52.440]   - I know it feels like I'm calm, cool, collected
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.760]   when I do these shows, I'm relaxed,
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.160]   but actually this is hard work.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.840]   You guys are tough.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.080]   The watch says I'm 78.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.640]   Maybe I calm down. - How does it track you?
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.880]   - I just installed it now, I just went up to 81.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.720]   (laughing)
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.000]   - Blood pressure.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.560]   - 82, it's going up.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:12.000]   Let's see, I think the Apple Watch has been the most accurate
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.520]   'cause I compare it with one of those polar straps,
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.920]   which I think is right, you know,
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.920]   that's probably the most, most, most accurate.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.680]   And it's always the same as the polar straps.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.000]   So I feel like the Apple Watch is very accurate.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.280]   I've got the Aura ring, I've got,
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.040]   oh, so many sleep trackers.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.640]   And they all say something different.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.040]   - Which is not good, if it's supposed to be tracking
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.880]   one person. - Well, it makes you wonder,
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.520]   is this just a made up number?
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.920]   - Who's algorithms, right?
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.640]   - Yeah, my 80, let me see what the--
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.480]   - I'm 58 right now.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.520]   - 58, you don't look at day over 70.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.320]   - Oh, your heart rate?
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.720]   (laughing)
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.320]   - That's not nice, Jeff.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.560]   - I don't know how to track my heart rate on here.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.480]   I have to figure that out.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.640]   Your heart rate is 58 right now?
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.560]   - I just took it, yeah.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.960]   - That's not possible. - That's not impossible.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.800]   - That's impressive.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.760]   You are the coolest cat on this channel.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.720]   - That's not a, that's like,
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.920]   'cause I'm bored by this talk,
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.440]   'cause I've not, I've not shaped.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   So I'm gonna do what I'm doing.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.040]   - How could it be, if you're a 88 for the next topic?
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.200]   - Well, I can try my--
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.760]   - Why don't you get three in too high?
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.200]   - I'll try my cardio, let's see.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.640]   - Cardio, yeah, those are not--
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.160]   - Oh, that's actually truly accurate.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.720]   - Live core, right?
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:25.920]   - Oh man, I didn't realize my heart rate was so high.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.760]   - Yeah, mine's--
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.600]   - Wow.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.080]   - It's about 68 right now, so--
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.000]   - I got a dry cough, I got a bad heart rate.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.920]   Yours is 68?
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.960]   - Yeah.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.800]   - See--
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.840]   - But my resting heart rate's like 53.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.480]   - People don't realize how hard it is
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.820]   to show with you clowns.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:48.400]   - You know, my heart rate when I'm on stage
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.000]   walking around giving a speech--
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.840]   - Yeah, but it's higher.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.520]   - For that amount of time, it's sustained like at like 80.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.360]   - Yeah, so that's--
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.760]   - I have to stand up for that.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.080]   - Well, I don't have to stand up.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.080]   - Cardio is 59.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.280]   Wow, Jeff, I would worry.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.120]   - Jeff is just like--
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.360]   - That seems very calm.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.720]   - Mine is higher than y'all.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.560]   Mine is 92 right now.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.000]   - See, he's working, that's why.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.080]   - But I get excited.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.080]   - No, you better be nervous, Leo.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.000]   - I get excited, I get fired up being on--
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.200]   - Yeah, so--
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.240]   - Well, yeah, just--
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.080]   - I even swear--
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.160]   - Just try to talk a moral panic
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.000]   and then see what happens.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.840]   I'll talk a little second.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.680]   - Yeah, just--
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.160]   - We'll check in on Jeff's heart rate later
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.240]   when we talk about it.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.240]   - Do we think Google will announce a Pixel 6A?
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.080]   - Why not?
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.720]   - Wednesday, you already hit it.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.560]   - Why not?
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.400]   - You hit it.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.520]   - It's about that time, right?
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.840]   So a new phone and a new watch.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.960]   - Jeff, you wanna hope for your new notebook?
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.360]   - No, Chromebook.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.200]   - Chromebook?
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.600]   - It's not gonna happen.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.040]   - That's done.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.120]   - I just, I want Jeff to have something nice in his life.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:48.960]   - Thank you.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.440]   - And I'm assuming they're gonna talk more
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.240]   about the air quotes improvements
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.560]   to the Android operating system.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.760]   - Yeah, 'cause we saw Android 13 start
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.800]   the first preview of that come out last week.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.400]   - Oh, you mean the one that started wiping phones?
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.480]   - Yeah, that one.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.240]   Well, hey, look, you know,
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.880]   it shouldn't have to be said.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.720]   If you are downloading the very first public beta,
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.680]   was it even in public beta or a dev beta?
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.640]   I think it was developer beta of an operating system.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.280]   You're not putting that on your main phone, I hope.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.760]   - Mr. Howe, I feel so bad.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.200]   - Didn't happen to--
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.320]   - Did really?
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.560]   Jason?
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.480]   - Well, Jason, I mean, that's his job.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.320]   - That's his job.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.400]   - That's his job.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.720]   - But dang.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.760]   - So Pixel 6A, PixelWatch,
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.600]   we had rumors last year
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.000]   that Google was gonna announce a folding.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   - Oh, that's all right, yeah.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.320]   - And it sounded last year like they were close to doing it.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.640]   So you don't think so.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.120]   - I think we would've heard something.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.640]   I think we would've heard folding jokes.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.480]   We heard something.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.840]   - Didn't we get a folding phone leak of something?
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.960]   Just like yesterday?
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.200]   - Yeah, well, maybe they all changed my mind then.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.640]   - But maybe it was a Samsung one.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.520]   I just remember it was like, it was a folding phone leak.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.160]   - Well, you have a folding phone, so you probably agree.
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.000]   - I do have a phone.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.760]   - I thought it was, we saw leaks in the--
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.200]   - Oh, yeah, Google's first foldable--
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.240]   - What does it say?
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.480]   - Are we asking--
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.320]   - One day ago, one time I was--
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.040]   - I'm asking you.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.160]   - Oh, okay, Google's first foldable smartphone
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.760]   will have a rather compact cover display.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.760]   - Okay.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.200]   - But we don't know when--
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.040]   - I don't know if you want to--
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:27.880]   - 1,400 bucks.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.720]   - Who cares?
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.120]   - Shh, shh, shh.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:30.960]   - Stop.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.120]   - Last night, Jason's saying the guest on all about
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:39.200]   Android had a Pixel 6A case that was shipped to him by accident.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:44.200]   - Well, that sounds like the 6A is definitely on for Wednesday.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.280]   I'm sorry, but this is from Tom's guide, Jeff.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.640]   All the things Google will not announce on Wednesday.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:55.640]   Not in 2022, a Pixel book, a Pixel Slate.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.800]   (laughing)
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.200]   That face.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.040]   - Nothing.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.760]   - You're not traveling much yet, right?
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:05.280]   - No, but he just wants--
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.120]   - He has a nice working--
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.320]   - I go out to the deck and work.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.480]   - Yeah, he wants a nice working device.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.200]   - Hey, do you think, I mean, I have my goal.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.920]   - I just, nice, I like it.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.560]   - I just did a dumb thing.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.880]   I just bought a Google Nest Hub.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:21.120]   - Five days a week before--
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.200]   - You're probably gonna ship a new one, right there.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.480]   - Here, cancel order.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.360]   - Have you opened it yet?
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.200]   - Yeah.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.600]   - Can I just order it literally on the show?
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.760]   - Literally just ordered it.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.600]   - Cancel order.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.160]   - Oh, then, I'm gonna have to order it.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.480]   - You got time.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.680]   - You think I should?
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.520]   - Yes, please.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.920]   - Wait a week, dude.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.720]   - No, cancel it now.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.560]   - But I want it.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.480]   - I mean, well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.600]   - Also, if I order it now, it's more likely to go--
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.920]   - I can't reach a world update it on Wednesday.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.320]   All right, let me cancel my order.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.560]   - It's 100 bucks.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.640]   You can always use another Google display.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.320]   (laughs)
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.800]   - Probably went, oh, quick ship it.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.880]   (laughs)
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.880]   Quick before he changed it.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.720]   - You found her.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.560]   - We found another one.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.960]   - Selecting a reason.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.800]   - I'm a schmuck.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   - Order the--
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.880]   - I'm a schmuck.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.760]   Yeah, I never know what to say on the reason,
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.120]   'cause it's never matches my real reason which is--
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:09.960]   - Well, plus it's--
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.800]   - Oops. - Only some of them
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.920]   are acceptable too, so that's the other problem.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:13.760]   - Okay, I canceled.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.920]   - No, they're all acceptable,
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.800]   just some of them won't give you your money back.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.640]   - Right, it's true.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.480]   - I canceled it. - Yeah.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.640]   - We're good, we're good.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.520]   - Thank goodness.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.080]   - So now, it's like Schrödinger's cat,
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.880]   because when I had ordered it,
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.480]   then if for sure meant they would--
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.120]   - Then I'd have something next week.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.040]   Now I've canceled it, what has happened?
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.160]   Has it killed the pixel nest hub?
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.280]   - They're probably gonna just talk Weymo next week.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.120]   - Weymo.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.440]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.720]   - But that'd be funny.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.280]   Let's talk about self-driving vehicles.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.120]   - Right.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.120]   (laughs)
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.000]   - It's so funny.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.680]   It's so funny.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.160]   - Well, I'm excited, we haven't had a real Google I/O
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.280]   in a while, we still can't gather.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.360]   - I have high-level-- - I have such fond
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.320]   memories of getting together,
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.600]   Jeff with you and Gina Trapani at Google I/O
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.600]   some years ago, that was so much fun.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.500]   - It was so much fun.
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.840]   - We used to battle over--
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.240]   - We did the whole show from down there.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.600]   - We did the show from down there.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.920]   - Yeah, I remember the gas box cast.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.320]   - Jason's done that several years in a row
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.800]   with all about Android, so.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.120]   - Yep.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.520]   - Cross your fingers, cross your fingers.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:14.480]   - I liked the dried fruit, it was very good.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.480]   They had good chips.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.520]   - Oh, God, yeah, remember the first time
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.640]   they did a shoreline, they had like a whole
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.200]   campground set up with--
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.080]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.120]   - All these little tents and booths,
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.560]   and you got to choose a little button
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.720]   with your pronoun, it was great.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.400]   - Interesting, yeah.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.080]   - You got a free phone.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.560]   - Yeah, that was the good stuff.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.960]   - I mean, we're old enough to remember I/O
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.800]   when was it Chromebooks that gave out a version?
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.240]   There were the applause from the Yosto de Center.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.640]   - Nexus 7s.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:47.840]   - I was like, I got the Nexus 2, Nexus 1,
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.880]   Nexus something that they handed out.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.440]   - Yeah, I remember those.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.560]   - Those were nice.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.520]   - Google Cardboard caused much joy,
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.480]   even though it cost $1.98.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.000]   - That was really fun though.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.040]   And you used that to distract yourself
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.640]   while coming over the Golden Gate Bridge
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.600]   to he assembled his cardboard.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:10.680]   So in the what's new keynotes, which are after
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.680]   the Cenar Pichai's keynote, they will be covering Android
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:19.280]   Firebase, learn how to build and run apps users' love
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:24.080]   with Firebase, Flutter, which is another nice
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:28.160]   cross-platform framework for developers.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.440]   Web, learn how Google is investing in the web platform.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.400]   AR, there's a lot of AR interest right now
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.880]   between Meta and Apple.
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.120]   I wonder if Google will respond to any of that.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.800]   They've kind of had a rocky experience solely,
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.120]   which shows up in the nest hub.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.240]   Was there AR solution for the phone,
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.040]   but they decided not to put it in the phones.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:51.280]   Google Play, Chrome OS, Google Home and Google Pay.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.800]   That pretty much covers it all.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:57.920]   But of course, there's no leaks
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:58.880]   about what they might announce,
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.120]   but I think that's a pretty good guess.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:01.880]   Wednesday.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.960]   - Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.280]   - Let's take a little break.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.600]   Come back with more.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.160]   It's great to have the gang all together again.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:15.080]   Stacey Higginbotham from StaceyOnIOT.com.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.640]   And prove it from Hands On Photography.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:21.080]   Jeff Jarvis from Craig Newmark.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:21.920]   - Arsh--
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.680]   (laughing)
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.120]   - Loynes, they're obvious.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.040]   - Loynes of Craig Newmark.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.360]   Spring, Jeff Jarvis with his heart rate,
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.680]   well under 60.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.560]   Our show today brought to you by privacy.com.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.840]   I'll tell you what brings my heart rate up
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.760]   is buying something online with a credit card.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.520]   I can't even count the number of times
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.400]   that number's been stolen.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.280]   And somebody else has bought something else
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.000]   and I've had to cancel the card.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.600]   That's a pain, you gotta get a new card.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.640]   For the last few years,
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.720]   I have any time I'm buying online
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.960]   used a card from privacy.com.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.120]   Let me tell you why.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.520]   Privacy masks your real bank information
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:09.600]   and creates virtual credit cards for your use online.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.680]   There's two different kinds of cards.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.440]   You can do a card that's locked into the merchant.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.040]   So if I know I'm gonna be buying from Amazon a lot,
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:20.320]   I'll actually create a card for Amazon with privacy.com.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.840]   And then only Amazon can use it, no one else.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.480]   Or you can make a burner card
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.880]   that can only be used once, period, by anybody.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.520]   That really eliminates the risk.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.760]   Plus, because your real bank information
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.560]   doesn't go to the vendor,
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.160]   your privacy is assured you never have to worry about
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.960]   giving out not just your card number,
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:43.240]   but your name, address, and all that other information.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.880]   Privacy is a tool that makes it easy
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.040]   to manage your financial life online
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.960]   while keeping all of your most important information secure.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.960]   I just love privacy.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.120]   I'll give you another great use case for privacy
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.640]   because you can pause a card or delete it anytime.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.400]   Whenever I'm buying a subscription,
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.520]   a recurring purchase online,
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.360]   let's say I wanna buy Adobe Creative Cloud,
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.680]   I use a privacy card locked into Adobe.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.920]   I set the limit to how much they can charge.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.240]   You can do it per charge, per month or per year.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.440]   And then if at any time I say I wanna cancel,
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.720]   and a lot of times these companies make it really easy
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.960]   to subscribe and really hard to cancel,
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.760]   I don't have to worry, I pause the card.
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.000]   And that's it.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.840]   They don't get another penny out of me.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.400]   It makes it safe so they can't overcharge you.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.160]   They won't keep charging you
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.600]   after you don't want something anymore.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.800]   It just blocks the charge.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.000]   You always get a notification
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.320]   whenever the charge is blocked for whatever reason,
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.640]   whether it's 'cause you pause the card
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.040]   or because the card number was stolen
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.440]   and somebody else tried to use it.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.760]   So you always know what's going on with your card.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.560]   A great way to do recurring payments
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.080]   and subscriptions online.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.760]   They have a Firefox extension and a Chrome extension.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.280]   So it's very easy to make a new card.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.800]   You don't have to jump through a lot of hoops to do it.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:58.640]   It's just very easy.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.680]   You say, "Give me a new card."
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.240]   You got the number, you got the expiration date,
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.760]   you got the security code,
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:08.320]   and by the way, you can use with privacy any address you want.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.440]   You could be John Doe with 123 Main Street,
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.120]   Anytown USA.
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.320]   Oh, you figured out my secret address.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.160]   And I use that with all the merchants.
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.000]   - Oops.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.880]   - Unless they're mailing me something obviously.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.560]   Although that guy, Anytown USA
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.680]   is probably getting a lot of my stuff.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.560]   He's probably getting a lot of junk mail.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.600]   So that they don't see,
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.800]   and privacy doesn't care what zip code or address they give it.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.080]   They know it's you,
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.240]   'cause you set the card up through them.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.800]   It's a great way to share a card.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.960]   So I wanted to send my mom a credit card,
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.360]   'cause I want, you know, Shady Nahn,
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.080]   she doesn't cook as much anymore.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.560]   I wanted to buy her dinner once in a while.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.520]   So I sent her a credit card.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.880]   I said, "Mom, you use this
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.880]   with whoever delivery service you like.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.720]   Remember, once you use it with them,
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.880]   you can't use it with anybody else,
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.320]   but I'm buying dinner."
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.080]   And I get, by the way, I get a notification
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.640]   and I see it on my statement,
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.880]   when she buys dinner, makes me feel good.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.480]   In fact, she told me the other day, she said,
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.640]   "Your sister's coming over.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.720]   We're gonna have hamburgers."
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.560]   I said, "Oh, that's great."
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.400]   She said, "You're buying."
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.640]   I said, "That's even better."
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:04.600]   I love that.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.640]   And sharing it with her was so easy.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:11.000]   I don't have to mail her a number and text it to her.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.240]   None of that's secure.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.000]   You actually just create the card and privacy on the website.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.040]   And you say, "Share this.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.960]   You give them, I give my mom's email address."
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.400]   And that's it.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.520]   They handle the rest.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.360]   It's very easy.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.120]   She doesn't have to have an account to use it.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.040]   She's got everything she needs.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.800]   I just love it.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.160]   You get a full activity summary.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.480]   You can tag purchases.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.040]   So it makes it very easy to filter by date
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.240]   or by how much you've spent or by tag.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.520]   It's great for budgeting.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.800]   I just think this is a no-brainer.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.480]   And I want you to do it.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.520]   You should check out the various levels.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.520]   There's a free level.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.080]   Most people won't wanna use that.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.360]   I actually pay for privacy.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.920]   I have like it's 10 bucks a month
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.080]   because I get 1% back.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:56.520]   And I use it so much that it makes me money.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:57.560]   It doesn't cost me money.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.720]   Privacy.com/twig.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.360]   Right now, new customers will automatically get $5
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.040]   to spend on their first purchase.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:08.920]   PRIVACY.com/twig.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.480]   Please use that address.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:11.560]   That's how you get the five bucks.
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.760]   But also it's how you let them know you saw it here
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:14.640]   and it helps us.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:17.800]   Privacy.com/twig.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.480]   Huge fan.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.680]   Huge fan.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.760]   Use it all the time.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:26.920]   Let's see here.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.640]   Parliament has invited Elon to come visit.
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:32.320]   That's funny, isn't it?
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.120]   This is why, I think this is why Elon buys Twitter, right?
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.440]   It gives him a little cache.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.280]   Parliament wants him to discuss the future.
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.480]   Oh, maybe this is not, maybe this is not much fun.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.760]   Not that kind of invite.
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.120]   You're gonna get rid of moderation?
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:46.960]   No, no, no, no.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.600]   Oh, we are interested in the developments.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:53.840]   You propose, in particular, your intention to roll out
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:57.000]   verification for all users echoes our calls
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.480]   on the UK government as part of proposed legislation.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:04.240]   He also wants to know about misinformation.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.240]   It's Julian Knight, member of Parliament,
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.320]   chair of the DCMS committee,
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:12.920]   the Digital Culture, Media and Sport Committee.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.240]   We'd also like to know what you--
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.240]   How do the jocks get into this?
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.920]   How do you feel about cricket?
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.760]   Too many.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.320]   Why did the camera flip the me?
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.480]   (laughing)
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.200]   How do the jocks like this?
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.280]   Let's go to one.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.680]   (laughing)
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.360]   I therefore wish to take this opportunity
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.800]   to invite you to speak with me on a committee
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.560]   and discuss your proposals in more depth.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.080]   I look forward to hearing a response
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.160]   in discussing our plans for the future of Twitter
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.560]   and committee in the near future.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:41.880]   Your sincerely at Julian Knight.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:46.120]   Yes, well, I don't know if Elon will accept,
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.800]   but he has the invite.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.040]   He has the invite.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:53.240]   Anonymous--
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.240]   We don't discuss the fee.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.160]   The fee we're gonna be paying for Twitter.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.480]   Well, he said a small fee for commercial and government users,
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.480]   but we already pay three bucks.
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.120]   We all pay the, do you know what I'm saying?
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:05.360]   Yeah, I think it'd be a little less small than that.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.680]   Yeah, but you think it'd be more than--
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:11.680]   Did he talk about it being like a set amount per follower count?
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.840]   Oh.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.200]   Kind of like a male chimp idea?
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.040]   Or a denied estimate.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.400]   He has to call him a chimp.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:23.840]   A slight, he says slight Twitter fee for commercial users.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:28.200]   Like every thousand followers cost you a dollar a month.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.320]   Yeah, it doesn't say.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.160]   Oh, okay.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.640]   Some revenue is better than none, he says.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.480]   So Nike--
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.080]   I don't think he even knows about Twitter below.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:34.920]   No, he doesn't.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.400]   He doesn't even know about it.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.240]   Oh, good.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:37.600]   Good.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.440]   Keep him away.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.440]   You like it?
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.040]   I don't know if anyone else knows about it either.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.240]   It's just the four of us supporting all the Twitter.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.680]   It's hilarious.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.520]   It's the day on the uplay.
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:54.680]   I think all of this is because he needs to raise money,
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:58.560]   because his stake in the 44 billion, which is 21--
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.120]   Well, he's reducing that now.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.400]   He's trying to get other people to--
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.640]   Yeah, so he's got to get people to lend him money,
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.280]   because he doesn't have 21 billion in cash.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.280]   So I think that's why he's saying things like,
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.000]   "Yeah, we could go public in three years,
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.920]   and we're going to develop new ways to monetize tweets."
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:19.720]   He also says, "We'll crack down an executive pay to slash costs."
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.720]   I think there's a legitimate and serious concern
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:27.560]   that he's also going to lay off a lot of people.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:28.160]   That's business.
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.480]   And the wrong people by that.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:30.920]   I mean, the functions that--
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:31.560]   The moderators.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:32.680]   The moderators, yeah.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.920]   Journalism relationships, that kind of stuff will go.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.080]   Oh, no more Twitter.
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:40.080]   Thank you.
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.440]   I was like, "Oh, we're getting into it.
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:47.520]   Didn't y'all get into it last week?"
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.200]   He was at the Met Gala.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.040]   Will that make you happy?
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.320]   You want to see his outfit?
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:51.920]   Oh.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:52.400]   No.
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:59.320]   He's wearing-- looks like white tie.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.960]   That was the theme, or not the theme.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.600]   The theme was Gilded Age, but yeah.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.640]   I mean, it took it pretty seriously.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.000]   No, the dress code was white tie.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.600]   Ryan Reynolds was also wearing white tie.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.520]   Oh, OK.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:12.480]   You know what?
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.600]   Elon, get a tailor.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.920]   The collar is way too big.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.680]   Your neck's rattling around in there.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.880]   Well, they were out on the rental place.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:20.880]   They just didn't emphasize.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.400]   That's all right.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.880]   "Ridgest Man in the World Can't Get a Fitting Suit."
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.800]   It looks-- this is very haughty.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:30.600]   Who's he with?
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:31.000]   Who's that?
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.120]   It's not Grimes.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:33.240]   Oh, Mom.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.280]   Oh, isn't that sweet?
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.480]   No, certainly not Grimes, yeah.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.480]   Oh, you never know.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:43.960]   Somebody said, I thought he looked like a conductor.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:47.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.920]   Yeah, anyway, there you go.
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:51.080]   That's Elon Musk at the Met.
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:51.920]   See?
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.280]   That's nice.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.280]   That's nice with his model mother.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:52:02.080]   At speaking there, he said that the reach of Twitter
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.560]   is only niche.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.120]   But he wants a much bigger percentage
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.840]   of the American population to be on it.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.240]   Well, having everybody yell at everybody
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.960]   is not the way to do that, Elon.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:14.600]   That's the thing.
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:16.720]   I don't think people understand that moderation
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:17.920]   is the key to growing.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:19.680]   You can't have--
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.680]   Yes.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:23.160]   If you just let everything go, it's 4chan.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.120]   And 4chan is not big.
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:29.160]   It's full of awful people who can say anything they want.
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:32.800]   And it is not a successful enterprise in any respect.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.720]   They don't make any money.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.240]   Maybe he'll talk to the Reddit people
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:38.640]   because they've done a pretty decent job of corralling
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:39.680]   and talking to the uncorralling.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.600]   I love Reddit.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.800]   It's my social network.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.400]   I read it more than anything.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.760]   What is it that banks read at work?
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:46.320]   Because there's--
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.280]   They do have moderation.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.560]   They have moderation.
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.080]   And it's very--
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.080]   And it's very moderation.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:55.320]   It's-- each community sets the standard in very rarely.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:56.320]   It's kind of like federation.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:00.440]   Very rarely do community level.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.280]   There was actually a really interesting article
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.920]   in Slate about how the prepper community
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:09.120]   kept downvoting women's issues that women think about
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.120]   for prepping, right?
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.360]   So things like birth control after these zombie apocalypse,
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:14.640]   right?
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.880]   Like, how do you manage that?
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.160]   And they were like, eh, not important.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.680]   So then the women just were like, well, screw this.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:22.560]   And they created their own prepper community.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.480]   So that's also--
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.280]   It's walking dead.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.760]   We're seeing it before our very eyes.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.080]   They're going to go and war each other.
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.040]   That'll be fun.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.760]   We can show.
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.120]   I think actually though you nailed it,
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:36.320]   which is that each section is moderated separately
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.760]   with its own rules.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:38.920]   And I only follow--
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:39.760]   Or appropriate.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.440]   I only follow subreddits that I like.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:44.640]   And if it's out of control, I don't follow it.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.920]   So much more so than anything else,
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.280]   because Reddit, unlike Twitter or Facebook or anybody else,
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:52.480]   doesn't push subreddits into your face
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.480]   that you aren't a member of, right?
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.560]   You see just what occasionally they're promoted.
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.400]   I always turn that off when they have, hey,
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.160]   here's a subreddit.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.040]   You might turn that off immediately.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.960]   So you only see what you want to see.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:03.960]   So it's very much--
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.200]   It's like use net, but better.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.160]   Yeah, I mean, look, we know how hard it is
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:13.080]   to do a social network without moderation.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:17.000]   Use net went down in flames for a while.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.880]   Literally in flame wars.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:21.120]   Well, also, I had to-- for the book,
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:24.000]   I had to add in something about the well.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.120]   And I was never a well guy.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.960]   I thought there were a bunch of snots.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:27.320]   Hey.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.360]   But I didn't really--
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.880]   I didn't really--
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.800]   I didn't know what the hell you're talking about.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:36.080]   The whole Earth electronic link.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:40.040]   It was run out of a little houseboat in Sausoleito
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:44.800]   for some years, very big with the DigiRati in the Bay Area.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:47.920]   Stuart Brand started it.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.600]   What did you say about it in your book?
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.880]   No, the fascinating thing about--
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.280]   I was talking about the lessons learned
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:57.080]   in the early days of the internet.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.400]   And so I put that in there.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.120]   Plus, the reviewer of my manuscript
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:02.480]   thought it would be good to talk about it.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:05.200]   And that he was right, so I did.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.160]   What I didn't realize was--
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:09.440]   number one, Wired called the most influential network
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:09.720]   on Earth.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.160]   It had only 10,000 members.
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.200]   Yeah, it was--
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.160]   Really small.
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:13.960]   And it was small.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:14.480]   Yeah, no.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.960]   And it was-- but it was influential people for its time.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:17.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.560]   And they gave it-- they charged.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:21.280]   They made it free.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:21.680]   That's right.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:22.360]   And journalists.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:23.400]   That's right.
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.680]   But what was fascinating about it was
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.280]   I didn't realize that there was a case--
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:28.680]   Katie Hafter, I think, wrote about this sort of book.
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:29.160]   I think the way that--
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.640]   The Wizard stayed up late.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.960]   Was there a book about the internet?
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.520]   Or Wizard stayed up late?
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:35.440]   And she wrote about the well.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.880]   And there was a--
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:42.400]   there was really bad trolling, not just kind of generic people
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.120]   coming in now and getting--
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:45.400]   Oh, she wrote a book on the well.
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:45.880]   You're right.
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:46.960]   I did not read this.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.440]   I have to get this book.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:53.120]   And so they came in, and there was one guy who died.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:53.720]   What?
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:54.720]   From trolling?
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.040]   Not one that you could kill.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.320]   No.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:00.640]   And he had a relationship with a woman on the well,
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:04.040]   and it turned bad, and they each had problems.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:06.560]   And it was-- so it was a very early example
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:10.040]   of trolling and the problems that if you don't watch it.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:12.280]   The well was famous for saying--
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.880]   you could read this three ways--
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:15.120]   you own your words.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:16.240]   Right.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.920]   That was-- you have to copyright to them.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.440]   It was also an early section 230.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:21.480]   Hey, not our problem.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.720]   You better watch it out.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.040]   But it also said you're responsible for them,
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:30.440]   which I like that as a motif that Facebook should have said
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:31.440]   from the beginning.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.160]   Twitter should have--
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.800]   By the way, the well still exists.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:34.560]   It's not the same.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.160]   It's the well.com.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:37.880]   Wow.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:41.840]   Yeah, I was on the well for a few years, and it was weird.
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:42.880]   Never heard of this.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.160]   But it's the first experience I had of the internet,
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.880]   because you could drop through the well software
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.600]   into the internet.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.400]   So it's how I got online on the internet.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:50.960]   Cool.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.400]   I'm going to have to read Katie's book.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.640]   By the way, speaking, I did not-- this
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.520]   is a sign of the times.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:59.720]   Marques Brownlee was at the Met--
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.760]   Well, whenever you Leo, good on him.
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.840]   And that is not a white tie.
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:05.960]   It is a black tie.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.920]   It is not a white tie.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.200]   But he looks pretty darn good.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:10.200]   Good on him.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:10.680]   Wow.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:11.440]   It's been great.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:11.960]   It's been great.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.400]   That's a sign of the times, right?
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.720]   That a YouTube star is at this--
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.720]   A geek YouTube star, even that.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:20.320]   Yeah, the geek YouTube.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.400]   I mean, because there's been influencers last year.
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:27.240]   The Met is co-sponsored by Instagram.
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.000]   So there have been influencers there.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.640]   Oh, it is co-sponsored by Instagram as well.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.960]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.360]   OK.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:36.360]   OK.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:36.880]   Cool.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:38.000]   I'm just adding a little--
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   I'm just adding a little--
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   --masterclass now, by the way.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:40.480]   He does.
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:41.440]   Oh, wow.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.720]   He is a star.
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:46.720]   I can't believe we had the temerity to offer him a job.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:50.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.360]   Did he even respond?
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:53.440]   Yeah, he said, well, I'd like to keep going to college.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:54.240]   Thank you very much.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.640]   But what he was thinking is, are you kidding?
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:57.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:58.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:00.800]   Are you kidding me?
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:01.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.360]   He's still fully independent, right?
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.120]   He still owns this.
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:08.320]   He's doing very well, too.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.560]   He barely gave us time of day at CES.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.800]   He said, well, he was with that crowd.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.000]   That they were hurting him and a couple of other people.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:17.520]   But he knew him.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:18.960]   But he did stop and speak to him.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:20.600]   Yeah, he knew you were.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:23.560]   No idea who I was.
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:24.960]   He didn't know who I was.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.080]   I'm some old bald dude.
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:28.680]   Saying, hey, this is young man.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.280]   I like your tech videos.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:31.800]   I have really big hands.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.760]   You should wave at me.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:39.080]   Here is-- this is what my two favorite people,
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:41.840]   the Stars of Succession War, to the Met Gala.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:42.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.000]   Wow.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:44.520]   Wow.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:45.560]   Wow is right.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.720]   Holy cow.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:47.840]   Oh, the fingernails, too.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:49.760]   Look at the hand, yeah.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:53.360]   That's Kieran Culkin, who plays Roman Roy,
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.400]   the youngest scion of the--
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:57.480]   They carry those parts, man.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:00.400]   And Kendall Roy on the left there.
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.040]   I can't remember the actor's name, but he's great.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:02.480]   Jeremy Brown.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.200]   Jeremy Strong.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.120]   Strong, that's right.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:07.840]   He's wearing just like a bunch of bottle caps on his--
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:10.400]   Yeah, it's a really weird outfit.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:10.840]   Like--
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:11.400]   I think it's--
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:11.840]   Go down there.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.600]   I think it's like a little bit like a teenager saying, OK,
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.960]   if you want, I'll wear a white dye.
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:19.320]   OK, if you make me.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:19.680]   OK.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:24.160]   Did you get yours?
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:28.360]   Did you order your new selfie drone yet?
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:28.920]   I did.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:30.520]   I ordered two.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:31.400]   Two.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:31.840]   Please no.
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:33.320]   So Ant can have one?
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:38.600]   Well, so Snap is selling something called the Pixi Drone.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:41.320]   $230 selfie drone.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:43.080]   It's kind of a neat idea.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:44.640]   Why are you skeptical?
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:45.480]   You like real drones.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:46.160]   I'm not.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:46.920]   I was not--
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.880]   No, no, but Ant's going on.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:49.880]   Oh, no, no.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.760]   And Ant, you have to understand, I cannot--
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.360]   I'm not allowed to operate a drone.
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.720]   No, you are not.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:57.800]   So this is a drone I don't have to operate.
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.080]   I don't know exactly how it works,
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.520]   but I get the impression you just kind of throw it in.
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.880]   Well, that kind of video showing how to do it.
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:03.840]   Oh, all right, let's do it.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:04.360]   Here, this is--
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.720]   I don't think this is worth $230.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.520]   Well, that was the funny thing, because then the chat room
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:11.080]   said, oh, don't get that.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:14.720]   There's another selfie drone that does exactly the same thing
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.920]   for half the price.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.640]   Right, it's not worth $230.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.040]   That ticked it during the town.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.840]   So I bought the other one too.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.040]   And we're going to do a head-to-head,
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.560]   and you're going to be the guy in charge, OK?
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.080]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.760]   You're going to be--
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.480]   And another thing here in Petaluma,
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.680]   you go outside.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.080]   You see how windy it is every dad gum day.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.680]   No, but this should work just fine,
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:38.160]   because I can't control it.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.280]   So the idea is you release the drone, and it has three modes.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.240]   One is it takes a selfie.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.880]   One is it follows you around, and one
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.200]   that kind of goes around you, right?
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.760]   And then you just hold out your hand,
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.960]   and it lands in your hand after taking the picture.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:55.960]   No, it's like a pet.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.640]   Look, look, watch.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.000]   So she's-- I don't know how she gets it to launch.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   Oh, she presses a button, OK?
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.480]   All of that is great, just not $230.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.920]   You think that's too expensive?
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.200]   How much did you spend for your most recent drone?
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:12.280]   For something like that, 150?
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:12.640]   OK.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.360]   Because you're not going to get the best of image quality.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.360]   But it's going to--
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.360]   And then it's going to--
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.880]   One of the questions is if you can post it to something
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.240]   besides Snapchat, or can it only go to Snapchat?
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.160]   And that would be no.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.960]   So the other one I got, you could post anything.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.520]   Probably this--
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.800]   Well, that's probably more practical.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:34.520]   It's the same model of thing, probably from the same--
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.040]   I'm sure it's same as--
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.520]   I would just say to you, remember the flip camera.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.840]   Oh, boy, was that a life changer, right?
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:45.840]   I mean, it was easy, and you could just--
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.600]   so this is like makes drones and turns it
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.320]   into something so easy that you can just use whenever you want.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.080]   So I agree with you that it's not the best.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:59.360]   Yeah, but drones are already pretty easy to use now
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.160]   at that price point that are way better quality
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.760]   at that price point.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.400]   My question is, do I have to learn how to twerk?
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.000]   Why?
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.120]   Well, please don't.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.120]   What were you saying this is taking off?
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.640]   But if I want to be an influencer,
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.320]   don't I have to do the influencer little dances?
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.240]   Like she's doing?
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.560]   That's-- you'd know.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.080]   No.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:22.560]   OK.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.080]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.480]   I think this could be super cool.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.520]   I'm hoping it comes in time for our Alaska Cruise
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.840]   with Paul Thorett, because I'm going to do a lot of--
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:31.880]   Next things, sir.
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:32.400]   --seltzer pictures.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.640]   The battery on that.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.240]   How many batteries are you going to have with you?
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.280]   Because you know that's not going to fly for more than 10
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.040]   minutes tops.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:40.840]   Well, that's fine.
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.880]   How many are selfies going to get a gig?
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.320]   You're going to drop a gig.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.840]   Right.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:51.840]   The other one that I got has a little battery thing you--
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:52.840]   like pouch.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.360]   You're going to--
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.480]   that charges it some more.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.400]   What's the name of that other one?
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:01.400]   I think this will be a good present for Christmas of 2022.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.840]   And I say this because we're going
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.040]   to get a lot more awareness from it now.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.640]   We're going to be actually out in public with places.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.360]   And I'm thinking about for kids and for people
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.640]   who just want to have--
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.640]   and the price point will come down,
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:14.920]   or we'll find the right one.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:15.920]   I hope so.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.440]   And for like $150 to give someone a little drone.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.880]   And I know they've been out for a while.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.880]   I won't walk down.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.880]   Well, get this instead.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:24.880]   I'm square with it.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:25.880]   There apparently quite-- yes, exactly.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.400]   Won't that be fun?
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:31.600]   So this is the air selfie camera.com.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.440]   This is only $150.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:33.960]   OK?
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.440]   And doesn't it look exactly the same?
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.720]   I think it's probably the same hardware, right?
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.600]   Does the same kind of thing.
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:39.920]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.080]   That's a more reasonable price for that piece of equipment.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.000]   2K HD video, OK?
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:48.600]   I don't know how--
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.240]   For instance, I think that's good.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.080]   All of that's legit.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.520]   12 megapixel camera.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.680]   2.74 degree field of view.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.880]   So it's slightly wide.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:01.240]   It can go 60 feet.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.400]   It weighs-- these things weigh nothing.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.880]   Not less than two ounces.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:06.680]   So I can just have it--
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.760]   I could carry them in my hands with my floppy wrist.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.600]   With your floppy wrist.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.200]   I wouldn't suffer.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.520]   Well, anyway, I ordered one of each.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.800]   There are turns out I didn't know this
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.520]   because I was so impulsive.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:22.000]   But there's quite a few selfie drones in the world.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.440]   There are.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.760]   I feel like that's why I feel like the snap
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:30.040]   pixie is kind of fun because it could kind of drive attention.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.400]   Like there's nothing right now like they exist,
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.560]   but no one's really using them or excited about them.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.440]   And I think something like this might help with that.
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.120]   Well, and federal law prohibits me from operating a drone.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:45.000]   But this way, I'm not actually operating itself.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.080]   I couldn't possibly--
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.280]   It's operating itself.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.480]   It's operating itself.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.000]   It could possibly screw it up.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.640]   Well, Judge, I was not operating it.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.200]   No.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.760]   It was all on its own.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.400]   I know it hit that kid and I.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.800]   But I didn't do it.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.760]   It's 13 weeks out.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.360]   So I'm not going to get it probably until August.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.200]   So it'll be a while.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.560]   I love drones.
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.280]   And this sounds fine.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.120]   They just overpriced it for what it's capable of.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:15.200]   So you're not a drone snob or a snow drop.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.640]   You are.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.080]   It's not that you're snobby about it.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.600]   It's just you think it's too high.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.040]   We should be surprised for when it will offer you.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.760]   You see those tiny sensors, image sensors.
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.040]   And it's not going to be great.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.120]   You're going to get--
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.640]   Well, it'll be like you don't think it'll even be
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.880]   camera phone quality.
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:30.400]   No.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:30.900]   Oh.
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:31.440]   Most of the time.
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:31.840]   You know what?
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.400]   We're sticking on our camera phones to the--
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.120]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.120]   OK.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.320]   I was like, this couldn't run that kind of processing power
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.440]   even if it wanted to.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.000]   All right.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.400]   Well, I want to say I was the sudden--
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.480]   Another $239 you've wasted.
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.040]   I did it for you.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.120]   I'm going to get both of them.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:48.920]   You can review them.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.000]   We can review them together, whatever you want.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.440]   Here's the headline.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:55.120]   Don't buy this thing.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.160]   I'm excited.
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:59.000]   I will look forward to that review because I'm--
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.440]   You and I think this would be a good thing for your kid.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.200]   But don't get this--
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.320]   Pixie, get the other one because it looks exactly the same.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:06.680]   All right.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:10.280]   Now, did they mention any type of AI for recognizing pets?
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.160]   Pets?
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:15.080]   No, this is for your influencer channel.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:15.880]   Oh, OK.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.560]   Well, pets are influencers.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:18.960]   Well, pets are influencers, yeah.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:19.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:19.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:23.320]   My niece has an influencer dog.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.240]   It has a cereal box ad.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.040]   Really?
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:26.840]   That's awesome.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:27.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:28.000]   Wait a minute.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.800]   Your niece's dog is on a cereal box?
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.520]   Yes.
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.120]   What's cereal?
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.320]   Magic spoon.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.880]   Oh, I like magic spoon.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.480]   Magic spoon is the keto cereal.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.680]   They're not on the box.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:46.640]   They did some photo with the box with the dog.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.600]   I don't remember what it was.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.560]   That's like an ad because they're doing a lot of ads, yeah,
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.760]   because the box has a cartoon on the camera.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.240]   Well, that's pretty cool.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:53.840]   Outstanding.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.880]   That's really cool.
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:56.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.080]   Magic spoon.
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:00.240]   It tastes like styrofoam, but it is keto.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.000]   So--
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:01.760]   Oh, so is legit.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.760]   And it costs $40 a box.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.480]   OK, so it is a keto.
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.480]   She loves them.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.000]   I don't know her name on it.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.280]   It's sort of keto.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.520]   It's five net carbs.
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:11.160]   No sugar.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.440]   Most of the carbs are fiber.
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:12.800]   OK.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.040]   It's high protein.
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:17.640]   But like I said, this is the selfie drone of cereals.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.880]   It's the selfie drone of cereals.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.720]   Well, they got more flavor, so.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.720]   If it doesn't taste good, it's probably keto.
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:26.160]   But if it tastes delicious--
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.960]   When I was keto, I ate it because I
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.280]   thought, well, I should have a treat.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:34.200]   But anyway.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.520]   Air-- so Apple's interesting.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.800]   People coming back to work, right?
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.240]   Maybe this is premature.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.480]   We're still waiting to see the COVID levels are starting
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.240]   to spike in areas like where you are, Jeff.
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.000]   Yep, it is.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.280]   It's like I'm here, sir.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.800]   Are they spiking here now?
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.200]   We are going to an indoor concert tomorrow.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.360]   Is that a mistake?
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.720]   I have no comment.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.920]   Are you going to wear your mask?
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:58.320]   I'm going to wear a mask now.
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.920]   Yes, I am.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:02.920]   We're going to see--
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:07.880]   My offie got her third case of COVID at the White House
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:09.840]   Correspondence Dinner.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.440]   Yeah, we all knew that was going to happen.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.120]   They were on stage joking about it.
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:15.120]   I'm like--
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:18.080]   Yeah, super spreader event.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.240]   I was like, terms don't recognize irony, y'all.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.600]   In '95, sir.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.680]   Yeah, well, we're a mask.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:23.000]   Good.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.920]   Thank you for the suggestion, because I
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.160]   don't want to bring it back.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.160]   And yeah, a lot of people I know are starting to get it,
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.920]   so maybe it is in any event.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.320]   Or people now.
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.280]   I know more people now have it than I've ever--
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:34.560]   Me too.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.040]   Me too.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.800]   Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.200]   Still, I still haven't gotten--
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.080]   None of-- you haven't gotten it?
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:41.880]   Jeff, you haven't gotten it?
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.640]   You haven't gotten it?
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.080]   Stacey.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:43.720]   Knock wood.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.720]   We're all the paranoid types, I guess.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:46.760]   Fortunately.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.680]   I live in a cave.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:49.600]   Oh, that's it.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.280]   We don't go anywhere, right?
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:51.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.120]   So--
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:52.800]   I have places.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:57.040]   We are asking, yeah, you are going to be in Vegas next week.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.120]   Will you wear a mask?
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.080]   Not when I'm on stage.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.120]   I'm everywhere else.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.640]   I'm usually outside when I go somewhere.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.960]   You're safe on stage.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.960]   I usually find outside.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:06.960]   Yeah, outside.
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.960]   I mean, it depends on the ventilation in the--
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.640]   We haven't been to an indoor concert in two and a half years,
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.880]   so this will be interesting.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:15.960]   Who are you going to see?
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.760]   Ann Wilson of Hart.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.160]   And Sundar Pichai.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.040]   No.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.160]   This week in Google.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:27.320]   She's going to sing crazy on you.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.920]   Anyway, it's going to be fun tomorrow for a Cinco de Mayo,
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.000]   but maybe now I have--
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.880]   well, we'll see.
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.600]   I promised a test before I come back.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.000]   Enjoy it in nine to five.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.480]   But what I was saying is people are starting
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:41.800]   to come back to work except they don't want to in many cases.
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:44.480]   Now the estimate is as many as half of the Apple
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:47.800]   employees who've been told they have to come back to work
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.320]   at least several days a week.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:53.040]   At least half of them are thinking of quitting.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:58.680]   Quitting their job at Apple rather than come back to the office.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.840]   That's nothing wrong with it.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.840]   They get jobs elsewhere.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.480]   If they can get another gig somewhere else.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.320]   They probably can.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.000]   You know, hey, they--
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.320]   I think they're hoping that if--
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.080]   Best value for themselves.
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.160]   If they say that, then maybe Apple will rethink it.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.000]   They should.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.560]   Apple, like many companies, says, no, no.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:17.160]   We've got to all be together for the collaborative aspect.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:17.640]   Oh, no.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.480]   They actually have legitimate because they develop hardware
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.280]   and because they've got such a culture of secrecy,
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:25.160]   they kind of do have a legitimate argument
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.080]   for putting people in place.
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:27.680]   That's true.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:28.200]   That's fine.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.080]   In an office.
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:32.600]   But there was a really good BBC comedy show that people who
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:35.440]   have been spending the last two years staring at a screen
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.200]   in their home are now ordered to come back
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.960]   to a larger building to scare at us.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.160]   Exactly.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.920]   And to spend hours of their day driving to and from
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:49.920]   and many, many dollars on gas, I understand what Airbnb just
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.400]   said, you know what?
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.360]   You don't ever have to come back.
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.520]   It's good to call us a good person.
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.680]   I think this is smart.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:03.680]   I get where the country will want you to be on site for certain
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.080]   tasks or duties or whatever.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.920]   But the world has proven to us over the last two years
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:13.520]   that most of these on site jobs were not required.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:16.480]   So much business was still able to get done
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.880]   from the comfort of your couch or bed or--
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.960]   Your home office.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:25.720]   Well, they're redesigning.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:29.160]   There's been enough stories now about home builders and talking
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:33.680]   about how homes are shifting because more people are going
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:34.360]   to work from home.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.040]   And I do think--
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.320]   More homes, right?
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:41.240]   Yeah, smaller, private rooms, more flexible space.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.800]   I mean, our guest room is also my husband's office.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.320]   So--
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:49.800]   And I know I'm different from most people.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:55.640]   But when I was working in a day-to-day job in an office,
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.680]   I hated being there because I couldn't get anything done
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.280]   because of all of my coworkers.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:02.800]   Yeah.
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:03.800]   Because that is a big sound.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.560]   And they would say, hey, what's your name?
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.840]   I mean, my work done because people kept
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.840]   visiting all the time.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:15.480]   And my superior at the time was like, wow,
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.520]   I got this email from you at 11 o'clock at night.
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.040]   Thanks.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:19.920]   Why are you working?
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.600]   And I'm like, because it's just all the time
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.560]   I could get something done.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.520]   And then that discussion later turned into, why not
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.840]   should you just stay home?
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.880]   And I'm like, thank you.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:29.800]   This works.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:33.880]   And I worked from home for most of my professional career.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.560]   And I loved it.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.040]   So Airbnb has an interesting twist on this, too,
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.240]   so that you can work anywhere in the country you want.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.040]   You can go into an office or not.
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:45.560]   But you can also work up to 90 days
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:49.040]   a year in any of 170 countries.
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:49.680]   Nice.
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.320]   Very Airbnb, obviously.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.440]   I guess just places where you probably
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.920]   can't get arrested for working there like Russia.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.160]   Or you can't go to.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.520]   But why would you want to?
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.600]   You go to Barbados.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.560]   That's where I'd be right now.
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:08.440]   If I work for Airbnb, but my boss won't let me leave the office.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:14.000]   20 plus countries offer remote work visas
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.120]   and more are in the works, which is one of them.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.120]   We know for Airbnb's business.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:22.240]   One of the one of our sponsors--
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:26.880]   I won't say who-- but he was in Barbados for at least a year
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:30.400]   on a special visitor visa for COVID.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:30.640]   Wow.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.200]   Loved it.
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.680]   The internet's very good there.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.400]   They all speak English.
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.600]   It's beautiful.
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.840]   It's not in the hurricane zone.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:38.320]   Nice.
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:40.600]   If you can get the gig--
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.600]   It's not hurricane.
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:45.040]   Well, the folks at Apple, if you can find another gig,
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.800]   that's going to give you the quality of life
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.480]   that you feel you've earned.
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.560]   And go for it.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.040]   Tell Apple to kick rocks.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:52.540]   Yeah.
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:53.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:53.540]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:54.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.880]   Phoenix Warp says he annoys his coworkers
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.480]   by listening to Twitter at the office.
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:03.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.920]   Sorry, Phoenix Warp.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:07.640]   I know who you work for, too.
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:08.720]   Let's take a little break.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:12.360]   We have lots more big announcement from T-Mobile.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.880]   They had a big event today.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.400]   We'll talk about that.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.240]   I actually want to ask Stacy a little bit about it,
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:18.640]   because it's kind of an IoT story.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:26.040]   But first, a word from Red Hat and their newest podcast
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.400]   Compiler.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.240]   We've talked about Compiler before.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.720]   It's a really cool idea.
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.840]   It comes to you from the makers of Command Line Heroes,
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.440]   another one of our sponsors and other podcasts
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.680]   I love listening to.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:40.240]   This new one, Compiler, is hosted by Angela Andrews
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.040]   in Brent's Seminole.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:43.600]   And it's a brilliant idea.
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.080]   And I can just see them coming up with this.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:50.480]   So Red Hatters, which is one of the great Linux distros,
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.880]   it's a great company to work for.
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.840]   They do wonderful stuff.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:56.720]   Red Hat has an internal, as many companies do,
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.560]   kind of in company forums, where they have fascinating
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.080]   discussions.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:02.360]   When you get a bunch of smart people talking about stuff,
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.240]   it's fascinating.
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:06.080]   And I think they said, this should be a podcast.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.480]   Because essentially, each episode
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.240]   covers a big question in technology.
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:15.360]   And then they ask different Red Hatters what they think,
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.760]   what are tech hiring managers looking for, or a good one?
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:21.240]   Do you have to know how to code to get started in open source?
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:25.360]   Or how much should managers be coding?
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.240]   Do you need to code if you're a manager?
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:29.840]   Episode two, what can video games
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.640]   teach us about edge computing?
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.520]   The internet is, of course, a patchwork
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:38.280]   of international agreements and all kinds of infrastructure.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.000]   But there's something coming to change the way
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.040]   we connect in this episode of Compiler.
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:46.120]   Hosts explore what edge computing could mean for people
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:48.960]   who enjoy video games and what this form of entertainment
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.520]   could teach us about the technology.
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.640]   And actually, I was really thrilled to listen to this,
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:55.680]   because this is something I've been saying for a while,
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.800]   is that this gaming at the edge is really just
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.920]   the predecessor to computing at the edge.
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:04.320]   That I cannot imagine Microsoft at some point, won't just say,
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:07.640]   I don't buy Windows, don't buy, just run it on your cheap,
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.800]   low and slow hardware on your Chromebook or whatever.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.680]   We'll manage it, we'll run it out of our--
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:15.400]   so I can't wait to see what the Red Hatters think about this,
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.600]   because of course, you could do the same thing with Linux.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:20.640]   Episode nine, how are tech hubs changing
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.840]   is right up the alley of what we were just talking about.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.120]   Used to be, you'd have to move to a tech hub, right?
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.800]   If you wanted to work in technology, but nowadays,
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.680]   you could be in Barbados.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.720]   So for this episode, a host of Compiler
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:35.000]   speak to a few of the changemakers
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.120]   who are thinking outside of the physical and social dimensions
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:42.440]   we've come to associate with innovation.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.760]   So these are new episodes.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:49.120]   I loved the first season new episodes of Compiler.
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:54.120]   You can go to redhatswebsitered.html/twit.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:17:00.200]   That's the short form, red.html/twit.
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:02.200]   You can go and listen there, but of course,
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.400]   you probably should just subscribe
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.280]   in your favorite podcast client,
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.080]   anywhere you listen to podcasts.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.960]   Listen to Compiler, Apple podcasts, pocketcasts,
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:14.520]   Spotify, Google podcasts, everywhere.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.120]   And we'll put a link just to make it easy
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.200]   on this episode's show page as well at Twit.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.200]   Thank you, Compiler, for making a great,
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:24.280]   I'm always interested to hear what other people are doing.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:26.800]   - You think managers should know how to code?
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.280]   I remember having this discussion.
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:32.480]   - I think they should have been coders at some point,
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:36.680]   but the thing they talk about in the episode is fascinating.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.160]   Some managers say fine, I don't have to do this anymore,
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.080]   but some of them say, get out of my way.
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.320]   And this is where you gotta watch out.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.280]   Get out of my way, let me write that, right?
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.880]   Terrible idea, don't do it.
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.120]   - Yep.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.960]   - That was a fascinating conversation.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:52.640]   And I think the idea of not having to be in San Francisco
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.000]   or Austin or New York City to participate
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.200]   in the tech revolution is a big, big idea.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.120]   That's an episode of--
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.520]   - You mean I can be in Calhoun Falls, South Carolina?
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:04.600]   - You have to sit right here next to me.
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.840]   - No, to be going anywhere.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.520]   Where would you go Calhoun Falls?
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.480]   - Calhoun Falls, South Carolina.
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:11.280]   - It sounds like something from Rocky and Bullwinkle.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:14.240]   - Oh, it's about as big as this TD booth.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.040]   - If you could be anywhere,
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.720]   that's where you would be Calhoun Falls.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:17.560]   - No.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.400]   (laughs)
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.240]   - No.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:20.240]   - Where would you be if you could be anywhere?
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.080]   - Right here.
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:21.920]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:22.760]   - Right, good answer.
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.280]   Stacy, if you could be anywhere,
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.600]   would you be in, you know, on the island?
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:33.840]   - No, no, I would be in a, like,
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:34.880]   a waffle house.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.720]   (laughs)
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.200]   - Good answer.
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:40.280]   And you know, they never close.
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.360]   They never close.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.200]   - They never close.
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.680]   - Oh, waffle house.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:47.200]   - How come the welcome to Calhoun Falls sign
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.000]   is a gravestone?
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.200]   That seems kind of,
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.600]   kind of productive.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.480]   - Kind of fatalistic.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.640]   - It's the gateway to Lake Russell.
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:59.720]   - Oh, man, he pulled up Calhoun Falls on twig.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.800]   - Ah, I did.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.320]   - Oh, boy.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.000]   Have you been to the Blue Hole?
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.040]   I have not.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.680]   Richard B. Russell Lake and damn overlook.
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:10.400]   (laughs)
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.920]   - Calhoun Falls is a town
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:14.960]   and I have driven through in a matter of seconds.
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.120]   - There's only 1,800 people in Calhoun Falls.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:17.960]   - It's tiny.
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:18.800]   - It's tiny.
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:19.640]   - It's tiny.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:20.640]   - I don't know, that's smaller than my town.
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.480]   - Yeah.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:22.320]   - What are the restaurants there?
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:23.160]   I wouldn't look this up.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.040]   Can we go to Google Maps and see what's--
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.880]   - Apparently only three destinations.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:27.720]   (laughs)
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.600]   - Is there a waffle house?
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.520]   - You know what, I bet there is a waffle house.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.360]   - No, definitely not.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.560]   - We don't have waffles houses out here.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.400]   Do you miss waffle houses?
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.440]   - Yes, I do.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.120]   - I have never been to a waffle house.
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.720]   All we have is I up.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:40.520]   And I don't think that's the same as a waffle house.
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.360]   - No, it's true.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.680]   - When I went back to visit my mom,
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:46.640]   was it last year or year before last?
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.800]   I went to the waffle house.
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.760]   I took my uncle to the waffle house with me.
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:50.600]   Was that it seen?
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.200]   - What makes it so good?
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.160]   - It's just 'cause they're cooking lard.
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.320]   (laughs)
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.160]   - Lard!
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.800]   - The secret is lard.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:59.840]   - They're cooking lard, but I remember sitting there
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.440]   and just having a good time talking with him
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.120]   and they brought the bill out.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.960]   And the bill was like $25.
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:07.800]   - Oh, nice.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:08.640]   - And lard's cheap.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.880]   Oh man, I missed this stuff.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:11.720]   So the nearest waffle house--
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.800]   - It's gonna say that's a high end bill right there.
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.280]   How many people did you have?
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.080]   - The nearest waffle house to me,
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.120]   you don't know how much I eat.
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.480]   - To us, it's good your Arizona.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.320]   - Yeah, it was so loud.
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.680]   - So we have to go to Arizona.
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.480]   - So is there a waffle house?
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:27.080]   There's not one in Seattle either, I'm sure.
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:27.920]   - Oh, God no.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:28.760]   No, I don't think--
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:31.040]   - It's more of a southern thing.
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:35.440]   - They cook in lard and they give you the pecan pie.
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:36.440]   As I said, pecan.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.720]   - Oh, I love pecan pie, baby.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:40.000]   - They put a little butter on the top.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   - Oh, butter?
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.360]   - Well, there's not enough fat on your pecan pie.
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:44.760]   You got a little butter on it.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.600]   - Oh my gosh, that's the best day.
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.440]   - Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.000]   - You know, pecan pie isn't fatty.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.520]   Pecan pie is just sugar.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:51.360]   - Sugar is sugar.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.200]   - You cook it in karo.
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.720]   - Oh, that's right, it's all karo, that's right, yeah.
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.080]   - You heard the John Oliver waffle house choke?
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.200]   - No.
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:59.960]   - No, we're gonna see if we can find it.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.520]   (laughing)
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:04.480]   - Oh, chicken in a 21, yes, apple butter, yes.
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.320]   Apple butter.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.880]   There is something called the waffle house index.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:09.160]   You know about that, right?
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:10.520]   - Oh yeah, everybody knows about that.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.520]   - Because waffle houses never close.
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:13.360]   - Right.
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.840]   - They're open 24/7.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:19.080]   If a waffle house is closed, that means--
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:20.080]   - It's a disaster.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:22.680]   - So there's three levels on the waffle house index.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:25.680]   Green, where there's a full menu,
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:28.280]   means the restaurant has power and damage is limited.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:30.520]   Yellow, limited menu means no power,
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:33.440]   only power from a generator, food supplies may be low.
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:35.160]   Red, the restaurant's closed,
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.560]   indicates severe damage or severe flooding.
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.640]   - It's usually flooding.
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:42.600]   This is all that's left of a waffle house
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.160]   in Biloxi, Mississippi after a katrina.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.520]   - Oh, look, yeah.
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.360]   - Look, see, that's where all my family's from.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.200]   - Really?
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.040]   Poker time.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:50.880]   - Every single member of my family--
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.120]   - I'm sure they've rebuilt the waffle, really?
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:53.960]   (gasping)
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.200]   So sorry.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.120]   - So was that the hardest hit by katrina?
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:00.240]   - Yeah, that's where katrina made landfall.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.080]   I know that-- - Oh, no worries.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:03.480]   - I know that Louisiana had, you know,
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:06.320]   New Orleans had their issues, but Biloxis were it hit.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:11.320]   - The amazing thing is this waffle house was only yellow.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.520]   It wasn't red.
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:13.360]   - Right.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.200]   - They were still giving you some food.
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.360]   - Yeah.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.360]   - Wow, they-- - Wow, they--
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.760]   - They were right there in the thick of things
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:21.600]   from a hurricane.
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.400]   - So I am like, this show
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.360]   is taught me about Popeyes Friday.
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:27.880]   (laughing)
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.560]   About waffle houses? - You never have Popeyes?
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:31.400]   - I have now, but what I do-- - Yes, no.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.280]   Thanks to Ann.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:33.640]   - Convinced to me.
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:34.480]   - Did you bring him a business?
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:35.480]   - The chicken bolus.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.480]   - No. - The chicken bolus.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.040]   - He wanted to get the chicken sandwich.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:39.960]   - You ever been to a Stuckey's?
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.240]   - I did not go to Stuckey's.
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:42.800]   - Okay, I did not go to Stuckey's.
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.080]   - I've seen it though.
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:47.600]   - FEMA actually uses the waffle house index unofficially,
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:50.040]   but they do use it, which is wow.
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:51.800]   Wow.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:57.000]   Concede defeat says Jeff Jarvis.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:57.840]   - Oh.
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.760]   - Time to surrender. - Up Jeff.
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:02.360]   - Wake up Jeff, get that heart rate up to 70.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.200]   - Yeah.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.840]   - She's 65. - 65.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:09.480]   Says, "Concede defeat to bad speech."
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.320]   What do you mean, Jeff?
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.880]   - Just that it's always gonna be around.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:16.680]   We're putting all this resource and all this effort into it.
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:18.520]   It's getting all the attention.
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:21.720]   It's thus doing the job of the bad guys.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:24.040]   We're painting good speech on the internet
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:27.680]   with the rush, the tar of bad speech.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:31.800]   We should be putting resources into finding good speech
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.000]   in support of you. - I completely agree with you.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:34.840]   Wow.
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:36.680]   I think you're right.
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:40.760]   I think we're overreacting to disinformation, bad speech.
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:41.680]   - Check your thoughts.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.080]   - Don't get rid of it.
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:44.400]   Don't get rid of it.
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:48.000]   - Still worry about disinformation, but treat it like spam.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.200]   - Yeah, it's just gonna be there.
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.480]   - It's gonna be there. - Yeah, it's gonna be there.
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:52.880]   We're never gonna defeat spam.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.040]   It's a human condition.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:57.280]   - I disagree in the sense that there's so many,
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:00.200]   if you have bad speech within agenda,
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:03.400]   so you think about the bot armies that China and Russia,
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.520]   and probably, to be honest, we probably do it
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:06.680]   to another places.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:12.000]   I think that no amount of just ignoring that
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.840]   or ignoring that is kind of silly and naive.
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.680]   And we kind of ignore things like QAnon
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:20.040]   and those have unfortunately real world impacts
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:23.360]   because they still reach so many people.
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:28.080]   And so I agree that we should be promoting good speech,
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.000]   but I also think that's kind of what we're doing
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.240]   with some of the things like,
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:32.960]   remember the COVID-19 banners?
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:35.360]   I think they're still around for some sites.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:39.920]   So I'm not a, I agree with you, Jeff,
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:41.520]   but I'm also like, I don't think that's enough.
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:43.160]   - Yeah, I'm not saying you get rid of the efforts
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.680]   that there's so many efforts going on.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:45.520]   They're not gonna go away.
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.360]   They're there.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:49.240]   But now let us turn some resource and attention
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:52.440]   to promoting good speech, but also supporting it, right?
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.440]   As art.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:56.240]   The story I always love to tell about this,
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.320]   and I'm telling it in my book coming out next year,
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:02.960]   is that in 1470, a decade and a half after Gutenberg,
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:04.040]   there, Drake,
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:08.640]   Niccolo Peroti said to the Pope,
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.840]   you've got to appoint a censor,
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.920]   'cause this, you've got to prove the stuff
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:13.360]   in the press, it's all a mess.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:14.840]   But he wasn't asking for a censor.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:15.960]   He was asking for quality control.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.600]   He was asking for editors and publishers.
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.480]   He was asking for new institutions
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:21.160]   that didn't exist at the time
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.760]   to try to support and assure quality.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.760]   When Harper's came out in 1850,
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:26.720]   they kind of did the same thing.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.440]   They said, "Oh, there's so much stuff coming out now
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:31.320]   "because of faster presses and we've got tons of content.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.480]   "We're gonna create a whole magazine
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:35.040]   "that's gonna try to bring you the best of it."
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.400]   That's what I'm trying to suggest here is,
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:41.400]   and so we start trying to promote art and intelligence.
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:45.000]   We're not gonna get any of it.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.520]   So I'm just trying to urge investment there too.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:51.480]   That's it.
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.800]   - I think you're right.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:53.640]   I do.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:58.320]   I think this is a specific instance
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.440]   of a kind of a larger case
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:03.480]   where we sometimes miss the forest for the trees,
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:07.560]   where we get so concerned with something else
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.400]   that distracts us from,
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:11.760]   I think that a lot of respects a lot of the complaints
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.720]   about the internet in general.
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:17.040]   - This is, I'm starting to turn into Jeff Charkvis.
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:17.880]   - Uh oh.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.680]   (laughing)
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.400]   Distract us from the benefits
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.280]   because we're so worried about
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.400]   trying to do something about the harms.
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.840]   - Which we're not gonna ever,
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.520]   Stacy's absolutely right.
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:32.120]   We can't completely ignore them, we can't take down.
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.000]   It's like, with me saying, Matt Cott's,
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.160]   don't bother us family anymore.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.000]   - No, no, no.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.960]   No, you still gotta do what we do.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.800]   - You point him out.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.640]   - I'll pay it down.
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:40.480]   - Yeah, you point it out.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.080]   You say, "Yeah, it's, but."
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:45.720]   It's kind of like, and this seems discredited now,
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.880]   that the old antidote to bad speech was more speech.
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:50.720]   - Right.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:51.560]   - I don't think it's discredited at all.
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:56.560]   It's Brandeis, it was the best proponent of that.
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:59.960]   And in fact, I was just, I was just editing that chapter
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.400]   where I mentioned three efforts to disagree with that
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:05.040]   and say, "Well, it's just proven."
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.120]   No, I don't think in the long run, that's true.
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:13.120]   I read John Ariel Pajitica, the famous defensive free speech
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:17.360]   that argues that in the long run, the truth will out.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.840]   In the short run, it won't.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:23.840]   I quote a book from the 1970s,
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:29.080]   where Rabbi Lullifield, the father of a famous
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.600]   New York journalist, New York Times journalist,
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:35.000]   said in the short run, "Truth won't win, either,
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.760]   "but in the long run it will."
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.280]   And we've got to try to keep that in mind,
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:42.840]   not to give up now, but to try to put our resources
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.040]   and our attention to what's good,
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.880]   or else we're not just not gonna get it, that's all.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.280]   - Yeah.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.200]   It has been used in some negative ways.
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.540]   Clarence Thomas cited Brandeis'
[01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:55.920]   counter speech passage when he,
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:01.040]   in Laurel Lard versus Riley when he invalidated
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.440]   a number of restrictions on tobacco advertising.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:07.600]   - Yeah, I'm not the only one. - If the state of Massachusetts
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:10.760]   concern is that tobacco advertising communicates a message
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:13.080]   with which it disagrees, it should seek to counteract
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.800]   that message with, and then quoting Brandeis,
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:19.480]   "More speech, not enforced silence."
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:22.560]   - That's an example where I agree with Stacy,
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:25.960]   you know, the tobacco advertising, you could stop that.
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.040]   You could stop that.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:33.040]   - So Tim Wu asked whether the First Amendment is obsolete.
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:34.280]   That scares me.
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.680]   - Oh, man.
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:39.720]   Phil Napoli, who's an academic, I respect a great deal,
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:41.760]   wrote a paper saying, "What if more speech
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.680]   "is no longer the solution, just to this point?"
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:47.640]   My online friend Ian Beggost, who's brilliant,
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:50.320]   is watching University Now, wrote a piece in The Atlantic
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:53.200]   saying, "What do people shouldn't say so much,
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.880]   "and shouldn't say it to so many so often?"
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:56.160]   And I get that, that's a point of advice,
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:57.720]   like, do you really need to add a hot take?
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:59.560]   Though I find it ironic this comes in The Atlantic,
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:02.000]   which is nothing but a hot, lot of flow of hot takes.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.800]   But anyway, yeah, we've got a meter of what we do
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:10.800]   as well online, yet, where are the patrons
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:13.200]   of the arts in this world?
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:16.840]   Where do we gotta get more TikTok musicals to irritate and?
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:18.360]   - That's what I want.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:20.960]   - Is it binary like that?
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:24.080]   Is it like, no, no, you have free speech
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:27.280]   or you have, it's not binary.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.120]   - Prab.
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:28.960]   - No, not at all.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:32.360]   It's just that we're so monomaniacal right now
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:34.840]   about all the bad stuff that we're giving attention
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.480]   to the bad guys, which is what they want.
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:37.320]   - What they want.
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.160]   - They want it in their hands.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:41.000]   And we're harming the freedoms of the internet overalls
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.720]   by fear, you know that about me.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.320]   But again, it's kind of about investment.
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:46.760]   Where's the person who's gonna support,
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:48.720]   so the press comes out and there's a lot of junk
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.760]   in the world, but who's supporting Michelangelo?
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:51.600]   - Right.
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.440]   - You know, that's awesome.
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:55.120]   - But Stacey, are you worried that that kind of doctrine
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:58.800]   is gonna encourage just more hate speech?
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:02.840]   - I'm not worried about hate speech.
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:06.640]   I'm worried about weaponized misinformation, I guess.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:10.840]   That's, I mean, yeah, that's what I'm worried about.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.600]   I mean, I'm sad about hate speech as a person.
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:13.440]   - Well, that's the thing.
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.280]   I mean, especially as a woman,
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:17.080]   I mean, you are much more the target of this
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.520]   than any guy online.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.160]   - Yep.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:21.240]   - And as a black person,
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:22.400]   you're probably much more the target
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.160]   than any white person online.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:26.360]   So I can understand how,
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:28.080]   if you're the target of this stuff,
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.520]   you might say, well, we gotta do something.
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:31.680]   - Right.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:33.880]   - It's easy for me to say, oh yeah,
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.160]   and Jeff, two old white guys to say,
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:40.720]   yeah, go ahead, let a thousand flowers bloom.
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:41.560]   But--
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:42.920]   - And I think, I would say,
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:44.880]   and I don't know how Aunt would respond,
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:48.840]   but like, if I received a lot of hate speech on Twitter,
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:49.680]   which I don't--
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:51.640]   - You don't actually, which is weird.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:53.960]   - Don't encourage it.
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:54.800]   - No, I'm not.
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.520]   - I'm like, I'm okay with that.
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.680]   Nobody needs to--
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:58.760]   - We're not.
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:00.840]   - But if I received it,
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.160]   I would just leave Twitter.
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:03.000]   - Yeah.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.520]   - And presumably, I mean,
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.640]   would I be sad not sharing pictures
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:08.920]   of my dog with everybody?
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:09.760]   Sure.
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:13.520]   Would it have a noticeable impact of my business?
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.480]   - Am I?
[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:16.320]   - Probably not.
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:17.160]   - No, I mean--
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:18.600]   - It really has promotional value.
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:20.040]   - It has promotional value,
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.920]   but I mean, worst case scenario,
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:25.920]   I could always have a bot account,
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.360]   if I wanted to do that or something.
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:30.360]   I mean, but I would just basically,
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.440]   I would basically tweet out only my stories
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:34.720]   and not engage with people, and that would be that.
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:37.160]   - But that's where a lot of the bigger companies
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:38.040]   are doing anyway.
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.000]   You look at somebody like Nike,
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.680]   yeah, that's first company comes to my mind.
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:44.360]   They have a Twitter account, Facebook account,
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:45.880]   or whatever, and they post something,
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:47.840]   hey, we stand with someone, so,
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:52.480]   hey, this is the new shoe, and then it's done, they're gone.
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:54.200]   They don't come back and do comments,
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:55.200]   they don't do anything like that.
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.360]   It's just sort of just--
[01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:57.360]   - Well, and that was Elon Musk
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:59.360]   - Would it have played about the top 10 Twitter users
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:01.280]   like Taylor Swift, she just promotes,
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.680]   she doesn't hang around.
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:03.520]   Why should she?
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:04.520]   She's just gonna get back.
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:07.160]   - Yeah, she's not, she has no--
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:08.000]   - There's no--
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.280]   - If he wants her to engage,
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:11.360]   he needs to set up some different rules.
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:14.360]   - Yeah, she's just gonna do the real Twitter.
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.200]   - And also--
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:16.560]   - That's a mass way to look at it,
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:17.400]   is if you've gotta have--
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:18.240]   - Yeah.
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:19.400]   - A million people to be real, no.
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:23.920]   - And Taylor Swift probably doesn't wanna engage on Twitter
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:25.800]   because why would you wanna talk to that many people?
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:26.640]   You would never.
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:27.480]   - Yeah.
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:30.800]   Breaking news.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:32.400]   - We were gonna talk about T-Mobile, no?
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:33.240]   We're not--
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:34.720]   - Yes, I will get to that, but that's breaking news.
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.640]   T-Mobile's is also, but less important.
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.480]   Cameo just laid off, according to Yanko,
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:43.040]   Ricker's writing a protocol, your friend Yanko,
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:45.560]   who's great cover of media.
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.440]   He was a variety, I'm glad to see he's got a protocol.
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:48.280]   Protocol is--
[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:49.120]   - Protocol is for that, Dan.
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:49.960]   - Yeah, they're doing it in the great job.
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:51.760]   - He was one of the original protocol, please.
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:54.000]   - Was he, oh, he went back then.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.800]   - No, he's been a protocol for--
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:57.240]   - Oh, he was, yes, 'cause they're new.
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:58.920]   That's right, yeah, yeah.
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:32:59.760]   Relatively new.
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:04.160]   Cameo lays off close to 90, including the CPO, CTO,
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.320]   and VP of marketing.
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:09.080]   Cameo, I don't know how you lose money on this.
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.840]   They are the company that charges
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:13.000]   that lets celebrities come there to charge, you know,
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.520]   50 bucks, 100 bucks, 500 bucks, to do quick greetings.
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:21.200]   It was huge during the pandemic.
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:23.000]   - Well, that's probably your answer.
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.320]   - Yeah.
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.240]   - We're tired of things.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.320]   It was cute for a while, but then
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:30.320]   then Rudy Giuliani shows up.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.280]   There goes the neighborhood.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:32.880]   - Yeah, this is what they're saying.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:38.880]   Stephen Galenis, the CEO, says,
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:41.080]   "We hired a lot of people quickly,
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:44.440]   "and market conditions have rapidly changed since then.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.880]   "Accordingly, we have right size to the business
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:50.240]   "to best reflect the new realities."
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:51.400]   - That makes sense.
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.640]   People aren't spending money on stuff like that.
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:54.480]   - On stupid stuff.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.360]   - You know, it's just not, it's as money as tight nowadays.
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:00.200]   - But you can get last minute delivery for Mother's Day.
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:03.720]   Get the perfect gift for mom.
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:04.560]   (laughs)
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:05.400]   - So much.
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:07.360]   (laughs)
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.560]   - A Mother's Day gift she'll never expect and never forget.
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:12.000]   - You know what your mom wants?
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.400]   Your mom wants you to come.
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:14.400]   - Your phone call.
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:16.640]   - You just want to pull something off like that
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:18.360]   when my mom's-- - Not someone famous.
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.960]   - I'm imagining my mom getting a thing
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:24.120]   from whoever's on there, and she'd just be like,
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.360]   "The heck?
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.760]   "Stacey, I want you to talk to me."
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:28.560]   - Wouldn't you like,
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:31.520]   wouldn't your mom like the bachelor to say hi, mom?
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:34.080]   - My mom doesn't know who the bachelor is, good Lord.
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:36.400]   - That would be the really, the height of dumb
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:37.880]   to send her something like that.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:39.640]   She goes, "Why is this strange person?"
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:40.640]   (laughs)
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:41.480]   - Who is this? - Yeah.
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:42.480]   - He's hiding me.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:43.720]   - What's going on?
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:46.640]   - My mom is a science fiction loving day trader.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.520]   - Oh, let's see who we can find for mommy.
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:49.440]   - Yeah.
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:50.280]   - Let's see.
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:52.160]   - If you got Neil Gaiman to do it, she'd be excited.
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:53.800]   - Neil, yeah, I don't think Neil makes you okay.
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:54.640]   - Okay, all right.
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:55.480]   - How are you?
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:56.640]   - Well, for charity, he might.
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:57.480]   - Yeah.
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:58.320]   - He might.
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:00.600]   - Oh, Hugh Laurie, is he a good Lord?
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:02.440]   - No, I said Hugh Howie, but Hugh Laurie would be--
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:03.280]   - Oh.
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:04.720]   - I was like, Hugh Laurie, she'd do.
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:06.840]   - It is kind of like his character house.
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.160]   - If you're a Hollywood celebrity,
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:11.720]   it's kind of like appearing on The Love Boat, right?
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:12.920]   It's kind of like a sign--
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:14.160]   - Oh, it's always below that.
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:16.000]   - You're kind of on the land.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.960]   - It's below Summer Theater.
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:19.800]   - Yeah.
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:20.640]   - Tuscalo--
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:21.760]   - Lori Berkner.
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:25.040]   - Singer in the Lori Berkner band, she's only $125.
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:25.880]   You want her?
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:27.880]   I can arrange for her to say hi to you.
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:29.240]   - No, but my daughter loves--
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.920]   Actually, her music was lovely.
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:31.760]   - Oh, okay.
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:33.600]   - She does kids' music, so you can do that
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:34.840]   for your kids' birthday.
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:37.480]   - Oh, yeah, see, that's cute.
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:39.080]   Yeah, you could see the problem here.
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:42.640]   Part of the problem is also actors are going back to work.
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:44.280]   They are no longer sitting around the house
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.440]   wishing they were working.
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:48.560]   They actually go do some movies and TV shows and stuff.
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:51.520]   - Why don't you get on cameo and see how you do?
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.080]   I'd be so curious.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.160]   - What should I say?
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:56.720]   - Well, they'll tell you what to say.
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:57.560]   - They'll tell you what to say.
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:58.880]   - Yeah, but don't you want to have like
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.360]   your trademark thing that you say?
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.720]   - Hey, hey, hey!
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.960]   (laughing)
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.240]   How about if I pay them?
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:10.200]   (laughing)
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:12.280]   I'll pay you to take my video.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:13.280]   How about that?
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:17.840]   Yeah, the only thing I'm famous for is saying
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:19.640]   screw you to Mike Arrington.
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:20.880]   I could do that.
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:22.160]   - Oh, I saw that.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.000]   - Yeah.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:23.840]   - That was hilarious.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:24.680]   (laughing)
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:26.080]   - Apparently, we have some stickers.
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.440]   You can bring the stickers in?
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:32.000]   - Could you go get me that sticker?
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.280]   - Whatever happened to Mike Arrington?
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:35.120]   - He--
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:36.480]   - He worked to Washington State.
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:37.600]   And now he's in--
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:38.840]   - He's around somewhere.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.960]   Yeah, he's like hiding out.
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.960]   Last time I saw him, he wouldn't shake my hand.
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:44.160]   Not 'cause he doesn't like me,
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:46.520]   but because he was germaphobe.
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:48.520]   So these stickers,
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:51.200]   this is gonna be my new cameo thing, I think.
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:52.200]   - You can do the sticker then.
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:53.560]   - We made stickers out of this.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:55.320]   - Uncle Leo one is in there.
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:57.600]   - Oh, look at, whoa, John, you got a lot of stickers.
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:58.560]   - This is a ton of stuff.
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.440]   - Holy cow!
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:03.640]   John's been collecting stickers, but this is my favorite.
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:10.520]   It says, "Remember kids, Uncle Leo says, 'Screw you!'
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.720]   - Put that on your cameo.
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:15.040]   (laughing)
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:16.240]   - Except that here's the problem.
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:18.840]   I just did that cameo for free.
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.080]   (laughing)
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.240]   - Yeah, there you go.
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.600]   (laughing)
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:23.720]   - Oh, he lives in Miami.
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:24.560]   - That's not how this works.
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:27.080]   - He lives in Miami, is he writing?
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:28.560]   - He has a crypto fund.
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.000]   - Oh, of course he does.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:30.840]   - Of course he does.
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:34.160]   - If you can't do cameo, do crypto, right?
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:35.440]   - Clearly.
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:38.600]   - Yeah, he doesn't, I mean, he's,
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.280]   this is not a flattering picture of him
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:41.760]   on TechCrunch the site.
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:42.600]   (laughing)
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.360]   - He was the founder, for those who don't know,
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:46.600]   he was the founder of TechCrunch, a lawyer,
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:50.400]   and TechCrunch in the early days of .com was huge.
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:51.240]   - Big.
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:52.080]   - Yeah.
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:53.880]   - That was how you found out who the next big thing was.
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:55.760]   - I had very long conversations with him,
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:56.960]   trying to, he was trying to understand,
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.000]   "What do I do with this thing?
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.160]   It's taking it off."
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.320]   - Yeah.
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:02.200]   Yeah, it was a huge success.
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:03.960]   - Well, why did you say, "Screw you" to him?
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.680]   - What was he, I remember?
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:07.440]   - Do you wanna watch a video?
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:08.280]   - Sure.
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:10.160]   (laughing)
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:12.840]   - Let me see, I bet you I can find it.
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:15.760]   - I mean, he basically called you like a shill.
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:17.720]   - Yeah, he called me a shill.
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:22.720]   We used to do, I used to host the Gilmore Gang.
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:28.080]   This was 13 years ago on, on Twitch.
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:31.920]   So, that was Steve Gilmore,
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:34.720]   and then Mike Harrington was on a bunch of other people.
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:37.280]   We're on it, and I was doing a review
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:40.080]   of the new Palm Pre-R.
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.720]   - Pre, which I really liked.
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:42.760]   - A lot of people liked it.
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:43.600]   - Yeah.
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.320]   - I don't know, are you happy with it?
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.240]   - Love it.
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:48.080]   - Why?
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:48.920]   - It's quite impressive.
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.480]   Well, you know, I thought that--
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:51.320]   - Okay.
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:52.160]   - Kevin Marks was on there.
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.760]   - It was like, it's young Kevin Marks.
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.640]   - Like, let's get the disclosures out of the way right away.
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:57.240]   - This is a one-week review unit.
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:58.600]   I couldn't get one, and unfortunately,
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:38:59.520]   I don't think I'll be able to get,
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.440]   I was gonna go out and get one this afternoon.
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.640]   - So you got a free pre,
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:04.560]   you're one of the very two people that got a free review.
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.240]   - Not at all, I think there are quite a few reviewers
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.080]   who asked for you.
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:08.920]   - I'm, Mike, that's BS,
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:11.280]   and I'm really pissed off that you would imply it in some way
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:14.040]   that this free quote, free pre that I sent back
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:16.680]   in seven days, but in any way, predisposed me.
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:17.520]   Screw you.
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:18.360]   - What are you gonna do about it?
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:19.360]   - Mike, you are such a troll.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:20.240]   Screw you.
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.560]   - Okay, it gets worse from there.
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.600]   - Yeah, it does.
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:23.960]   Cause was second.
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:27.520]   Look right there in the bottom right corner on the screen.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:29.520]   I know that guy that has Lauren, right?
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:30.520]   - Oh yeah!
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:33.040]   - And I'm just watching Lauren the whole time.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:33.880]   - Oh Kevin left!
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:34.880]   - He is the troll.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.320]   He is the troll of trolls.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.720]   He had trolled me for years.
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:40.840]   - He did a puppet thing, right?
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:41.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:43.240]   - He's still around him puppets, yeah.
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:44.080]   - I don't wanna know.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:45.200]   - Lauren just sits there.
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.160]   I'm looking at him, looking at his expression
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.320]   while all of this is going on.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:49.720]   - Well look, he loves his fights.
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:50.560]   He loves his fights.
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:51.760]   - Kevin just ran.
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:53.400]   Kevin just ran.
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:54.240]   - I'm not kidding.
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:55.240]   - I would run too, I'm with Kevin.
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:58.760]   I'd be like, oh, yeah, this is upsetting.
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:39:59.760]   - I'm sorry I asked you.
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.760]   - Let's go back to happy news.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:03.040]   (laughing)
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:04.440]   - I thought that was funny.
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:07.360]   - And everybody thinks, oh, the internet used to be really nice.
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:08.640]   And people all were going along.
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:10.040]   - That was 2009.
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:10.880]   That was 2009.
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:11.720]   - I thought that was a little late.
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:14.360]   - 13 years, 'cause you went off the note.
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:16.360]   - I lost it, and I felt bad about it.
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:18.320]   In fact, I called Mike later and apologized,
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.880]   and I apologized to Steve Gilmore.
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:22.520]   But I stopped doing Gilmore King.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.320]   (laughing)
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:27.880]   - Well, it was, look, it had been a,
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:29.320]   wasn't that incident.
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:32.000]   It was a series of incidents of him.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.480]   He was, that was one of the things he really liked to do
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:36.720]   was needle people. - We don't.
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.840]   - And insinuate without coming out and saying it.
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:40.680]   - Yeah.
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:43.720]   - And after several months of that,
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:45.680]   I find, that's when I finally blew, but there's no--
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:47.080]   - I actually liked Mike.
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:48.000]   - I did too, that's a thing.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:48.840]   - That's a very smart guy.
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.320]   He was doing it two things.
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.640]   But yeah, he just, he had a thing.
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:53.760]   He had to be difficult.
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:55.120]   - You wanna know something?
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.840]   - He's blocked me on Twitter.
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.200]   - Good for you.
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:40:59.440]   - I don't even know the cat.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:02.240]   Why did he block me? - I wonder if he blocked me.
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:03.200]   - I am, I could take a time.
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:04.280]   - I remember he blocked me.
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:06.600]   I remember finding that he blocked me a couple of years ago.
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:07.880]   I'm like, I don't even know this guy.
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:09.240]   Why am I blocked?
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:11.600]   - How do you find when someone blocks you?
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:13.680]   - When you go to look him up and it shows.
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:14.520]   (laughing)
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:17.080]   Yeah, if you look at your name and I say he's blocked.
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:19.040]   He's probably blocked anybody who has anything to do with me.
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:19.880]   I would imagine.
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:21.320]   - Maybe that's it.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:25.480]   - Amazon responding to the Supreme Court,
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:28.160]   potential Supreme Court decision on Roe v. Wade,
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:31.440]   says we will reimburse employee travel from board.
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:33.040]   - That is such a.
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:34.200]   Here's why.
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:38.040]   If you wanna take a stand against abortions,
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:41.760]   if you really believe that this is a big problem
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:45.400]   for your company, you say, hey,
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:48.600]   I'm not gonna have my operations at a state with.
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:49.480]   - Just be so lost. - Move out.
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:50.320]   Move out.
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:51.160]   - There you go.
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:52.000]   - Don't say I was. - Hit in the pocket
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:52.920]   or in every state. - Don't.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.400]   - That was the problem.
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:57.560]   - They're not, well, they are, but do it that way.
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:58.400]   - They'd have to move out of 20 states.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:41:59.720]   - And tell the people who live there.
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:02.760]   - But Stacy, Stacy, that doesn't make this bad.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:05.760]   That doesn't make, should they do more, I agree.
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:07.800]   But that doesn't make this itself bad.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:09.920]   - This itself is bad because already--
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:11.320]   - All right, a couple of people come out to say it.
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:12.560]   - It's kind of like green washing your same.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:16.000]   - No, Levi's Strauss, Levi's also has come out,
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.480]   but, and we'll see more.
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:19.800]   I mean, A, this isn't an actual opinion yet,
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:24.280]   but B, saying you'll look out for your employees,
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:28.880]   has the reason America is dealing with issues associated
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.360]   with like healthcare and costs.
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:32.600]   Like many of our costs are associated with this,
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:35.080]   is because we're reliant on our companies
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:38.120]   to pay for things like this.
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.000]   We don't have a social network that beholds people
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.080]   to these companies for all kinds of things
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:47.600]   that really the government probably should provide.
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:48.800]   I personally-- - I've never understood
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.760]   why companies don't, aren't saying exactly
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:51.920]   what you're saying, Stacy,
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:53.600]   'cause why should they want to pay this?
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:55.200]   I've never understood why they weren't the ones
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:56.000]   fighting for single things.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.600]   - It was a deal, so it was a deal way back.
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:00.800]   Oh, how did this start?
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:02.160]   There's a really good book.
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:06.200]   I'm not gonna make this up, but sorry.
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:07.840]   - I'll go ahead, make it up, go ahead.
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:09.760]   - No, Stacy doesn't, Stacy doesn't--
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.600]   - Stacy's a journalist. - Stacy's a journalist.
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:14.280]   - Oh, jeez, this is not a hot taker.
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:18.200]   - Basically, when they were coming up with Medicare,
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:21.920]   Medicaid, and all of the social security programs,
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:24.920]   basically the government did this thing,
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:27.680]   they basically agreed with the big industries of the day
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:29.320]   that they would provide health insurance.
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:31.240]   And I can't remember reason why, but--
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:34.840]   - Well, it's shameful when a company like Walmart
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:36.440]   doesn't pay its employees sufficiently,
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.400]   so they have to be on food stamps
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:41.720]   and get government health care.
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:44.840]   That's basically Walmart leaching on the US government.
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:48.360]   You think, I don't think the government expected that,
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:49.520]   did they?
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:54.520]   - No, and I would also argue that if you look at
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:58.560]   where the Republican party seems to be going,
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:00.800]   both with how they're--
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.440]   - Well, don't get us started on this.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.360]   - Sorry, the cynic can be looked--
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:06.520]   - Where the Republican party is going
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:08.880]   is a conversation due to--
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:10.360]   - Yeah, sorry.
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:13.560]   - The cynic in me looks at some of the policies
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:18.120]   and says, "Hey, many of the policies that we're enacting
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:22.520]   "as a country really just create a more indentured population
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:24.760]   "that requires them to have these low wage--
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:25.600]   - Absolutely, that's right.
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:26.440]   - For happy jobs.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:29.520]   In capitalism originally was built on slavery.
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:32.280]   - And those chickens are coming home to roost, I have to say.
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:33.120]   - Yeah.
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:34.840]   - Between income inequality,
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:37.840]   ridiculously low minimum wages,
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:41.080]   wage slavery effectively, lack of health care.
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:45.960]   Now this latest pending decision from the Supreme Court,
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:49.240]   which is an assault on women,
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:51.680]   I can't believe that we're gonna go on like this.
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:52.920]   Something has to snap.
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:54.080]   - Oh, we are.
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:56.760]   - I don't think we are.
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.080]   - People are not snapping.
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:01.040]   People are going to their jobs and doing everything
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:04.880]   because, I mean, what are we doing right here right now, Leo?
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:06.800]   We are talking about technology.
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:07.640]   - Yeah.
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.560]   - We're not, I mean, honestly,
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.040]   I'm kind of-- - If there were a general strike--
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:12.920]   - I was thinking about this last night.
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:15.400]   If we're agreed, we're gonna do a general strike
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:16.520]   on Friday.
[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:18.960]   I would go dark, we would go dark in this station.
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:20.320]   - Yeah. - Absolutely.
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:21.680]   - Yeah. - Absolutely.
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:23.080]   - Stacey, I put that story in there
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:24.360]   because it's the only story I could find
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:27.840]   that was related to the abortion decision and tech.
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:31.560]   - Oh, you didn't see the story about, you know,
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:34.440]   governments potentially looking to buy data,
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:36.000]   location data. - Oh, isn't that--
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.280]   - There's a story. - Positive side, right?
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:41.080]   - In fact, I saw somebody saying, you know,
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:43.880]   if you're using a menstrual application
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:45.960]   and monitor your menstrual period,
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:49.880]   you should stop because that could be used against you.
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:53.080]   If abortion becomes illegal, that data could be used
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:53.920]   against you.
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:55.920]   And then this story that in fact,
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:59.680]   who is it selling this information?
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:01.760]   - Political-- - Peter Thiel
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:03.080]   was supposedly involved in one of them.
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:06.720]   I'm trying to-- - Well, that's the CDC story.
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:08.520]   - Safe graph says, Mr. Right there.
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:09.720]   - Safe graph, that's who it is.
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:11.840]   - Safe graph is selling information
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:16.760]   about who visits abortion clinics,
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:20.760]   both coming and going, on sale by a data broker,
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:24.680]   including information from Planned Parenthood.
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:25.520]   And guess what?
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:28.120]   Hey, gang, it's only $160.
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:29.840]   - Oh my gosh.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:34.480]   - It's only, and this comes from your phone records, right?
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.000]   - This is real. - This is one of those things.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.520]   Okay, this is not-- - By the way,
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:41.680]   credits advice who got this story.
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:45.520]   They actually paid a data broker $160 for that information.
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:47.320]   - Yeah, and vice actually did a story earlier
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:51.360]   about the CDC getting location data on people
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:53.120]   following COVID curve history anyway.
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:54.760]   - We're getting the wrong hands.
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:56.520]   - So here's a couple hours ago,
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:58.360]   it says they have stopped selling--
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.960]   - Oh, they got caught, so they stopped.
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:01.360]   - Oh, yeah, they got caught.
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:03.920]   - Okay. - This is, we need new,
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:05.680]   so like, there are rules in place
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:08.440]   for personally identifiable information, PII, right?
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:09.760]   - PII.
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:14.040]   - And we need to include location data as PII
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:17.200]   because there's no way you can anonymize
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:19.760]   a person's location data, period.
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:23.560]   You know where they go, you know where they live.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:27.240]   Any location map can be attributed
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:29.520]   to an individual very easily.
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:32.200]   And that, I know it sucks.
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.840]   We love location data.
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:37.320]   The entire ad industry is like salivating,
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:40.320]   but we have to actually classify that as PII,
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:43.160]   and we have to have really strict rules about
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:44.880]   who can access it and how.
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:47.200]   - For a long time, I've been defending
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:49.960]   the invasions of privacy saying,
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:50.920]   "Well, where's the harms?
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:51.840]   I wanna see the harms."
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:53.440]   It's just selling ad tracking.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:55.440]   It's just selling for ads.
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:56.840]   And I now see the harms.
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:00.320]   And we add so nearly, it is very clear
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:02.480]   how this could be misused.
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:05.160]   - If you're state, so one of the,
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:08.120]   the period tracking data is interesting because,
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:11.960]   A, there's been several stories over the last couple of years
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:13.920]   about how much, they haven't really gained
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:17.760]   like outrage and traction, but those apps take a lot of data
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:20.480]   and then they also sell it to a lot of people.
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:22.320]   So that's a problem.
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:24.320]   But then if you're looking at some states
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:27.960]   or looking at like, "Hey, could we maybe prevent abortion
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:31.640]   and like sue people or add their stuff?"
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:32.480]   - Or get, could we get--
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:33.800]   - Let's get, are they dangerous?
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:34.880]   - They want jurisdiction.
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:35.720]   - Yeah.
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:38.640]   - They want jurisdiction over people who are not in,
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:41.000]   'cause if you're murdering babies the next state over,
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:41.840]   that's a problem for them.
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:43.000]   - Oh, we gotta get you, yeah.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000]   - So they're saying, "Hey, if you conceive in our state,
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.160]   then you're also under our jurisdiction
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:50.360]   and you can't get an abortion," which is an interesting idea.
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:52.000]   And the only way you could figure out
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.560]   if someone's conceiving in your state is combining
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:57.360]   that sort of, now they're not doing that now.
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:02.480]   And if you were a lawyer, but yeah,
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:04.240]   we have to be aware of how much data
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:08.360]   we're giving these companies and how it's,
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:11.840]   I mean, it can be used by the states.
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:15.160]   They've already talked about using it in ways
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:18.280]   that are really creepy and we can't wait for the courts
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:19.800]   to come in and say, "This is bad,"
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:22.360]   because by that time someone's lives,
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:24.800]   probably many people's lives have already been ruined.
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:26.200]   - Well, Stacy, I think it's gonna be worse than that.
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:28.360]   If you look at the, at the Alito opinion,
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:31.600]   what he's basically killing is the--
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:32.440]   - The right to privacy.
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.160]   - Right to privacy.
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:37.560]   So it kills a lot of things and it kills, I think,
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.880]   the principle to stand on to do is just what you just asked for.
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:41.800]   The courts will start throwing that out
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:43.440]   if we lose the right, 'cause there's no right
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:45.000]   to privacy in the Constitution.
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.400]   It was created out of the various parts.
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:49.040]   I wrote about a whole book about this.
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:52.360]   And if that, if the one gets pulled up underneath that,
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:54.680]   it's not just this, it's obviously all the issues
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:57.840]   of who you choose to sleep with and who you choose to marry,
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:49:59.400]   but it's everything else too.
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:01.600]   It goes into privacy in the internet
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:04.840]   and says that any data can be grabbed up by government.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:05.680]   - Yeah.
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:09.440]   - I mean, honestly, the reason I was so
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:11.160]   sanguine about data collections,
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:14.240]   I thought, well, the government would never do that.
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:16.520]   - Oh, naive it's-- - Clearly, well,
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:17.800]   wasn't naive today, maybe not.
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:20.120]   Maybe it was optimism.
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:23.320]   But I really thought we lived in a better place
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:25.760]   where government wouldn't do that,
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:28.960]   but it's clear that some state government certainly will.
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:30.920]   - Some people want that.
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:34.320]   I mean, the issue, yeah, the issue is when the state
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:38.240]   has access to this information, they can punish you.
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:40.120]   And I mean, hello, in 1984.
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:40.960]   - Yep.
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:42.400]   So-- - Okay, I'm too incensed.
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:43.240]   We got it.
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:45.080]   - No, I am too, so-- - It's your heart rate now.
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:46.080]   - Yeah, really.
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:48.400]   (laughing)
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:49.240]   - Like check it.
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:50.480]   - Team Mobile, here's some team double news.
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:54.800]   And this is actually IoT, I think IoT interesting news.
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:58.160]   I have Verizon and T-Mobile both offer residential internet
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:50:59.920]   using their 5G networks, which,
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:04.080]   unless you are near, I think, a 5G tower
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:07.440]   with ultra wideband, the midband,
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:10.120]   the lowband, I don't think, is fast enough,
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:11.480]   that's just LTE.
[01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:13.680]   Or maybe you're luckily and you've got the millimeter wave,
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:16.440]   but if you're near a fast enough 5G tower,
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:17.440]   these are pretty good deals.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:19.680]   My daughter lives in Marin,
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:22.920]   and I had a Verizon phone there,
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:24.680]   and I said, wow, you're really,
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:27.080]   you're getting ultra wideband, and it's fast.
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:29.200]   So when it was time to get her internet
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.200]   for a new apartment, instead of getting Comcast,
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:33.080]   it's 60 bucks a month.
[01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:34.320]   I already have a Verizon account,
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:35.840]   I was able to get 25 bucks a month,
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:37.520]   get this Verizon wireless.
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:38.800]   - A Finto sales?
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:41.800]   - No, yeah, it's not a Finto sale
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:43.600]   'cause it's not for your cell phone.
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:48.280]   It's a little Wi-Fi receiver that uses the 5G,
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:50.560]   but it's 380 megabits down,
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:53.280]   and I've been doing tests all through the day.
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:56.640]   19 megabits up for 25 bucks a month.
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:57.840]   - Why not?
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:59.280]   - Now, there's a couple of catches.
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:02.440]   One is it is not as maintainable,
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:04.760]   or there aren't as many settings.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:08.880]   For instance, I don't, to protect my privacy,
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:12.880]   I use a next DNS from my DNS provider
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:14.800]   and do a lot of blocking at the house.
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.680]   You can't change your DNS provider.
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:20.920]   Verizon clearly wants all that private information.
[01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:22.400]   - There's a good data in there.
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:23.240]   - And it's data.
[01:52:23.240 --> 01:52:25.120]   - And it's pretty clear Verizon doesn't want you
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:27.120]   to modify the DNS settings.
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:28.320]   - So it's a very limit.
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:30.120]   It's not a great, but it's 25 bucks.
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:31.480]   - Do you want to modify it when your phone?
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:33.400]   - No, no, it's 'cause she's on her.
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:34.240]   Yeah, okay.
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:35.680]   - No, I'm saying if you have a Verizon phone,
[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:37.000]   could you modify it?
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.480]   - Well, I don't know about the phone,
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:41.080]   but you could certainly, if you're using this thing,
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:43.160]   on each computer that connects to it,
[01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:45.680]   you could use next DNS individually.
[01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:47.520]   So you can't modify it the router,
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:50.040]   but nevertheless, even if you do, Verizon knows it's you
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:50.920]   and they know what you're doing.
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:55.160]   So, you know what, Verizon's got a lot of information
[01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:56.000]   from that.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.320]   Team Mobile just announced,
[01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:59.080]   now one of the things Verizon said is,
[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:01.680]   this is an introductory rate we reserve the right to
[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:02.520]   increase it.
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:03.360]   - Okay.
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:04.360]   - Team Mobile just said.
[01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:05.640]   - That's what they normally do, right?
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:08.080]   - We're gonna give you, in home and in it,
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:10.160]   they announced this today for $50 a month
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:12.600]   and we're never gonna change the price.
[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:16.480]   And if you're already a customer, $30 a month.
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:17.560]   - Oh, geez.
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:19.840]   - So this is disruptive, I think.
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.680]   Now, Stacey, you're the IoT expert.
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:22.520]   - Shots fired.
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:24.320]   - But I do feel like if you live in an area
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:26.600]   with 5G Ultra Wideband,
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:28.680]   or as Team Mobile calls it, Ultra Capacity,
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:31.760]   this is a very good choice for that price.
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:33.000]   - Yeah, sounds like a good,
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.320]   I don't know how it deals with IoT,
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:35.520]   but it does do with broadband.
[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:38.480]   - Well, these are IoT devices, really, right?
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:40.480]   - No, they're routers.
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:41.960]   - Well, I call a router.
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:44.240]   I mean, this may be a nomenclature issue,
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:46.360]   but I think anything that goes on the internet,
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:50.320]   it is not a computer, is an IoT device, but okay.
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:51.920]   - Oh, you're one of those people.
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:53.520]   - Oh, man.
[01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:56.520]   - Sorry, sorry, yes.
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:59.720]   - I mean, from a broadband perspective,
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:00.560]   this is good.
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:01.400]   - Huge.
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:02.920]   - It's competition.
[01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:04.920]   It's competition.
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:08.480]   It's also, so, for this is,
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:10.480]   are they using 28 megahertz?
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:12.640]   Are they using the midband for this?
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:15.960]   - They must be because my daughter, like I said,
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:17.960]   380 megabits down, 19 up,
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:20.520]   rock solid day and night, even during commuter hours.
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:23.200]   She's near Highway 101.
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:24.880]   - I imagine they have towers right there,
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:29.880]   so she's probably very proximate to a 5G UW tower.
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:30.800]   - Yeah, sounds good.
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:31.640]   You should buy it.
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:33.640]   - Only, and you should, that's what you should do.
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:35.320]   You should check T-Mobile or Verizon,
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:37.600]   make sure you're getting that 5G.
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:40.800]   Now T-Mobile's offering 15-day home trial.
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:41.640]   And--
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:43.560]   - I thought that was actually pretty disruptive,
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:45.560]   'cause it's not like you can normally test broadband.
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:46.440]   - How else would you know?
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:47.360]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:49.760]   - So now you can actually just very easily bring this in
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:51.840]   and be like, "Hey, this is gonna work for me?"
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:52.680]   Boom.
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:57.680]   - Knock it in for life for both home and business.
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:00.280]   The $30 a month is not, I know, locked in,
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:04.360]   but it's for existing Magenta Max T-Mobile customers.
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:07.960]   They will also give you $50 off any streaming device,
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:09.560]   including Apple TV.
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:11.840]   So it's kind of an encourage that.
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:15.080]   They give you 50% off YouTube TV for a day or so.
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:19.120]   They're really, this is a arrow aimed at the heart
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:20.520]   of the cable companies.
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:26.520]   And they'll help you cancel your--
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:30.600]   - I'll give you some fees. - Consisting up to $500
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:32.680]   at early termination fee coverage.
[01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:35.200]   This is like Comcast coming in.
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:37.400]   - They're at TV, they're just like, "Oh, too."
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:38.240]   - Yeah, right.
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:39.840]   - When they came in, they said, "You know what?
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:41.240]   We'll give you this." - We'll pay your termination fee.
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:43.360]   - Yes. - Oh, yeah.
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:44.200]   Good move.
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:46.960]   - So I think this is pretty amazing.
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:51.800]   You should check to see if you're eligible.
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:55.520]   Verizon did not charge for the router or the equipment.
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:56.880]   There was zero cost for that.
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:58.080]   Same with T-Mobile.
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:55:59.120]   Go ahead.
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:00.920]   - I was gonna say, I would just look at the reviews
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:04.920]   for how it behaves like in rain and other kind of events.
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:07.400]   If they're in the mid band, they should be fine.
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:09.520]   But that's just something to think about.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:12.600]   'Cause as you get up into those higher spectrums,
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:13.760]   they attenuate faster.
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:16.600]   So they don't go through as many walls.
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:18.320]   - They have bushes and trees.
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:21.400]   - Well, but Verizon does want you to put it near a window.
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:24.560]   Although I tested in a variety of positions
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:25.400]   in our apartment.
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:28.440]   It was worked fine, worked the same almost everywhere.
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:33.440]   Let me just do a, I've been doing speed tests on it.
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:35.360]   You can do a remote speed test on it.
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:37.680]   I've been doing speed tests on it just to see
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:39.040]   if it's affected by time of day.
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:40.120]   'Cause that was the other concern.
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:40.960]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:42.520]   - Is that, you know, maybe--
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:43.520]   - Who's on?
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:45.880]   - Yeah, maybe if, you know, the commute hour
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:48.240]   and everybody's on that tower,
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:49.440]   maybe that's not so good.
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:51.000]   Let me, so I'll just run a quick speed test
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:51.840]   while we're talking.
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:55.640]   - My T-Mobile signal is not very good in my neighborhood.
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:56.480]   - Yeah.
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:58.080]   - And it's, I hate that.
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:56:59.440]   - You'd have to be somewhere,
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:01.240]   and that's mostly urban areas
[01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:03.520]   where you're gonna get high speed.
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:06.000]   - But this motivates them to put it more.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.080]   - Well, they are rolling out.
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:07.920]   - Yeah, really, yeah.
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:10.240]   I was gonna say this isn't the same as your mobile,
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:13.880]   I mean, I don't know if they're using the same spectrum
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:16.880]   for their mobile 5G as they are.
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:17.880]   - Oh, you think they're not?
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:18.840]   - They are the name, oh, that's interesting.
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:21.840]   - Yeah, I thought they were doing--
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:23.280]   - Something different, huh?
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:26.120]   - Your mobile 5G is actually in the lower megahertz
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:30.680]   'cause they were using, so, but I don't remember, so--
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:33.680]   - So here's the deal, Verizon, I don't know about,
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:35.040]   but I do know a lot about T-Mobile
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:37.680]   'cause I'm a T-Mobile customer in my main phone.
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:41.640]   They rolled out the 700 megahertz 5G almost universally.
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:42.480]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:44.320]   - They have-- - They have speeds.
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:46.240]   - Okay, okay.
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:50.400]   But that spectrum is gonna be way better.
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:52.760]   It's more crowded and they have tinier channels,
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:55.400]   so they are doing it at LTE speeds,
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:57.400]   but that's because their channels aren't wide enough.
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:57:59.960]   - Oh, so they could be faster down the road, you think?
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:04.360]   - Probably not because they don't have,
[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:07.760]   like it's 700 megahertz, I think your channels are limited
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:09.680]   to either 10 or 20 megahertz wide.
[01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:10.520]   - Right.
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:14.600]   - But for the in-home, if they're using the mid band,
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:16.160]   then they're gonna be using 28,
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:19.200]   and those channels are freaking huge because no one's there.
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:22.000]   So then you could have 100 megahertz channel,
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.600]   and then that means you can pack as many bits as you can
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:27.160]   in each of those megahertz, right?
[01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:28.200]   - Right.
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:32.880]   - So when you say LTE speeds, that's sort of true,
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:36.480]   but the underlying technology, like, I mean, 5G is actually
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:40.480]   really LTE released like 15 through 20.
[01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:41.320]   - Right.
[01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:46.360]   - So I have noted though, when I get the 5G,
[01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:50.920]   UW on my Verizon phone or the 5G, you see on my T-Mobile phone,
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:53.840]   that's when I get those speeds.
[01:58:53.840 --> 01:59:00.560]   So, I mean, maybe someday they'll be on the low band as well,
[01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:02.560]   but I really think it's the mid band
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:05.280]   that they're using for both.
[01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:08.080]   - Here, we should be able to find that out.
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:08.920]   - Yeah, would you?
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:09.760]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:13.000]   - It's a really, I mean, it's kind of very easy to set up.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.120]   You can see the signal strength of it, you know,
[01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:20.720]   on the app, you can, I mean, it's really kind of an amazing,
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:24.280]   it has ethernet ports, so I connected her iMac directly
[01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:27.440]   to it so she could get the highest speed possible.
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:30.560]   But the limitations are--
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:31.400]   - Oh, here it is.
[01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:32.240]   - Go ahead.
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:36.040]   - Their home internet is 1900 megahertz.
[01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:39.720]   Oh, they're using, okay, 1900.
[01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:44.720]   17, 700, 2100, 600, and so, so in 2.5.
[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:48.360]   - So, this is the average--
[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:49.880]   - Okay, so they're actually,
[01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:51.600]   actually most of it's low band.
[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:52.560]   - Interesting.
[01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:54.800]   - So, it's all the same.
[01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:55.640]   So good for them.
[01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:58.920]   So, and I'm wondering how many channels,
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:01.480]   how many megahertz they have at the mid band?
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:07.000]   - So, again, I was getting pretty consistently
[02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.160]   about 380 megabits down and 19 up,
[02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:13.120]   which is honestly, so yeah, 320 down,
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:15.400]   I just did the test, 19.3 up,
[02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:18.160]   latency's a little high, 20 milliseconds latency.
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:20.520]   - Ooh, so you couldn't do the show from it.
[02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:22.200]   - Well, I don't know what the jitter is.
[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:24.160]   - I mean, it works.
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:26.640]   - 20's not awful, milliseconds,
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:30.000]   that's 150th of a second.
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:34.440]   Download again, 320 upload, 19.3.
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:36.440]   Anyway, I think this is--
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:37.600]   Actually, I'm thrilled to see it.
[02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:40.360]   I really feel like T-Mobile's heralding
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:42.040]   it as internet freedom day.
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:45.520]   But I really think it's a shot against the cable companies.
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:47.520]   People are starting to cut the cord.
[02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:49.760]   And this gives them a way to do that.
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:51.360]   I think that's great.
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:53.800]   - I'm still gonna stick with the stupid cable company.
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:55.480]   - Well, I have to too, 'cause I don't have--
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:56.320]   - Yeah, I do too.
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:57.800]   - At home, I don't have anything like that.
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:00.720]   - Personally, I'm spoiled by the speed,
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:03.320]   the download speeds and being able to watch
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:05.240]   the streaming services that I watch
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:08.840]   in very, very high quality is quite nice.
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:11.400]   So there's value in it for me.
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:16.360]   ♪ Ba ba ba ba ♪
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:17.280]   (laughing)
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:18.440]   - What was that?
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:19.840]   What was that?
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:21.360]   - That's just me singing.
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:24.640]   ♪ Ba ba ba ba ba ♪
[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:25.960]   - That's a good thing about it.
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:26.800]   - That's a good thing.
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:27.640]   - There we go.
[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:28.960]   ♪ Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep ♪
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:29.800]   - That was her super super super--
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:32.120]   - Sorry, that was my excited, like,
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:33.320]   I got to nerd out.
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:35.560]   - I feel like I offer the most value,
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:38.600]   but I'm like, "Oh, here's a deeply nerdy topic
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:39.920]   "I can offer some incidents."
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:41.040]   - That's why I brought it up.
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:42.200]   Change the subject.
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:43.040]   - Thank you.
[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:43.880]   - Make you feel better.
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:45.640]   - That in pointing out that routers
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:47.440]   are not IoT devices.
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:48.440]   - I think they are.
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:49.280]   - With this much--
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:51.320]   - Why is that not an IoT device?
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:55.760]   - Okay, look, if we define everything as not being
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:57.880]   a computer, then we have to say, "Well, what's a computer?"
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:00.760]   I mean, my Nest thermostat is actually like a server,
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:01.960]   'cause it's making--
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:05.600]   I mean, so basically when I think IoT devices,
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:08.840]   I think more modern devices.
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:09.840]   - No, everything's a computer,
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:12.760]   but I'm saying no display, no keyboard, no mouse,
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:15.320]   no direct user interface.
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:18.520]   I guess that thermostat has a user interface, yeah.
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:23.480]   - Yeah, I mean, sure, if you wanna call it an IoT device,
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:24.800]   but I certainly don't write a letter about this.
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:25.880]   - Go ahead, be wrong.
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:27.200]   Go ahead, be a fool.
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:28.440]   It's all right, it's with me.
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:32.520]   - You know, I think my sense of it calling an IoT device
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:35.680]   comes from more about security.
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:37.680]   - Yeah, the security people do this all the time
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:39.000]   and it kind of drives me nuts,
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.440]   because they're like, "IOT devices are a huge problem."
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:45.140]   And people are like, "You know what I might--
[02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:46.480]   "They're like my light bulbs."
[02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:47.920]   And I'm like, "It's not your light bulbs,
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:50.560]   "it's your 20 year old network DVR,
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:52.240]   "your 15 year old printers,
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:55.120]   "and your 10 year old routers that are the issue."
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:58.160]   So I feel like, yeah.
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:02:59.160]   - Yeah. - Anyway.
[02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:02.160]   - I am going to declare victory over Facebook.
[02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:03.920]   You can thank me later.
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:07.360]   Facebook has pulled the plug on their podcast business.
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:14.000]   After a year, they will end the short form audio feature,
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.360]   shut the audio hub.
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:18.400]   No more-- - No more for the pivot to audio.
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:20.080]   - Yeah, they work, that was a big deal, right?
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:21.840]   They were gonna do audio, right?
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:23.880]   - Yeah, we didn't even fun a Google for dropping things.
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:26.520]   Google at least waits a few years and forgets about it.
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:27.800]   Facebook drops it in no time.
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:29.880]   - Yeah, that was the big Mark Zuckerberg thing,
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:32.600]   among other things we're gonna pivot to audio.
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:34.800]   Anyway, I-- - Spotify your next--
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:38.400]   - We have out-- - We have out lasted Facebook.
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:40.400]   Oh, no, that I don't think is gonna happen.
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:43.280]   I think Spotify's really moving in hard and fast.
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:44.800]   Let's do a quick change log,
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:47.200]   and then we'll get your picks of the week.
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:48.920]   (upbeat music)
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:51.160]   - The Google change log.
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:53.920]   (dramatic music)
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:59.000]   - Google TV announces favorite channels
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:03.920]   for its line. (laughs)
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:05.360]   - Don't sound so excited, sir.
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:07.040]   - TV TV still didn't already have something,
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:09.160]   but now you can kinda see what's live now
[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:10.000]   with some difference.
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.440]   I don't use YouTube TV, so I've no idea.
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:13.560]   - I used it this morning.
[02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:15.440]   I pressed the button on the YouTube,
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:18.040]   no, this isn't YouTube TV, this is Google TV.
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:18.880]   - Google TV, you're right.
[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:21.640]   - I pressed the button on my Google TV remote,
[02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:26.640]   and I played David Bowie and Freddie Mercury under pressure
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:30.320]   on YouTube music, and then I went to work.
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:33.200]   That's a favorite channel now.
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:35.040]   - It's the perfect use for Google TV.
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:37.280]   - Pressure under pressure.
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:39.280]   - So that's-- - Well, your heart rates up.
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:40.960]   That's the problem. - Yeah, I was dancing
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:43.120]   around the house. - Tell yourself something.
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:46.080]   - Google Play system and updates for May.
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:48.880]   Bring nearby share to self.
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:51.760]   (laughs)
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:53.560]   I don't know what that means.
[02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:56.360]   - Oh, that's what they were talking about when we got on.
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:04:59.320]   They were talking about nearby share, self-sharing.
[02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:02.600]   - I know what nearby share is, it's like Apple's airdrop.
[02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:05.640]   - Yeah, this is now you can share between your devices
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:08.040]   on your-- - Oh, I see.
[02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:11.080]   So you would share to another device that you own.
[02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:12.480]   - Okay. - Right, like me too.
[02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:14.680]   - Why would I share this photo to myself?
[02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:15.520]   I'm here. - Right.
[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:16.400]   - I know, here's the funny thing.
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:18.320]   I could swear we talked about this last week,
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:20.360]   that it's so lacking in memorability.
[02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:23.040]   - We talked about nearby share coming.
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:24.480]   Now it is here. - Oh, it's here.
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:26.240]   - Oh, it's here. - It's a change law.
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:30.800]   - Yes, and a redesign for Google help.
[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:32.880]   And a lot more, and yeah, if you watched all about Android,
[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:34.160]   you'd know all about that.
[02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:37.080]   Nearby share lets you move files across
[02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:38.560]   all your Android devices.
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:39.600]   So that's very cool.
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:41.800]   There it is.
[02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:43.780]   All your Android devices, hassle-free.
[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:48.880]   Google Assistant and Chrome, powered by duplex,
[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:53.520]   can now auto-change stolen passwords.
[02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:56.200]   - Okay. - That is--
[02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:57.840]   - How does it work?
[02:05:57.840 --> 02:06:00.240]   - I hope it tells you what your password is.
[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:01.160]   (laughs)
[02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:02.200]   - No, it'll remember it,
[02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:03.880]   but you have to use Chrome for the rest of your life.
[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:05.640]   - You just can't be, you're not responsible.
[02:06:05.640 --> 02:06:07.080]   I'm not gonna let you in this.
[02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:09.720]   - So if a password you just logged in with,
[02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:11.120]   so I just logged in a site,
[02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:13.000]   it was found in a data breach, you know,
[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.240]   like have I been pwned.
[02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:15.920]   - Mm-hmm.
[02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:18.720]   - Google Assistant and Chrome will offer
[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:20.880]   to change your password automatically.
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:22.160]   It'll pop up.
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:23.400]   And then you'll get a blue button,
[02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:25.000]   see it says it right here.
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:25.960]   Change your password now.
[02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:27.560]   Chrome found the password in data breach.
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:30.080]   Your assistant can change your password automatically.
[02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:32.480]   You press the button, change automatically.
[02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:37.160]   And the process begins.
[02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:40.720]   It will navigate you to the change password page.
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:44.200]   And then the assistant will generate a suggested password.
[02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:45.840]   You'll have to do, you'll have to interact a little bit.
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:47.840]   You have to say yes, I want that.
[02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:51.680]   And it will save it to your credentials manager in Chrome.
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:53.000]   At any point you could take over,
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.840]   if you say I want to do this myself,
[02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:58.400]   that's a, I think, anything that encourages people
[02:06:58.400 --> 02:06:59.680]   to change your password.
[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:01.960]   It's a bad password, it's a good thing.
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:03.240]   - And it's free.
[02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:06.280]   - Yep, comes with your Chrome.
[02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:07.800]   - Howard by duplex.
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:08.640]   - I'm not sure how that is.
[02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:09.840]   - Yeah, 'cause duplex is the thing
[02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:11.440]   that causes a mix of reservation for you.
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:13.440]   - Yeah, I don't get that, but I'm not sure.
[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:16.400]   - It's like everything's IoT.
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:18.520]   They're calling everything with AI.
[02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:19.840]   - Everything's AI.
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:22.120]   - It's all AI, it's all duplex.
[02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:25.120]   May's Pixel 6 and 6 Pro update is out.
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:30.080]   My major improvement only to haptic feedback.
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:33.000]   There's some minor little hoo-haws.
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.600]   Just three fixes total.
[02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:37.760]   Fix for occasionally causing a displayed awake
[02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:39.600]   without user interaction.
[02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:41.840]   Actually, my Google Nest hub does that.
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:44.640]   And the middle of the night, big bright white light
[02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:45.520]   will come on.
[02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:46.360]   - Really?
[02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:47.200]   - Yeah.
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:48.840]   - Should it not secure the camera?
[02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:50.560]   - No, no, no, it's just like the, you know,
[02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:52.400]   that hub thing.
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:54.120]   Maybe, I don't know, maybe you think some snoring
[02:07:54.120 --> 02:07:56.440]   and it's trying to wake me up, I don't know.
[02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:58.320]   And there's a fix for it an issue causing
[02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:00.120]   launcher crashes after restarting.
[02:08:00.120 --> 02:08:00.960]   - I throw it over.
[02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:03.600]   - Throw me over in the clover.
[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:05.560]   Get ready.
[02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:09.080]   Google Chrome OS
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:14.760]   is gonna be rebranded to drop the space.
[02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:16.000]   - What space?
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:19.880]   - In between the...
[02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:20.720]   - What?
[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:21.560]   - There is no space.
[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:22.400]   - What?
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:23.240]   - Yeah.
[02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:26.240]   I don't know.
[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:27.080]   - Okay.
[02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:31.440]   The system officially is Chrome Space OS.
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:35.400]   Although it is often stylized lowercase C, no space.
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:36.240]   - That's all I ever see.
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:38.600]   - But the official name is Chrome Space OS.
[02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:39.960]   - Oh, okay.
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:40.800]   - I know.
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:42.600]   - Who made a million dollars for that brilliant move?
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:45.120]   - We're going, well, think of the money Google's saving
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:47.600]   by eliminating all those wasted spaces.
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:49.560]   - Well, it used to be you had to have lead.
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:51.000]   - Spaces, yep, yep.
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:55.280]   - So, yep.
[02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:58.000]   That's the kind of thing we talk about right here
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.920]   on the Google change bar.
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:02.320]   (laughing)
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:03.400]   - That was really nice.
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:05.360]   - Yeah, that was really nice.
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:06.200]   - Riveting.
[02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:10.360]   - Well, let's take a break and then the picks of--
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:11.520]   - I mentioned one thing before.
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:12.680]   - You wanna do a TikTok?
[02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:13.920]   Go ahead, you can do a TikTok.
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:15.240]   - No, no, no, no, well, you could do that.
[02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:20.600]   Last week we talked about the Theranos flag.
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:21.440]   - Did she get some?
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:24.680]   - And there's a story in here on 146.
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:25.520]   - Oh.
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:28.120]   - Bloodlust.
[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:29.840]   - Bloodlust, Theranos merchandise on eBay
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:32.920]   according to the Guardian, sparks bloodlust
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:35.560]   among Elizabeth home fans, well,
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:39.320]   or people who collect memorabilia from failed companies
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:40.960]   like our friend Christina Warren,
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:44.080]   I wouldn't assume that she is an Elizabeth home fan.
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:46.640]   Five pens.
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:49.520]   - Are these people who are excited because of the show?
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:51.720]   - I don't think we could take full credit.
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:52.720]   - Like the dropout?
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:53.720]   - Oh, maybe.
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:54.560]   (laughing)
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:55.880]   I thought you meant a twig.
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:57.200]   - The harsh show.
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:09:58.520]   - You egotists you.
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:00.000]   (laughing)
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.800]   - I don't think we should take credit for this.
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:05.040]   (laughing)
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:06.440]   - Right.
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:09.000]   So they're probably more Amanda safe read fans
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.200]   or fans of the Hulu show.
[02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:13.880]   - No, they're $150 for three Theranos pens.
[02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:19.240]   I think it's, no, I think it's more failed company.
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:20.880]   - Yeah, I think it's Christina Warren stuff.
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:22.160]   I think the Guardian got it wrong.
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:24.880]   I don't think this is Elizabeth home's fans.
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:25.720]   - No, no.
[02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:27.400]   - This is people who, like Christina,
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:30.640]   want a Theranos pop socket to put in their collection.
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:33.520]   We talked about this last week with a great story
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:36.320]   about Christina Warren on NPR and doing all that.
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:37.160]   Yeah.
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:39.080]   - All right, I just want to mention that.
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:40.920]   - No, that's a good one.
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:42.360]   I guess there's a few we should throw in.
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:44.560]   Rate My Skype Room has a book coming.
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:47.160]   His name is Claude Taylor.
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:48.240]   I didn't, you knew that.
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:49.160]   - That's the same, yeah, that's what I was saying.
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:50.160]   - Yeah, I didn't know that.
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:53.160]   How to zoom your room.
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:54.800]   Talk about cashing in.
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:57.080]   - Is this how long is the book?
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:10:58.720]   Is it 10 pages?
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:10:59.560]   (laughing)
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:00.560]   - You could write this book.
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:02.880]   I mean, you should have written this book.
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:06.760]   But you don't have that room raider brand.
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:10.720]   - Well, they have Connie Schulz.
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:14.600]   - Oh, the former reporter.
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:16.320]   - They did a caricature of her room.
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:17.400]   - Oh.
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:18.960]   - Four eyes, so I'm jealous as heck.
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:20.120]   I mean, yes, I got a 10.
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:22.600]   - You got a 10, they should have a caricature of your room.
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:23.440]   - Yeah.
[02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:24.280]   - Yeah.
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:25.360]   - Is it a caricature?
[02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:26.520]   Is it like a diarometer?
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:27.440]   - Well, it's interesting.
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:28.360]   - I don't understand.
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:29.880]   - It's an illustration.
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:30.720]   - I mean, good.
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:31.560]   - Oh, okay.
[02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:32.400]   - That book.
[02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:34.760]   All right.
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:36.600]   There are other sources.
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:38.040]   - Oh, wait, for Twitter.
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:39.120]   - Yeah.
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:42.120]   - Elon, so a lot of people like rape my dogs,
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:43.680]   et cetera, all the merchandise you get
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:45.840]   from having a successful Twitter account.
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:46.680]   - Yes.
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:47.520]   - And rape my room.
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:48.360]   - Yes.
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:49.520]   - Maybe he should take a cut of that.
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:50.800]   - Oh.
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:52.400]   - Like a percentage.
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:53.520]   - Yeah.
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:54.720]   Like a platform fee.
[02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:58.280]   - You owe me big time, buddy.
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:01.760]   All right.
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:03.160]   That's my free idea of the day.
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:04.000]   - Okay.
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:05.640]   - It's worth exactly what you pay for it.
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:09.320]   - Leo, is your video ready yet?
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:11.800]   (laughing)
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:12.640]   - Google.
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:18.240]   - I was gonna show a behind the scenes video I shot
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:19.440]   of my son.
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:23.880]   It's so funny, 'cause every time I watch it,
[02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:26.480]   since your video will be ready soon,
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:28.040]   it shows just one frame.
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:29.240]   Watch.
[02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:30.240]   Oh, I didn't do it this time.
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:31.920]   It shows one frame and then it says,
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:33.800]   well, now your video's still not ready.
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:35.200]   - Wow.
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:36.280]   - You should probably stop that
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:38.240]   and re-upload it, my friend.
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:39.880]   - It's fine on Apple Photos.
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:41.280]   - It was there a couple of days ago.
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:45.840]   - I was showing how SaltHank shoots his chicken parm
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:50.080]   with the vodka pen a sauce with his cannon horse.
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:52.080]   - I saw SaltHank, is that his apartment?
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:53.600]   - It's posted on my Instagram.
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:55.840]   I could put it on my I could go to my Instagram, yeah.
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:56.760]   No.
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:12:58.920]   So he, this is great.
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:00.520]   He just moved his apartment,
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:02.680]   'cause he didn't like the kitchen
[02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:04.720]   in his apartment, wasn't photogenic.
[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:05.840]   - It was a saltman, a lot of eat.
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:07.440]   - Well, it wasn't photogenic.
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:08.760]   - I mean, that's his job, man.
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:10.840]   - He needs to shoot it.
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:14.000]   So here is the video.
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.440]   Oh, I should turn on the sound.
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:20.800]   This is, I got, okay, wait, wait for it,
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:24.480]   wait for it when it plops into the cuisine art.
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:27.160]   Oh, son of a--
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:29.040]   - You need to work on your Instagram.
[02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:31.040]   (laughing)
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:31.880]   - Peace.
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:33.640]   - How does social media work here?
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:35.640]   I posted the behind the scenes.
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:40.080]   This is of him making the thing where the--
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:43.200]   - This is how SaltHank sets up a shot.
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:44.000]   - All righty.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.680]   - The key is now you're using the Cannon R6.
[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:47.520]   - Cannon R6, exactly.
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:48.360]   - The video.
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:49.200]   - Yep.
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:51.560]   - And a weirdly named Mike, the Comica.
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:53.480]   - Comica, but gets the job done.
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:54.320]   - It's good enough.
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:56.320]   It's not Comica, it's Comica.
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:13:57.360]   - It's not even important, huh?
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:58.280]   - Most important.
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:13:59.200]   - Yeah.
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:01.400]   - Is he getting proposals from the show?
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:03.840]   - He's writing a book proposal right now.
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:05.240]   - No, I've had like, this is hilarious.
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:06.360]   - Oh yeah.
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:07.200]   - Tomato's got a tomato--
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:08.040]   - Like to get married?
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:08.880]   Like to marry him?
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:10.080]   - Yeah, I'm sandwiching.
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:13.480]   - Oh yeah, he's gets a lot of attention.
[02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:15.040]   - Butter, garlic, pliers.
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:16.040]   - Attention.
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:16.880]   (laughing)
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:17.720]   - For me.
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:19.200]   I'm trying to say it without--
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:22.160]   - It always has to have a little bit of salt.
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:24.000]   - Look at the plug, the plug.
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:25.840]   - Oh, oh, oh.
[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:26.680]   - That's so salty.
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:28.200]   (laughing)
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:29.760]   - It's all hank.com.
[02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:31.760]   - And of course he's wearing his cuts.
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:32.600]   - Oh yeah.
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:33.760]   - This is another advertising.
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:34.600]   - Oh, yes.
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:35.920]   - Yes, cuts, yeah.
[02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:37.400]   (laughing)
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:39.000]   All right, I'm gonna stand back and let you--
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:39.840]   - You don't pay.
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:40.680]   - All right.
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:41.520]   - But you--
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:44.040]   - This whole thing set up for one second,
[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:47.240]   the plop of the sauce into the Cuisinart.
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:48.080]   - Yeah.
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:49.320]   - What happens if he messes it up?
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:51.000]   He has to take it all out and wash the Cuisinart.
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:51.840]   - Start over.
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:56.600]   (laughing)
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:14:58.760]   - It's all about the plop, baby.
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:00.760]   - Yeah, this is absolutely--
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:01.960]   - Anyway, that was a lot of fun.
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:02.800]   - I respect that.
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:03.640]   - That's fun.
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:04.840]   - I totally respect that.
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:06.760]   - He loves what he's doing.
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:08.440]   That's all I care about.
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:11.000]   He's become--
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.040]   - You might care that he can also afford a place to live
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:15.400]   that's not your basement.
[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:17.440]   - Well, like I said, he's moved into a--
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:18.960]   He doesn't live in the basement.
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:19.800]   He's moved into--
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:20.800]   - Well, no, I know, that's what I'm saying.
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:23.880]   - Although, I'll be honest, that kitchen is his mom's.
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:26.680]   It's not, and he's been shooting there a lot
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:30.360]   because so he's got two million followers now.
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:32.720]   This is the video that he was making.
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:35.720]   1.2 million views on this video.
[02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:39.440]   And wait for the plop 'cause it's really good.
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:40.360]   You're gonna hear it.
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:41.840]   Sound is his thing now.
[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:43.200]   - Yeah, it makes a difference.
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:46.600]   - Yeah, hear that?
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:47.440]   - Yeah.
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:48.280]   - Yeah.
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:53.120]   - He's got a lot of travial in the background.
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:55.920]   - How about his edits?
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:59.400]   - You know what I realize?
[02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:01.040]   He doesn't cross the line.
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:04.240]   He's actually, I don't know if he knows this or not.
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:05.080]   - What do you mean?
[02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:07.720]   - I was, when I did the thing, I'm walking around him, right?
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:09.360]   I didn't do any cuts, so it wasn't a problem.
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:13.040]   But his angle on the whole thing is the same.
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:15.880]   He's always coming in from the left, always.
[02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:20.040]   And I realize if he switches the way at all,
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:22.240]   he'd be crossing the line and make people uncomfortable.
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:23.080]   - He's oriented.
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:25.680]   - I don't think he knows that rule.
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:26.520]   Maybe he does.
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:27.880]   He studied it in college, it probably does.
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:32.880]   But I probably shouldn't assume this is all instinctual.
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:35.440]   He's obviously knows what he's doing.
[02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:36.640]   - I love it.
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:40.600]   I just don't like what TikTok is doing with him for me
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:42.320]   as a follower.
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:43.520]   - I never see his videos.
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:44.600]   - Yeah, I trust him.
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:45.440]   - I get his stuff.
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:46.840]   - What do I have to do?
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:50.240]   - They're weeks old when I get the alerts from him.
[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:51.200]   - Yeah, that's how they do it.
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:53.960]   - I'm like, I follow him actively.
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:55.120]   - I know.
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:57.040]   - Well, what you have to do is what I always do,
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:59.200]   which is go to his name, search for him
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:01.600]   and watch the videos, and that's how I always do it.
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:02.920]   - Yeah.
[02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:07.920]   - His biggest video, I think 30 million views.
[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:11.440]   But he tells me it's not the views, it's the likes.
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:12.600]   It's not the views.
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:14.560]   He got 34 and a half million likes.
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:15.400]   - That's awesome.
[02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:16.240]   - That's a good number of likes.
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:19.360]   - Mr. Jarvis, did you see that I actually did a TikTok?
[02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:20.200]   - No.
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:21.040]   - Wow.
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:21.880]   - That's a good show for me.
[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:24.000]   - Well, I shared it with you on Twitter.
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:25.720]   - What's your handle on TikTok?
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:28.480]   - It's probably still an ant, underscore Pruitt.
[02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:29.800]   - It is everywhere, isn't it?
[02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:31.640]   - That's what I tried anyway.
[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:33.400]   - Let's see.
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:34.560]   There's a chase Pruitt.
[02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:35.720]   - That would be no.
[02:17:35.720 --> 02:17:39.160]   Or just anant Pruitt one word, maybe.
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:41.520]   - You don't even know your handle, do you?
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:43.160]   - No kind of.
[02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:44.000]   - No.
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.120]   - Well, I mean, there's how many ant Pruitts are out there.
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:47.120]   - Apparently none.
[02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:48.520]   (laughing)
[02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:49.360]   - Son of a.
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:53.200]   - I just did this thing and I thought about Mr. Jarvis
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:54.040]   when I did it.
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:54.880]   I was like, how many?
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:55.720]   - There's a Hannah Pruitt.
[02:17:55.720 --> 02:17:56.960]   - Yeah, it is, ant, underscore Pruitt.
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:57.960]   - It is.
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:00.240]   We'll see another thing TikTok screwing up.
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:04.040]   Oh, I have to view all results, there you are.
[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:07.040]   So, that wasn't the first one it was showing me.
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:07.880]   - Wow.
[02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:09.800]   - Is this the new one, this first one here?
[02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:10.840]   - Yeah, that one.
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:11.680]   - Of the.
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:13.640]   (soft music)
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:15.760]   Oh yeah, you're doing a video
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:18.760]   of our sponsor, Blue Lands Container,
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:20.880]   which you're making it look better than they make it look.
[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:23.120]   You probably should sell this to them.
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:25.800]   You're lighting it from within and all that stuff.
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:27.360]   - Well, you were a lot of shots.
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:28.200]   - You were a lot of shots.
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:30.120]   - You need to do a hands-on photography for product shots.
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:30.960]   - Yeah.
[02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:31.800]   - So I was rehearsing.
[02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:32.800]   - Yeah, that's cool.
[02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:33.640]   - Let me do this.
[02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:35.320]   - How did you get the green light, is that behind it?
[02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:37.320]   - That's actually part of my pick of the week.
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:40.040]   - Oh, well, we'll get there in a moment, but first,
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:42.880]   a word from our sponsor.
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:46.760]   Our show today brought to you by ITProTV.
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:51.760]   I know you were an ITPro before we snagged you away
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:54.480]   from your job, you worked in IT.
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:56.560]   It's a great job, it pays well.
[02:18:56.560 --> 02:19:00.360]   If you're into tech, you're get to do the tech
[02:19:00.360 --> 02:19:04.280]   that you love, but one of the hardest things
[02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:05.280]   is getting that first job.
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:07.240]   You gotta talk your way into that first job, right?
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:09.680]   It's kind of, oh no, really, I'm good at it.
[02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:12.320]   So that's why this certification thing was set up.
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:14.840]   So that you can take a test, it's like the A+ test
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:17.720]   and show, that's for desktop tech support.
[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:20.960]   Show you know the material, those certs are so important.
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:24.120]   That's why people study, they take the tests,
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:25.880]   they look for somewhere to learn IT.
[02:19:25.880 --> 02:19:28.360]   And I wanna tell you the place to go
[02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:31.160]   that you will love is ITProTV.
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:34.320]   It's an online IT training platform,
[02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:36.080]   it's the best out there.
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:37.680]   It's got the most up to date content,
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:41.240]   look at all the categories, certs in every area.
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:44.600]   They'll even help you figure out what area you want.
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:47.000]   They've got coaches, counselors,
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.160]   they've got all the subjects matter.
[02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:51.840]   They just released a new course, CompTIA's A+
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:52.920]   I was just talking about that.
[02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:54.800]   Core One and Core Two series.
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:57.720]   This is for people who, you know, desktop support,
[02:19:57.720 --> 02:19:59.520]   they support today's core technologies
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:02.440]   and it's security, it's networking, it's virtualization.
[02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:05.160]   This A+ cert is the industry standard
[02:20:05.160 --> 02:20:08.680]   for launching an IT career in today's digital world.
[02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:12.960]   This is what you need for a lot of IT jobs out there.
[02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:15.440]   So take the course, you will learn about hardware,
[02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:16.640]   you'll learn about operating systems,
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:19.240]   networking, security, troubleshooting.
[02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:22.080]   You can actually take the tests before you take the test,
[02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:24.840]   they have practice exams, you can work on hardware
[02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:27.960]   that you don't even own, they have virtual labs.
[02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:30.200]   ITProTV has seven studios,
[02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:32.940]   they're working Monday through Friday creating new content.
[02:20:32.940 --> 02:20:34.760]   So it's always up to date, they have to do that
[02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:37.200]   'cause the IT world changes minute by minute,
[02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:40.560]   new programs, new versions, new tests, new questions.
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:42.560]   Their courses go from those studios
[02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:44.200]   to the library in 24 hours.
[02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:46.240]   All the courses have transcripts
[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:47.920]   so it's easy to search them to find the part
[02:20:47.920 --> 02:20:48.920]   you're looking for.
[02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:51.320]   You can watch a chunk in 20 to 30 minutes.
[02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:53.920]   So it's a very easy way to do it during a lunch hour
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:55.080]   or a break.
[02:20:55.080 --> 02:20:57.440]   And with those virtual labs and practice tests,
[02:20:57.440 --> 02:20:59.640]   you know, you're gonna be in great shape
[02:20:59.640 --> 02:21:03.120]   to take that CompTIA A+ test, get that cert,
[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:04.960]   get that first job.
[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:06.440]   The best part about ITProTV,
[02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:08.560]   you can learn and get certified on your schedule.
[02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:10.640]   So if you've got another job,
[02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:13.080]   maybe you're doing a podcast, you know,
[02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:14.000]   or something like that.
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:14.840]   - Maybe.
[02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:15.680]   (laughs)
[02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:17.520]   - You can still study.
[02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:18.720]   And it's always entertaining.
[02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:22.280]   ITProTV's courses are fun 'cause they're edutators,
[02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:23.560]   they call them, they're teachers.
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:25.120]   Our experts in the field, of course,
[02:21:25.120 --> 02:21:27.760]   that's the first qualification, but they're also passionate.
[02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:29.800]   They love what they're doing, they're having fun.
[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:31.720]   And that communicates.
[02:21:31.720 --> 02:21:33.520]   May, we're getting ready for summer.
[02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:37.240]   So is ITProTV, their free Azure weekend is coming up,
[02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:39.320]   May 14th and 15th.
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:43.320]   That means free courses all weekend long in Microsoft Azure.
[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:45.080]   Head to the website to get the free courses
[02:21:45.080 --> 02:21:48.400]   a great introduction if you haven't tried ITProTV.
[02:21:48.400 --> 02:21:50.560]   And this month, two free webinars,
[02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:55.560]   one tomorrow, 2PM Eastern, what is Azure Bicep?
[02:21:55.560 --> 02:21:57.140]   This sounds like I have something to do with you,
[02:21:57.140 --> 02:21:58.020]   - Right, what?
[02:21:58.020 --> 02:22:02.480]   - Azure Bicep, Adam Gordon, Wes Brian will be doing that.
[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:05.600]   May 19th, 2PM Eastern, all things cybersecurity
[02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:07.680]   with Daniel Lowry and John Hammond.
[02:22:07.680 --> 02:22:09.120]   You can be at those seminars live,
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:10.920]   but you can always watch them after the fact as well.
[02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:12.160]   But try to get their live as you can,
[02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:13.280]   'cause then you can ask questions.
[02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:14.720]   I wanna know what the hell is it?
[02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:16.200]   - Yeah, I need a look.
[02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:20.640]   - I don't think it's about, you know, lifting.
[02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:22.120]   Don't forget about your IT team,
[02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:25.480]   they've got great business plans to it, ITProTV.
[02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:28.960]   Look, just check it out, ITProTV.tv/twit.
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:30.680]   I've known these guys since they started it,
[02:22:30.680 --> 02:22:32.720]   they're the best, really love them.
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:35.240]   ITPro.tv/twit.

[02:22:45.420 --> 02:23:03.620]   Twit3
[02:23:03.620 --> 02:23:05.100]   - She's got a waffle.
[02:23:05.100 --> 02:23:06.500]   - Oh good.
[02:23:06.500 --> 02:23:07.700]   - Woo.
[02:23:07.700 --> 02:23:11.140]   Someone on the chat caught me during my little waffle interlude.
[02:23:11.140 --> 02:23:15.900]   - Waffle Express, Landshark, got a waffle for you.
[02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:20.900]   So, Stacey's pick of the week this week, your thing.
[02:23:20.900 --> 02:23:25.660]   - This is actually a thing, it's from our site.
[02:23:25.660 --> 02:23:29.580]   So it's Stacey on IoT, Kevin did a review of the,
[02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:33.860]   what's it called, the Schlage, he always calls it Schlage.
[02:23:33.860 --> 02:23:35.700]   So I've always had it like, it's like, wait a second.
[02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:38.980]   I've always wondered, so Schlage is the famous lock maker,
[02:23:38.980 --> 02:23:40.180]   Schlage, okay.
[02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:42.940]   - Yeah, it's Schlage, it's just Kevin being session.
[02:23:42.940 --> 02:23:43.780]   - Schlage.
[02:23:43.780 --> 02:23:48.780]   - Schlage, the Schlage uncode plus smart wieffy lock.
[02:23:48.780 --> 02:23:52.900]   - So I have the encode plus wifi lock,
[02:23:52.900 --> 02:23:54.620]   but this is one with HomeKey,
[02:23:54.620 --> 02:23:55.940]   and I'm not a HomeKit person.
[02:23:55.940 --> 02:24:00.140]   - Oh, HomeKey lets you open the door with your iPhone.
[02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:01.380]   - Yes, or your Apple Watch.
[02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:02.500]   - Or your watch?
[02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:03.940]   Oh, I gotta hit this.
[02:24:03.940 --> 02:24:08.420]   So yes, this is why we're, so I didn't try it
[02:24:08.420 --> 02:24:10.700]   because I'm not an Apple user.
[02:24:10.700 --> 02:24:13.220]   So Kevin did for us and he loves it.
[02:24:13.220 --> 02:24:15.180]   He loves it and his family loves it.
[02:24:15.180 --> 02:24:16.500]   His family are a hard sell.
[02:24:16.500 --> 02:24:18.740]   - Safer, 'cause it's NFC, right?
[02:24:18.740 --> 02:24:19.620]   It's not Bluetooth, you actually--
[02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:20.460]   - It is NFC.
[02:24:20.460 --> 02:24:21.300]   - Yeah, it's like Apple.
[02:24:21.300 --> 02:24:23.020]   - They have a Bluetooth radio in there too,
[02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:23.940]   but you can use an NFC.
[02:24:23.940 --> 02:24:25.540]   - I would turn that off, I get really nervous
[02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:27.180]   about the Bluetooth, but if it's NFC,
[02:24:27.180 --> 02:24:29.540]   that means I have to touch it like Apple Pay.
[02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:31.260]   That's very secure.
[02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:35.940]   - So yeah, so this particular lock is $2.99.99.
[02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:39.500]   The Schlage and Code Wi-Fi lock is $2.49.99.
[02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:40.940]   So if you don't need HomeKit,
[02:24:40.940 --> 02:24:42.540]   you're at the HomeKey functionality,
[02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:44.260]   then you don't have to do that.
[02:24:44.260 --> 02:24:46.860]   But these are good locks.
[02:24:46.860 --> 02:24:49.380]   I mean, mine has done well.
[02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:51.820]   I've granted mines on my front door
[02:24:51.820 --> 02:24:55.900]   and we don't use the remote unlock feature all that often.
[02:24:55.900 --> 02:24:57.740]   We mostly unlock it with the keypad,
[02:24:57.740 --> 02:25:00.020]   which still the power draw is moving the motor
[02:25:00.020 --> 02:25:00.980]   to move the deadbolt.
[02:25:00.980 --> 02:25:05.540]   But the battery's lasted for like,
[02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:08.300]   I think almost a year, like 10 or 11 months.
[02:25:08.300 --> 02:25:09.900]   - Oh, so it's pretty good.
[02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:12.980]   - Even though it's pulling the deadbolt back.
[02:25:12.980 --> 02:25:13.820]   Wow.
[02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:14.660]   - Yeah.
[02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:15.500]   - Okay.
[02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:16.340]   - So this is a good lock.
[02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:17.180]   It works.
[02:25:17.180 --> 02:25:19.020]   It has a keypad for everybody who wants a keypad
[02:25:19.020 --> 02:25:21.540]   and this particular one has HomeKey.
[02:25:21.540 --> 02:25:23.300]   And there you go.
[02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:25.300]   I don't know if you can buy it just yet,
[02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:27.220]   but you should be able to buy it soon.
[02:25:27.220 --> 02:25:28.260]   And then a reminder.
[02:25:28.260 --> 02:25:29.180]   - Yes.
[02:25:29.180 --> 02:25:31.180]   - Sunday is Mother's Dayo.
[02:25:31.180 --> 02:25:34.220]   - And you say that as a mother?
[02:25:34.220 --> 02:25:36.700]   - No, I just, you know, I feel like,
[02:25:36.700 --> 02:25:39.300]   (laughing)
[02:25:39.300 --> 02:25:42.220]   - No, I just, you know, I always,
[02:25:42.220 --> 02:25:43.740]   you never want to forget your mom.
[02:25:43.740 --> 02:25:48.180]   - No, I told you, I gave her a June oven for Mother's Day.
[02:25:48.180 --> 02:25:51.500]   She said, "Oh, Leo, you shouldn't give me a June oven.
[02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:54.260]   "You already gave me," and I forgot what it was.
[02:25:54.260 --> 02:25:55.500]   Something stupid.
[02:25:55.500 --> 02:25:57.340]   - That's what she said.
[02:25:57.340 --> 02:25:58.180]   - No.
[02:25:58.180 --> 02:25:59.940]   - That's something stupid.
[02:25:59.940 --> 02:26:00.780]   - Something dumb.
[02:26:00.780 --> 02:26:02.140]   I forgot what I gave her.
[02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:04.700]   I said, "No, Mom, you need a real Mother's Day present."
[02:26:04.700 --> 02:26:06.460]   That was weeks ago.
[02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:07.980]   - Oh, here's an update.
[02:26:07.980 --> 02:26:11.740]   I think it's good that we were called out, says Aaron Hoffman,
[02:26:11.740 --> 02:26:14.260]   the CEO of Location Data Provider SafeCraft.
[02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:17.380]   He told this to protocol.
[02:26:17.380 --> 02:26:20.500]   And he's glad that we got caught selling.
[02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:22.940]   - He's basically saying we were not aware of this.
[02:26:22.940 --> 02:26:24.940]   - Oh, they didn't know.
[02:26:24.940 --> 02:26:26.020]   - Okay.
[02:26:26.020 --> 02:26:29.260]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:31.260]   - Yeah, so there you go.
[02:26:31.260 --> 02:26:32.900]   Sorry, little update there.
[02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:35.980]   - They didn't know.
[02:26:35.980 --> 02:26:41.300]   Well, thank you for keeping us up to date on that.
[02:26:41.300 --> 02:26:44.980]   And Sunday's not Mother's Day in the UK, says John Arne.
[02:26:44.980 --> 02:26:48.220]   - Oh, okay, see, I'm totally not listening to you.
[02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:49.260]   I'm reading this article.
[02:26:49.260 --> 02:26:53.360]   And he said, "Okay, already researchers are complaining
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:55.340]   "that we took this data down because they actually
[02:26:55.340 --> 02:26:58.860]   "want to see if these laws, dampened family planning visits."
[02:26:58.860 --> 02:27:00.780]   Twist.
[02:27:00.780 --> 02:27:05.540]   I would argue that's why we need to have good regulations
[02:27:05.540 --> 02:27:08.300]   around this data in how you access it,
[02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:10.460]   who gets to access it, and what they can do with it.
[02:27:10.460 --> 02:27:11.300]   - I agree. - Okay.
[02:27:11.300 --> 02:27:12.140]   - I agree. - Sorry.
[02:27:12.140 --> 02:27:13.540]   - I agree. - Just one additional update.
[02:27:13.540 --> 02:27:16.020]   - Yep, thank you.
[02:27:16.020 --> 02:27:19.300]   And by the way, Sunday is not Mother's Day in the UK.
[02:27:19.300 --> 02:27:21.380]   - Sorry, sorry if people need the UK.
[02:27:21.380 --> 02:27:22.740]   This is US centric.
[02:27:22.740 --> 02:27:25.300]   - We already had it in March 19.
[02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:28.980]   But thank you to all the mothers in the US of A.
[02:27:28.980 --> 02:27:33.980]   And now, it's time for a number from Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[02:27:33.980 --> 02:27:36.180]   - Well, I'll give you a short one for you.
[02:27:36.180 --> 02:27:38.820]   So after last week's show, our new friend,
[02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:42.180]   your new friend, my long-standing friend, Glenn Fleischman,
[02:27:42.180 --> 02:27:45.500]   tweeted this online, 162.
[02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:49.900]   Someone is selling a picture of me on eBay.
[02:27:49.900 --> 02:27:51.660]   - What? (laughing)
[02:27:51.660 --> 02:27:52.940]   - For $20? - $20?
[02:27:52.940 --> 02:27:54.700]   - $20? - $20?
[02:27:54.700 --> 02:27:56.220]   - My mother wouldn't buy it.
[02:27:56.220 --> 02:27:57.860]   (laughing)
[02:27:57.860 --> 02:27:59.460]   - $20? - Pretty much.
[02:27:59.460 --> 02:28:00.300]   - Pretty much.
[02:28:00.300 --> 02:28:01.860]   - Where did they get it?
[02:28:01.860 --> 02:28:05.620]   - Where did they get it? - I wasn't happy, obviously.
[02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:08.180]   - Oh, then they've ruined it by the ballpoint pen
[02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:09.980]   by circling your name.
[02:28:09.980 --> 02:28:11.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:28:11.180 --> 02:28:12.300]   - Why did they keep it?
[02:28:12.300 --> 02:28:14.540]   I love that it's a historical image, too.
[02:28:14.540 --> 02:28:15.660]   - I know, I know.
[02:28:15.660 --> 02:28:18.460]   - Do you think if I buy it, it will have that watermark on it?
[02:28:18.460 --> 02:28:19.420]   'Cause that's ugly.
[02:28:19.420 --> 02:28:21.780]   - Notice this is best offer.
[02:28:21.780 --> 02:28:23.180]   - No offer. - No offer.
[02:28:23.180 --> 02:28:28.180]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:28:28.180 --> 02:28:30.820]   - Oh, look, bought it, it's from historicimages.com.
[02:28:30.820 --> 02:28:32.580]   Oh, let's make an offer.
[02:28:32.580 --> 02:28:34.380]   - Best offer. - What if there is no offer?
[02:28:34.380 --> 02:28:36.100]   (laughing)
[02:28:36.100 --> 02:28:37.540]   - Let me, don't show my log in.
[02:28:37.540 --> 02:28:38.540]   - Beautiful for framing.
[02:28:38.540 --> 02:28:40.460]   (laughing)
[02:28:40.460 --> 02:28:42.900]   - Man, that is.
[02:28:42.900 --> 02:28:44.500]   - Oh, man, I'm sorry, I wasn't logging in.
[02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:46.420]   - Oh, the shipping bay, I had it time.
[02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:47.860]   - It's $4.99.
[02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:49.620]   - Well, that's fine.
[02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:52.180]   - Two cents. - Two cents.
[02:28:52.180 --> 02:28:54.140]   - What should I offer?
[02:28:54.140 --> 02:28:55.700]   Make an offer.
[02:28:55.700 --> 02:28:57.340]   Can you offer zero dollars?
[02:28:57.340 --> 02:28:58.380]   - I can't show a bit.
[02:28:58.380 --> 02:28:59.380]   - Two dollars?
[02:28:59.380 --> 02:29:00.660]   - Maybe. - Maybe to take it?
[02:29:00.660 --> 02:29:03.460]   - Similar items sold for $12 to $16.
[02:29:03.460 --> 02:29:04.820]   - Oh, Jeff Jarvis, yeah.
[02:29:04.820 --> 02:29:06.540]   (laughing)
[02:29:06.540 --> 02:29:08.100]   - Oh, you're going all the way up to 10?
[02:29:08.100 --> 02:29:08.940]   - Oh, wait, I'm just--
[02:29:08.940 --> 02:29:10.580]   - I'm just kidding. - You're getting yourself, man.
[02:29:10.580 --> 02:29:12.020]   - I'm gonna start at 10.
[02:29:12.020 --> 02:29:13.020]   - You're going all the way up to 10.
[02:29:13.020 --> 02:29:15.060]   - Will you autograph it if I buy it?
[02:29:15.060 --> 02:29:15.900]   - Oh, yes. - Oh, yes.
[02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:17.300]   - This is suspenseful.
[02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:19.300]   Give the seller a day to review your offer.
[02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:21.140]   If it's accepted-- - Oh, it's coming to your right now.
[02:29:21.140 --> 02:29:23.060]   - I can't make it. - Make your payments.
[02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:24.900]   You'll get a notification right now.
[02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:25.940]   - I didn't do buy it now.
[02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:29.500]   - No, no, no, the notification's coming back from the seller.
[02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:30.700]   - Oh, somebody made an offer.
[02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:32.420]   Let me please dump this.
[02:29:32.420 --> 02:29:34.860]   (laughing)
[02:29:34.860 --> 02:29:36.740]   - Oh, I see, so it's like buying now.
[02:29:36.740 --> 02:29:37.940]   It's not an auction.
[02:29:37.940 --> 02:29:40.260]   If I make an offer, then he has to say, hmm.
[02:29:40.260 --> 02:29:41.100]   - Yes or no?
[02:29:41.100 --> 02:29:42.100]   I wish I needed a jump on it.
[02:29:42.100 --> 02:29:43.740]   You're gonna be stuck with this photo.
[02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:44.580]   (laughing)
[02:29:44.580 --> 02:29:45.420]   Just like June.
[02:29:45.420 --> 02:29:47.260]   - I am framing it.
[02:29:47.260 --> 02:29:49.220]   - And hang it on your desk right here.
[02:29:49.220 --> 02:29:51.460]   - Oh, I'm gonna put it right on the desk.
[02:29:51.460 --> 02:29:53.500]   I am so excited.
[02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:54.820]   Thank you, Glenn. - That wasn't my number.
[02:29:54.820 --> 02:29:56.620]   - Okay. - That wasn't my number.
[02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:59.420]   - So, you know how,
[02:29:59.420 --> 02:30:01.860]   if you go, I'm gonna guide you through this if I mainly am.
[02:30:01.860 --> 02:30:04.980]   - Wait a minute, you said another picture of you on eBay.
[02:30:04.980 --> 02:30:06.420]   - Oh, man.
[02:30:06.420 --> 02:30:08.580]   - And this is you with some other guy.
[02:30:08.580 --> 02:30:09.420]   (laughing)
[02:30:09.420 --> 02:30:10.940]   - That was the publisher, that was by Nemesis,
[02:30:10.940 --> 02:30:13.740]   the publisher of-- - Oh, my goodness.
[02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:14.580]   - What?
[02:30:14.580 --> 02:30:16.660]   Is this the same seller?
[02:30:16.660 --> 02:30:19.820]   - Oh, the other guy brought the value down, apparently.
[02:30:19.820 --> 02:30:21.540]   - Yeah, it's only 13 now, darling.
[02:30:21.540 --> 02:30:22.540]   (laughing)
[02:30:22.540 --> 02:30:24.380]   Why are you with Billy Crystal, though?
[02:30:24.380 --> 02:30:25.220]   I don't understand.
[02:30:25.220 --> 02:30:26.660]   What are you doing with Billy Crystal?
[02:30:26.660 --> 02:30:28.900]   (laughing)
[02:30:28.900 --> 02:30:32.420]   - That's hysterical.
[02:30:32.420 --> 02:30:35.700]   Somebody got a whole trove of Jeff Jarvis pictures.
[02:30:35.700 --> 02:30:36.620]   Is this the same guy?
[02:30:36.620 --> 02:30:37.620]   - I've got lots of stuff over there.
[02:30:37.620 --> 02:30:39.100]   I got a box over there.
[02:30:39.100 --> 02:30:40.820]   Should I-- - No, it's a different seller.
[02:30:40.820 --> 02:30:42.180]   It's a different seller.
[02:30:42.180 --> 02:30:43.220]   - Oh, a different seller.
[02:30:43.220 --> 02:30:44.060]   - It's a different seller.
[02:30:44.060 --> 02:30:46.460]   This one came from Historic Images 03,
[02:30:46.460 --> 02:30:48.660]   and that one's from our fleet, Jr.
[02:30:48.660 --> 02:30:50.100]   (laughing)
[02:30:50.100 --> 02:30:51.780]   And better of the end of the end of the end of the end of the
[02:30:51.780 --> 02:30:52.620]   end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end.
[02:30:52.620 --> 02:30:53.460]   That's great.
[02:30:53.460 --> 02:30:56.620]   - That one has a nice kind of smirk on it, I think.
[02:30:56.620 --> 02:30:59.460]   - Oh, I know, I'm kind of sad I bought the wrong one.
[02:30:59.460 --> 02:31:01.620]   (laughing)
[02:31:01.620 --> 02:31:02.820]   It's too late.
[02:31:02.820 --> 02:31:04.420]   Maybe I just buy both of them.
[02:31:04.420 --> 02:31:07.100]   I don't want Clingman in mine, or Clingol and Smith,
[02:31:07.100 --> 02:31:07.940]   or whatever.
[02:31:07.940 --> 02:31:09.940]   (laughing)
[02:31:09.940 --> 02:31:13.540]   I could just, I could put my face on Clingol Smith's face.
[02:31:13.540 --> 02:31:15.860]   - Yeah. - Oh, well,
[02:31:15.860 --> 02:31:17.460]   I'm just making off. - Make it so.
[02:31:17.460 --> 02:31:18.780]   - Make it so. - Make it so.
[02:31:18.780 --> 02:31:19.620]   - Wait a minute.
[02:31:19.620 --> 02:31:22.620]   Now, he's only asking $13.99, so I should do 10.
[02:31:22.620 --> 02:31:23.460]   - Yeah, I would go jump. - 10.
[02:31:23.460 --> 02:31:24.540]   - 10. - 10.
[02:31:24.540 --> 02:31:25.660]   Save some money.
[02:31:25.660 --> 02:31:28.300]   Okay, send that along.
[02:31:28.300 --> 02:31:29.820]   This is suspenseful.
[02:31:29.820 --> 02:31:34.020]   I might have two Jeff Jarvis pictures.
[02:31:34.020 --> 02:31:34.860]   - You're eating every one of them.
[02:31:34.860 --> 02:31:36.700]   - I'm very concerned about y'all.
[02:31:36.700 --> 02:31:38.100]   - There might be more.
[02:31:38.100 --> 02:31:41.020]   If you're selling a Jeff Jarvis picture on eBay,
[02:31:41.020 --> 02:31:41.860]   you ought to let me know.
[02:31:41.860 --> 02:31:42.860]   - We found your buyer.
[02:31:42.860 --> 02:31:45.620]   (laughing)
[02:31:45.620 --> 02:31:47.100]   - Wow.
[02:31:47.100 --> 02:31:50.060]   What's the number, Mr. J?
[02:31:50.060 --> 02:31:53.300]   - Well, well, sorry, I got my eyesight back laughing.
[02:31:53.300 --> 02:31:54.300]   (laughing)
[02:31:54.300 --> 02:31:56.620]   So you know the long S,
[02:31:56.620 --> 02:31:57.820]   this is about the typographical moment.
[02:31:57.820 --> 02:31:59.500]   You know the long S, how you says Congress,
[02:31:59.500 --> 02:32:01.620]   if you go to line 167.
[02:32:01.620 --> 02:32:02.780]   - Okay.
[02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:05.420]   - And through a fresh everybody's memory.
[02:32:05.420 --> 02:32:06.260]   - Oh yeah, we're talking about.
[02:32:06.260 --> 02:32:07.260]   - Congress, the United States.
[02:32:07.260 --> 02:32:08.260]   - Yeah, yeah. - Just like it says,
[02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:13.260]   - Congress, E-R-E-F-F, every cool kid has seen this.
[02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:15.140]   - And around this, Congress.
[02:32:15.140 --> 02:32:15.980]   - Yeah.
[02:32:15.980 --> 02:32:17.900]   - And so this confuses the heck out of everybody who sees this,
[02:32:17.900 --> 02:32:19.460]   but for years and years and years,
[02:32:19.460 --> 02:32:20.800]   Ben Franklin was one of the ones who said,
[02:32:20.800 --> 02:32:22.620]   get rid of it, it's ridiculous.
[02:32:22.620 --> 02:32:25.100]   So, - Well, does it represent a double S?
[02:32:25.100 --> 02:32:25.940]   When is it used?
[02:32:25.940 --> 02:32:27.220]   - No, it's not, no, it's just another S.
[02:32:27.220 --> 02:32:29.460]   And I don't even know the pattern of why one goes in one place,
[02:32:29.460 --> 02:32:30.860]   one goes in the other place,
[02:32:30.860 --> 02:32:31.920]   but it's just another S.
[02:32:31.920 --> 02:32:34.100]   It's a long S in a short S.
[02:32:34.100 --> 02:32:34.940]   Another difference.
[02:32:34.940 --> 02:32:36.780]   - No difference. - So now go to line 165.
[02:32:36.780 --> 02:32:38.100]   This is what you learn on Twitter.
[02:32:38.100 --> 02:32:42.900]   If you can,
[02:32:42.900 --> 02:32:44.660]   - Yeah. - I found it.
[02:32:44.660 --> 02:32:46.060]   - Yeah.
[02:32:46.060 --> 02:32:48.660]   - Technically we should be finizing.
[02:32:48.660 --> 02:32:49.500]   (laughing)
[02:32:49.500 --> 02:32:53.820]   Yes, so actually says Susie Dent to Dennis Duncan,
[02:32:53.820 --> 02:32:56.260]   who wrote a wonderful book about the index,
[02:32:56.260 --> 02:32:57.260]   the history of index,
[02:32:57.260 --> 02:32:59.740]   that it actually is not sneezing,
[02:32:59.740 --> 02:33:01.780]   it's finizing.
[02:33:01.780 --> 02:33:04.580]   That it was a long S to confuse somebody,
[02:33:04.580 --> 02:33:07.340]   and it wasn't an F, it was an S.
[02:33:07.340 --> 02:33:10.420]   So the actual word is to finise.
[02:33:10.420 --> 02:33:12.820]   And if you then go to the next line of the O,
[02:33:12.820 --> 02:33:17.660]   - Oh my God, this is like a scavenger hunt.
[02:33:17.660 --> 02:33:18.500]   - Yes.
[02:33:18.500 --> 02:33:20.140]   - So Dennis Duncan, who wrote this wonderful book
[02:33:20.140 --> 02:33:22.180]   called Index, A History of the,
[02:33:22.180 --> 02:33:23.020]   - Yeah. - which is wonderful.
[02:33:23.020 --> 02:33:24.660]   It's brand new and out, you probably enjoy it.
[02:33:24.660 --> 02:33:25.980]   It's about the history of the index.
[02:33:25.980 --> 02:33:30.860]   So this is Caxton, who was the first printer in English.
[02:33:30.860 --> 02:33:33.020]   And so you'll see there, it says,
[02:33:33.020 --> 02:33:35.940]   sneezing, finizing,
[02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:37.260]   and try to pronounce,
[02:33:37.260 --> 02:33:39.380]   - Phinesis. - Phinesis.
[02:33:39.380 --> 02:33:41.700]   Whenever one is Phinesis,
[02:33:41.700 --> 02:33:46.500]   or capith, he make it to both his faith
[02:33:46.500 --> 02:33:47.980]   in the sign of the,
[02:33:47.980 --> 02:33:50.180]   (laughing)
[02:33:50.180 --> 02:33:52.500]   So for now on, and the reason, by the way,
[02:33:52.500 --> 02:33:53.780]   this is a little piece that explains
[02:33:53.780 --> 02:33:54.780]   why you should say God bless,
[02:33:54.780 --> 02:33:55.620]   because it was the plague,
[02:33:55.620 --> 02:33:57.620]   and you were trying to not get to die with the plague.
[02:33:57.620 --> 02:34:00.580]   It's now, you no longer sneeze, you please.
[02:34:00.580 --> 02:34:02.140]   - Sneeze. - Please.
[02:34:02.980 --> 02:34:03.820]   (laughing)
[02:34:03.820 --> 02:34:05.380]   - That's a show title. - Please.
[02:34:05.380 --> 02:34:07.900]   - God bless you.
[02:34:07.900 --> 02:34:13.100]   Oh my God. - Fneeze.
[02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:14.620]   - Fneeze. - Fneeze.
[02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:16.420]   - Well, there he is. - Does it sound like it, right?
[02:34:16.420 --> 02:34:18.180]   - Right, it says, it looks a lot more.
[02:34:18.180 --> 02:34:19.020]   - Please. - Please.
[02:34:19.020 --> 02:34:20.340]   - Fneeze. - Please.
[02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:22.580]   - Fneeze. - Oh my God.
[02:34:22.580 --> 02:34:24.700]   - Fneeze. - As Miss Higgins
[02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:26.180]   bothered and left the building yet.
[02:34:26.180 --> 02:34:27.180]   (laughing)
[02:34:27.180 --> 02:34:29.380]   - She still does. - And give us something.
[02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:30.540]   - Am I zoning out?
[02:34:30.540 --> 02:34:31.700]   - Yes. - Yes.
[02:34:31.700 --> 02:34:33.260]   - I'm not too fascinated by that.
[02:34:33.260 --> 02:34:34.940]   - Come on. - Hey, take a bow.
[02:34:34.940 --> 02:34:36.380]   - Hey, take a bow, Mr. Jarvis.
[02:34:36.380 --> 02:34:37.860]   That was next level there.
[02:34:37.860 --> 02:34:39.300]   - Yeah, yeah. - If you were wondering
[02:34:39.300 --> 02:34:42.780]   how Aunt got that beautiful sheen
[02:34:42.780 --> 02:34:45.060]   on the Blue Land bottle,
[02:34:45.060 --> 02:34:48.500]   it's a very, very inexpensive light I got off Amazon.
[02:34:48.500 --> 02:34:49.500]   I don't know how long it will go.
[02:34:49.500 --> 02:34:51.180]   - It's called the Fneeze.
[02:34:51.180 --> 02:34:53.820]   - It's like, it's super, duper cheap,
[02:34:53.820 --> 02:34:55.820]   but it really works well.
[02:34:55.820 --> 02:34:59.140]   There's only 30 bucks, and we have it in the show notes.
[02:34:59.140 --> 02:35:01.580]   LED light, you can change the colors of it,
[02:35:01.580 --> 02:35:03.540]   change the color temperature,
[02:35:03.540 --> 02:35:05.540]   and if you do on product photography,
[02:35:05.540 --> 02:35:07.300]   you can hide it in your scene
[02:35:07.300 --> 02:35:10.180]   to help separate your product from the background.
[02:35:10.180 --> 02:35:11.780]   - So you get different colors in your--
[02:35:11.780 --> 02:35:13.500]   - All right, and if you wanna just use it
[02:35:13.500 --> 02:35:16.260]   for portraiture of people or video or whatever,
[02:35:16.260 --> 02:35:18.820]   you can use it as a hair light or something like that.
[02:35:18.820 --> 02:35:21.180]   - Nice. - It's super useful,
[02:35:21.180 --> 02:35:24.420]   and you can just charge it up with a USB-C charger.
[02:35:24.420 --> 02:35:25.700]   - You know what would be fun to do with this?
[02:35:25.700 --> 02:35:27.300]   Is time exposure's in the dark.
[02:35:27.300 --> 02:35:28.900]   You could write-- - Light paint.
[02:35:28.900 --> 02:35:30.300]   - Light paint, yeah.
[02:35:30.300 --> 02:35:32.580]   - It's, again, it's only about,
[02:35:32.580 --> 02:35:34.100]   if it's in the size of my hand,
[02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:36.980]   so I guess it's roughly five inches.
[02:35:36.980 --> 02:35:38.300]   (laughing)
[02:35:38.300 --> 02:35:39.140]   - Five foot, yeah.
[02:35:39.140 --> 02:35:41.500]   (laughing)
[02:35:41.500 --> 02:35:45.300]   - So it's roughly five inches, but nice little light.
[02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:46.620]   But that's the first thing,
[02:35:46.620 --> 02:35:49.580]   but my main picks of the week is to tell everybody
[02:35:49.580 --> 02:35:50.980]   to take care of themselves.
[02:35:50.980 --> 02:35:55.300]   Pick number one, I went to have my physical,
[02:35:55.300 --> 02:35:58.700]   not too long ago, and the doctor is just like,
[02:35:58.700 --> 02:36:02.220]   "Wow, but I've never seen such big hands in my whole life."
[02:36:02.220 --> 02:36:03.500]   (laughing)
[02:36:03.500 --> 02:36:06.260]   And he's like, "Well, what are you doing?"
[02:36:06.260 --> 02:36:09.060]   I said, "I'm the most healthy, unhealthy person
[02:36:09.060 --> 02:36:11.780]   "that you'll meet, but I take care of myself
[02:36:11.780 --> 02:36:14.460]   "by taking supplements such as good old fish oil."
[02:36:14.460 --> 02:36:15.460]   - Fish oil, good for you.
[02:36:15.460 --> 02:36:17.780]   So take fish oil, it's not expensive,
[02:36:17.780 --> 02:36:21.060]   it's really, really helpful for your heart.
[02:36:21.060 --> 02:36:22.820]   I also take garlic tablets,
[02:36:22.820 --> 02:36:24.820]   that's helping with cholesterol.
[02:36:24.820 --> 02:36:29.100]   I actually notice I've purchased this fish oil six times.
[02:36:29.100 --> 02:36:30.060]   - Hey, hey.
[02:36:30.060 --> 02:36:31.140]   - So there you go.
[02:36:31.140 --> 02:36:32.980]   - So take care of yourself, people.
[02:36:32.980 --> 02:36:35.300]   - And you eat garlic in a bottle?
[02:36:35.300 --> 02:36:36.780]   - Yeah, 'cause I don't like garlic,
[02:36:36.780 --> 02:36:37.900]   so I take the tablets.
[02:36:37.900 --> 02:36:40.140]   - And it upsets some people's stomachs as well.
[02:36:40.140 --> 02:36:41.260]   - That's true, yeah.
[02:36:41.260 --> 02:36:43.220]   - So just get you some fish oil,
[02:36:43.220 --> 02:36:45.460]   get you some garlic to help take care of your blood
[02:36:45.460 --> 02:36:47.460]   and cholesterol and your heart, no, and that.
[02:36:47.460 --> 02:36:48.300]   - Nice.
[02:36:48.300 --> 02:36:51.100]   - And lastly, this is Maine.
[02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:53.300]   - I love it, this garlic is called Puritan's Prime.
[02:36:53.300 --> 02:36:54.140]   - Puritan's Prime.
[02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:57.220]   (laughing)
[02:36:57.220 --> 02:36:58.540]   - Oh, okay.
[02:36:58.540 --> 02:37:00.180]   - Puritans would have been so proud.
[02:37:00.180 --> 02:37:01.020]   - Right.
[02:37:01.020 --> 02:37:05.580]   This is Maine and it is Mental Health Awareness Month.
[02:37:05.580 --> 02:37:07.980]   And so to shout out Mental Health Awareness Month,
[02:37:07.980 --> 02:37:11.860]   I wanted to mention a book with Ms. Jennifer Lewis.
[02:37:11.860 --> 02:37:14.420]   She's called The Mother of Black Hollywood
[02:37:14.420 --> 02:37:16.500]   and you may have seen her on a couple different movies
[02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:18.180]   and TV shows, but she's--
[02:37:18.180 --> 02:37:19.620]   - Oh, she's the star of Blackish.
[02:37:19.620 --> 02:37:20.460]   - Yes.
[02:37:20.460 --> 02:37:21.300]   - Yes.
[02:37:21.300 --> 02:37:22.700]   - And she's, she's a hilarious woman,
[02:37:22.700 --> 02:37:25.820]   but she has had a really interesting history
[02:37:25.820 --> 02:37:27.940]   in Hollywood with some of the way the things
[02:37:27.940 --> 02:37:30.300]   that she dealt with being treated as a woman.
[02:37:30.300 --> 02:37:32.340]   And then she battled mental health problems.
[02:37:32.340 --> 02:37:35.820]   And in this book, she just comes spread out
[02:37:35.820 --> 02:37:37.860]   and tells you all of her struggles with mental health
[02:37:37.860 --> 02:37:40.660]   and says, "Hey, if you need help, go get help.
[02:37:40.660 --> 02:37:43.220]   "And if you need medication, go get the medication
[02:37:43.220 --> 02:37:47.220]   "and take your medication, stop this stupid stigmas
[02:37:47.220 --> 02:37:50.100]   "of people being on medications for their own mental health."
[02:37:50.100 --> 02:37:50.940]   - Nope, it's okay.
[02:37:50.940 --> 02:37:52.900]   Check her out, Ms. Jennifer Lewis,
[02:37:52.900 --> 02:37:56.540]   the mother of Black Hollywood, a memoir.
[02:37:56.540 --> 02:37:58.460]   - And you want to hear her voice 'cause it's good.
[02:37:58.460 --> 02:37:59.300]   - Oh, it's funny.
[02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:00.140]   - Listen.
[02:38:00.140 --> 02:38:06.020]   - Look, the voice is in Hollywood,
[02:38:06.020 --> 02:38:09.860]   but I'll be damned if now, at the moment of truth,
[02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:13.020]   I could remember one line of the script I had studied.
[02:38:13.020 --> 02:38:14.300]   - Oh, what a voice.
[02:38:14.300 --> 02:38:15.220]   - I love her.
[02:38:15.220 --> 02:38:17.620]   Jennifer Lewis, the mother of Black Hollywood.
[02:38:17.620 --> 02:38:20.220]   My pick of the week is this photo of Jeff Jock.
[02:38:20.220 --> 02:38:22.020]   (laughing)
[02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:23.060]   - Offering Jeff Jock.
[02:38:23.060 --> 02:38:25.220]   - There was no, on this one.
[02:38:25.220 --> 02:38:27.060]   - This is another one.
[02:38:27.060 --> 02:38:28.820]   (laughing)
[02:38:28.820 --> 02:38:32.780]   This one comes from vintage press photos.
[02:38:32.780 --> 02:38:35.580]   And it has a red dot on the back.
[02:38:35.580 --> 02:38:38.380]   But I think it's kind of, no, it's not the same, is it?
[02:38:38.380 --> 02:38:40.380]   You're now in a plaid suit.
[02:38:40.380 --> 02:38:41.220]   - Oh, no.
[02:38:41.220 --> 02:38:42.780]   - He still looks just as cranky,
[02:38:42.780 --> 02:38:44.500]   Jeff and her wrestling bitch face.
[02:38:44.500 --> 02:38:46.180]   (laughing)
[02:38:46.180 --> 02:38:48.580]   - But why are there so many eight by tens
[02:38:48.580 --> 02:38:51.140]   who Jeff Jarvis, they think?
[02:38:51.140 --> 02:38:53.740]   The world wants to know.
[02:38:53.740 --> 02:38:55.340]   - How was it been there?
[02:38:55.340 --> 02:38:56.940]   - Should I buy it too?
[02:38:56.940 --> 02:38:57.780]   - No, no.
[02:38:57.780 --> 02:38:59.340]   - No, I only too is more than I need.
[02:38:59.340 --> 02:39:00.500]   - It was more than you need.
[02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:01.340]   - Yes.
[02:39:01.340 --> 02:39:02.180]   - You think?
[02:39:02.180 --> 02:39:03.020]   (laughing)
[02:39:03.020 --> 02:39:04.740]   - I actually think you should buy,
[02:39:04.740 --> 02:39:06.620]   as many as you can find,
[02:39:06.620 --> 02:39:08.900]   Walt Baker-- - Order the barking on him.
[02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:11.260]   - In Jeff's house, when he goes out of town
[02:39:11.260 --> 02:39:12.980]   and just like have him come home,
[02:39:12.980 --> 02:39:13.820]   - Yes.
[02:39:13.820 --> 02:39:14.660]   - It would be amazing.
[02:39:14.660 --> 02:39:15.500]   - All right, well, just, all right,
[02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:17.660]   I'm gonna make a $5 offer just in case.
[02:39:17.660 --> 02:39:18.660]   (laughing)
[02:39:18.660 --> 02:39:19.980]   - Okay.
[02:39:19.980 --> 02:39:20.820]   - Oh, oh!
[02:39:20.820 --> 02:39:21.980]   - They turn it down.
[02:39:21.980 --> 02:39:25.820]   - They say Jeff Jarvis is worth more than $5.
[02:39:25.820 --> 02:39:27.380]   - 50. - Wow.
[02:39:27.380 --> 02:39:29.380]   (laughing)
[02:39:29.380 --> 02:39:30.340]   - Wow.
[02:39:30.340 --> 02:39:32.020]   - Take that.
[02:39:32.020 --> 02:39:33.140]   - That was pretty damn quick.
[02:39:33.140 --> 02:39:33.980]   - 550.
[02:39:33.980 --> 02:39:35.540]   - The guy said, "Nah, absolutely not."
[02:39:35.540 --> 02:39:36.380]   - This is my final one.
[02:39:36.380 --> 02:39:37.220]   - They probably have a floor on it.
[02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:38.380]   - Yeah, they have a floor.
[02:39:38.380 --> 02:39:39.580]   So let's find out what it is.
[02:39:39.580 --> 02:39:41.020]   You can't, by the way, keep doing this.
[02:39:41.020 --> 02:39:43.300]   You gotta, I only have like one offer left.
[02:39:43.300 --> 02:39:45.060]   So let's try eight.
[02:39:45.060 --> 02:39:48.820]   - No, he's gonna, I'm gonna say not, well, $15.
[02:39:48.820 --> 02:39:50.180]   Yeah, eight, that's more than half.
[02:39:50.180 --> 02:39:51.020]   - There you go.
[02:39:51.020 --> 02:39:53.900]   - Yeah, let's see.
[02:39:53.900 --> 02:39:56.020]   He wasn't rejected out of here.
[02:39:56.020 --> 02:39:57.940]   - Oh. - Man, here he goes.
[02:39:57.940 --> 02:39:59.220]   They want their money.
[02:39:59.220 --> 02:40:00.660]   - They're not taking a penny less than--
[02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:01.900]   - They feel that Jeff is--
[02:40:01.900 --> 02:40:02.980]   - $14.99. - $14.99.
[02:40:02.980 --> 02:40:04.060]   - There's a rush on it.
[02:40:04.060 --> 02:40:05.140]   They see there's a market.
[02:40:05.140 --> 02:40:06.980]   (laughing)
[02:40:06.980 --> 02:40:08.580]   - You're betting to get yourself down.
[02:40:08.580 --> 02:40:10.660]   - They're checking on the other ones.
[02:40:10.660 --> 02:40:13.380]   - All right, Jeff Jarvis futures are all up.
[02:40:13.380 --> 02:40:14.220]   I'm telling you.
[02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:15.500]   All right, let's see if you'll take,
[02:40:15.500 --> 02:40:16.860]   will you take 10?
[02:40:16.860 --> 02:40:18.420]   Oh yeah, he'll take 10.
[02:40:18.420 --> 02:40:19.300]   (laughing)
[02:40:19.300 --> 02:40:21.620]   - All right, so $10 is the cost of it.
[02:40:21.620 --> 02:40:23.820]   - Not only was it accepted, it was accepted right away.
[02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:25.860]   I now own this.
[02:40:25.860 --> 02:40:26.860]   I gotta pay him.
[02:40:26.860 --> 02:40:28.380]   (laughing)
[02:40:28.380 --> 02:40:29.660]   - But if you have to pay all the others,
[02:40:29.660 --> 02:40:31.660]   is that a better one than the other one?
[02:40:31.660 --> 02:40:34.380]   - You can't reject the acceptance.
[02:40:34.380 --> 02:40:35.220]   You're stuck, right?
[02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:36.780]   - No, you're stuck.
[02:40:36.780 --> 02:40:37.780]   - Well, no, if you don't pay them,
[02:40:37.780 --> 02:40:38.820]   they just won't send it to you.
[02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:39.900]   - My order's in.
[02:40:39.900 --> 02:40:41.700]   You should get it by May 14th.
[02:40:41.700 --> 02:40:43.940]   (laughing)
[02:40:43.940 --> 02:40:44.780]   - Yes.
[02:40:44.780 --> 02:40:45.620]   Yes.
[02:40:45.620 --> 02:40:48.620]   - You can take it all the crews with you.
[02:40:48.620 --> 02:40:49.460]   - Oh, I will.
[02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:50.980]   I'm gonna have it on my pillow.
[02:40:50.980 --> 02:40:56.100]   - I am so excited under your pillow on the mirror.
[02:40:56.100 --> 02:40:57.580]   - Oh, everywhere.
[02:40:57.580 --> 02:40:58.420]   - Yeah.
[02:40:58.420 --> 02:41:01.620]   - We'll make a little TikTok of me shaving it.
[02:41:01.620 --> 02:41:02.460]   - Or Lisa.
[02:41:02.460 --> 02:41:03.300]   - Looking at Jeff.
[02:41:03.300 --> 02:41:04.340]   (laughing)
[02:41:04.340 --> 02:41:06.900]   - This is like flat, flat, flat, what's his name?
[02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:08.500]   - Flat Stanley, was that his name?
[02:41:08.500 --> 02:41:09.340]   - Flat Stanley.
[02:41:09.340 --> 02:41:10.180]   - Like flat, flat, flat.
[02:41:10.180 --> 02:41:12.580]   - It's a whole new thing, flat Jarvis.
[02:41:12.580 --> 02:41:14.580]   - Yeah, I love it.
[02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:16.740]   You know, flat Stanley, you know?
[02:41:16.740 --> 02:41:17.980]   You don't know that?
[02:41:17.980 --> 02:41:20.860]   It's a flat thing of a guy.
[02:41:20.860 --> 02:41:22.860]   And people take it around, take pictures with it.
[02:41:22.860 --> 02:41:23.700]   - I see it.
[02:41:23.700 --> 02:41:26.180]   Okay, it's based off of a children's book.
[02:41:26.180 --> 02:41:28.300]   - Yeah, I'm surprised you don't know that, yeah.
[02:41:28.300 --> 02:41:29.220]   - Yeah.
[02:41:29.220 --> 02:41:32.540]   - So now I have to order a bunch of frames for my collection.
[02:41:32.540 --> 02:41:34.800]   (laughing)
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:40.620]   Oh, man, I'm gonna pull it up and it says,
[02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:43.340]   "Soad when I look for it, this must be the name."
[02:41:43.340 --> 02:41:46.620]   - So our morning conversation at breakfast is usually,
[02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:51.620]   all right, I have a payment here for $1,500.
[02:41:51.620 --> 02:41:53.700]   Oh yeah, that was that laptop, okay.
[02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:56.500]   I have three payments to eBay for $10.
[02:41:56.500 --> 02:41:57.500]   (laughing)
[02:41:57.500 --> 02:41:59.380]   - Wait, are these on your business account?
[02:41:59.380 --> 02:42:00.220]   - Oh yeah.
[02:42:00.220 --> 02:42:01.060]   - Oh, excellent.
[02:42:01.060 --> 02:42:02.860]   - Oh, of course it's tax deductible.
[02:42:02.860 --> 02:42:04.060]   - Yeah, I was about to say,
[02:42:04.060 --> 02:42:05.500]   oh, you're gonna expense Jeff.
[02:42:05.500 --> 02:42:09.140]   - Of course he's gonna think, you know, wait.
[02:42:09.140 --> 02:42:10.340]   I wouldn't have liked that.
[02:42:10.340 --> 02:42:12.220]   And if the IRS comes here.
[02:42:12.220 --> 02:42:13.700]   (laughing)
[02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:15.940]   - Hey, we talked about it quite a lot.
[02:42:15.940 --> 02:42:17.500]   - This was on the goal.
[02:42:17.500 --> 02:42:20.100]   - It was worth a great goal.
[02:42:20.100 --> 02:42:25.100]   - Jeff Jarvis is the director of the Townite Center
[02:42:25.100 --> 02:42:30.100]   for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig, Craig,

[02:42:35.060 --> 02:42:37.860]   And he adorns my wall.
[02:42:37.860 --> 02:42:39.660]   - Former brunette, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:42:39.660 --> 02:42:42.340]   - Former brunette, thank you, Jeff.
[02:42:42.340 --> 02:42:46.780]   Buzzmachine.com for his writings at Jeff Jarvis
[02:42:46.780 --> 02:42:49.020]   if you wanna join the battle on Twitter.
[02:42:49.020 --> 02:42:50.340]   - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[02:42:50.340 --> 02:42:53.780]   - And put the hands-on photography.
[02:42:53.780 --> 02:42:55.500]   You're gonna do that product shot thing this week,
[02:42:55.500 --> 02:42:59.180]   or no, got something else going on this week.
[02:42:59.180 --> 02:43:01.500]   - You've been talking to some really great people.
[02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:05.380]   - I got to sit down with a very, very popular NFL
[02:43:05.380 --> 02:43:06.220]   photographer.
[02:43:07.060 --> 02:43:09.380]   - I know, we're so jealous that you got to talk to this guy.
[02:43:09.380 --> 02:43:11.420]   - It's gonna be great.
[02:43:11.420 --> 02:43:12.260]   - Yeah.
[02:43:12.260 --> 02:43:13.980]   - But just go ahead and subscribe,
[02:43:13.980 --> 02:43:16.220]   twitter.tv/hophop.
[02:43:16.220 --> 02:43:18.460]   I'm still rehearsing how I would like to do
[02:43:18.460 --> 02:43:19.580]   the product photography.
[02:43:19.580 --> 02:43:22.140]   So that's what you saw on TikTok,
[02:43:22.140 --> 02:43:23.700]   is me going through rehearsal.
[02:43:23.700 --> 02:43:29.660]   - You are also a master at events tomorrow
[02:43:29.660 --> 02:43:31.580]   in the Twitch Clubhouse.
[02:43:31.580 --> 02:43:32.420]   - That's right.
[02:43:32.420 --> 02:43:34.580]   - Without wall consent. - That'll be fun
[02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:37.740]   and ask me anything at 9 a.m. next week, Father Robert.
[02:43:37.740 --> 02:43:39.980]   Stacey's book club's coming up June 16th.
[02:43:39.980 --> 02:43:41.700]   You have time still, I think,
[02:43:41.700 --> 02:43:43.740]   to read termination has shocked by Neil Steeves.
[02:43:43.740 --> 02:43:44.580]   - I don't know.
[02:43:44.580 --> 02:43:45.420]   That's a long book.
[02:43:45.420 --> 02:43:47.540]   - You're gonna be in the book.
[02:43:47.540 --> 02:43:49.540]   - I'm starting to, I'll be starting at tomorrow.
[02:43:49.540 --> 02:43:52.460]   - Jamie and I have been having some conversations long.
[02:43:52.460 --> 02:43:54.100]   - I really struggled with this one.
[02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:56.140]   I was sad when they chose it.
[02:43:56.140 --> 02:43:58.020]   - It's all jamboree. - Listen to that.
[02:43:58.020 --> 02:44:00.180]   John has read it all the way through
[02:44:00.180 --> 02:44:02.940]   and has started over and is now 40% on his second read.
[02:44:02.940 --> 02:44:05.020]   - Yeah, he's saying he's trying to catch up with me
[02:44:05.020 --> 02:44:06.740]   on his second time around.
[02:44:06.740 --> 02:44:10.260]   - Oh gosh.
[02:44:10.260 --> 02:44:11.100]   - He's lapped you.
[02:44:11.100 --> 02:44:14.140]   - Yeah, this book is so long.
[02:44:14.140 --> 02:44:16.060]   - If you are not a member of Club Twit,
[02:44:16.060 --> 02:44:17.540]   you really have to join it.
[02:44:17.540 --> 02:44:19.100]   So much fun, the Discord is great,
[02:44:19.100 --> 02:44:20.740]   but there's more to it than just the Discord
[02:44:20.740 --> 02:44:22.500]   ad-free versions of all of our shows
[02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:24.620]   that Twitch+ feed with many of the things
[02:44:24.620 --> 02:44:27.020]   that don't happen in the podcast,
[02:44:27.020 --> 02:44:28.940]   including some shows we don't put out
[02:44:28.940 --> 02:44:32.020]   like the Untitled Linux show, The Giz Fizz.
[02:44:32.020 --> 02:44:33.740]   We launched this week in space in the club.
[02:44:33.740 --> 02:44:35.140]   Thank you Club Twit members,
[02:44:35.140 --> 02:44:36.620]   and we are gonna launch a new show soon.
[02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:39.060]   I'll give you details about that very soon.
[02:44:39.060 --> 02:44:40.340]   We're very excited about this one.
[02:44:40.340 --> 02:44:42.020]   I think you will be too.
[02:44:42.020 --> 02:44:43.580]   All it is is seven bucks a month.
[02:44:43.580 --> 02:44:45.460]   Just a couple of lattes.
[02:44:45.460 --> 02:44:47.620]   Go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:44:47.620 --> 02:44:51.580]   Your support is very, very much appreciated.
[02:44:51.580 --> 02:44:52.580]   - Thank you.
[02:44:52.580 --> 02:44:53.660]   - Yeah, thank you so much.
[02:44:53.660 --> 02:44:56.020]   Stacey Higginbotham.
[02:44:56.020 --> 02:44:57.940]   Stacey on IOT.com.
[02:44:57.940 --> 02:44:59.740]   We will miss you next week.
[02:44:59.740 --> 02:45:01.540]   I'm sorry.
[02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:03.380]   But have fun and Vegas.
[02:45:03.380 --> 02:45:05.180]   - I'm gonna be gone the next week, too.
[02:45:05.180 --> 02:45:07.020]   - I know, they already told me.
[02:45:07.020 --> 02:45:08.620]   They try to warn me ahead of time.
[02:45:08.620 --> 02:45:11.500]   - Aye, however, he can't get rid of me, he tries.
[02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:12.900]   - No, you're gonna be gone in two weeks.
[02:45:12.900 --> 02:45:14.420]   - I'm gonna be bad, Penny, I might be, I don't know.
[02:45:14.420 --> 02:45:15.660]   - Yeah.
[02:45:15.660 --> 02:45:18.060]   I'm gonna be all alone in two weeks.
[02:45:18.060 --> 02:45:19.140]   - Oh yeah, 'cause that's the week,
[02:45:19.140 --> 02:45:20.300]   I'm not gonna be there that week, too,
[02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:21.140]   'cause I'm in Dallas.
[02:45:21.140 --> 02:45:21.980]   - Have fun with that.
[02:45:21.980 --> 02:45:22.980]   - Oh, sorry.
[02:45:22.980 --> 02:45:24.340]   - Are you gonna be here, Ian?
[02:45:24.340 --> 02:45:25.180]   I don't know.
[02:45:25.180 --> 02:45:26.020]   You better be.
[02:45:26.020 --> 02:45:26.860]   (laughing)
[02:45:26.860 --> 02:45:28.820]   - We have the AMIO show.
[02:45:28.820 --> 02:45:31.220]   - No, by then your photo of Jeff will be here.
[02:45:31.220 --> 02:45:32.500]   - Oh, I'll just put a photo.
[02:45:32.500 --> 02:45:34.300]   - Oh, you know what, now, wait a minute,
[02:45:34.300 --> 02:45:36.340]   does Ebay have any pictures of you Stacey,
[02:45:36.340 --> 02:45:37.180]   'cause I need you.
[02:45:37.180 --> 02:45:38.580]   Good job, Ian. - Oh, no.
[02:45:38.580 --> 02:45:39.500]   No need that. - I'll just tape it,
[02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:40.820]   I'll just tape it to the TV.
[02:45:40.820 --> 02:45:42.580]   - Here, let us go to Ebay's.
[02:45:42.580 --> 02:45:44.180]   - Or just for good, Ian.
[02:45:44.180 --> 02:45:45.900]   - The internet's great.
[02:45:45.900 --> 02:45:47.820]   - I'm gonna assume they don't have it.
[02:45:47.820 --> 02:45:49.980]   Although, Anne, how old are you?
[02:45:49.980 --> 02:45:51.020]   May I ask?
[02:45:51.020 --> 02:45:52.060]   I mean, I can ask.
[02:45:52.060 --> 02:45:54.460]   - I am over 40, I'll say that.
[02:45:54.460 --> 02:45:58.060]   - So I noticed that Jeff's photo is from 1980.
[02:45:58.060 --> 02:45:58.900]   - And--
[02:45:58.900 --> 02:46:01.100]   - Wait a minute, that's all 40 years ago.
[02:46:01.100 --> 02:46:04.100]   - That's 42 years ago.
[02:46:04.100 --> 02:46:05.780]   No, it's not.
[02:46:05.780 --> 02:46:10.220]   - It's like, were you bored when that photo was taken?
[02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:11.140]   (laughing)
[02:46:11.140 --> 02:46:12.140]   - 1990?
[02:46:12.140 --> 02:46:13.380]   - Oh, 1990.
[02:46:13.380 --> 02:46:14.340]   - Oh, okay.
[02:46:14.340 --> 02:46:17.420]   I was like, man, bad enough.
[02:46:17.420 --> 02:46:18.420]   (sighing)
[02:46:18.420 --> 02:46:19.420]   - That's crazy.
[02:46:19.420 --> 02:46:20.260]   - Wow.
[02:46:20.260 --> 02:46:21.860]   - I feel better now, sorry, sorry, Jeff.
[02:46:21.860 --> 02:46:22.700]   - I was shocked.
[02:46:22.700 --> 02:46:23.580]   - I was like, yeah, you enjoyed that.
[02:46:23.580 --> 02:46:25.620]   Stacey, you enjoyed that far too much.
[02:46:25.620 --> 02:46:28.420]   - That was not a jab, that was a left hook.
[02:46:28.420 --> 02:46:29.260]   (laughing)
[02:46:29.260 --> 02:46:31.020]   - I was just like, oh my God, Jeff,
[02:46:31.020 --> 02:46:32.220]   you look amazing.
[02:46:32.220 --> 02:46:34.060]   (laughing)
[02:46:34.060 --> 02:46:35.060]   - It's enough to make you funny.
[02:46:35.060 --> 02:46:36.220]   - I look just as well.
[02:46:36.220 --> 02:46:38.580]   (laughing)
[02:46:38.580 --> 02:46:39.980]   - Thank you all for being here.
[02:46:39.980 --> 02:46:41.900]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday.
[02:46:41.900 --> 02:46:43.580]   You see, you don't wanna miss an episode.
[02:46:43.580 --> 02:46:44.940]   - Yeah, who says this is not fun
[02:46:44.940 --> 02:46:45.940]   talking about Google for three hours?
[02:46:45.940 --> 02:46:47.300]   - This is a great show.
[02:46:47.300 --> 02:46:48.940]   We barely mentioned Google.
[02:46:48.940 --> 02:46:49.860]   (laughing)
[02:46:49.860 --> 02:46:52.340]   Oh, we even get to Google's quarterly results.
[02:46:52.340 --> 02:46:53.580]   That's how little we care.
[02:46:53.580 --> 02:46:54.580]   - Yeah, all right.
[02:46:54.580 --> 02:46:55.740]   - Oh, no.
[02:46:55.740 --> 02:46:58.460]   - We do this show, oh, we'll do it someday.
[02:46:58.460 --> 02:47:00.820]   It wasn't good, let's put it that way.
[02:47:00.820 --> 02:47:04.380]   Ironically, we talked about it on Windows Weekly.
[02:47:04.380 --> 02:47:06.340]   We talked about it on this week in tech,
[02:47:06.340 --> 02:47:08.420]   but we didn't talk about it on this week in Google.
[02:47:08.420 --> 02:47:11.220]   'Cause we got bigger fishtists and finis.
[02:47:11.220 --> 02:47:14.900]   We do this show Wednesday,
[02:47:14.900 --> 02:47:16.860]   2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern,
[02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:19.860]   2100 UTC, watch live at live.twitt.tv.

[02:47:28.540 --> 02:47:30.020]   Best thing to do, be subscribed,
[02:47:30.020 --> 02:47:32.060]   get it in your podcast catcher,
[02:47:32.060 --> 02:47:34.260]   and you can listen whenever you're in the mood
[02:47:34.260 --> 02:47:37.620]   for a deep and profound discussion
[02:47:37.620 --> 02:47:38.620]   (chuckles)
[02:47:38.620 --> 02:47:41.500]   about finis and waffles.
[02:47:41.500 --> 02:47:44.500]   Thanks everybody, we'll see you next time on Twig.
[02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:45.340]   Bye bye.
[02:47:45.340 --> 02:47:49.580]   (loud beeping)
[02:47:49.580 --> 02:47:53.180]   - Hey, I'm Rod Pyle, editor of Ad Astor Magazine.
[02:47:53.180 --> 02:47:55.300]   And each week I'm joined by Tariq Malek,
[02:47:55.300 --> 02:47:58.020]   the editor-in-chief over at space.com.
[02:47:58.020 --> 02:48:00.100]   In our new This Week in Space podcast,
[02:48:00.100 --> 02:48:02.340]   every Friday Tariq and I take a deep dive
[02:48:02.340 --> 02:48:04.460]   into the stories that define the new space age.
[02:48:04.460 --> 02:48:05.660]   What's NASA up to?
[02:48:05.660 --> 02:48:08.340]   When will Americans once again set foot on the moon?
[02:48:08.340 --> 02:48:10.460]   And how about those samples from the Perseverance rover?
[02:48:10.460 --> 02:48:11.900]   When are those coming on?
[02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:14.140]   What the heck has Elon Musk done now?
[02:48:14.140 --> 02:48:15.820]   In addition to all the latest and greatest
