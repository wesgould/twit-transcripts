[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   It's time for Tweg this week and Google's Stacey Higginbotham's here. Jeff Jarvis is here. I'm here.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.600]   We're gonna talk about the Internet of Things. Stacey and I have this oven that's connected to the Internet.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.760]   We'll talk about that. A new device that allows you to use Amazon's Echo in your car.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.680]   Actually, it's not a new device, just a new capability. And of course, all the tech news, including Visio's consent decree with the FTC.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.960]   It's all coming up next on Tweg.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.560]   NetCasts you love.

[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.560]   It's time for Twit this weekend in Google to show we talk about Google and our ovens.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.560]   And that's because the Internet of Things, the queen of the Internet of Things is here. Stacey Higginbotham of Stacey on IoT and IoTpodcast.com.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.560]   And she and I are going to talk about our connected ovens. We're not kidding.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   We're not kidding. My ovens on the Internet. I learned some things about the June oven and we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.560]   Also here, Jeff Jarvis, he's the king of all media.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.560]   Well, at least he's a friend of the king of all media.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.560]   I wouldn't claim that title ever. He's buddies to the king of all media.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.560]   Blogger, Buzz machine.com. Long time caller.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.560]   He's also professor of journalism at the City University of New York at the town night school of journalism.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.560]   And we join together every week, not just to talk about Google, despite the name.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.560]   That's just a convenient hook on which to hang the hat of all things, you know, having to do with Internet, social media, journalism.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.560]   The New World. The New World.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.560]   What's the matter, Jeff?
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.560]   You don't like the New World too much? I want the old world back.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.560]   Hey, the only thing constant is change, Jeff. Come on. It'll just...
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.560]   I was fine with that. To the change went on a detour.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.560]   For the first time, it was like the change.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.560]   In my life, I now understand the phrase, "I'm just glad I won't live along enough to see that."
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.560]   I never understood that, and now I get it.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.560]   But I've lived a long time ago.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.560]   Because we did!
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.560]   Hey!
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.560]   Hey!
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.560]   Hey!
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.560]   Hey!
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.560]   So, why don't we start with the June oven? Because there's a little heat going on here.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.560]   Oh, I know.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:00.560]   We should mention that June is a sponsor of one of Stacey's shows, just as a disclaimer.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.560]   But you talked me into buying this long before they were a sponsor.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.560]   Yes, and I bought my own too.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.560]   And I paid actual money.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.560]   Yeah, well, and that's by the way, the other side of this, a lot of actual money.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.560]   It's a $1,500 toaster oven. Okay, before you get upset, that's a ridiculous amount of money.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.560]   And I wasn't going to do it. I actually put down the $100 deposit, and they wrote me about a month ago saying,
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.560]   "Okay, your oven's ready." I said, "I'm not."
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.560]   But then I realized I'm already in for $100, and you get, you know, you can return it after whatever a month or something.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   So, I thought, "Well, I'll give it a try."
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.560]   But Stacey, I saved the box.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.560]   Oh, good. No, I still have the box too.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.560]   Yeah, I know. Well, I don't normally save the box, but this time I saved all the packing material.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.560]   And I was glad. So, the first thing I cooked in, it was a steak.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   Now, I've got to tell you, this oven is wild.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.560]   If you look at the front of it, it looks like it has an Android phone in the front of it.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.560]   And it pairs to your iPhone, and you watch while your food cooks, but not just watch like what temperature it is.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.560]   You can watch how hot it is inside the food, how hot it is inside the oven.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.560]   You can watch video, live video of your food being cooked.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.560]   And I had the weirdest experience yesterday.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.560]   I put a piece of bread in there to make toast, because I want to see, well, does it toast?
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.560]   [laughter]
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.560]   And it recognized it.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.560]   No, I recognized it.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.560]   It's either bread or a strudel.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.560]   [laughter]
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.560]   Yes, I can explain why.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:35.560]   So then I tapped the bread and said, light, medium, dark, dark, you know, and I said that the thing, it's got ceramic elements, so they get bright red immediately.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.560]   And it toasted it about the same time as my Breville toaster oven, which is what I compare it with, about five minutes.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.560]   But it tells you, it's going to be five minutes, tells you exactly how long.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.560]   The toast, I've never had such even toast, by the way, perfectly browned on both sides.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.560]   So literally my husband and I have been talking about this, and I'm like, did you notice anything about the toast in the oven?
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.560]   He's like, it's toasted your toast?
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.560]   And I was like, yes.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.560]   And it felt silly, like we were justifying the cost to the oven.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.560]   There's no, there's no, I'm going to say this right in front.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.560]   There is zero justification for the cost.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.560]   It's way too expensive.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.560]   I'm embarrassed that I bought something that expensive.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.560]   How much does your other oven do you rev it over to cost?
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.560]   Breville is a couple hundred bucks.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   And it's, but the Breville is a fantastic convection.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.560]   It does every, actually it does everything the June does.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.560]   It's a smaller, one of the things that's surprising is how big the June is.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.560]   It's taller.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.560]   You need a lot of, you should get the measurements before you buy it to make sure you could fit it under your counter,
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.560]   because it needs a few inches all around, because it's an oven.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:40.560]   It also feels like it looks like it's made out of space age materials, like not, like the inside is some sort of weird plastic.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.560]   It's, it's fancy.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.560]   It's got carbon fiber heating elements.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.560]   Yes, this is it.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.560]   Oh, it was the back that it was showing.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.560]   Sorry, I was confused for a moment there.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:57.560]   And it, so, so, so I cooked a steak and it didn't come out great, but I'm used to cooking my steak and my big green egg,
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.560]   and it's smoky and delicious and it's got to, it's better.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.560]   Okay.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.560]   It's not going to taste smoke.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.560]   Don't recommend it for the steak.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.560]   We did a filets.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.560]   Okay.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.560]   It was good for that.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.560]   You have a thermometer, so you could put it right in the meat.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:20.560]   And it, and it'll tell you if it needs, if you, if it recognizes the food, it'll actually tell you to put the thermometer in.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.560]   Which is nice.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   And in many cases, it does recognize the food.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:31.560]   Sometimes though you have to pick the food from a, so when you, when you, when you get next to the oven, the display lights up,
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.560]   it almost says hello.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.560]   It's a size of a small Android device, and I'll say why I keep saying Android in a second.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.560]   And then it, and then it has a scale on the feet.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.560]   You mentioned this, which is kind of cool.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.560]   So it knows whatever, you know, how much steak you put in.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:51.560]   And, and with, if you can identify it through the camera, it will actually say, oh, I see toast or I, or piece of bread or I see a
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.560]   strudel.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.560]   Why is it the same strudel in bread?
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.560]   So it's, what it is is actually when you put salmon in it also says salmon or strudel.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.560]   It did not, I must have the update because it, that's the other thing.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.560]   It updates all the time, right?
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.560]   Yes.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.560]   It's connected to your life.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.560]   It's doing a probability.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.560]   It's, it's machine learning.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.560]   So it's, it's doing a probability that this is most likely.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.560]   It knew I put in this.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.560]   It knew it.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.560]   Oh, it also learned.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.560]   It didn't give you a choice.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.560]   No, it didn't give me a choice.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.560]   It learned.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.560]   Okay.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.560]   It's getting better.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.560]   Okay.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.560]   So Stacy, does the data go back up to the cloud?
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.560]   A thousand people said no, that's not strudel.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.560]   Yes.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.560]   And they're planning an update.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.560]   I don't think it's up there yet.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.560]   I haven't been given this option.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.560]   Maybe it's on the phone to ask, how did you like that cooked?
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:42.560]   So they can learn about like how things like, is there preset recipe, the right one or.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.560]   Cause the steak, for instance, was under done.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.560]   I had to put it back in.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.560]   I said medium rare came out rare.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:54.560]   Could be because of poor probe placement, which has always been a problem of mine.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.560]   So you got to get that temperature probe, you know, where the coldest part of the steak
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.560]   would be.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.560]   Maybe I maybe I missed and I pushed it too far and I thought it was more cooked than it was.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.560]   This is sounding uncomfortable.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.560]   Go ahead.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.560]   Okay.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.560]   So the next day I want to cook salmon because I want before the show, I wanted to cook, you
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.560]   know, steak, salmon, chicken breasts and toast before the show.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.560]   So I can talk to you, Stacy.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.560]   Excellent.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.560]   I've been wondering about it all these days.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.560]   I did.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.560]   I didn't bake cookies.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.560]   I didn't bake cookies yet because I am not going to bake cookies, but maybe we will for
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.560]   the kid.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.560]   So I'm ready.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.560]   I got the salmon, open it up like walk up to the oven.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.560]   It's in a boot loop.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.560]   That has never happened.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.560]   Not a good thing for your toaster.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.560]   I'm going to be in a boot loop.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.560]   So the June logo comes up and then briefly it flashes the screen and then it crashes.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.560]   So I go, oh crap.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.560]   Well, and Lisa said, you're going to be in a boot loop.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.560]   So I go, oh crap.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.560]   Well, and Lisa said, you better turn on the oven, the regular oven.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.560]   We want to have dinner someday and our oven is crashed.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:04.040]   So but they have to go on to the June site and they have, they don't have a phone number,
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.960]   but they have a chat interface and it does say, yeah, we're not here all the time.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.760]   So, you know, but but fortunately, what was her name?
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.760]   Tricia or somebody?
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.760]   June?
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.760]   Not June.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.360]   It should have been June, but but Tricia says, oh, yes.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.360]   Hi.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.560]   And I said, my oven's in a boot loop.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.360]   She said, describe that and I described it.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.160]   She said, all right, we're going to reset the oven.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.160]   This is a good thing for you.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.880]   No, Stacy, you unplug the oven, which I had done already, plug it in holding, pushing
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.880]   in the button.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.760]   You have this big knob in the front, push it in, then plug it in and hold it.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.240]   And you know what comes up?
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.240]   The Android bootloader.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.240]   It's the Android.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.240]   It's the Android.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.240]   It's the Android.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.040]   Which is ironic because they only have iOS software.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.880]   No, they have an Android.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.880]   They have it.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:49.880]   They don't have it.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.880]   Oh, wait.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.880]   Oh, I could be like you.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.880]   No, they're doing.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.880]   They're working on it.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.880]   They don't have it yet.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.880]   Okay, you're right.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.880]   You're right.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.880]   So it's Android.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.760]   And then you have the same things you have in an Android recovery screen where you can
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.440]   delete the cache, delete the data reset, just like Android.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.760]   So I and she says, just do a complete reset.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.480]   So I did a complete reset.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.160]   And just like Android, it get you have to do down, down, down, down, down, down, and
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.760]   then do it for it to confirm it.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.760]   It refreshed it.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.200]   It did not need to do the update.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   So it didn't.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.880]   She told her that and she said, oh, that's interesting.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.880]   Huh.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.880]   Huh.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.840]   Someone in a chat room asked if it's running an Intel atom.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.480]   It's actually the NVIDIA K1.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.360]   Oh, that's why it's Android.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.360]   So that makes sense.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.360]   That's what's in the video.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.360]   That's what's in the video.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.080]   Yeah, that's what they my shield.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.440]   That's actually a very good processor.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.200]   It looks like an older version of Android does not look like NuGet.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.600]   It looks like more like KitKat.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.200]   It looks like a fairly old, but it doesn't matter.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.200]   That's not a big thing.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.200]   It doesn't matter.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.200]   It's custom.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   More stable.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.560]   It's just running on the applicant.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.640]   When your oven rings, answer it.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.400]   So then the next thing is it says, join the Wi-Fi.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.960]   So I got on the Wi-Fi.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.960]   Connect it to the phone.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.320]   I've had a little trouble connecting with the phone, but the beauty part is then it's
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.320]   fine.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.320]   I put the salmon steaks in.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.520]   It says, oh, salmon.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.360]   How would you like that cooked firm or loose or whatever?
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.360]   Two choices.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.920]   Moist or firm, something like that.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.920]   Dryer.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.560]   I think it's flaky or moist.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.160]   It's one of them is unpalatable.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.160]   That's the one I chose because I didn't want firm.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.000]   So you know, it went dry or moist.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.240]   So I chose moist.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.280]   And it was, again, a little undercooked.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.120]   We put it back in for a few minutes.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.120]   You could use it at regular oven.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.360]   You set the temperature and everything like that.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.640]   Chicken same thing with a little undercooked.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.240]   So it's a little bit a little bit undercooked.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.240]   Actually, the salmon was on.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.240]   It was a dangerous.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.240]   Okay.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.920]   So here's where I think everything is perfectly cooked.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.920]   So I have a probe placement problem I'm thinking.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.640]   Well, no, I'm wondering if maybe you're just like your food more done.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.800]   Well, I don't eat chicken where it's pink.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.880]   I don't eat steak where it's cold in the middle.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.880]   I mean...
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.880]   Oh, well, no, that's true.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.320]   It was not doing it the way it's supposed to do it.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.320]   Okay.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.480]   Because I've cooked like, I mean, I cooked, let's see, I've cooked five fillets in there
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.960]   and they came out, we did them for rare.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.200]   No, we did the medium rare.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.440]   And that was for me.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.440]   And then we kept my husbands in longer.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.440]   And they were pink.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.440]   They were still pink in the middle.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.640]   I want to be pink for medium.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.880]   Yeah, but medium rare, but I don't want it to be cold in the middle, which it was.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.880]   Yeah, I know that.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.880]   It was rare.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.880]   It was blood rare.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.880]   It was blue.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.880]   So...
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.880]   Jim, that sucker in there.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.880]   Yeah, I think it could be poor probe placement.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.360]   Because anyway, I'll play with this.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.600]   But I'm very impressed.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.840]   The chicken browned beautifully because what it does is it all, it will bake it and then
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.960]   it'll turn on the broiler.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.640]   It does it all automatically.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:41.400]   Yeah, it like does something to crisp the skin at a higher temperature and then chime it
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   down.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.760]   And I think that you can even...
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.640]   I could show you on my phone because I have the app.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.400]   I could show you videos of my bread toasting because it has a picture.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.320]   It's just wild.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:14:01.120]   I could show you, you know, and then you could see it started at 4.30 pm and it at 4.41 pm.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.600]   It shows you the temperature chart.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.600]   It's the geek.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.200]   It really is the geeks, you know, thing.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.600]   Here's the chicken breast cooking.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.840]   And you see you have a video and it cooked quite well.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.840]   It's really weird.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.360]   I have to clean the camera, obviously.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.160]   Anyway, despite the cost is the negative.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.240]   If we're half as much, I would tell everybody this is just forget any other toaster oven.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.040]   This is the one you want.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.040]   Yes.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.040]   I will say...
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.040]   I will say...
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.040]   I said it's not a toaster oven.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.040]   It's an oven.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.040]   So...
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.200]   Well, it makes toast.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.480]   It does make toast.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.600]   So I would look at it as a...
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.240]   If you don't have two ovens.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:44.560]   So I have two ovens in my house and they're two full-sized ovens and they were $1,500 each.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.560]   That's true.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.560]   You're right.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.560]   Okay.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.600]   So if I only had one of those, I would buy this at a heartbeat.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.600]   Instead of the second oven.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.680]   Instead of the second oven.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.240]   I agree.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.240]   And it's big.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.640]   It's bigger than my Breville toaster oven.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.040]   I could put a small whole chicken in there.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.680]   I mean, I've done up to a six-pound chicken in there, which is good for feeding my family.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.680]   Right.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.680]   And it's good for that because it knows how much it weighs.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.560]   It knows what the temperature, internal temperature is.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.560]   It can look at it.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.560]   I mean, it really is...
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.880]   I agree with you.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.360]   This is a fascinating use of this IoT technology.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.360]   I think it's like...
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.400]   You know how we talk about our smart homes being anticipating our needs and all that?
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:31.000]   This oven doesn't anticipate your needs, but it provides that level of...
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Set it and forget it.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   I don't have to think about it.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.160]   I'd literally shove a tray of food in there.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.960]   And it's like, "Oh, I got this."
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.360]   And then I'm like, "Sweet."
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.360]   I would like to try some baking.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.880]   I think it'd be interesting to do some baking in there.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:50.360]   I will say that during the review, and I don't bake a lot, so we baked some loaf of banana
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:58.240]   bread or something, the top got done and the middle still wasn't done, but it wasn't a
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.240]   preset.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.240]   So I'm trying to remember...
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.000]   So you were just doing a recipe.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.640]   Yeah, I was just doing a recipe.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.640]   And again, I don't bake.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.640]   Can't really blame it.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.360]   Because I want the presets to work perfectly.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.160]   Yes, and they should.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.000]   And I think that's what's interesting is that they will, right?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.760]   Or at least they're getting feedback.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.240]   Yeah, I mean, they switch their cookie recipe.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.120]   I think I told you guys this.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.120]   So...
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.120]   I'm going to try some other...
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.120]   Some vegetables.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.120]   I like to...
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.160]   I love to bake root vegetables like cauliflower.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.320]   So I'm going to try some of those things.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.920]   But I have to say, it's kind of amazing, actually.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.920]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.280]   It is awfully expensive.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:46.160]   And I guess we're kind of subsidizing the initial outlay.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.160]   Yes.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.880]   By the way...
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.400]   The service, the support was very good.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.400]   And she said, "We're going to have the engineers contact you because I'd like to get more information
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:03.240]   on what happened with the crash and the pairing."
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.440]   So that was good.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.440]   She was pretty knowledgeable.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.760]   She said, "Well, try rebooting your router."
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.760]   She was good.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.800]   She knew what she was talking about.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.880]   So there you go.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.200]   I wonder if they do their own support.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.720]   Sorry, don't I?
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.040]   I felt like that was actually somebody who was hanging around the office late at night.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.520]   They're in services because it wasn't that late.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.520]   That's 7 p.m.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.520]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.360]   I want to talk about a different gadget.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.360]   Yes.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   Do it.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.360]   Shall I?
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.360]   Yes.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.360]   I'm having fun.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.360]   I don't mind.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.360]   He's talking about trucks.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.360]   So this...
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.360]   What's that?
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.360]   It's the car.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.360]   Hardie up.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.360]   Okay.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.360]   You remember?
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.360]   Was it two weeks ago now?
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.360]   Yes.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.360]   I was...
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.360]   A-fib.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.360]   I had a-fib.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.720]   So this got recommended to me.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.840]   And this happens to be the company that Vic Condotra is now the CEO of.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.920]   Oh, I saw your exchange with Vic.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.640]   And so it is very, very cool because all you have to do is put your fingers on these metal
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.840]   pads and it talks to your phone and you get a good AKG.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:08.160]   In fact, I will email one to mine to Kirsten right now.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.520]   That's kind of amazing.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.520]   And you send...
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.520]   It's really cool.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.480]   You need your doctor to be in on this, right?
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.000]   Because you want to send the...
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.920]   I presume you want to send the graph...
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   Well, no.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920]   So here's the way it works.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.920]   So Kirsten, I'm sending you my AKG right now.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.800]   This is a live core is the company that does this.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.800]   A live core.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.800]   Yeah, a live core.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.160]   And the first time you sign up, yes, they have to have a clinician.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.160]   It takes up to 24 hours.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.080]   A clinician does look at your AKG.
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.880]   Oh, doesn't that mean you're a doctor?
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.880]   Okay.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.080]   No, but I guess to make sure you're not dying.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.240]   And then you can look at your own after that and you can send it to your doctor if your
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.400]   doctor actually gives you an email address, but that's rare.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.400]   You can sign up with your doctor.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.800]   You can pay to get analysis.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.880]   Oh.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.880]   Oh.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.880]   So if you're worried, you could say, "Hey," and you send it to them and they say...
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.880]   Well, that's my tick on Rayden.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.280]   Oh, Jesus, you better get to the hospital right now.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.280]   I know.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.520]   That looks nice and regular.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.520]   That's good.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.520]   No, you were boring me with the oven talk.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.520]   See how calm it is?
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.520]   Excellent.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.320]   So that is normal sign.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.000]   And it will analyze it and say you're normal.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.080]   That is super cool.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.560]   It really, really, really isn't so small.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.560]   And you can get...
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.920]   There's a thing you can get so you can stick it on the back of your phone so you can check
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.920]   that way.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.320]   But I don't want to become completely neuro...
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.320]   My wife got nervous.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.320]   I'll get completely neurotic.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:31.000]   Because I used to be always like this with my hand and my neck checking my pulse.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.240]   But that's not fully informational.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.240]   And then when I went into AFib, I looked at wraps on Android.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.040]   And there are apps that use the camera and the light.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.200]   You put your finger on the camera.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.880]   But it's very unreliable and B, really hot.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.040]   It burns your finger.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.040]   And not nearly as good.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.920]   Because this really does give you a decent EKG.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.920]   This is only...
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.920]   And I'm only 80 bucks.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.920]   I can't believe it.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.920]   It's really quite amazing.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.920]   It's so tiny.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.480]   You can put it in the back of your phone.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.400]   They're coming out with a watch that will have it on the watch.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.520]   You can put your finger on the watch.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.640]   I would have thought the watch just...
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.640]   It's actually a fan.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.960]   No, no, no, because it works on an Apple watch.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.960]   So is it...
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.880]   Can you still have a case that did this, an iPhone case that did this?
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.880]   Oh, really?
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.880]   A live core.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.880]   I also have...
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.840]   I don't know if this is still here.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.480]   Let's see.
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.480]   There's a database.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.800]   So you could actually send in your data to this database.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.880]   And I'm trying to see if it's still there at the USC Center for Body Computing.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.080]   They were creating like a...
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:43.440]   They were trying to get enough data so they could do like understand what's a normal heartbeat.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.440]   What does it look like?
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.480]   Because one of the challenges of having all this is now that we can see everything we
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.160]   don't know what's normal or not.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.240]   Well, and also that's kind of what...
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.400]   That's one of the things Apple's pushing is Apple using iPhones for research.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.400]   Yes.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.000]   So you can sign up for a bunch of these research projects.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Research kit.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Because the nervous...
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Yeah, research kit.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   The nervousness of this is...
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.280]   And this is why VIX company, a live core is so unusual.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.480]   They got FDA approval.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.480]   Yes.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.440]   A lot of companies really are kind of...
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.440]   That's difficult.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.440]   It's expensive and difficult.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.440]   So I'm trying to see...
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.880]   You can imagine all kinds of things where the signals will be good.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.400]   I'm talking to Vic in a week or so and I'll report on that.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   But I...
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.520]   Maybe we should have Vic on, in fact.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.520]   Yes.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.000]   That would be fun.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.680]   But my mother's a type one diabetic.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:38.320]   And there are signals when she's going to an insulin reaction like clammy skin and other
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.320]   things.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.320]   You can imagine many signals.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.800]   You can imagine the case where maybe it would be predictive of my AFib.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.840]   If it knew enough signals of what was coming up or an insulin reaction or a...
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.280]   Epiletic seizure or God knows what.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.640]   With all the signals you could have, one of my...
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.440]   Jake was teaching summer camp, but I had a tech camp a couple of years ago and there
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.680]   was a kid there who had Tourette's.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.240]   And he wanted to do an app that checked his Tourette's ticks and moments because we're
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.840]   predicting it worse or not.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.240]   The opportunities here are huge.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.680]   But anyway, so thanks to Vic.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.680]   I paid for it.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.680]   Let me clear.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.680]   But thanks to Vic for...
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.320]   And his company for starting this.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.320]   I just ordered one.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.800]   But I think this would be...
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.720]   Now, I didn't realize this AFib is not a sign of a heart attack.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.960]   It's a sign of a potential stroke.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.960]   That's the risk.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.960]   Well, no.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.960]   Here's how it works.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.960]   No, it could lead to a stroke.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.400]   AFib is an irregular heartbeat.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.080]   You lose sinus rhythm.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.080]   It's related...
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.480]   It can go into tachycardia, which is a very rapid irregular heartbeat.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:43.480]   And if it goes on for long enough because the heart is so inefficient, pools of blood
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.640]   collectively and their heart becomes clots.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.480]   And when it kicks back into full rhythm, that's where the problem is.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.240]   Shoots the clots in the brain and you are sorry.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.240]   Or you're long or whatever.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.240]   It's what's so critical.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.240]   I know this is lovely.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   Talk to Jeff.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.280]   Do you want to hear about me, prostate?
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.600]   So what's so important about this is when I went in that Sunday night, I was supposed
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.040]   to go to Tokyo.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.560]   You have 24 hours.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.560]   If they believe you that you really haven't been in for a long time, you really started
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.360]   24 hours.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.840]   And they can clear, shock you back.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:22.360]   But if you go past 24 hours, this happened at once because the damn doctor at the time
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:27.640]   didn't do it, I had to go through a 30-day regimen of blood thinning before they would
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.600]   shock me to be sure that I had no clots all the time.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.000]   I was in tachycardia and I had to travel to London.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.880]   I was miserable.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:40.880]   So now if I haven't had AFib for 10 years until I got it two weeks ago.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.200]   If you were worried about this, you could check yourself every day and then know within
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.320]   24 hours you were regular and it was fine.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.680]   And you can know for a certain, I went to the hospital once and I didn't have AFib.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.680]   I thought I might have.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.560]   So it's a waste of time and resource.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.560]   So this kind of stuff is just amazing.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.000]   What a tiny little inexpensive thing.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.160]   So Dr. Marmett, if I have some, if I'm worried it, can I send you my acor for reading?
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:09.120]   I just can send it to Dr. Mom in our chat room and she can tell me how does Dr. Mom
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.720]   like my kgs look alright.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.720]   Okay, Dr. Marmett.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:17.320]   I mean, to me as a complete layman, it looked excellent, Jeff.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.040]   The rhythm was beautiful.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.760]   Oh, Dr. Mom said that I explained it well.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:22.760]   Thank you, Dr. Marmett.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.760]   I appreciate that.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.760]   I find it amazing.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.760]   Especially at $79.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.760]   Could you do it?
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.760]   But it's active.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.760]   It's not continual.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.760]   It's not like.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.160]   No, no, you have to say, oh, I don't feel good.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.880]   Let me try this and then check out what it's like because you'd really become neurotic.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:44.400]   Well, so I used to have a problem where I would faint if my heart got too, my heartbeat got
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.900]   too fast.
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.800]   So I think it was more my blood pressure would be too low.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.600]   But so they stuck me on a halter monitor and that thing was annoying.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.600]   Yeah, it is.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.440]   So I'm like, oh, I would love to go.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.880]   Yeah, that is interesting, Stacey.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:05.480]   I mean, the fingers, the pulse and the fingers is what makes this work.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.800]   But I wonder if they could do it otherwise or make you do it once an hour or something
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.800]   like that.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.400]   Yeah, I mean, right as I'm about to hit the floor.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.400]   Yeah, that's.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.400]   Go down, clutching.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.640]   Dr.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.680]   Mama says, it looks like you're alive.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.040]   Thank you, Dr.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.040]   Mama.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.040]   Yes.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.360]   According to our bill, you for that best analysis.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.600]   She already asked me who my insurance carrier was.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.840]   So obviously she's a real doctor.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:37.360]   Anyway, I ordered one, Jeff, just I think that's probably a good thing for me to have around
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.360]   at my age.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.360]   At my weight.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:44.440]   You know, when I go to the gym every day, and I probably should bring it to the gym
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.440]   with me.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.640]   Well, it's interesting too.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.640]   Yeah, because you get your pulse rate, you can record it.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.640]   You can see what's what.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.800]   And then Stacey, did you ever find the database?
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.040]   I found the website for the USC Center for Body Computing.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.040]   And that is that is where I stopped looking because I wanted to pay attention to you.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.680]   I felt bad like surfing the internet while we were talking.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.680]   But if I find.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.440]   It's a little bit.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.120]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.040]   Oh, it's Dr. Leslie Saxon.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.280]   Oh, sorry.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.280]   Leogo.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.120]   No, no, no, you go.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.640]   Hey, she's Leslie Saxon.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.440]   We don't want you to fade.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.160]   I'm not going to fade.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.160]   I'm good now.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.720]   She grew out of it.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.720]   I did.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.720]   I know.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:36.800]   I think this is I mean, we talk a lot about kind of how everything is going to change.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.320]   But this is a palpable, useful and affordable.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.320]   Solution.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.120]   Good for Vic for doing this.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.120]   A live core.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.120]   A L I.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.960]   What a different thing from Google+, huh?
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.960]   That's what a different thing.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.960]   Oh, different.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.960]   Yes.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.840]   So this is I don't want to go into this.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.880]   By the way, speaking of AFib, Google+ is still alive.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.320]   Oh, that was cool.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.520]   They have applied the the paddles to it a few times.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.520]   Clear.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.520]   Clear.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.520]   Perfect.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.520]   I was just going to say one more thing.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.960]   So this also ties, I don't want to get it prematurely, but to your new advertiser because
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:18.400]   the kind of data that you can tie to genetics and things like that, it really is going to
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.400]   make the analysis of ailments and genetics just so much better.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:28.640]   So imagine if all of us who use this send in our heart rhythm to that certain new sponsor,
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.640]   you know what this would be good for?
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.640]   What's up?
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.640]   Valentine's Day gift.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.640]   No.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.640]   Here, honey.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   No.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.640]   No.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.640]   Okay.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:43.320]   Stacey, when you get to be our age, flowers or that's okay.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.320]   And AFib detector.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.120]   Like I've got some wax up.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.120]   That's not very romantic, is it?
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.160]   This is for your heart, honey, your actual heart.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.320]   Your actual heart.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.560]   I was going to say, so do you actually do you want to use just awesome segue because
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.560]   you can?
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.400]   No, go ahead and then I'll use just awesome segue.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.080]   Okay.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.400]   There is.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.120]   So we were talking about data, medical data.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:18.400]   Now, the only caveat I would throw on that is we don't medical data to your doctors protected
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.760]   by HIPAA, but it's unclear what can be done with this.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:27.680]   That's if you're, okay, so the doctor had your EKG.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.640]   You couldn't send it through the public email to you.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:35.040]   I don't think HIPAA prevents you from sharing your data in any way you want, including with
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.040]   your doctor.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.000]   In other words, you don't have any burden of privacy because it's your data.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Right.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.480]   So here's where this is where it gets interesting because if my internet was working, there's
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:51.040]   a story in the new scientist on done, done, done.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.960]   Oh my gosh, why is my internet so slow?
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.280]   Oh, I really.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.880]   We need one of these for the internet.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.080]   Yeah, give me the jolt.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:05.120]   This is about an insurance company that is analyzing your voice when you call into their
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.120]   health.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:11.240]   So it's US startup Canary speech is developing deep learning algorithms to detect if people
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.960]   have neurological conditions like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's just by listening to the sound
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.960]   of their voice.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.680]   Oh, wow.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.920]   And it's using phone calls to a health insurer to train their, now this is just to train
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:23.920]   their algorithm.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.400]   Canary will not say who it is.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.040]   It's a large American healthcare insurance provider.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:34.120]   But if you think about using something like that without any data protections, plus your
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:40.800]   EKG data going in, all of a sudden you've really got your insurance company has possibly
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.920]   more information than your doctor does.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:51.920]   Yes, and especially as we lose prior condition coverage, it becomes terribly damaging.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:57.000]   So I'm just throwing that out there as we're in this like, hey, that's actually a reason
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.600]   I haven't done a lot of like the genetic testing and stuff like that because I'm really unsure
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.120]   about the protections available for my data.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.120]   Right.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:11.800]   And well, I was talking before the show about there's a big genome project going on.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.720]   I think a professor at Harvard, we talked to him on one of our shows years ago on futures
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.640]   in biotech.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:24.080]   And the idea was they were going to gather, it's called a personal genome project and
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.320]   actually apply to be in this in order to participate.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.840]   Because Leo is that public.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.840]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:36.080]   You have to be a very public person because the idea is they want to collect full genotypes
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:42.760]   for as many people as they can combined with your phenotype, your medical history and then
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.080]   give it to researchers.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.280]   So they said, since we know we ultimately would not be able to protect your privacy to
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:53.440]   participate in this, you have to acknowledge we're just going to attach your name to it.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.440]   And I was going to do it.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.520]   In fact, I did apply to do it.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.160]   They never accepted me.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.880]   But a number of people in the chat room pointed out, you know, it's not just your information
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:06.600]   you're handing over here, your children could be tainted by the information that's publicly
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.000]   available about you.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.040]   If you have a genetic flaw that's commonly passed down to children, you're in effect
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.640]   revealing something about them.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.280]   And I hadn't really thought about that at all.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.280]   I mean, I was wondering-
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.840]   Well, I said this to Esther Dyson, who he did.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.840]   She did it.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.840]   Yes.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.960]   And I said, well, Esther, I was talking to the theory of it.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.360]   Yeah, I guess if I reveal my prostate cancer or a bilsophema or a son and she said, go
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.840]   get over yourself, Jeff.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.920]   Everybody gets it.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.920]   That's true.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.920]   You live long enough.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:35.240]   Every man, almost every man will get it.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.640]   But it is a legitimate point.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.080]   I still would probably do it, but I would ask my kids permission first.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:47.840]   I think this is- I mean, Esther did something that is a real gift to humanity, which is
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:53.080]   basically give up her personal privacy to further genetic research.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.600]   I think that's really- and I would be glad to.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.520]   I should offer again.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.520]   You still have to pay for the- it was fairly expensive.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.520]   You have to pay for your testing.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.520]   Oh, imagine the prices coming down.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.680]   Oh, Jean, you can do a whole genome for less than $1,000.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.680]   Thanks, Illumida.
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.680]   Yeah, it is.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.680]   So it was $1,500, I think, when I enrolled or attempted to enroll.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.160]   I'm going to do it again, because I think this would be-
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.000]   But couldn't you just do it on your own?
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Go to who is it?
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   U- who, Gina?
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   Whoever.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Who?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Who what?
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Who is it?
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   You said that's doing $1,000.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.680]   Oh, I'm making sure it's Illumida.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.680]   Illumida.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:35.720]   There's a security firm and the genetic testing firm that did it for under $1,000.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.560]   So I can't remember which one is which.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.200]   Well, this- I mean, yeah, interesting.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.360]   Why is this really an interesting world we're living in?
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.360]   Illumina.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.360]   Illumina.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.360]   Illumina.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.760]   Oh, that probably makes more sense.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:58.760]   Well, no one knows, no one knows.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.760]   Let's take a break.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.880]   New Android Wear is- watches are here, finally, and we're seeing reviews, not so positive,
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.880]   frankly.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.880]   I'm sorry to say.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.040]   I was really looking- well, some positive, some not.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:12.760]   I'm really looking forward to getting these new Android Wear watches.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:20.120]   Google Super Bowl ad apparently affected some people with Google Homes in the same vicinity.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.040]   We'll talk about that.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:28.440]   YouTube has expanded mobile live streaming to a whole lot more people.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.440]   All coming up.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.440]   Stacey Higginbotham is here.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.440]   Stacey on IOT.com.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.440]   Giga Stacey on Twitter.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.440]   Hey!
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.440]   Jeff Jarvis here.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.440]   Jeff Jarvis here.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.920]   Biggest trend number one fan.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.640]   Buzzmachine.com.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.680]   And I do want to mention our new sponsor.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.040]   I think this would be a good Valentine's Day gift.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.240]   It's 23 and me.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.040]   I've done this.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.280]   You did it, Jeff, right?
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.280]   I did it.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.280]   It was a long time ago.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.280]   A long time ago.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.280]   A quarter still there for my, that's like six years older.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.880]   Is this Susan Wojiski?
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.800]   Yes, at Pardon me for this, Davos.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:06.440]   Susan Wojiski, who is of the famed Wojiski family, of course, mom Esther Wojiski famously
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:12.280]   leased her garage to a couple of young grad students named Sergei Brin and Larry Page.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:19.840]   And as a result, both she and daughter had, I think, some role in the founding of Google.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.920]   So Susan created 23 and me.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:30.120]   And it is an inexpensive way to find out some of your, it's a personalized genetic service
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.880]   based on the 23.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.000]   That's where the pairs of chromosomes, this is the 23.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.720]   Comes from found in your DNA.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.400]   And I've done this in Jeff's, has done it.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.400]   You know, I was just going through my report before the, because I did this month years
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.960]   ago.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.400]   And I just was going through my report because I haven't looked at it in a while.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.360]   And there's some cool stuff they've added new stuff.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.280]   For instance, I found an ancestor.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:58.440]   By the way, I don't have a lot of Neanderthal in me.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:02.520]   I have 265 Neanderthal variants.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.160]   I would turn a 66.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.160]   Be a job.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.320]   Oh, crap.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:10.880]   I have less Neanderthal than 68% of 23 and me customers.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:15.000]   My Neanderthal ancestry accounts for less than 4% of my overall DNA.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.720]   However, I'm in fifth place out of family and friends.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.160]   So there you go.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.360]   I just think this is so cool.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:30.960]   And one of the things I discovered is a second cousin whose last name is the same as my grandmother's
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.600]   maiden name.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:40.240]   That is wild based on his 23 and me chromosomes and mine.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.520]   You also get a wellness report traits.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.800]   I found out that my hair is likely to be brown.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.040]   My eyes likely to be brown.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.200]   Actually, you know what the most interesting one is the ancestry report.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:57.640]   If you've ever wondered where your ancestors came from, here's my ancestry report, mostly
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:02.160]   European effect, all European, but this is by generation.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:06.960]   So first three generations of British and Irish, then go back three through five French
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.960]   and German.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.120]   And then if you go back five or generations or more, I have Scandinavian, Italian, Ashkenazi,
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.040]   Jew, and Iberian.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.160]   I think this is so cool to find this stuff out based.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.160]   Now all I had to do was very simple as a cheek saliva, rather.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.160]   It's not a cheek swab.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:26.360]   I just spit into a little tumbler and then you send it back to 23 and me.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.560]   You can see how your DNA breaks out across 31 populations worldwide.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:34.520]   Found out where your ancestors lived more than 500 years ago.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:39.320]   If that can go further back, over thousands of years trace parts of your ancestry to maternal
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.960]   and paternal haplogroups.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.960]   You know how much Neanderthal DNA is in you.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.640]   You can even connect with other people who shared DNA with you.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:53.200]   23 and me has a very big database now, more than a million genotype customers worldwide.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.520]   So that's why when I went back to my ancestry report, I was able to find people I hadn't
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:02.920]   met before and you can contact them, which is pretty awesome.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:08.520]   Here's a second cousin, third and fourth cousins, and on and on and on.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:14.840]   So let's look at this Anthony who shares my grandmother's maiden name.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.360]   So I know that they nailed it on this one.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.720]   I can look at what genes we share in common.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.720]   It's really cool stuff.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.800]   And I was saying earlier that before we were on that I don't really know what my last name
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.800]   would be if my great-grandfather had married my great-grandmother.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.040]   If you know what I mean.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.040]   Yeah, but you find out where they're from.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.040]   Think it might be Riley.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.040]   Think it might be Riley.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.760]   Well, it looks for some Irish in there.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.360]   Well, I look for that day.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.080]   Well, yeah, I look for that day when when point of three gives me it relatively in Bradley,
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.840]   which would be cool.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:51.360]   And also I thought I had a lot of German in me just because that was the family lore.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:55.960]   But it turns out I'm 63% British and Irish, only 7.4% German.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:02.040]   So you and I have a lot in common as well as very, very white skin.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.440]   I am very likely to be pale.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:09.760]   96% likely to have lighter skin.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:14.080]   So this is actually they're going to do a $20 off for Valentine's Day.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.000]   See, I think this would be you could do it for you and a loved one.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   It would be so cool.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.520]   It's a bit on a spit.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.520]   I know.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.520]   I think it is kind of romantic to find out this kind of stuff.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:29.560]   And actually was talking to one of our employees who's engaged to get married.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:34.280]   She said, you better believe I'm going to get my future husband to do this.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.280]   It's kind of romantic.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:42.440]   23andme.com, 23andme.com, $20 off when you buy before Valentine's Day, a little less
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.440]   than a week.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.440]   23andme.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:49.080]   I have to say I did this a while ago and I always thought it was super cool.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.440]   And what's interesting is that more people join the database, you get more and more information,
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.440]   which is very neat.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.960]   Are they going to be cool to do with your two kids and see what the differences are?
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.960]   I'd like to.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:00.960]   You know.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:06.960]   Also, and I think this is new, you can get the database of the entire, you can get your
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:13.280]   entire data, the raw data that you can download and do further analysis on.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:19.360]   And I think as time goes by, this is going to be more and more useful, right?
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:24.800]   As we learn more and more about what these various genotypes mean, what these markers
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.120]   mean.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.840]   You can actually search for specific genes and markers of interest.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.880]   You can view or download your data at any time it's raw, uninterpreted format, your A's,
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.920]   your T's, your G's and your C's.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.200]   All right, here's your science test.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.720]   Everybody remember what ATG and C stand for?
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:45.160]   Adenine, Cytazine, guanine, something.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.160]   Very good.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.160]   What's the T?
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.160]   You did well.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.160]   That's really good.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.160]   Stacey, nice.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.920]   I wanted to be a genetic engineer.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.920]   Very good.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:54.920]   I'm impressed.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:55.920]   Thymine, thymine.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:56.920]   Is it thymine?
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.920]   Yes.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.080]   Thymine, I don't, there we go.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.080]   I couldn't remember.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.440]   I am so impressed.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.440]   Very good.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:10.960]   No, I just, we did electrophoresis like so in high school.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.280]   So we were doing like those CSI type, what matches with this?
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.280]   Those are the four proteins that combine in your DNA.
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.280]   That's all it takes.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.280]   Yes.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.280]   Just four.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.600]   Thank you 23 and me.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.720]   23 and me.com.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:34.120]   $20 off when you buy before Valentine's Day, a little less than a week.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.760]   I'm glad to have you as a sponsor.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:39.080]   I've been a customer for a long, long time.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.160]   Android Wear 2.0, we knew it would come out this week.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.000]   It is official.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.680]   And as a result, we're seeing the first, a lot of reviews of the first Android Wear
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.920]   2.0 watch.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:52.520]   The LG watch sport and style.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:58.040]   Both have PO led displays, 4GB of storage, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.440]   There are two different specs though.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:06.240]   There's the, the sport has a built in gyroscope, accelerometer, barometer and GPS.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.160]   And it's also bigger, 1.38.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.640]   Lots of antennas too.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.920]   Tungel TEE and NFC.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.360]   And this is the one I want to get because you can use it with Android pick, kind of like
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.280]   an Apple watch, right?
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:21.100]   Also it's got more RAM and a much bigger battery.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:25.720]   So the sport is the one probably most of you want to look at except if you've got small
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.760]   wrists because it's a lot bigger.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:33.360]   1.38 inch screen compared to the styles 1.2 inch screen.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:36.560]   Styles also lighter has about half the battery.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.960]   Three color options too.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.520]   Titanium, rose gold and silver.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.840]   Straps are leather but no LTE, no GPS, no NFC, no Android pay.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.400]   Cost difference?
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:52.180]   The wear style is the cheaper one at $249, $100 more for the wear sport.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:55.980]   You can get it from Google or at AT&T or Verizon.
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.860]   In fact, let me run, not walk.
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:41:59.860]   I didn't see it.
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.580]   I just checked the Google store and I didn't see it.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.580]   Huh?
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:04.580]   Sagin?
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.580]   T...
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:06.580]   Oh, the tenth.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.580]   Oh crap.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.580]   Well, I guess I'll be getting up early on the tenth.
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.580]   So that's a good Valentine's Day present.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:16.580]   You know, maybe?
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.580]   Do you think?
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:21.580]   I do.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:24.580]   I mean, watches are like...
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:25.580]   You would.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.580]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:30.580]   Well, if your husband or wife is a runner, actually, you know what?
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:31.580]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.580]   Lisa and I have...
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.580]   Wait till next week.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.580]   Apple watches.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:35.580]   Yeah, wait till next week.
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.580]   Because Kevin, oh, buy one super fast and he'll tell me because he's an actual...
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:39.580]   Yeah, but he's a runner.
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:40.580]   He's a runner.
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:45.100]   It does have Google Assistant in it, by the way, which is a big deal because you could
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.820]   only get it on the Pixel before.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.100]   Okay, I have a really random question.
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:50.740]   I have to ask you guys.
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:51.740]   Yeah.
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.060]   Y'all are super blurry.
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.100]   Everything on the camera is super blurry.
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.580]   Is it super blurry for anyone else?
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:57.580]   Check your heart.
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:58.580]   Stacey, check your heart quick.
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:59.580]   Don't get her in.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.580]   Get her in.
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:01.580]   Get her in.
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:02.580]   One of those alive cores.
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.580]   You don't know right?
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.580]   All right.
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.580]   Why?
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.580]   Stacey, put both hands over your head.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.580]   Smile.
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:08.580]   No, yeah.
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.580]   If we're blurry, it's probably something.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.820]   We've been having a little trouble today with Skype.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:14.060]   You look great and sound great.
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:15.060]   You're looking good.
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.060]   So, yeah, it's great.
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.060]   It's good, but great.
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:18.560]   I wasn't fishing, guys.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.300]   I was just like, maybe something is happening with my vision.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.940]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:24.540]   Put both hands over your head.
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.540]   Hands up.
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:26.540]   Okay, everybody worry about...
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.540]   Smile.
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:28.540]   She can be okay.
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:29.540]   All right.
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:30.540]   All right.
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:31.540]   So obnoxious.
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:33.540]   We are so obnoxious.
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:34.540]   Carry on.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:35.540]   Yeah, we're...
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.540]   Yeah, it's Skype.
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:37.540]   Not you.
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.540]   Okay.
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.980]   Is it me or is it Skype?
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:41.980]   It's Skype.
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:42.980]   Dr. Mudd...
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:43.980]   My Skype hasn't been feeling too good lately.
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:44.980]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:45.980]   I don't know what it is.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:53.980]   It's blurring on me, Dr. Pixel and Pixel XL have taken first and second place in business
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:58.820]   insiders list for the best smartphones in the world.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.940]   It is a great phone, I gotta say.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:04.460]   Number 20, Blackberry Classic.
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.540]   Number 19, Blackberry Priv.
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.340]   Number 18, Moto G4.
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.620]   17 G5, LG.
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:12.940]   Galaxy Note 5, number 16.
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.100]   That's a year old phone.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.340]   I like this when the Axon 7.
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.540]   That's a nice phone from ZTE.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.740]   Only 400 bucks.
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:28.020]   The LG V20, the HTC 10, the Moto Z, the Huawei Mate 8.9, the OnePlus 3T comes in at number
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.020]   10.
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:33.300]   iPhone SE, which was a big best seller of the 5-inch iPhone, comes in at number 9.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.380]   Then the 6S, I guess they don't care about time.
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.340]   If it's still available, I guess it could be on this list.
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.500]   The 6S plus is number 7.
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.300]   The S7 is number 6.
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.820]   If I'm not confusing you with the numbers.
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:45.820]   That's confusing.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.460]   The S7 Edge is number 5.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.460]   I agree with that one.
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:49.460]   That's a nice phone.
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:53.260]   If you can get over the Samsung cruft.
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:56.540]   iPhone 7 number 4, I think a lot of people might be a little upset to see the iPhone
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:03.260]   7 and the iPhone 7 plus number 3 solo because besting the iPhone 7 and 7 plus, Google's
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:06.060]   Pixel XL.
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:08.780]   The best phone is the little Pixel.
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:09.780]   Oh no.
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.260]   I don't know why.
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.620]   It's the one I carry.
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:13.620]   It's a wild blue.
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:14.900]   Yeah, I didn't get the blue one.
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.460]   I thought that was dopey.
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:17.460]   Really?
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.780]   Would you go for the color?
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:20.780]   That was my choice.
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:24.380]   But here's the reason I don't want it is because only 32 gigs of storage.
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.380]   Oh, okay.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.380]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:27.380]   Everything I have is in the cloud.
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:28.380]   I don't care.
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:33.020]   Yeah, 32 is actually probably enough, but I hate to buy a phone with 32.
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:34.020]   That's okay.
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.380]   I wish that I'd get it.
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:36.380]   I forgot.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:44.140]   The business of Sire folks say that the screen on the Pixel is lighter, is better, and has
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:48.020]   useful features like fast charging that are missing in the iPhone.
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.740]   It's quite nice, I got to say.
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:53.460]   I was my usual grumpy cell beginning when I was wrong.
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:58.020]   Well, on the face of it, somebody sent me an email saying, "I know you like the Pixel,
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.020]   but I said it back.
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:00.340]   It's so boring.
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.340]   It is boring looking.
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:04.060]   It's not very beautiful.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.220]   The phone, people?
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.220]   It's a phone.
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:07.220]   It's very functional."
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.660]   I'm pro function.
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:12.260]   I don't need a lot of sex appeal in my devices.
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.820]   What do you carry?
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.420]   I carry the Nexus 5X.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:16.420]   That's right.
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:17.420]   That's right.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:21.060]   Because I wasn't convinced that I needed to upgrade for the latest and greatest.
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.940]   I'm still not really super convinced.
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.940]   Would you get the smaller or the bigger one?
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:26.940]   The smaller.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.260]   I'm a one-handed caller.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:29.260]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:30.260]   So...
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:33.780]   I've been very happy with the Pixel, the little one.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:38.660]   And it works with VR too, although that seems counterintuitive, but you can use the dream.
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:42.900]   By the way, Verizon is feeling terrible that people can't get the Pixel from it, so they
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:48.220]   are now giving you a free Google Daydream visor if you buy it from them.
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.220]   The weights are long.
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.220]   The sweatpants.
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:51.220]   Really?
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:52.220]   The sweatpants VR.
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.220]   Yeah.
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.220]   Got it.
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:57.220]   Here's one for the ladies.
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.220]   Uh-oh.
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:06.220]   I'm like, I'm ducking ready to go.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.220]   Google isn't...
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:08.940]   I couldn't resist.
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:12.660]   Google's helping H&M construct a custom dress based on your personal data.
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:15.140]   That's why I say it's for the ladies, because I don't wear dresses.
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:18.580]   Now if they do it, I can see you doing it because you're curious about the data.
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:19.580]   I would do it.
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:20.580]   I like kilts.
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:23.060]   If they did a skirt, I'd wear it.
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.060]   You know, I used to...
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:27.780]   There was a company that fitted you for bras based on your data, and everybody else's
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.660]   data, and that actually worked out really well.
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:30.660]   So I would buy a dress.
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:35.660]   Do you go into a booth and they take 3D pictures of you or...
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.260]   For the data dress or for the bras?
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.260]   For the bras.
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:39.260]   So for the bras.
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.260]   You answer a questionnaire.
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:41.260]   Really?
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.260]   No measurements.
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.260]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.260]   And it was super accurate.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:45.260]   That was what was kind of stunning to me.
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:46.260]   That's odd.
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:47.260]   Uh, it's not that odd.
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.260]   Um, I mean, it's basically like, here are things we think predict how a bra is going
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:55.700]   to fit, then they give them to you and you tell it, and it's based on what you send back.
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:57.060]   Oh, so it's not size.
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:58.060]   It's just design.
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:00.060]   No, no, well, it's size too.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:01.060]   Oh.
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:03.300]   Yeah, it will size and how you're likely to fit.
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.300]   Because every bra...
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:07.700]   Yeah, whether you run a lot or, you know, stuff like that.
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:08.700]   Something like that.
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:11.060]   So I don't want to go too far down this road and get in trouble, but there are...
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:16.500]   And the subways in New York, they're advertising a bra and billboards in New York with no straps
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:17.500]   and no back.
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.300]   Oh, like little cups?
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.300]   The cups.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:21.300]   Oh, it's called suction cups.
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.300]   How does it say...
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.300]   Wow, yeah.
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.300]   And he says...
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.300]   Adhesive.
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:26.300]   Adhesive.
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.300]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:28.300]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.860]   You're not going to be able to jog or run a marathon if you're a big person.
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:34.700]   It's so you can wear a strapless dress or, you know, off the shoulder dress and you don't
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.340]   want to see any lines.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:37.340]   It just...
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:41.180]   Google fashion tape, Jeff, and you're going to be...
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:43.060]   It's a whole world of exciting things.
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:44.060]   Really?
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.060]   Oh, wow.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.060]   Fashion.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:47.060]   Okay.
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.060]   All right.
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:51.140]   So I was just trying to figure out the engineering of it.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.940]   Fashion tape requires a lot of engineering.
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:53.940]   Got it.
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:54.940]   Got it.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.940]   So what does the dress do, Leo?
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:57.940]   Thank you.
[00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:59.940]   Let me get out of this.
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:04.620]   It's like so hard not to say anything.
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:06.700]   Google's teaming up with a digital fashion house.
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.180]   Don't know what that means.
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:09.180]   Ivy Revel.
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:11.540]   Which is backed by H&M.
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:12.980]   Back by H&M.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:19.380]   They're working together on an Android app that will track wherever users go, the weather
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.980]   where they live and whether they're having casual or formal hangs.
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.980]   This is the verge.
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:27.940]   Yeah, I don't know what a hang is.
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.940]   Without information, Ivy...
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:31.740]   Yeah, whether they're...
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:35.020]   Do you get casual events or formal events?
[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.020]   Oh, that's...
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:37.020]   Oh, got it.
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:38.700]   Hangs, I think.
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.420]   And then that's like hangouts, right?
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:48.740]   And then they're going to design an individualized data dress that you can buy.
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.780]   It sounds like the bra, frankly.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:56.580]   So if you're in Sweden, it'll be black velvet because it's cold.
[00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:01.060]   And if you like to go out dancing, it'll have diamond details.
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:03.420]   There's not really that much tech in it.
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:04.940]   But Google has...
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:10.740]   See, this is based on Google's awareness API, which uses all the sensors on the phone.
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:14.660]   And actually, you know, the mostly where I hear about the awareness API is as a form
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:16.460]   of authentication, right?
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:23.180]   So based on your gate, where you go, Google can uniquely identify you, but they also can
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:28.700]   use this, you know, and knows whether you've got headphones plugged in, where you did that,
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:33.260]   what weather conditions were, and then somehow it makes a dress based on that.
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:39.340]   The dress starts at $99, which is in the world of fashion, not a whole heck of a lot of money.
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:43.140]   That would be interesting if they've paired that with personalized.
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.140]   Sorry.
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:45.140]   No.
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:49.940]   I still don't understand what phone data is going to contribute to your dress.
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:53.500]   Well, like I said, if you live in Sweden, they'll make it warmer.
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:57.900]   If you like to dance a lot, they'll make sure there's slits down the side or whatever it
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:59.620]   is people need for dancing.
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:01.020]   Okay, that's stupid.
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:02.020]   This is dumb.
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:04.020]   If you're gonna use data...
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.020]   Seriously, you're gonna use...
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.020]   For good, not evil.
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.020]   No, it's...
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.020]   This is just dumb.
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:09.020]   It's not even evil.
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:10.020]   It's just...
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.020]   It's not very interesting, I have to agree.
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:13.020]   It's not...
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:14.020]   Sorry, I put it in the rundown.
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:17.180]   No, I mean, it's a...
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:24.340]   Using that type of data to market products or offer products to people is interesting.
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.180]   It's just that use case doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:30.900]   You could just ask somebody, or maybe even better, have a rack where people can look at
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.580]   dresses and say, "That would work with my lifestyle."
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:34.580]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:35.580]   What a thought.
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:36.580]   Right.
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.020]   Like, what if I'm going to Sweden, but Google doesn't know yet?
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.020]   Google doesn't know.
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:41.020]   Oh, but it does.
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:43.020]   Because I bought your plane tickets.
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.020]   No, it does know.
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.020]   It knows.
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:47.020]   The Google knows all.
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.020]   It knows.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:49.020]   Okay.
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.020]   It knows all.
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:55.860]   Like, I love the idea of, like, being able to say, like, a bunch of people who are your
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:59.460]   height bought this and it fit too small, or this fits generally too.
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.100]   That's like your job, right?
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.060]   That's that kind of data feedback is great.
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.060]   Right.
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:08.100]   And, um, is it Amazon actually does 3D scans of shoes now?
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:13.620]   And so you tell it what kind of how your shoes typically fit for you, and then they match
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:17.340]   it to the particular shoe you're looking at, and they're like, "You should buy a size
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:18.340]   smaller in this shoe."
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:19.340]   That's interesting.
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:20.340]   So that's useful.
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:25.020]   This is a company they bought last year called Shoe Fitter.
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:26.020]   Yes.
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:29.020]   And you put your foot inside it?
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.020]   No.
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:32.020]   They scan the shoe and then...
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.020]   Oh, they scan the shoe.
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.020]   Okay.
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.780]   I just bought some shoes and they're like, "How do athletic shoes normally fit on you?"
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.020]   Oh, that's good.
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:39.020]   So it's kind of...
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:40.460]   So do you like these?
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:41.820]   What do you not like?
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:46.700]   When I went to buy running shoes, I went and I was strongly recommended that I do this
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:50.300]   to a store where you actually...
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:54.500]   They look at your gate and they say you pronate in and you need a shoe that's going to give
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.220]   you better support here.
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:53:00.820]   I mean, that kind of customization, I don't think Google could do.
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:01.820]   I really think somebody...
[00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:03.900]   Oh, you ready?
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:12.780]   There's a company called Sensoria, they make connected socks and they will tell you...
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:16.900]   They will tell you, they look at your gate and they tell you if you pronate, if you...
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:20.780]   Whatever the other one is and how you run and what types of shoes would work better for
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:21.780]   you.
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:25.540]   So it's out there, Leo.
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.060]   I need connected socks.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.060]   That's true.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:29.060]   That's true.
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:30.060]   It's out there.
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.060]   They...
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:32.060]   Oh, you found them.
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.060]   Yes.
[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:36.580]   I think two sports like sports bras and other things too.
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:41.140]   So it's not just like, it's so you can run better, basically.
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:43.120]   Oh yeah, there's a sports bra.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:49.500]   No relation to the 2015 horror film about Caroline, a woman in her late 30s who was searching
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:54.580]   for a new beginning and realizes she is not as alone as she thought she was in her new
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:55.580]   apartment.
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.580]   Not that Sensoria.
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:57.580]   I don't know.
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:58.580]   That's a...
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:53:59.580]   That's a...
[00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:00.580]   That's connected socks.
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:01.580]   You might not be as alone as you thought you were.
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:02.580]   A little different.
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:06.060]   The socks are really soft too, guys.
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:07.060]   They're very good for you.
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.060]   Oh, you have?
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:09.580]   And I have reviewed them, yes.
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:10.980]   You have connected socks.
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:11.980]   Wow.
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:12.980]   I used to...
[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:13.980]   I sent them back.
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:17.260]   Aren't you afraid of an insurance company's get your connected sock data?
[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:21.180]   No, because I don't usually run a lot, so they'd be okay.
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:24.060]   They'd be like, "Oh, this person is a couch potato."
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.500]   See, you know, this whole thing...
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:30.500]   This is, of course, the argument, one of many, but this is the kind of chief argument people
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:35.540]   use about privacy is, "Oh, you're not going to want insurance companies to deny you coverage
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:39.420]   because they saw you ate an extra donut."
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:44.620]   But I always thought that that might be a red herring because my experience when you
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:48.620]   apply for life insurance is they...
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:53.580]   Not only do they send a nurse out and take all your vitals, they have a long questionnaire
[00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:56.100]   in which they ask you all sorts of ridiculous things.
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:57.260]   Do you climb on ladders?
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:58.580]   How often do you climb on ladders?
[00:54:58.580 --> 00:54:59.980]   How high are the ladders?
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:03.420]   Do you ever wear a safety harness when you climb on ladders?
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:11.100]   And I realize the point is not to screen you out beforehand, but if you lie then and which
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:14.140]   they hope you will do, they hope you will say, "No, I don't smoke and I don't climb
[00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:18.620]   on ladders," because then when you do die from falling off a ladder, they can deny you
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:21.580]   your heirs any money.
[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:25.940]   So I don't think they need all this information because they just put it in the questionnaire
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:27.500]   and they're praying you're going to lie.
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:29.020]   They don't want to know really what you do.
[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:30.140]   They want to be able to...
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:34.100]   What they want is to collect premiums but not pay out.
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:35.100]   Right?
[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:38.700]   Yeah, that is such a cynical view of insurance.
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.260]   No, it's exactly how it works.
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:42.060]   It's not even cynical.
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.740]   The evil industry.
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:46.340]   No, it's this profit.
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:47.340]   It's capitalistic.
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:49.340]   Oh, and somebody...
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:52.940]   Do you think insurance companies want to pay your insurance?
[00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:54.940]   Of course not.
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:58.100]   No, it's all based on actuarial data.
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:03.940]   There is a really cool thing if you want to go nerdy on what real-time masses of easily
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:08.860]   collected data on people means for actuarial predictions, but that's...
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:10.460]   Yeah, of course.
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:12.020]   So actuarial is just statistical.
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.540]   But frankly, that's sufficient for them, right?
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:18.140]   They just take a population pool and you know, 13% of those people are going to die
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:20.460]   of a heart attack in the next three years.
[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:24.260]   And so they make the insurance premium such that they will still make a profit if that
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:25.260]   happens.
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:26.260]   It's all math.
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.260]   I understand that.
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:32.660]   The question is, are they interested in this kind of additional?
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:34.380]   Thank you very much.
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:35.900]   This is the actuary magazine.
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:38.380]   In case you like to subscribe.
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:45.300]   Are they interested in the data from your Tivo and your Visio and all of this stuff in
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.220]   order to somehow deny you coverage?
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.460]   No, I don't think they are.
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:50.380]   I think they don't care about that.
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:55.380]   A, because of the statistics, but B, because they want to give you coverage.
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:56.580]   They just don't want to pay you.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:57:03.540]   So all of their energy is figuring out how to avoid paying off, not and not getting new
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:04.640]   customers.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.260]   In medical insurance, it might be different.
[00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:09.020]   In medical insurance, they definitely want to screen out people who are going to cost
[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:10.020]   the money.
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:14.380]   They'd like young, healthy people, obviously.
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:15.940]   So I've been thinking about this lately.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:19.340]   Their insurance is selling fear, right?
[00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:21.580]   Is fear that you're going to die and your family is going to be?
[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:24.740]   I would submit there's a difference between life insurance and health insurance.
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:25.740]   Yes, I agree.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:27.940]   But the various things can sell fear.
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:31.620]   And then I'm thinking lately about all the fear I hear advertised all over, right?
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:38.240]   The ADT commercials about, here's the nice white male who's worried about his fear,
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:44.100]   wife who says about them as there's a dark force behind, right?
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:47.980]   There's things about your identity and your credit and your data.
[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:51.340]   There's a serious add-off right now that has a new thing that women should carry in
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:57.380]   their purses, they say, that acts like a cat's claw and not only harms your attacker, but
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:58.380]   also collects DNA.
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:01.740]   This is an ad on the serious.
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:05.580]   But you could just get DNA under your fingernails.
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:06.620]   Yeah, just scratch them.
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:08.180]   That's good enough.
[00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:14.300]   I would submit it because of what you listen to.
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:16.060]   Yeah, I don't get those.
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:17.540]   It's the media you're following.
[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:18.540]   I've never heard of that.
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:21.540]   Well, I get hopeful things about it.
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:22.540]   Here's what is it?
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.540]   Serious.
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:24.540]   Yeah, so this is the talk stuff.
[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:26.060]   This is like a mess in the museum serious.
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.540]   So when the TV gets the real commercials, I get the really happy-
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:31.740]   I have a lot of experience with this because I've worked in radio for 40 years.
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:34.500]   And radio discovered this.
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:39.660]   And you saw about 20 years ago with the advent of Rush Limbaugh that a certain kind of programming
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:41.700]   did very, very well.
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:47.660]   And it has taken over at least the AM radio spectrum completely 100%.
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:50.820]   And yes, it works.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:56.540]   But I think we're moving into an age and we know this from Trump's Facebook advertising
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:59:02.740]   and the Cambridge Analytica stuff where they will target an ad to your mental state.
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:07.340]   So for some people like Stacey, they may not target her with fear ads.
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:09.820]   They may target her with let's make the world a better place ads.
[00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:12.220]   In fact, I'm pretty sure that's what they target you with.
[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.260]   Probably or food.
[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:14.260]   I really like food.
[00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:17.540]   Or let's eat more.
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:19.140]   But they know that, by the way, Stacey.
[00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:20.340]   They know that exactly.
[00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:23.660]   So I think that that's kind of old world is scare everybody.
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:27.980]   And not to get political, but it's pretty clear that that was Trump's message throughout
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:28.980]   the campaign.
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:35.220]   Even it is inaugural speech in the American carnage speech that fear was very effective
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:36.220]   to get him elected.
[00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:39.380]   But I think we're getting even more sophisticated than that.
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:42.540]   Fear works in a general with a general brush.
[00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:45.980]   Some people, I don't think Stacey probably responds well to the fear message.
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:47.980]   I would almost guarantee you.
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:48.980]   Right?
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:50.340]   You can try me.
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:51.340]   Scare me.
[00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:52.340]   Let's see.
[00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:53.340]   What would scare Stacey?
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:57.420]   Stacey, you know that all those internet things, devices in your house, are providing
[00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:02.460]   a target for hackers who can get in, reach in, see everything you're doing, and kidnap
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.460]   your child.
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.780]   I know that's not true.
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:06.780]   But OK.
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:07.780]   Son of a bitch.
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:08.780]   She's smart.
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.820]   This is why fear may not work for me.
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:15.460]   Well, I was always told, and I've told this story before, but when I had tech TV, when
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:20.100]   I was talking about how we should really aim for the smart technology enthusiast programmers,
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:23.220]   I said, there are 14 million programmers in the US at the time.
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.220]   Why aren't we aiming at them?
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.500]   That's a great audience.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:29.820]   And the boss said, Leo, let me tell you something.
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:31.820]   Brand is the refuge of the ignorant.
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:37.900]   Advertisers don't want smart people because like Stacey, they know, I'm not scared.
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.620]   Oh, you can't scare me.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:41.620]   So they want.
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:42.620]   You can scare me.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.620]   That just didn't scare me.
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:44.620]   OK.
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:48.980]   I don't want people who are too sophisticated because you people do research on products
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.420]   and try to be rational and blah, blah, blah.
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:52.980]   I'll scare Stacey.
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:53.980]   Go ahead.
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:54.980]   Scaredy.
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:55.980]   Oh, scaring.
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.780]   You know, you can get food allergies in the middle of life.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:00:59.780]   That's scary.
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:00.780]   Oh, that is scary.
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.100]   But not to anything good, right?
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.100]   Is there anything I could do?
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.100]   Is there?
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:06.100]   Wait a minute.
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.180]   Is Jeff, is there anything I could buy to prevent that?
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.900]   Are there allergies?
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:14.140]   No, you have to buy a new diet that only gives you.
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:17.140]   So after the 8th, people have their own cures.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.140]   Yeah.
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:19.140]   A lot of water.
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:20.140]   Yeah, I was probably dehydrated.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:23.760]   But then inevitably carbs.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.780]   Carbs give you a, you know, you're going to be eating bread.
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.380]   Jeff, you're gluten intolerant.
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:29.380]   That's why.
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.780]   I'm not giving up my bread.
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:33.220]   Jeff, you've got to stay away from the gluten.
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:36.780]   So my pizza, not Dorton.
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:40.220]   Here's the ultimate running bra that just happens to be smart.
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.860]   Oh, so you're going to go in trouble now.
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.860]   Boom bra, not related to all-mountain.
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:47.300]   Boom signal, yes.
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.300]   You know about this.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.300]   Those guys are great.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.300]   I do.
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:51.300]   I have not tried, they didn't have a running bra.
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:54.220]   They just had a fitted shirt when I was trying my technical thing.
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.220]   It is.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:58.100]   Well, it's got sensors in it and a battery pack.
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.100]   It coaches you.
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.100]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.100]   Say goodbye to bounce.
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:03.020]   Say a lot of comfort.
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.220]   That's a big deal, you guys.
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.220]   Okay.
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:06.220]   You move and bounce.
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:07.220]   Okay.
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.220]   Okay.
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:09.220]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.220]   I don't know.
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:11.220]   Well, we have some of those issues.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.220]   Oh, I'm getting to know what Stacy is like at all.
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.780]   This is actually very cool.
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:17.780]   I would get this.
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:18.780]   I should.
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.900]   Oh, now I should get this Valentine's gift.
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.540]   What was it on on on sign film?
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:24.780]   Was it the man's ear?
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:25.780]   Man's ear.
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:26.780]   Man's ear.
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:32.260]   So tell me, is this a would this be a bad Valentine's day gift?
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.020]   If for Lisa or for you?
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:35.020]   No, for Lisa.
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:36.660]   I don't need a.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.740]   They have a shirt, you guys.
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:41.700]   They have a fitted shirt for boys or men.
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.180]   No, he's asking for a Lisa.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:45.660]   No, but I'm thinking for a Valentine's gift for Lisa.
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:48.220]   If Lisa is into fitness and runs.
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:51.860]   She's training for the Avon Walk for the Cure.
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:53.700]   Oh, okay, yes.
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:58.020]   But if not, then you're telling her something that no woman wants her husband to tell her,
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:59.020]   which is get off the.
[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:00.020]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.020]   She's a fitness.
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.020]   She's all in it.
[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:03.020]   Okay.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.020]   You're fine.
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.020]   That's good.
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:06.020]   Now, but I have a problem.
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.020]   Okay.
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:09.020]   Tell me your problem, Leo.
[01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.580]   Oh, I can't.
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.420]   I don't know what size to get.
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.780]   That's another problem for another day.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:14.780]   That's a different problem.
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:16.260]   We can talk about that offline.
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:19.940]   That's what guys they go in a Victoria's Secret and they say, she's about, she looks
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:21.820]   like, she's about your size.
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:22.820]   Yeah.
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.380]   Too much just like you.
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:26.380]   What?
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:30.620]   You know, people used to tell me that a lot when I was younger, not so much.
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:31.620]   Not so much.
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:32.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:33.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:37.180]   The bro, they're saying the Seinfeld Manzier was called the bro.
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.180]   Oh, nice.
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:40.180]   That was the man's ear?
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.180]   What size, baby?
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.940]   Oh, she has a one one.
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:44.940]   Never mind.
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.700]   Oh, it's like it measures.
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.660]   No, it would help.
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:49.660]   No.
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:50.660]   I'm going to be on her list.
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:51.660]   She's going to be like Stacy.
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:52.660]   It's not stay.
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:53.660]   I came up with that one.
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.660]   Okay.
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:55.660]   Got it.
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:56.660]   She came running in and said, don't get that.
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:57.660]   Okay.
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:58.660]   Good.
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:00.500]   How do you feel about a, how, what?
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.980]   If it's not diamonds, forget it.
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:05.180]   Not even if it were to detect your a fibrillation.
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.180]   Yeah.
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.180]   No.
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.180]   Okay.
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:09.780]   I better cancel that order.
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:10.780]   Okay.
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.780]   Diamonds.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:12.780]   She wants diamonds.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:17.780]   I have some lovely connected jewelry I can tell you about.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:18.780]   Really?
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:21.300]   That, that, no, she doesn't want anything connected.
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:25.700]   In fact, she started wearing, you know, I said, well, because you're training, you should
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:26.700]   wear your Apple watch.
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:27.700]   It would help you the training.
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.700]   She tried it for, she hate this thing.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:32.900]   She doesn't want to want stuff.
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:39.180]   Google, Google overtakes Apple as the world's, you know, I didn't do this story on Macbreak
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:40.180]   weekly.
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:41.860]   I probably shouldn't do it on this week in Google.
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:44.100]   It comes from a company, it's just dumb.
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:48.780]   It comes from a company, even the name of the company should tell you startup echo.
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:54.780]   The world's most valuable brand Google, Apple's dominance has ended.
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:59.620]   Well, actually this comes from brand finance startup echoes just repeating it.
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:03.780]   Google is now the king of all brands, but I don't even know how they measure that, right?
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.460]   Brand goodwill.
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:10.740]   It says Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantages, repeatedly disillusioned its advocates
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.420]   with tweaks when material changes were expected.
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:14.740]   I wouldn't disagree with this.
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:18.380]   Apple over exploited the goodwill of its customers mainly because of its failure to generate
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:22.220]   significant revenues from products like the Apple watch and its inability to demonstrate
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:27.260]   that genuinely innovative technologies are desired by consumers that are desired by consumers
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:28.540]   are already in the pipeline.
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:29.780]   I think that's accurate.
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:32.180]   What do they say about Google?
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:35.420]   Google has definitely benefited from increased revenue, brand strength scores also a factor
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:36.660]   in its success.
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:42.540]   Its brand strength score was up by two points indicating underlying brand equity.
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:45.100]   Higher brand equity means the brand is more likely to retain customers.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.020]   Where are you going to go?
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:50.140]   Even command a premium price.
[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:53.220]   Number three, Amazon number four, AT&T.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.420]   I don't think so.
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:56.420]   What?
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.500]   I don't think so.
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:02.060]   I guess they include revenue in this.
[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:03.820]   I don't know what the methodology is.
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:08.820]   I have a story I want to ask you guys about because I don't know what this is going to
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:09.820]   mean.
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:14.940]   Let's take a break and we will man's plane anything you want.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:17.700]   I look forward to it Leo.
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:20.660]   I know you can't wait, can you?
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:24.860]   Stacy Higginbotham, Stacy on IOT, Gigas Stacy on the Twitter.
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:26.620]   She's keeping it real, baby.
[01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:28.460]   Keeping it real for us.
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:30.460]   Old men.
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:31.460]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:32.460]   Old men.
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:35.500]   Old man from Buzzmachine.com in the city.
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.340]   I used to be a Wunderkint.
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.220]   Where you are Wunderkint?
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:42.220]   I was never a Wunderkint.
[01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.900]   I was really obnoxious.
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:49.860]   I was an underachiever really until later in life.
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.140]   Some may say still.
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:55.580]   I'm not an overachiever.
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:58.500]   I've never been an overachiever.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.900]   You know who's an overachiever?
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:01.420]   Quick and loans.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:06.900]   Quick and loans has become over the last couple of years the second largest mortgage lender
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:11.100]   in the country and the best.
[01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:12.100]   You can be both, right?
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.220]   Well, if you know who number one was, you'd agree.
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:15.220]   The best.
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:22.100]   All you have to do is go to the website quickandlones.com/twig and take a look at the list of JD Power

[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:52.700]   God, with an offer like that.
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:53.700]   How did I refuse?
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:54.700]   What I offer.
[01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:59.140]   What are you doing for Valentine's Day?
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:02.540]   My husband is taking me out to my favorite restaurant, which I haven't been to in like
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:03.540]   four months.
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:07.220]   Is dare I ask what your favorite restaurant in Austin is or is that a secret you don't
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:08.220]   want to tell everybody?
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:12.100]   No, I love it so much but apparently I don't go often enough so everyone should go.
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:16.580]   It's péche and it's delicious and they make the best.
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:22.500]   No, it's French food I believe even though, yeah, it's French.
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.500]   It's French.
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:24.500]   Péche.
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.500]   Péche.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:26.500]   Péche.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.500]   Péche.
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.500]   Péche.
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.500]   Péscato.
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:30.500]   Péscato.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.500]   It is.
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.500]   They make me throw a bit in cocktails.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:40.820]   And the guy who runs it is just the most nice, the most enthusiastic and you walk in and
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:42.940]   you're like, "Hey, I love this drink."
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:45.180]   And he's like, "I got something for you."
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:48.140]   And then he whips up something or tells somebody else to whip something up and he gives it
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:50.380]   to you and you're like, "Oh, this is perfect."
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.900]   And you're like, "Oh, this is too sweet."
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:54.420]   He's like, "Okay, now I really know what you like."
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:56.340]   And then I love that restaurant.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.340]   I love the vibe.
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:02.060]   When you come to town, bring your husband, Lisa and I will take you to our favorite restaurant
[01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:08.860]   up in Hillsborough, Casa Madrona, and Pam the bartender's just like that.
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:11.300]   We're in love with the bartender.
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.380]   And when we come in, she says, "Oh, hi.
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:16.220]   I've have something for you."
[01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:17.220]   Yes.
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:18.220]   I love that.
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:19.220]   I love that.
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.460]   Yeah, we were last there.
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:25.460]   He brought out an amaro, so just some local Italian thing that he picked up that he was
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:28.460]   like, "Oh, I was in Italy in 1977 and I picked this up.
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:29.460]   You want to taste it?"
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:32.220]   And I'm like, "That is older than I am."
[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:33.220]   Yeah.
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.220]   Yeah.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.220]   That is awesome.
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:37.940]   A great bartender makes a great restaurant.
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:40.540]   I mean, this is a wonderful restaurant.
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:41.660]   And we'll take you to Jeff.
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:42.660]   Come on out.
[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:43.660]   Yep.
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:47.860]   But Pam, the last time we were there, we were there for their Dickens.
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:50.100]   They have a Dickens dinner for Christmas.
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:52.260]   And she had made eggnog.
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:58.140]   She'd barrel aged her own eggnog for three months and put this amazing brand.
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:00.060]   It was so good.
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:01.060]   And she's like that.
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:02.540]   So it's like cooking a good bartender.
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:04.660]   It's like cooking, isn't it?
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:06.060]   I'm taking you up on it.
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.060]   All right.
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:09.060]   You come up here and then when we're in Austin, we'll go to Peche with you.
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:10.060]   Well, boom.
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:11.060]   Done.
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:12.060]   Good for Valentine's Day.
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.060]   That sounds great.
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:14.060]   What are you doing for Valentine's Day?
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:15.060]   Speaking of Austin.
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:16.060]   Yes.
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:17.060]   How many years since you've been to South by Southwest?
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:18.060]   How many?
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.060]   I wish I could go this year.
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:20.580]   I would like to go, but I'm calm.
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.580]   I should.
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:22.900]   It's just a party.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:26.500]   We used to go because I felt like, well, there's going to be news here because Twitter broke
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.700]   out there, four square broke out there.
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:30.900]   And now it's just it's really a social event.
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.700]   It's not nothing wrong with it, but I'm not going to.
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:36.900]   You could shoot the show from the rooftop deck.
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:37.900]   I know.
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.380]   Oh, wouldn't that be fun?
[01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:40.380]   Yes.
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.460]   We did shows from South by a.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:43.460]   We did it.
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:44.460]   Oh, or did you ever?
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:45.460]   Yeah.
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:46.460]   Were you at that?
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:47.460]   Yeah, you were.
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:48.460]   I'm so hurt.
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:49.460]   You didn't remember.
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:51.220]   It was so much fun, wasn't it?
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:52.780]   Are you going to Jeff?
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:53.780]   No, man.
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:54.780]   Oh, all right.
[01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:57.380]   Well, I'll be there.
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:59.500]   It's in March, April.
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.700]   March, March, 9th through 13th.
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.540]   Oh, wait, I haven't asked you.
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:05.460]   You'll still have to mansplain something to me.
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:06.460]   Hold on.
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:07.460]   Okay.
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:08.460]   Okay.
[01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:09.460]   Is this the Google?
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:10.460]   Google now.
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:13.660]   Google now launcher app possibly being removed.
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:14.660]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:16.380]   Let me explain that to you a little lady.
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.380]   What does that mean?
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:19.980]   Leo, where's my punch Leo button?
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:20.980]   Sweetie.
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:21.980]   Let me tell you sweetie.
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:22.980]   Come on.
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:30.260]   Well, you don't use the Google now launcher, so you don't care.
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:34.580]   It's not what happens when I show up when I scroll over in my Nexus.
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:36.260]   Actually, you might you might be using that now.
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:38.940]   Does it look like here?
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:43.180]   So this so what we're talking about is the stock launcher on Google phones.
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:45.780]   Yeah, that's so you slide left you get now.
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:47.180]   Yeah, that's what you're using.
[01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:48.700]   Oh, I love that.
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:51.180]   Well, the pixel has a very similar launcher.
[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:53.100]   Yeah, I'm telling you, it has the pixel.
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:57.460]   No, but I think that they will just offer for first of all, because you have a five X,
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.460]   you're going to keep.
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:12:59.540]   I think you'll still have the now watch.
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:00.740]   I don't know.
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:04.620]   I'm not mansplaining this so good.
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:06.420]   But this but the pixel launch is the same.
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:10.620]   The only thing is it has assistant, but you swipe left for Google now and and you don't
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.740]   hit the center button at the bottom to get the apps.
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:13.740]   You just scroll on.
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:14.740]   Oh, you don't get.
[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:15.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:17.740]   You're the first bothered me because you don't.
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:20.980]   I still I end up in law team messenger all the time and I don't want to.
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:27.220]   You know how on your doc Stacy, you have two icons and then an apps icon and then two
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:28.940]   more icons.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:29.940]   They got rid of the apps icon.
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:33.100]   So now you're going to have five icons on the bottom.
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.940]   But and that bothered me at first, I thought, well, how do I get to my app store?
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.620]   You just slide up to go to the app store.
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:40.820]   And that actually becomes a very intuitive move.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:41.820]   Okay.
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:42.820]   Yeah.
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:43.820]   Okay.
[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:44.820]   Then I can handle it.
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:47.380]   I like being able to flip over and get the weather.
[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:48.380]   It's new stories.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:49.380]   That's not changed.
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:50.380]   Okay.
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:52.380]   Then I feel good.
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:53.380]   Thank you.
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:54.380]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:59.060]   I think Google's part of Google's problem is they have way too many versions of everything,
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.060]   right?
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.180]   And I wish they do the same with their messaging apps.
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:05.940]   Just prune a few of them out.
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:08.420]   So so yeah, they're going to discontinue it.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:13.860]   Apparently because they have to I presume that the pixel launcher will take over where
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:17.980]   the Google now launcher is, but many of us, one of the reasons I don't pay any attention
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:19.820]   is I don't use either.
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:21.420]   I use active launcher.
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:23.180]   A lot of people buy for years, I use nova launcher.
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:24.700]   A lot of people use third party launchers.
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.380]   We don't use the stock.
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:28.180]   I don't choose.
[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:30.380]   You guys are so like cutting edge and.
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:31.380]   Oh, geeks.
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:32.380]   We like to.
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:33.740]   Mottie twiddle stuff.
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:34.740]   Yeah.
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:35.740]   It were really twittlers.
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.340]   I am not Jeff.
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:41.140]   I'm a twittler.
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:46.780]   So they're going to remove it from the optional Google services package starting the first
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:49.340]   of next month.
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:55.100]   So existing devices can continue to use the Google now launcher and it will still be
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:59.660]   updated using the Google Play Store, but it just won't be listed in the Google Play
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:04.980]   Store as a separate download and future Google devices, including the rumored new pixels
[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:09.420]   coming out, I guess later this year will all have the pixel launcher on it, not the Google
[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:10.940]   now launcher.
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:11.940]   It's not a big loss.
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.780]   I think that that's a minor.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:16.740]   It was just two different code bases they didn't really need.
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:17.740]   Okay.
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:18.740]   Yeah, there's.
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:19.740]   That's a good question.
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:23.340]   And it made me feel very manly to answer that.
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:26.380]   I feel very patronized now.
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:28.220]   Thank you.
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:30.500]   Jeff and I both know you're much smarter than us.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.140]   So the world is an amen.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:36.460]   We're not believe me in any way diminishing your brains.
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:37.460]   Nope.
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:39.380]   You know better at all over world or two.
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:40.980]   So we lose whatever brain power we had.
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:41.980]   We're losing.
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:46.180]   Did you just say you were born after 1977, Stacey?
[01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:47.180]   Yes.
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:48.980]   Oh my God.
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:50.940]   That would.
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:52.260]   1977 was a long time ago.
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:57.220]   That was the year I would have graduated from college had I continued.
[01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:01.500]   It was a year after I began my career in broadcasting.
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:02.500]   Okay.
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:03.340]   Okay.
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:05.340]   Just checking.
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:06.820]   I don't know.
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:09.380]   I have ties older than you.
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:11.380]   I was in the city of rural trouble.
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:12.380]   Tribune.
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:16.100]   No, they're coming back in style, Stacey.
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:17.740]   It's goodness.
[01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.740]   This wide.
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:20.740]   Excellent.
[01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:21.980]   Okay.
[01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:25.620]   You want to talk about the fine from the FTC or do you want to talk about?
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:26.620]   Yes.
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:28.340]   That's we got the Vizio story.
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:30.980]   We've got Google's court loss.
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:32.220]   Let me start.
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:34.620]   Let me start with this one.
[01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:42.100]   So Microsoft, a district court last year ruled that Microsoft did not have to hold handover
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:48.060]   information to US law enforcement that was stored in a server in Ireland.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:49.660]   This is a magistrate.
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:55.740]   So it's a lower court than the district court magistrate, Thomas writer in Philadelphia ruled
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:17:04.180]   on Friday that Google did have to hand over data stored outside the United States.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:07.220]   He ruled the transferring emails from an international server.
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:13.340]   So FBI agents could review them locally as part of a domestic fraud probe did not qualify
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:15.100]   as a seizure.
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:16.100]   You're not.
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:20.500]   So I guess I gather he would say, well, if you were seizing data held in a warehouse
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:25.220]   in Ireland to say, like I would stop you from doing that.
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:28.820]   But since you're just asking Google, copy this data over to the US server so we can
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:32.980]   see it, the judge says, there's no meaningful interference with the account holders'
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:35.540]   possessory interest in the data salt.
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:37.900]   So that should be legal.
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:41.940]   He wrote through the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:42.940]   abroad.
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:47.780]   I'm sorry, though the retrieval has the potential for an invasion of privacy.
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:48.780]   Potential.
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:54.700]   The actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States.
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.900]   I'm not sure I disagree with this.
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:18:02.900]   Well, isn't the argument about possessory interest simply because he's not going to
[01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:07.300]   be saying they don't have to have a hard time physically delivering the product that it
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:08.300]   doesn't count?
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:09.300]   Right.
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:12.740]   But all digital information would be subject to that then because it's not hard to grab
[01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:13.740]   digital information.
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:18.740]   In fact, Google said, and I think they didn't help, well, we don't even know where the emails
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:19.740]   lie there.
[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:23.540]   We, for practical reasons, we distribute them all over the place.
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:28.780]   And in effect, that sounds to me like Google's, and they didn't mean it this way, but that
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:35.500]   what Google's saying is, well, it's physical location is not material because we don't
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:36.980]   even know where it is.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:38.980]   It's just in the cloud.
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:47.180]   And I think the judge is quite rightly saying, well, this doesn't harm the defendant because
[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:49.020]   it doesn't matter where it is.
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:54.060]   It's bits that are stored in some imaginary space.
[01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:57.420]   Isn't it kind of ridiculous to say, well, one third of the email is on a server in Germany,
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:01.060]   one third of the emails are serving in Italy and one thirds in the United States.
[01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:04.020]   Well, why should that those two thirds be protected?
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:08.780]   Well, because of all those other countries who don't want to know American servers because
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:09.780]   of what we can do.
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:10.780]   Well, I agree.
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:11.780]   There's political issues.
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:15.980]   No, no, I understand the political issues, but the judge isn't supposed to, you know,
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:16.980]   consider the implication.
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:20.820]   The judge is supposed to say, well, does this fit the law or not?
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:21.820]   I agree.
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:24.100]   I'm not supposed to consider implications.
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:25.700]   Well, I don't know.
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:29.580]   I mean, that seems like a lot to say to the judge, well, you got to see this is going
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:34.300]   to cause us political trouble or this is going to cause a company economic trouble.
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:35.500]   I think you'd have to argue that.
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:38.980]   I don't think Google argued that.
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:46.380]   But you could now you could argue that this is outside of the FBI is it was the FBI outside
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:50.580]   of their jurisdiction because the data is not in the US.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:55.340]   Well, what if the third of the email is in Google handles hands that third over, which
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:20:03.100]   isn't very useful because it's like every third bit.
[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:08.740]   I don't see why data should be protected just because Google's process involves spreading
[01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:10.500]   it around.
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.900]   Their legal argument may be flawed.
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:15.380]   I'm not.
[01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:21.900]   But if you think about this in a bigger picture, it does open us up to lots of problems.
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:25.420]   Yeah, I mean, certainly I agree with that.
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:29.820]   I mean, I understand why Microsoft doesn't want to be liable for something held on a server
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:33.740]   in Ireland.
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:37.460]   And Russia, for instance, says you can't like Russia put LinkedIn out of it's kick click
[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:40.780]   that out at Russia because they don't store the data on Russian servers.
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:44.380]   So Russia doesn't have access to the data.
[01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:46.140]   But I think we also should be reasonable.
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:50.180]   Shouldn't we about balancing the needs for law enforcement to do their job?
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:53.780]   I mean, how much of a harm is this to somebody?
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:57.500]   Do you don't think about when you put something on Gmail, you're not thinking, well, thank
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:00.140]   goodness, Gmail's being stored somewhere else.
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:01.500]   You don't even think about that.
[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:05.140]   Well, but if you're in Canada, you do.
[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:06.740]   If you're in Germany, you do.
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:07.740]   You do.
[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:10.500]   Yeah, you want to not be.
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:16.660]   In fact, if you're a corporate client, I think of Google services, you can say where
[01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:18.500]   you want it stored, right?
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:24.660]   Yes, and there are actually technologies that will cache data in certain.
[01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:31.100]   You can run something that'll say store this only in this Amazon data center, for example.
[01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:32.540]   I guess my fault.
[01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:40.500]   My argument is that Google is using an artifact of its technological solution to try to defend
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.660]   the privacy of its users.
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:49.340]   I applaud their desire to protect the privacy of their users, but I don't feel like this
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:53.060]   is that strong of an argument.
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:54.060]   Okay.
[01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:58.820]   And that's, I mean, Google lawyers, badly the argument.
[01:21:58.820 --> 01:21:59.820]   Okay.
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:02.100]   In any event, they're going to, obviously, they're going to appeal.
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:05.100]   And the reason they're going to appeal is because the higher court, the second circuit
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:13.700]   court did say that Microsoft could not be forced to turn over emails stored in Dublin.
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:17.900]   I think we get, I think, I mean, it's, it's thorny.
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:19.500]   I would all have to listen on Friday.
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:24.100]   I'm sure Denise, how we'll discuss it on this week in law with some actual lawyers.
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:25.100]   Ooh.
[01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:29.460]   What a thought.
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:35.660]   You know, the ACLU, US Chamber of Commerce, lots of technology media companies agree that
[01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:41.060]   it shouldn't, you know, that you shouldn't have to hand over data stored on servers outside
[01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:43.780]   the United States.
[01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:46.340]   On the other hand.
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:50.340]   Do you think their argument is weak?
[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:53.340]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:58.060]   You know, there were four descending judges on the district court.
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:00.420]   It wasn't a, wasn't a unanimous decision by any case.
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:07.740]   In fact, the dissent called on the Supreme Court a Congress to resolve this, saying the
[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:11.020]   decision hurt law enforcement and raise national security concerns.
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:15.620]   So they said the Supreme Court should weigh in on this.
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:20.660]   This goes back to the Stored Communications Act of 1986.
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:25.900]   And one of the things that did get fixed by Congress just a few days ago was this crazy
[01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:32.300]   notion that if you didn't, if email was stored on a server for more than six months, 180
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:37.220]   days, then you didn't, you lost all privacy rights to it, that it was considered abandoned
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:42.500]   at that point and that no warrant will be required for law enforcement to access that.
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:44.980]   That's been the law.
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:50.380]   Now Congress has passed an act saying, no, no, no, no, that's still your private property.
[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:54.500]   Because frankly, usage is, you know, the law is cut up with usage.
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:58.500]   People leave their email on servers forever and it's still considered, you know, theirs.
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:23:59.500]   It's not abandoned.
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:02.860]   Well, no, that was the law.
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:05.220]   If there was a period, it was until just last week.
[01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:06.220]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:07.220]   Actually, it may still be the law.
[01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:10.660]   I guess it has to be printed as federal register.
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:16.540]   President Trump has to sign it and no one knows it'll happen then.
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:18.940]   You know, they should, can we make it just so that he just has to do it?
[01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:19.940]   Email.
[01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:20.940]   Is it Clinton's email?
[01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:21.940]   Is it Hillary's email?
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:22.940]   Well, that's it.
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:23.940]   It should be law.
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:24.940]   And it'll be law.
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:25.940]   That's law three things.
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:26.940]   That's exactly what it makes.
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:27.940]   We were so close.
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:33.340]   I know, I know, I know, I had to get in the shot.
[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:36.300]   I'm sorry.
[01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:38.020]   Okay.
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:44.020]   Google interns work saves one and a half gigabytes a day.
[01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:50.100]   It's the famous soon to be famous, brought Lee compression algorithm.
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:53.740]   Oh, wait, was this on Silicon Valley?
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:54.740]   No.
[01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:55.740]   Yes.
[01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:56.740]   What is this?
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:57.740]   What is the score?
[01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:58.740]   What is it?
[01:24:58.740 --> 01:24:59.740]   What do they call that?
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:00.740]   The Riemann score?
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:01.740]   What is the score that they talk about there?
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:08.500]   Anna Maria Cortilea, who was an intern is now from Romania, now a full-time software
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:10.540]   engineer.
[01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:19.940]   When she was at Google, as an intern, she perfected the brought Lee compression and
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:25.700]   installed it at the Google Play Store to streamline app installs and updates.
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:33.100]   And because so many people download from the Google Play Store 65 billion downloads, it's
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:42.060]   estimated that this compression, which reduces the average update size 65% has saved a massive
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.500]   amount of data.
[01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:46.060]   And intern did it.
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:47.820]   Isn't that great?
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:51.860]   They used to use Gzip, but brought Lee is so much better.
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:55.580]   I think this is cool because it shows kind of, I don't want to say it wasn't.
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:26:01.500]   I was going to say low-hanging fruit for both algorithms and software efficiencies,
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.900]   but it may not be low-hanging fruit.
[01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:09.060]   It probably was really hard, but it's very cool to me that in a digital world, you can
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:11.380]   actually do these sort of tweaks.
[01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:14.940]   And have a really big impact very quickly.
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:19.660]   So that's one of the reasons I feel kind of optimistic about things in this area.
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:22.420]   Well, it also tells you something about Google scale, right?
[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:23.420]   Yes.
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:28.300]   Little tiny improvement at Google scale saves its estimate to get this.
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:30.220]   Yeah, that's really true.
[01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:31.580]   This should be your number.
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.140]   I'm sorry if I stole it.
[01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:41.420]   One and a half petabytes a day, a day, one and a half petabytes of data transfer from
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:44.620]   the Google Play Store every day.
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:49.100]   A petabyte is a million gigabytes.
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:51.740]   Or so that gives you an idea.
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:54.380]   One and a half million gigabytes of data every day.
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:57.980]   I think that an intern could do that is so awesome.
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:26:58.980]   Yes.
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:03.380]   We've talked about brought Lee on security now.
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:04.700]   It's an interesting compression algorithm.
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:05.700]   I don't know.
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:10.980]   It's been around for a year or so.
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:14.660]   It replaced Zopfly.
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:26.540]   So you typically, if you're using compression, you know, using zip on Linux, you'll use B
[01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:29.980]   zip or G zip.
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:33.780]   But this is much better and faster.
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:43.420]   20 to 26 higher compression ratio over Zopfly.
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:46.540]   And anyway, so I like that story.
[01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:53.460]   You're right because it shows how one person can make such a huge difference.
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:55.460]   An intern from Romania.
[01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:59.540]   Hey, they've got a lot of smart people in Rome.
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:00.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:01.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:02.540]   She's a.
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:11.020]   She's a graduate of the faculty of mathematics and informatics at Babes Boliye University.
[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:13.860]   I'm sure that's mispronouncing that.
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:14.860]   Babesch.
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:15.860]   Babesch Boliye.
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:18.820]   Yeah, this is not a language that I can.
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:22.900]   Romanian Babes Boliye University.
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.620]   Babesch, probably Babesch.
[01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:27.340]   That's what that little thing underneath there.
[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:28.340]   What's that?
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:29.340]   Is that a CD?
[01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:30.340]   No.
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:31.340]   What is that called?
[01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:32.340]   What do you call?
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:34.140]   This thing is made up.
[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:36.740]   It looks like it doesn't look like it's in the font.
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:38.140]   They just drew it on there.
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:39.700]   I don't know.
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:40.980]   We need a Romanian.
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:45.980]   Oh, someone's asking about the square kilometer array.
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:47.220]   What's that?
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:53.740]   That's a giant telescope that they're building in Africa in or maybe Australia and South
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:54.740]   Africa.
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:55.740]   Sorry.
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:58.660]   It's going to create so much data.
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:02.260]   I think actually learning how to deal with the that amount of data is going to lead us
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:03.540]   to all kinds of new science.
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:04.860]   I wrote about it like years ago.
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:05.860]   Wow.
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:06.860]   It's very cool.
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:07.860]   Five kilometer diameter.
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:08.860]   Yes.
[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:09.860]   It's a ooch.
[01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:10.860]   Skah.
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:11.860]   Skah.
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:18.500]   And of course, you know, I mean, even like the RSC Bo telescope produces huge amounts
[01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.860]   of data.
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:24.580]   This one will be out amazing.
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:27.180]   Phase one of Skah was 650 million euros.
[01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:30.340]   Phase two's cost is not even established.
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:33.020]   Nice.
[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:34.020]   It's a radio.
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:35.340]   It's a radio telescope, right?
[01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:36.340]   Yes.
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:37.340]   Yeah.
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:38.340]   That's probably important to say to people.
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:39.340]   What is that?
[01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:42.860]   Well, we're just, you know, we're listening for the Howard Stern show.
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:49.060]   We've built giant dishes so we can all listen to Howard Stern.
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:53.700]   We talked about this last week and I don't know if we really kind of explained it properly.
[01:29:53.700 --> 01:30:00.820]   So I'm going to try to do a better job this time.
[01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:03.420]   This is a Google brain.
[01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:10.500]   Remember they trained a pair of neural networks to zoom enhance, zoom enhance.
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:17.460]   And I we showed this, but I don't think I described this properly, this graphic.
[01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:18.460]   And now I'm not sure.
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:25.900]   Not I understood it this morning, but maybe the coffee wore off.
[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:26.900]   Anybody want to try?
[01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:28.580]   Oh, this is the pixel.
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:30.380]   This is what.
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:35.900]   So at left, this is what the computer was given and eight by eight, very blurry picture,
[01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:37.260]   right?
[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:41.900]   At right, what they call ground truth is the actual photo.
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:42.900]   Okay.
[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:51.340]   In the middle is what the computer using AI generated from the eight by eight input.
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:53.300]   Look how close it got.
[01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:55.940]   First one, not so much.
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:57.780]   Next to better.
[01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:02.460]   Yeah, actually they got the lips a little wrong, but it doesn't have that data.
[01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:07.100]   I mean, this is all it has is the eight by eight.
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:11.340]   So we are, you know, that whole thing that you see all the time in, you know, like 24.
[01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:13.620]   Oh, look at this blurry picture.
[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:17.620]   Let's zoom in on it and see if we can see what that person is, which always annoyed
[01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:18.620]   me.
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:19.620]   Magic software.
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:20.620]   That's what we used to call it.
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:21.620]   Yeah.
[01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:22.620]   Magic software.
[01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:25.380]   It's not so magic anymore.
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:28.620]   That's kind of amazing.
[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:35.460]   Unfortunately, according to Google, this was a one off research exploration.
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:37.100]   They have no current plans to use it.
[01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:39.100]   Right.
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:43.980]   We just invented this amazing thing, but we're not going to use it.
[01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:44.980]   I promise.
[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:45.980]   All right.
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:46.980]   Enough of that.
[01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:47.980]   We're going to take a break.
[01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:48.980]   A word from legal.
[01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:53.140]   So the holiday hangover is over.
[01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:54.460]   New Year's dust has settled.
[01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:56.060]   Now you can actually do something.
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:58.860]   Forget those new here resolutions.
[01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:01.740]   You can actually been doing some things you've been putting off for too long.
[01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:05.100]   For instance, you want to launch the business of your dreams.
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:08.860]   Take control of your family's future within a state plan.
[01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:11.180]   Legal questions should never stand your way.
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:15.420]   Legal Zoom is an awesome solution that helps you with the legal world.
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:22.100]   I mean, you saw even earlier in the show struggling with what does this mean?
[01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:23.860]   I'm not a lawyer.
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:27.020]   That's why Legal Zoom was created over 15 years ago to give you the tools and know how

[01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:52.140]   firm.

[01:32:54.980 --> 01:33:00.060]   It's how we set up Twits LLC some years ago, our trademarks.

[01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:07.460]   But for your family planning, Lisa did her will with the Legal Zoom, got this great kit

[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:45.140]   Anybody?
[01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:46.140]   Yes.
[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:47.140]   Yes.
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:49.140]   Did you watch your Google Home nearby?
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:50.540]   No.
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:52.100]   So let's do it right now.
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:57.300]   Would everybody get your Google Home, turn on your Google Home?
[01:33:57.300 --> 01:33:58.900]   Why don't you do this to Jeff?
[01:33:58.900 --> 01:33:59.900]   Okay, Google.
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:00.900]   No, no, no.
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:01.900]   You don't have to do anything.
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:02.900]   Just put it next to the speaker.
[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:03.900]   Okay.
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:04.900]   Well, the speaker.
[01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:06.700]   I'm going to play this ad.
[01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:07.700]   Hold on.
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:09.100]   I don't have a speaker.
[01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:10.100]   I have.
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:11.900]   No, no, just put your home next to this.
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:13.900]   Oh, your headphones are so.
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:14.900]   Yeah.
[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:15.900]   I already did this earlier today.
[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:16.900]   Yes, it does it.
[01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:17.900]   Does it do it?
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:18.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:19.900]   So the ladies getting home.
[01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:24.860]   Okay, Google, turn on the hall lights.
[01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:26.700]   Did your hall lights come on, Jeff?
[01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:29.420]   No, turn off the music.
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:30.900]   Did your music go up, Jeff?
[01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:33.300]   No, I had no music.
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:36.700]   It just the little lady like went around around around.
[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:43.660]   So what's interesting is Amazon has somehow, and I would like to get this technology,
[01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:47.700]   modified their commercials so they don't wake up the echo.
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:51.140]   I thought they said they were working on it, but they hadn't done it because I asked them
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:56.700]   that last Super Bowl if they had done some technology and they ate, they were Amazon
[01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:57.860]   so they didn't actually answer the question.
[01:34:57.860 --> 01:35:03.060]   My echo has not woken up to the TV in a while, but the Google does have a better speaker
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:04.060]   later.
[01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:07.140]   Sorry, better microphones than the echo.
[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:14.100]   So you, you will in the chat room says my Google home went nuts during the Super Bowl.
[01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:19.580]   Gadget nut in the chat room is saying Amazon underlines underlies the audio of their commercials
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:25.740]   with a five kilohertz tone that you, I guess is in audible, but that the Google, the Amazon
[01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:28.980]   echo knows enough to, oh, oh, this isn't real.
[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:31.500]   Yeah, I was like, what?
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:32.500]   No.
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:36.300]   So wouldn't that be audible, five kilohertz tone?
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:41.420]   No, it's got to be within the range of TV speakers.
[01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:44.340]   Obviously, it has to be able to reproduce that.
[01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:47.260]   Here let me, what was it?
[01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:48.260]   What was the tone?
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:49.260]   kilohertz.
[01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:54.300]   All right, listen, this is a, that's a five.
[01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:55.300]   What do you hear something?
[01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:56.300]   I don't hear anything.
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:57.300]   Oh, yeah, I do.
[01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:58.300]   I'm just kidding.
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:35:59.300]   Sorry.
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:00.300]   All right.
[01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:01.300]   Wait, wait, all right.
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:02.300]   Let's try this.
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:09.300]   Okay, everybody put your echo near the speaker here.
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:11.220]   Oh, that's okay.
[01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:12.220]   Okay.
[01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:16.580]   Alexa, order me some roses.
[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:19.100]   Did that work?
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:20.100]   You made some noise.
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:21.100]   Don't make any noise.
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:23.100]   Okay, ready?
[01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:25.100]   Alexa, send Leo $100.
[01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:30.340]   I think super sales got in trouble for that.
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:35.700]   Yeah, there's no FCC and podcasts yet.
[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:39.060]   So I know that hurts some people because they have hearing.
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:40.780]   Did that really hurt you?
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:41.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:43.780]   I didn't mean to do that Stacy.
[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:44.780]   I apologize.
[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:52.180]   They actually talked to Wired about this and in that story, both Google and Amazon are
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:53.180]   working on this.
[01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:55.180]   Oh, neither of them have it.
[01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:57.420]   Oh, that was a recent article?
[01:36:57.420 --> 01:36:59.820]   Yeah, that was like Monday.
[01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:00.820]   Okay.
[01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:03.300]   So Dr. Mom says hers woke up.
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:07.260]   UUI says, I'm not sure what you meant by that question.
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:12.980]   Lawndog says his echo dot did wake up, but he didn't understand what she said.
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:16.660]   I think that now in somebody saying again in the chat room, what they're doing is they're
[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:19.580]   clipping the A word a little bit off.
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:21.180]   Oh, that could be good.
[01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:22.340]   That's interesting.
[01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:25.740]   And Guy Smiley says he's getting an order of four dozen red roses.
[01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:27.940]   Congratulations, guy.
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:29.940]   Interesting.
[01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:34.820]   And Leo, I'm like, oh, my ears are still in age.
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:35.820]   Really?
[01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:36.820]   Do you listen really loud?
[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:37.820]   It wasn't that loud, was it?
[01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:38.820]   No, it's just piercing.
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:39.820]   I don't know.
[01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:40.820]   It hurt.
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:41.820]   It's painful.
[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:44.380]   That's because you're born after 1977.
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:46.700]   Those are the four 1977.
[01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:48.700]   Don't even go back at you.
[01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:49.700]   Didn't you?
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:50.700]   We got back at it.
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:51.700]   Didn't we, Leo?
[01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:52.700]   So mean.
[01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:53.700]   I'm so sorry.
[01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:54.700]   I didn't know it would be that painful.
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:57.500]   Earlier, you said we were old, Stacey.
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.740]   How old are we?
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:00.740]   Stacey.
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:01.740]   All right.
[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:02.740]   So I hear this button.
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:06.100]   You can have the five, five kilohertz button.
[01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:07.260]   You hear this?
[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:11.860]   Actually, did you see the guy who's made a dash button?
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:14.180]   Okay, this is a little political, but it's still--
[01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:15.180]   This is great.
[01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:17.060]   It's still a great story.
[01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:21.980]   So and it actually is kind of a neat geeky story.
[01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:29.460]   You know, the Amazon Dash button allows you to push it in automatically order stuff.
[01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:31.900]   And this guy says, you know what I'd like?
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:40.100]   I'd like a dash button that I can push that will donate to the ACLU every time I get mad
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:42.060]   at the TV.
[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:47.900]   So Nathan Pryor is a 41 year old designer, programmer, tinkerer, crafter, maker, and
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:49.900]   take apart her.
[01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:50.900]   And he likes to make stuff.
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:53.820]   He made a Tetris Jackal lantern.
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:57.340]   So he's created an ACLU dash button.
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:38:59.540]   That's the greatest.
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:02.140]   It actually turned out to be a little bit tricky.
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:05.460]   Amazon does give you kind of an interface to the button.
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:08.380]   Did you talk about this on your show today, Stacey?
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:09.380]   This is on--
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:12.060]   I did not do the IOT dash, but it is a good story.
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:14.140]   It's a good IOT button.
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:16.820]   And it turns out there isn't really an API for donation.
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:21.340]   So charities, you might want to think about that going forward.
[01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:23.820]   Have an API for donating, right?
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:25.180]   Then people can write this.
[01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:32.100]   So he wrote a script in Python using Amazon's AWS Lambda service, which is a very cool service.
[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:35.740]   Also works with the Echo Voice Services, Amazon Voice Services.
[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:41.460]   When it's triggered, his Python script opens the donation page, fills in the fields with
[01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:43.020]   his name, address, and credit card info.
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:44.860]   Then presses the submit button.
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:48.300]   And then if it's successful, it sends him a text message to let him know.
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:52.420]   He was so worried, though, about bugs that he used to prepaid gift card just so there
[01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:54.900]   wouldn't be an infinite loop of donations.
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:57.580]   Which was probably smart.
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:02.340]   And he got the acknowledgment from the ACLU.
[01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:10.020]   He said the real hard thing was getting the IOT button registered and linked up to the
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:11.580]   script, but he was able to do that.
[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:16.660]   So now he has a button on his computer.
[01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:23.380]   Whenever he sees something he doesn't like.
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:28.340]   He just presses the dash button and sends 10 bucks to the ACLU.
[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:29.980]   I think that is brilliant.
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:30.980]   It is.
[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:34.940]   I think that is just a really, that's an interesting use of the dash button, isn't it?
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.740]   And you know what you can do?
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:37.740]   What's up?
[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:40.060]   You can do it if this, then that.
[01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:44.820]   And then anytime you press it, you could actually send an email to Donald Trump or Mike Pence
[01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:46.220]   saying, oh, might as well.
[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:48.220]   You just did this.
[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:50.700]   Just so you know that tweet.
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:52.380]   Exactly.
[01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:53.860]   And folks will be fair.
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:55.340]   You could donate to Breitbart too.
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:56.340]   Why not?
[01:40:56.340 --> 01:40:57.340]   Yeah.
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:58.340]   Or you know, you could do Twilio.
[01:40:58.340 --> 01:40:59.340]   Can you do Twilio?
[01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:01.540]   Make phone calls and make a phone call.
[01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:03.580]   Tell your senator.
[01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:05.140]   We're going to just pissed me off.
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:10.940]   The other favorite thing I have is all kinds of people are making teen vote subscriptions
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:11.940]   for their senators.
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:14.540]   Yeah, because teen vote has been very political.
[01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:15.540]   It's been amazing.
[01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:16.540]   Amazing.
[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:19.900]   So we have a friend we have Adam on the new screensavers who runs a company called the
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:23.100]   Jolly Roger Telephone Company.
[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:24.620]   You may remember this.
[01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:28.540]   He created robots that if you get a call from a telemarketer, you could transfer the call
[01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:32.300]   over to their robot and it will tie them up for hours.
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:33.780]   Oh, yes.
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:34.780]   Hours.
[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:39.020]   Here you want to hear one just after months of asking for help, somebody finally teaches
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:43.380]   Sally how to record her favorite TV shows.
[01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:45.660]   So this is one of the.
[01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:46.660]   Hello.
[01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:47.660]   Hi.
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:48.660]   My name is Stephanie.
[01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:52.260]   I'm a customer service manager for the home.
[01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:53.260]   Hello.
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:54.940]   I'm just following up.
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:55.940]   Yeah.
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:56.940]   Hi.
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:57.940]   Hi.
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:41:58.940]   Can you hear me?
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:41:59.940]   Hi.
[01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:00.940]   My name is Stephanie.
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:01.940]   I'm a customer service manager.
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:03.580]   The loud voice is the robot.
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:04.580]   Yeah.
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:05.580]   I'm not that bad.
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:09.180]   I request information that was made about a walk in bathtub.
[01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:10.180]   The van.
[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:12.980]   Therapeutic walk in bathtub.
[01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:13.980]   Yeah.
[01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:17.660]   Can you get to the point?
[01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:18.660]   No mean.
[01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:23.180]   And I feel bad for the telemarketer because it's just, it's not that's a poor nice lady
[01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:25.100]   who's just trying to do a job.
[01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:29.900]   However, there are some telemarketers I would very much like to punish.
[01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:35.900]   The people call you say, hello, I'm calling from windows and your machine has a virus
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:38.220]   on it and I can help you remove it.
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:41.540]   You know those guys, it's becoming a plague.
[01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:47.620]   So the Jolly Roger phone company is creating an outbound bot.
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:51.980]   When you get the pop up on your screen, you just send the number to the Jolly Roger phone
[01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:59.260]   company and he's going to have hundreds of his bots call that number and harass them.
[01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:03.820]   I'm sure it's illegal, but I love the idea.
[01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:09.220]   We're going to actually interview a lot of screen savers on Saturday and maybe we'll
[01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:13.260]   even try it out.
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:15.860]   Don't call me.
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:19.580]   It's probably illegal, but maybe not.
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:21.460]   Not under this FCC.
[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:23.380]   Nothing's illegal now, baby.
[01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:26.620]   Yeah, you're FCC buddies do it all kinds of things fella.
[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:27.620]   What's new by the way?
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:28.620]   Hey, did I get it wrong?
[01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:33.820]   Because I was talking about Lifeline last week and I had seen the story that nine companies
[01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:35.620]   were knocked off of that.
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:41.980]   But then I got a text message from one of our good friends, Alison from Nacilla cast,
[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:46.740]   who said no, there are still 891 companies still doing it.
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:48.740]   Is that the case or is Lifeline?
[01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:49.740]   There are a lot of Lifeline companies.
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:53.860]   Okay, so Lifeline Broadband is not dead.
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:56.180]   Those guys were kicked off mostly for a procedural issue.
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:57.180]   Yeah.
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:59.060]   So I want to correct myself.
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:03.780]   So Lifeline Broadband is not dead.
[01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:05.020]   Or is it?
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:09.820]   Is it all of the Lifeline Broadband people?
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:13.220]   Because there's Lifeline and then there's Lifeline Broadband, isn't there?
[01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:14.940]   There's Lifeline, which is phone service.
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:19.700]   And last year the FCC extended it to include Broadband.
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:24.580]   So the question is, were those nine the only ones providing Broadband through Lifeline?
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:25.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:27.460]   And here's where we're going to find out.
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:29.300]   Yeah, I'm looking.
[01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:34.980]   He defends it saying there was 14 projects participated in the Broadband Pilot Program.
[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:40.100]   But he and his Medium Post, to Jip Pai said, first our action only impacted nine of the
[01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:43.900]   over 900 providers participating in the Lifeline program.
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:50.140]   Maybe he's misrepresenting that as the Lifeline Telephone Program has 900 providers.
[01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:54.260]   The Lifeline Broadband Program had 14 originally.
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:55.260]   Okay.
[01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:57.820]   How many of those are still there?
[01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:04.940]   So in that case, that's a very misleading Medium Post from Agile.
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:07.940]   And then we'll find out how many of these are there?
[01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:10.940]   And then we'll find out how many of these are there?
[01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:13.940]   And then we'll find out how many of these are there?
[01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:16.940]   And then we'll find out how many of these are there?
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:19.940]   And then we'll find out how many of these are there?
[01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:22.940]   And then we'll find out how many of these are there?
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:25.940]   And then we'll find out how many of these are there?
[01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:28.940]   And then we'll find out how many of these are there?
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:31.940]   And then we'll find out how many of these are there?
[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:39.020]   If you want to read more, and maybe this is a hyperbolic headline, but it does sound like
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:48.180]   the program to provide, I do like it, frankly, that he is posting a response on Medium.
[01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:50.540]   Right?
[01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:54.380]   That's at least reaching out and participating and saying something.
[01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:59.700]   I would hope that this would be fact checked.
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:00.860]   By whom?
[01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:01.860]   By Stacey Higginbotham.
[01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:02.860]   Oh, Lord.
[01:46:02.860 --> 01:46:05.860]   I don't know if you pay me enough to fact check.
[01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:06.860]   Do you have?
[01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:08.860]   Yeah, I know, really.
[01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:12.380]   But what I'd like, I'll all right, I'll tell you what, I'll go home and I'll fact check
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:13.380]   it.
[01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:14.380]   I'll do some research.
[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:15.380]   Oh, I know.
[01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:16.380]   I'm looking for it right now.
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:17.380]   And I'll just email it.
[01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:20.620]   And we can post this as a comment in this Medium post, which is one of the advantages
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:23.580]   at Medium posts is you can annotate them.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:27.940]   So I do, but I do want to say I may have misstated that.
[01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:36.940]   And so we're going to figure that one out.
[01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:39.060]   I'm digging through the Lifeline modern-
[01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:41.380]   My sense was, yeah, this is the problem.
[01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:42.380]   It's kind of obfuscated.
[01:46:42.380 --> 01:46:47.140]   My sense was that people are not going to get Lifeline broadband service.
[01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:50.580]   They might get Lifeline phone service, but the Lifeline broadband program is gone.
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:52.540]   But I may be wrong and we'll check.
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:57.300]   YouTube Mobile Live Streaming is here starting with channels above 10,000 subscribers.
[01:46:57.300 --> 01:46:59.340]   I've had live streaming on YouTube for a while.
[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:04.420]   Samsung offered it on some of its phones and with its 360 camera.
[01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:10.060]   But if you didn't have one of those or you weren't a verified user who was allowed to
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:16.260]   do this or whatever it was that you had to have, now anybody with more than 10,000 subscribers
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:18.420]   on YouTube can do it.
[01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:25.140]   And eventually YouTube says everybody who has YouTube will be and has the ability to
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:27.740]   stream life from a phone will be able to do that.
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:31.020]   I was surprised that frankly it was taking us so long because Facebook's competition
[01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:34.660]   in Facebook Live has been out there for eight months now.
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:39.820]   YouTube has much more experience in video.
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:41.340]   It's got to be expensive.
[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:45.340]   Yeah, that's what they said about YouTube original.
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:47.860]   YouTube's expensive, isn't it?
[01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:48.860]   YouTube was.
[01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:49.860]   Let's talk about Facebook.
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:50.860]   What's the latest?
[01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:53.780]   So this was a number, but I'm not going to steal it from myself, which is fine.
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:48:00.260]   What's the number now on Senator Warren's?
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:05.140]   So when she got kicked off of the Senate floor yesterday or told us down.
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:12.980]   She was told you may not read this letter from 1986 by Coretta Scott King was sent to
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:20.580]   the Senate during Jeff Sessions confirmation hearing for being a federal judge.
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:28.260]   Coretta Scott King saying that Sessions had used, tried to suppress voting by black
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:31.100]   voters.
[01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:35.940]   Elizabeth Warren tried to read it last night on the Senate floor and was stopped procedurally
[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:39.740]   by Mitch McConnell who said it was impugning a fellow Senator.
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:41.260]   That's a rule in the Senate.
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:43.020]   You can't impugn other senators.
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:46.500]   However, another Senator then read the cover letter.
[01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:47.500]   Many senators have since.
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:49.140]   Oh, more than one.
[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:51.540]   Oh, lots of men have and they weren't stopped.
[01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:52.540]   Oh, that's bizarre.
[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:53.540]   So she went off.
[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:56.380]   You know, the Republicans don't like Uppity women.
[01:48:56.380 --> 01:48:57.380]   Exactly.
[01:48:57.380 --> 01:48:58.380]   Well, it may be they were.
[01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:01.700]   They kind of probably knew that Elizabeth Warren was going to do it and had procedurally
[01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:02.700]   had prepared for it.
[01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:05.580]   Maybe they weren't prepared for 50 other guys to do it.
[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:06.580]   I don't know.
[01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:10.420]   Well, the argument, the argument on morning Joe this morning, why do I watch that?
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:15.180]   But the argument, Steve Schmidt made, which is that McConnell wanted to do exactly that
[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:19.620]   because that's Trump once Elizabeth Warren to be his opponent in 2020.
[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:23.380]   And so they're setting her up to be the leader of resistance because I think they could
[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:24.380]   beat her.
[01:49:24.380 --> 01:49:25.740]   How cynical is that?
[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:27.700]   I just put on the on the rundown chat.
[01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:32.100]   I put there was a great thread that then explained was rule 19.
[01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:33.100]   Well, 18.
[01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:36.620]   Yes, I've had impugning a fellow Senator.
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:43.260]   So so it explains the like like the Electoral College itself has racist roots going back
[01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:44.260]   to abolition.
[01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:51.260]   I'm a kind of later related, but it's kind of fascinating with John Quincy Adams was involved
[01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:53.820]   and they basically tried to shut up the abolitionists.
[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:56.860]   And that's what led to rule 19.
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:50:02.660]   The show more if you saw the Spielberg movie about Lincoln, you saw how vicious the debate
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:08.340]   was over the what was the amendment?
[01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:12.500]   I can't remember, but they were really calling each other names so I can see why they
[01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:13.500]   know.
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:14.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:16.000]   It was that was wonderful, by the way.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.100]   That's a great movie to watch if you ever want to enjoy.
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:26.580]   So anyway, Elizabeth Warren's video now has more than 9 million views on life.
[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:29.180]   And it is a huge meme on Twitter.
[01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:32.300]   She persisted persist persist.
[01:50:32.300 --> 01:50:37.740]   Oh, Kamala Harris, our senator from California says by silencing Elizabeth Warren, the GOP
[01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:41.860]   gave women around the world a rallying cry.
[01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:43.780]   She persisted.
[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:45.660]   This is what McConnell said.
[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:47.180]   She was warned.
[01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:48.180]   She was warned.
[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:49.180]   And now she persisted.
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:51.500]   So yeah, nevertheless, she persists.
[01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:54.100]   She sure has been made already.
[01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:56.780]   Well, yeah, God, it works.
[01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:58.700]   Resist persist.
[01:50:58.700 --> 01:50:59.700]   Resistant persist.
[01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:07.380]   And then of course, the all the women who persisted like a Anthony and so join her truth
[01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:09.380]   and on and on and on.
[01:51:09.380 --> 01:51:11.340]   All right.
[01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:16.620]   Just another thing to wear when you go to that next March.
[01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:17.620]   Let's see.
[01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:19.620]   What else?
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:26.420]   Facebook launches fake news filter in France.
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:29.740]   Actually, that's because the French have an election coming up.
[01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:30.740]   They election coming up.
[01:51:30.740 --> 01:51:32.660]   So yes, again, I think Google is working on this too.
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:35.660]   So yeah, they're doing cooperative stuff there.
[01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:37.540]   So that shows they can do ahead of it.
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:38.540]   They can't do it.
[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:42.340]   Well, yeah, I mean, they're showing they're doing what's the one they did here and they're
[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:43.500]   trying to get ahead of it this time.
[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:50.820]   Is it just my Facebook feed or has Facebook, to at least the way I see it as replaced to
[01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:53.820]   some degree Twitter as a news feed.
[01:51:53.820 --> 01:52:00.700]   Facebook no longer is pictures of doggies and my friends, new babies as much as is news.
[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:02.260]   It's also learning about you.
[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:03.260]   I had a meeting.
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:07.900]   Yeah, I had an off the record meeting with a bunch of product people on Facebook.
[01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:10.620]   We could go fascinating, absolutely fascinating.
[01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:14.100]   But one thing they said that I think this is fine.
[01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:16.780]   One of the phrases they use is news whales.
[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:18.940]   Am I a news whale?
[01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:20.380]   Yeah, you're a news whale.
[01:52:20.380 --> 01:52:25.460]   And if you're in some news whales will end up 95% of their feed will be news.
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:27.980]   Some people will have zero news in their field.
[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:28.980]   Interesting.
[01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:29.980]   So it's just me.
[01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:31.860]   Is that like casino whales?
[01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:37.260]   No, but you hope it's not like the news whale and the fail whale or cousins.
[01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:43.180]   I still get a few things, but a lot of political.
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:47.620]   I think it's also just the times and the politicization of our friends and people are
[01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:52.460]   talking about this stuff and they're making jokes.
[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:55.460]   I have my new hip-hop name, EZD.
[01:52:55.460 --> 01:53:02.140]   It's a lot of, here's Dan Lyons with an EZD joke.
[01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:06.580]   So it's just the topic of the moment across tons of conversations.
[01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:08.900]   I don't think it's just the personalization.
[01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:10.180]   I think it's what people are talking about.
[01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:12.180]   So that's kind of interesting.
[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:19.220]   Boy, if nothing else, we're seeing how important social media has become to the body politic,
[01:53:19.220 --> 01:53:21.500]   to the national discussion.
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:22.500]   Is it a good thing?
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:24.940]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:29.260]   People in all, but I think that the issue we have now is still the civility problem.
[01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:30.260]   I mean, I...
[01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:35.660]   Well, the civility problem and the echo chamber/filter bubble problem, right?
[01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:40.420]   Because basically people unfollow, people don't agree with them.
[01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:41.420]   So here's...
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:42.420]   Let me try this idea out on you.
[01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:47.580]   So what I think is what the internet enabled first was speaking, what it didn't enable
[01:53:47.580 --> 01:53:49.580]   was listening.
[01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:50.780]   And everybody's going to speak.
[01:53:50.780 --> 01:53:51.780]   We can all speak now.
[01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:58.340]   We can yell up and speak and there's no conversational requirement, really, right?
[01:53:58.340 --> 01:53:59.340]   You can go on and...
[01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:00.340]   We're all just shouting at each other.
[01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:03.100]   That's the architecture of the thing.
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:04.100]   Yeah.
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:07.580]   And how we find better conversational mechanisms.
[01:54:07.580 --> 01:54:14.580]   I mean, Zuckerberg, when he wrote his 13th birthday bar bits of a post about Facebook,
[01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:20.700]   I'm assuming it's mail, you know, talked about the goals and talked about it.
[01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:22.700]   And I think Facebook has a lot more opportunities.
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:29.020]   It's barely begun to connect us in meaningful ways and introduce us to strangers and encourage
[01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:30.980]   us to have conversations that are civilized.
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:37.060]   And I think there's a lot more it can do that it's still yet young.
[01:54:37.060 --> 01:54:39.980]   But the problem is that we don't listen well as a society.
[01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:43.700]   We shout well because that's the opportunity we have now.
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:44.860]   But then you're not heard.
[01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:45.860]   That's frustrating.
[01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:46.860]   And so you shout louder.
[01:54:46.860 --> 01:54:47.860]   Yeah.
[01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:50.020]   I think that's a function of the media.
[01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:54.180]   And I think it's probably a function of the media being dominated more by...
[01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:55.180]   Pundertree.
[01:54:55.180 --> 01:54:56.180]   A certain...
[01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:58.340]   Yeah, pundertree, a certain personality.
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:01.620]   I mean, if I think about like why...
[01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:07.540]   I was thinking about this in relation to Donald Trump and the idea that the Defense
[01:55:07.540 --> 01:55:12.620]   Department might take space in the Trump Tower in comparing that in my head to what
[01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:17.500]   happens when Hillary and Bill were like leasing out the Lincoln bedroom.
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:21.620]   When I don't don't kill me, Jeff.
[01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:27.740]   I'm just thinking about what drives the aggravation behind all of these and why one might be okay
[01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:30.900]   to the other but not the other is...
[01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:35.580]   Is the people yelling about it on cable TV, to be honest?
[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:36.580]   I think so.
[01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:37.580]   I agree.
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:39.860]   I listened to a really great interview.
[01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:43.580]   Alec Baldwin's podcast, "Here's the Thing is So Good."
[01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:47.500]   And a couple of months ago he interviewed...
[01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:48.500]   Is it Bob Garfield?
[01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:49.500]   It's interesting.
[01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:52.500]   Yeah, the media critic.
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:53.500]   He's media critic.
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:54.500]   And he said...
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:55.500]   It's very funny.
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:56.500]   He's very good.
[01:55:56.500 --> 01:56:01.020]   And he says, "I stay away from all cable news shows because they're not journalism.
[01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:02.180]   They're pundertree."
[01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:06.540]   He says, "There's not that many news stories to fill a 24-hour news cycle.
[01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:08.020]   So what it mostly is..."
[01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:09.020]   And he's absent.
[01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:11.180]   And once he said it, I thought, "Oh, he's right."
[01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:17.980]   And what happens is you watch the cable news network that feeds your vision of the world.
[01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:26.460]   And it becomes a nonstop stream of kind of conformational bias that just solidifies
[01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:28.980]   you in your thoughts.
[01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:34.780]   And he said, "I think it would be good for all of us to turn off the cable news networks.
[01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:40.260]   Read newspapers of record maybe but not where there's actual news.
[01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:42.580]   But isn't Facebook kind of the same thing now?
[01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:44.660]   It's just this conformational bias."
[01:56:44.660 --> 01:56:47.460]   So Facebook is with your friends.
[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:51.300]   I would say though, the problem is...
[01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:55.700]   So Rachel Maddow, yes, she has a very definite political bent.
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:57:01.100]   But earlier on especially, she did a lot of things trying to explain how stuff worked
[01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:02.420]   to people.
[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:06.500]   And I think people just don't want to...
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:10.420]   You don't want to sit and watch that on the television when you're tired for more kind
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:12.740]   of days work because it's hard to think.
[01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:15.140]   I beg to differ.
[01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:16.380]   And I'm trying to break this.
[01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:18.540]   I got addicted.
[01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:25.380]   And I had these channels on 24/7 all the time for the last three or four weeks.
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:31.260]   And I realized I was getting a drip, an intravenous drip.
[01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:33.300]   And I just have to cut it off.
[01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:34.300]   Not because I don't want...
[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:35.460]   I'm not engaged and I don't want engaged.
[01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:36.980]   I do want to engage.
[01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:38.500]   But I don't think it's helpful.
[01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:39.500]   Yeah.
[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:43.340]   I went off Twitter this weekend and I felt much better on Sunday evening.
[01:57:43.340 --> 01:57:44.340]   Welcome to the club.
[01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:45.340]   Just because...
[01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:46.340]   Yeah.
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:47.340]   Well, so I have though...
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:51.900]   I watched Twitter non-stop during the Super Bowl.
[01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:52.900]   That was fun.
[01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:53.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:54.900]   See?
[01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:58.740]   It was fun frustrating because I wanted the other guys to win.
[01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:01.060]   Oh, sorry, Jeff.
[01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:02.060]   It's okay.
[01:58:02.060 --> 01:58:04.100]   So this happened to me.
[01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:05.180]   So I put up a tweet.
[01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:08.140]   I was having fun, I thought.
[01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:13.860]   And I learned that Pat's fans and Trump's fans have a high Venda diagram overlap.
[01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:16.860]   It's because Tom Brady.
[01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:17.860]   Exactly.
[01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:22.740]   So I put up a post that said, you know, trying to be humorous doesn't work terribly well
[01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:23.740]   in those circumstances.
[01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:30.300]   I put up a post on Twitter that said, "Tonight, all right-thinking, decent, civilized, intelligent,
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:35.940]   democratic Americans are from Atlanta."
[01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:39.780]   And then I put up a post at the loss and I said, "God hates us."
[01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:41.860]   I saw God hates us.
[01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:44.500]   I didn't see the previous one.
[01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:46.780]   And I was very puzzled.
[01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:52.740]   Somebody put that together in a GIF for the purposes of having lots of frog people come
[01:58:52.740 --> 01:58:53.740]   after me.
[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:54.740]   And it got...
[01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:58.100]   Did that GIF got retweeted by America's best-known Nazi?
[01:58:58.100 --> 01:58:59.580]   Oh, you're kidding.
[01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:00.580]   Answer, retweeted.
[01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:01.580]   Richard?
[01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:02.580]   Yeah.
[01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:05.180]   So what it meant was, I was probably going to start it again.
[01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:09.540]   I hope that there's no Venn diagram overlap with the Twig fans, please.
[01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:11.140]   Please don't tweet this, folks.
[01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:16.180]   But what happened was my Twitter feed was useless for 36 hours, useless, because it
[01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:20.380]   was nothing but the rule of tears and all this stuff.
[01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:22.140]   You don't want to stimulate that conversation.
[01:59:22.140 --> 01:59:25.300]   Yeah, when that happens, you just got to log off and grab your little AFib card.
[01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:26.300]   Yeah.
[01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:31.820]   He's a new gesture in town.
[01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:34.420]   So I went off Twitter as a result.
[01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:36.220]   I was forced off Twitter for 36 hours.
[01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:37.980]   And yeah, the way it stays, you're right.
[01:59:37.980 --> 01:59:38.980]   I kind of felt better.
[01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:39.980]   Why did I go back?
[01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:41.780]   I feel better when I leave social media.
[01:59:41.780 --> 01:59:45.620]   And I'm going to at lump social media and cable this.
[01:59:45.620 --> 01:59:48.260]   And I'm going to put them together and turn them off.
[01:59:48.260 --> 01:59:52.260]   And like it's a weird thing, Twitter now says they're going to try to do some things
[01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:53.900]   to make this better.
[01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:56.460]   I think it's it's I saw that announcement.
[01:59:56.460 --> 01:59:57.460]   Quick sod.
[01:59:57.460 --> 02:00:00.180]   It comes back to hiding from you.
[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:01.180]   The bad.
[02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:02.780]   Sorry, the I'm sorry.
[02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:06.820]   The crap, the crap that's going on around you.
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:08.860]   Yeah, that doesn't work.
[02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:10.340]   No, somebody.
[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:12.420]   So I took somebody did something awful.
[02:00:12.420 --> 02:00:13.980]   I won't say what it is.
[02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:15.260]   And so I said it.
[02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:17.140]   I thought, well, what the hell I said it to Twitter.
[02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:19.820]   And they responded quickly saying screw you, Jeff.
[02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:20.820]   Really?
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:21.820]   What do you have to do?
[02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:22.820]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:23.820]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:26.900]   And then I'm going to do the violate Twitter's rules.
[02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:27.900]   Huh.
[02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:35.300]   Well, I guess I should read the rules because lately Twitter has does seem to be both more
[02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:36.860]   helpful and less helpful.
[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:37.860]   Yeah.
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:40.660]   I think it depends who you get.
[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:42.180]   How many people do you think they have?
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:46.980]   I mean, there must be thousands working in the abuse department now.
[02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:51.060]   Facebook says we can't monitor all posts for racist language.
[02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:52.060]   We don't have the means.
[02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:58.580]   This is in a German court case.
[02:00:58.580 --> 02:00:59.900]   Is this even credible?
[02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:03.460]   I mean, can't don't they see every post?
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:05.660]   How hard would it be to write a filter?
[02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:09.660]   Well, you don't know what's racist and it changes all the time.
[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:13.700]   I mean, there are certain things that yes, you could screen for.
[02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:18.260]   But you know, if you screen for the word Nazi, that might preclude a historical documentation.
[02:01:18.260 --> 02:01:19.260]   Right.
[02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:21.020]   Well, or somebody saying, you know, yes.
[02:01:21.020 --> 02:01:22.020]   That's exactly.
[02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:26.380]   You know what I did, by the way, instead of watching cable news a couple of nights ago,
[02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:31.380]   I watched Downfall again, which is that great German language story of Hittler.
[02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:32.860]   You watched it with the actual dialogue?
[02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:35.260]   With the actual dialogue instead of the meme dialogue.
[02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:37.060]   But you know, there's a wonderful moment.
[02:01:37.060 --> 02:01:41.740]   And I wish I had a way of clipping this and posting on Twitter when gubbles, gerbils,
[02:01:41.740 --> 02:01:47.900]   Hitler's propaganda minister is confronted by a general who says, you've got to stop
[02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:48.900]   the Volkssturmer.
[02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:54.540]   These are the citizenry that Hitler mobilized in the last days of Berlin to defend Berlin,
[02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:58.380]   children, women, old people, people who weren't in the army.
[02:01:58.380 --> 02:02:00.500]   And the general comes, you got to stop these guys.
[02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:01.740]   They're just getting, they have no training.
[02:02:01.740 --> 02:02:04.780]   No weapons are being slaughtered in the streets.
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:10.540]   And this is what I want to clip is gerbils saying, well, I have no pity for the people.
[02:02:10.540 --> 02:02:12.220]   We have a mandate.
[02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:16.780]   They knew what they were voting for when they voted us in.
[02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:19.100]   And I thought, that's kind of a nice quote.
[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:24.620]   I'm listening to focal Ulrich's biography of Hittler right now.
[02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:26.060]   Oh, good stuff.
[02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:28.100]   There are some interesting historical.
[02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:29.100]   Yeah, there are.
[02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:34.660]   And what it shows you that resistance matters, that when you give up on the resistance, it's
[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:35.660]   an issue.
[02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:37.140]   But it also shows, it was fascinating.
[02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:38.140]   I didn't quite realize this.
[02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:43.580]   I mean, the language after Weimar was quite clear.
[02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:44.580]   Democracy is bad.
[02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:45.580]   We're going to get rid of democracy.
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:46.580]   The world wants a dictator.
[02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:47.580]   That's what they said.
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:51.860]   Get rid of the press as well, the Munich Post, the other newspapers.
[02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:52.860]   The newspapers.
[02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:54.660]   We're reporting on all of this.
[02:02:54.660 --> 02:02:57.580]   And they said, you know, and the very first thing Hittler does after the B.O.R.
[02:02:57.580 --> 02:02:59.220]   Pooch and goes to jail.
[02:02:59.220 --> 02:03:01.700]   But the very first thing they should do is shut down the Munich newspaper.
[02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:05.060]   Have you seen the alt-POTUS 45 Twitter handle?
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:06.060]   Yes.
[02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:07.060]   It's brilliant.
[02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:09.380]   The other ones are the ones today right now.
[02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:10.380]   Just go ahead.
[02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:14.420]   Day 18, have a no dick wads allowed rule of the DOJ.
[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:19.620]   The old McConnell that he's a low-life POS said, "Build Nordstrom's for sensible heels."
[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:21.860]   And I've been trying not to read Twitter, Jeff.
[02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:22.860]   Do you mind?
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:28.340]   So here's what I'm going to recommend you to do.
[02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:29.980]   This will make you maybe feel better.
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:33.700]   Plus, it's a darn good movie.
[02:03:33.700 --> 02:03:37.300]   I found the eyes on the prize, the PBS doesn't matter.
[02:03:37.300 --> 02:03:38.780]   Isn't that a great movie?
[02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:39.780]   For a long time.
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:40.780]   For a long time.
[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:49.220]   You couldn't watch it because the Martin Luther King states said, "Well, you can't broadcast
[02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:51.980]   that without paying us because I have a dream speech."
[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:55.180]   I guess they've backed down on that because eyes on the prize is back and it is well worth
[02:03:55.180 --> 02:03:56.180]   watching.
[02:03:56.180 --> 02:04:00.220]   And while you're watching that, watch 13th on Netflix, which is the history of the 13th
[02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:06.780]   Amendment, which I was trying to remember earlier, and it is a damning, a damning but
[02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:10.540]   brilliant documentary on racism and the history of racism in America.
[02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:12.340]   You know what else I watched?
[02:04:12.340 --> 02:04:14.860]   A couple of Steve Bannon documentaries.
[02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:16.860]   That was fun.
[02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:17.940]   Oh, you watched them.
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:21.300]   I was very curious.
[02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:22.460]   This isn't really for this show.
[02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:24.940]   So after the show, I'll tell you what I learned.
[02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:29.900]   You want to hear, I got an update on the Lifeline data that I did some reporting for you here.
[02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:30.900]   Yes.
[02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:31.900]   Would you like to know the details?
[02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:32.900]   Please.
[02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:38.140]   So according to Mark Wigfield, a FCC spokesman, there are over 900 Lifeline providers and
[02:04:38.140 --> 02:04:41.060]   they're all allowed to offer broadband.
[02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:44.460]   We don't have a number of how many do at this point.
[02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:46.660]   The program is at a transitional stage right now.
[02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:51.220]   Eventually, all Lifeline providers will have to offer broadband in order to get the support.
[02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:52.220]   Okay.
[02:04:52.220 --> 02:04:59.340]   So then I think a JITPAI statement is accurate that that is to say that the nine they were
[02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:03.900]   shut down, shuts down the broadband Lifeline project is not accurate.
[02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:07.580]   So I want to retract that and correct myself.
[02:05:07.580 --> 02:05:08.580]   So there you go.
[02:05:08.580 --> 02:05:12.620]   And if you do you want the further information from them on the details here?
[02:05:12.620 --> 02:05:16.860]   A distinguishing feature of the nine going back for further review, which is what happened,
[02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:21.780]   is they were cleared by the FCC to be nationwide Lifeline broadband providers.
[02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:24.340]   So they didn't get designated state by state.
[02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:30.100]   And the tribal lands people, they said, we want to have the states have challenged that
[02:05:30.100 --> 02:05:35.620]   portion of the order saying the states, not the FCC can approve providers.
[02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:36.940]   So now you know.
[02:05:36.940 --> 02:05:37.940]   Thank you.
[02:05:37.940 --> 02:05:40.660]   I appreciate your work.
[02:05:40.660 --> 02:05:41.660]   My email.
[02:05:41.660 --> 02:05:43.660]   My 22nd email to the spokesman at the FCC.
[02:05:43.660 --> 02:05:44.660]   Thank you.
[02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:45.660]   Oh, really?
[02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:46.660]   That's how you got that?
[02:05:46.660 --> 02:05:49.420]   Oh, reporting, actual reporting.
[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:50.580]   So impressive.
[02:05:50.580 --> 02:05:51.580]   We're not worthy.
[02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:52.580]   No, we're not.
[02:05:52.580 --> 02:05:53.580]   We're not worthy.
[02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:55.740]   I'm not a good pundit.
[02:05:55.740 --> 02:05:57.900]   I could only report.
[02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:00.500]   That's something we've needed on this network for a hell of a long time.
[02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:01.500]   Oh, yeah.
[02:06:01.500 --> 02:06:02.500]   Yeah.
[02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:03.500]   So.
[02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:04.500]   Thank you.
[02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:05.500]   Facts.
[02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:06.500]   Facts.
[02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:07.500]   That's my weakness.
[02:06:07.500 --> 02:06:10.300]   No, and I admire that greatly.
[02:06:10.300 --> 02:06:11.500]   I really do.
[02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:17.500]   Twitter's head of diversity is leaving, but that's another matter.
[02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:18.500]   Who's it?
[02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:21.220]   I think the chef in the kitchen is leaving you.
[02:06:21.220 --> 02:06:23.420]   I think I was left.
[02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:30.580]   The chief HR officer has already left this according to TechCrunch.
[02:06:30.580 --> 02:06:32.300]   The VP of diversity inclusion.
[02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:40.220]   I think it's great that they had a VP of diversity inclusion, but he's left for personal reasons.
[02:06:40.220 --> 02:06:41.220]   She's left.
[02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:42.220]   Oh, no.
[02:06:42.220 --> 02:06:46.100]   Renee Atwood, the human resources officer, has left for personal reasons.
[02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:49.940]   We don't know why Jeffrey Simmons off the diversity guy.
[02:06:49.940 --> 02:06:56.300]   He came from Apple, where he was director of worldwide inclusion and diversity.
[02:06:56.300 --> 02:06:57.300]   Twitter.
[02:06:57.300 --> 02:06:58.300]   Twitter.
[02:06:58.300 --> 02:07:04.380]   Twitter stocks up today.
[02:07:04.380 --> 02:07:07.580]   You know, I've been noticing it going up even when the stock market's been going down.
[02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:08.580]   It's been ratcheting up.
[02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:09.580]   I don't hear any more say.
[02:07:09.580 --> 02:07:11.500]   It has to be a sales thing.
[02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:17.380]   It has to be the market knows about some sort of, or maybe Jim Kramer pushed a button.
[02:07:17.380 --> 02:07:18.380]   Yeah.
[02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:20.020]   Bye Twitter.
[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:24.200]   But it's been going up pretty steadily over the last week.
[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:25.200]   Not sure why.
[02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:26.900]   Did you see Amazon has hired this?
[02:07:26.900 --> 02:07:28.700]   It was one of your numbers.
[02:07:28.700 --> 02:07:30.780]   110,000 people last year.
[02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:31.780]   I know.
[02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:32.780]   It's amazing.
[02:07:32.780 --> 02:07:33.780]   Most of them.
[02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:34.780]   110,000.
[02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:38.260]   They hired 110,000 people.
[02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:40.420]   A third of their workforce in one year.
[02:07:40.420 --> 02:07:43.300]   What I wonder is how many of those are warehouse.
[02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:45.100]   They've got almost all be.
[02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:46.100]   Delivery.
[02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:47.100]   Yeah.
[02:07:47.100 --> 02:07:51.860]   You know, I'd love to know what the kind of employment percentages are of Amazon in
[02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:55.700]   terms of engineering science, marketing versus warehouse.
[02:07:55.700 --> 02:07:58.300]   They ain't working at the new Amazon Ghost store.
[02:07:58.300 --> 02:08:03.540]   Apparently the Ghost store should be called a Ghost store because you only need as few
[02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:07.740]   as three employees and a max of 10.
[02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:11.300]   This is the store where you just go in, pick up what you want and walk out.
[02:08:11.300 --> 02:08:15.740]   Though, did you see Bezos mocked a report that he was going into the grocery business
[02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:19.660]   big time saying on Bezos's Twitter feed, he mocked it.
[02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:20.660]   Yeah, there it is.
[02:08:20.660 --> 02:08:22.900]   Why would he want to do robot run supermarkets?
[02:08:22.900 --> 02:08:26.060]   Well, because you did want Jeff.
[02:08:26.060 --> 02:08:27.700]   Well, now he knows.
[02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:28.700]   Come on.
[02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:34.020]   Are all of those employees, were they all full time or were some contract?
[02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:35.020]   Oh, probably.
[02:08:35.020 --> 02:08:36.020]   Who knows?
[02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:37.020]   I don't know.
[02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:38.020]   Oh, I'm sure a lot were contract.
[02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:39.500]   Let's see.
[02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:42.460]   You asked the tough questions.
[02:08:42.460 --> 02:08:45.860]   Any given location, a max of 10 human employees.
[02:08:45.860 --> 02:08:47.340]   Wait a minute.
[02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:48.740]   This is the New York Post.
[02:08:48.740 --> 02:08:51.260]   I'm not sure I'd trust this.
[02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:56.180]   They plan to use six people per shift on average with Amazon relying on robotic automation
[02:08:56.180 --> 02:08:58.540]   and software to most of the heavy lifting.
[02:08:58.540 --> 02:09:07.860]   But that kind of makes sense because that's the whole point of it, right?
[02:09:07.860 --> 02:09:11.340]   What else do we have?
[02:09:11.340 --> 02:09:17.340]   How Google fought back against a crippling IoT powered botnet and won Stacy Stacy tell us
[02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:18.680]   are we safe?
[02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:20.980]   This is actually the cribs on security story.
[02:09:20.980 --> 02:09:21.980]   Yes.
[02:09:21.980 --> 02:09:25.500]   I feel so bad for Brian Krebs, who was a great security reporter for years at the Washington
[02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:28.580]   Post that he went out on his own, does a great blog.
[02:09:28.580 --> 02:09:36.260]   He was doing excellent reporting on the various, which one was it?
[02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:41.380]   It was on, I can't remember.
[02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:47.980]   He kind of blew the lid off of one of the hacking groups.
[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:59.300]   His result, his site was taken down by a massive sin flood, 130 million packets a second.
[02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:06.300]   Then up to an even stronger attack using the Marai open source botnet, that was the one
[02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:11.380]   that brought down the DNS servers.
[02:10:11.380 --> 02:10:17.540]   This is a botnet that takes advantage of hacked routers and Internet of Things cameras,
[02:10:17.540 --> 02:10:23.620]   Internet enabled cameras at one point, 140 gigabit per second attack.
[02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:26.820]   Holy cow.
[02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:32.740]   Google jumped in and they have a service called Project Shield.
[02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:33.740]   Is this Project Shield?
[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:34.740]   Yeah.
[02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:41.540]   Designed to protect news, journalists and human rights, organizers from digital attacks.
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:47.140]   It's basically DDoS protection, but it's free to those people, which is awesome.
[02:10:47.140 --> 02:10:53.060]   It was, Krebs was able to use it to mitigate the DDoS attacks because Google has more bandwidth
[02:10:53.060 --> 02:10:54.660]   than the bad guys.
[02:10:54.660 --> 02:10:55.660]   Right.
[02:10:55.660 --> 02:10:58.620]   Well, he was on Akamai.
[02:10:58.620 --> 02:11:00.180]   He was on Akamai and they brought it down.
[02:11:00.180 --> 02:11:04.540]   Akamai pushed him off saying, "You can't, you're killing our network."
[02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:10.100]   To be fair, Krebs, Akamai was hosting him for free.
[02:11:10.100 --> 02:11:13.460]   I mean, this was actually economically not viable for Akamai.
[02:11:13.460 --> 02:11:16.100]   So the way you survive a DDoS attack.
[02:11:16.100 --> 02:11:24.980]   The reason these work is because you can forge your origination.
[02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:30.380]   So if I sit here, initially it worked because it could forge my origination.
[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:34.580]   If I'm sitting here firing a million packets a minute at you, I have them all with random
[02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:35.580]   IP addresses.
[02:11:35.580 --> 02:11:37.860]   That was the raw sockets technique.
[02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:42.980]   More recently, because of these massive botnets, people don't even care.
[02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:48.060]   They don't bother because you take down one, you still have 100 million other Linksys
[02:11:48.060 --> 02:11:50.140]   router Zane debt you.
[02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:54.940]   And so the only way to mitigate in both cases is just to put a big pipe there because the
[02:11:54.940 --> 02:11:57.860]   way they work is they jam the pipe.
[02:11:57.860 --> 02:12:01.980]   So Google's saying that they have a terabit of spare capacity.
[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:02.980]   Right.
[02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:03.980]   Just in case.
[02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:09.340]   You just have to have, you're being flooded, you just have a bigger pipe than the flood.
[02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:11.740]   There's no other way to do it.
[02:12:11.740 --> 02:12:13.140]   It's you can't ignore it.
[02:12:13.140 --> 02:12:18.660]   So I mean, my information is a little out of date, but a sin flood, you know, the way
[02:12:18.660 --> 02:12:24.500]   the web works is when my open my browser and say go to yahoo.com, I send them a synchronized
[02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:28.820]   packet, which is basically a knock on the door saying I'd like to have a conversation.
[02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:30.900]   Yahoo sends an act back.
[02:12:30.900 --> 02:12:34.460]   And then we have a back and forth conversation, which mostly includes me downloading content
[02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:35.940]   from Yahoo servers.
[02:12:35.940 --> 02:12:39.940]   The way these DDoS attacks work, one way these DDoS attacks work is with a sin flood where
[02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:43.020]   they knock, but they don't care if you respond.
[02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:45.500]   And no website can afford to not respond.
[02:12:45.500 --> 02:12:47.020]   That's how people get on the website.
[02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:50.940]   So every single one of these knocks, you have to, you know, send packets you have to respond
[02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:51.940]   to.
[02:12:51.940 --> 02:12:54.700]   So the website very quickly can be overloaded.
[02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:59.020]   No website is designed to handle a million requests a second.
[02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:05.540]   But if you're behind a giant shield, we use, we use a similar service, I won't say from
[02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:06.540]   home.
[02:13:06.540 --> 02:13:10.980]   But if you're behind somebody with a lot of pipe, you can handle it.
[02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:13.100]   All those sin packets come into you.
[02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:16.940]   What happens is the DDoS protection holds them.
[02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:21.700]   It sees them, holds them, and then dribbles them out so you can respond to them so it can
[02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:23.260]   hold back the wall.
[02:13:23.260 --> 02:13:28.540]   And what that generally means is that response from the site is slower, but it's not dead.
[02:13:28.540 --> 02:13:32.260]   So, and now you're talking about last little.
[02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:33.260]   And you have last.
[02:13:33.260 --> 02:13:34.260]   Oh, go ahead.
[02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:38.220]   So, someone in the chat room said that Akamai was not hosting Brian Krebs.
[02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:39.340]   They were offering for free.
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:41.460]   They were offering DDoS protection for free.
[02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:43.340]   So that is, that is a point.
[02:13:43.340 --> 02:13:47.340]   And one of the things that's gotten worse is besides these botnets, which is a big one.
[02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:49.940]   Using IoT devices that are not well secured.
[02:13:49.940 --> 02:13:53.500]   Okay, let's stop calling them IoT devices.
[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:57.100]   I'm serious because cameras and routers in the case of Mirai, but it's anything that's
[02:13:57.100 --> 02:13:58.500]   on the net could be used.
[02:13:58.500 --> 02:14:03.340]   Well, so, but yes, but 90% of what we think of when we think of IoT devices are things
[02:14:03.340 --> 02:14:06.700]   that are actually very small and not likely to be useful in these attacks because they
[02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:10.980]   don't have the capacity or the compute power.
[02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:15.580]   So your thermostat is going to be a really crappy element for a botnet attack because
[02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:18.140]   it doesn't have any bandwidth.
[02:14:18.140 --> 02:14:19.980]   It's limited.
[02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:24.140]   So I think that's an important thing to say to people because...
[02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:27.180]   I'm not convinced of that.
[02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:30.100]   Because remember, they make it up in volume.
[02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:35.500]   So if your thermostat could send one packet out every minute, it's okay if I've got five
[02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:36.500]   million of them.
[02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:40.780]   My thermostat is sending its one packet out every minute to nest.
[02:14:40.780 --> 02:14:42.100]   So nest filters it there.
[02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:43.540]   Because it's well designed.
[02:14:43.540 --> 02:14:45.180]   Well, okay, yes.
[02:14:45.180 --> 02:14:51.700]   But also something like my light switch doesn't have the compute power inside to run a bot.
[02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:58.100]   So the way Mirai works is it infects the router, which does have RAM and processor and so forth.
[02:14:58.100 --> 02:15:03.940]   It sits in RAM and basically takes the router over and says, "You've got a new job now."
[02:15:03.940 --> 02:15:10.340]   And obviously that would be a lot harder to do with a thermostat or a light or a switch.
[02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:13.340]   I hesitate to say it couldn't be done.
[02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:19.580]   I'm not saying it couldn't be done, but it's not economically efficient from a capacity
[02:15:19.580 --> 02:15:21.940]   or effort standpoint.
[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:27.540]   Well, not while there's things like routers and cameras lying around.
[02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:35.140]   Those things have been out forever like a decade or longer.
[02:15:35.140 --> 02:15:41.700]   So okay, that was my everyone's like- I know because you like the Internet of Things.
[02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:43.020]   It's not just that I like it.
[02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:47.140]   It's that there are legitimate security woes about these devices.
[02:15:47.140 --> 02:15:49.060]   And we're not talking about those.
[02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:54.540]   We're talking about something that is far removed from what the problem is today.
[02:15:54.540 --> 02:16:02.100]   But it does argue for all devices that are on the Internet to have an updateable firmware,
[02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:08.060]   passwords that are not hardwired in to things hard-coded in, things like that.
[02:16:08.060 --> 02:16:10.380]   And these routers were like that.
[02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:12.500]   And as a result, they were a commandeer.
[02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:13.500]   And there's also another issue.
[02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:17.940]   I mean, some of these attacks are using an amplification.
[02:16:17.940 --> 02:16:20.860]   And those are really scary because somebody doesn't have to have a lot of bandwidth.
[02:16:20.860 --> 02:16:23.100]   Your nest does not have to have a lot of bandwidth.
[02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:27.820]   It merely needs to send a ping to an appropriate server.
[02:16:27.820 --> 02:16:31.660]   Often it's a, I mean, of late, it's been an NTP servers, the time servers, but there are
[02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:35.900]   presumably other servers out there and create a flood.
[02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:42.020]   So what you do is you ping these time server with a forged IP address, Brian Krebs IP address.
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:45.980]   And you say, send me everything you know.
[02:16:45.980 --> 02:16:50.660]   And then the time server floods Brian's IP address with crap.
[02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:55.220]   So that's another kind of an amplification attack that is also very widespread.
[02:16:55.220 --> 02:17:00.420]   And that argues for Internet software like the NNTP server software to be kept up to
[02:17:00.420 --> 02:17:01.420]   date.
[02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:09.620]   That's that story of NNTP is it's one guy who's maintaining that and not paid by anybody.
[02:17:09.620 --> 02:17:15.060]   And it's, you know, it's, he can only do so much to fix this stuff.
[02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:18.740]   I'm sure he's fixed that bug because that was a well-known amplification attack.
[02:17:18.740 --> 02:17:20.740]   All right, we should wrap this up.
[02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:24.940]   Any, I'll tell you what, I'll give each of you a choice of one or two stories.
[02:17:24.940 --> 02:17:27.580]   You'd like to make sure we get in.
[02:17:27.580 --> 02:17:28.980]   You first, Daisy.
[02:17:28.980 --> 02:17:31.620]   Oh, anything I missed.
[02:17:31.620 --> 02:17:32.620]   Okay.
[02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:34.780]   This is I, I have Tizio.
[02:17:34.780 --> 02:17:37.740]   Oh, I could talk about this.
[02:17:37.740 --> 02:17:38.740]   I'll bring that one up.
[02:17:38.740 --> 02:17:40.740]   You got to, I'll bring that one up.
[02:17:40.740 --> 02:17:41.740]   Okay.
[02:17:41.740 --> 02:17:45.780]   One is, and I'm only reading this up because you mentioned this device.
[02:17:45.780 --> 02:17:49.300]   So I thought it was worth adding to this plus as a cool feature.
[02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:52.380]   The Logitech is at the zero touch.
[02:17:52.380 --> 02:17:53.980]   Yes, I have it.
[02:17:53.980 --> 02:17:55.180]   Dashboard mounting system.
[02:17:55.180 --> 02:17:58.660]   So now it is connected to the Amazon Echo.
[02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:02.580]   And yes, when you wave your hand in front of it, if it's set up and you've enabled the
[02:18:02.580 --> 02:18:06.620]   skill, you can actually ask the echo anything you want in your car.
[02:18:06.620 --> 02:18:09.940]   So no, we're going to get it back out.
[02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:10.940]   Yes.
[02:18:10.940 --> 02:18:12.460]   Go play with it.
[02:18:12.460 --> 02:18:15.020]   So it puts, it puts an echo in my car.
[02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:16.020]   Yes.
[02:18:16.020 --> 02:18:17.700]   So this little thing is a magnet.
[02:18:17.700 --> 02:18:20.860]   You put a little plate on the back of your phone, Android or iOS.
[02:18:20.860 --> 02:18:23.060]   Play Discover weekly playlist on Spotify.
[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:24.500]   You can wave your hand out.
[02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:27.500]   And there's always been a few things you could do, but now you could do anything that the
[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:29.020]   echo does.
[02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:30.020]   I believe so, yes.
[02:18:30.020 --> 02:18:31.020]   Nice.
[02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:33.020]   Because I have, I bought Amazon unlimited music.
[02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:38.380]   Oh, well then you, my friend, the whole like joyous thing ahead of you.
[02:18:38.380 --> 02:18:39.380]   Nice.
[02:18:39.380 --> 02:18:40.380]   It works pretty well.
[02:18:40.380 --> 02:18:44.980]   I, I don't keep it in there because both my cars have their own, you know, voice.
[02:18:44.980 --> 02:18:45.980]   Stuff.
[02:18:45.980 --> 02:18:47.620]   But nothing is good as that.
[02:18:47.620 --> 02:18:52.020]   I mean, like the Tesla is, yeah, the Tesla, I'm constantly like, oh, if only I could ask
[02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:54.060]   she who shall not be made.
[02:18:54.060 --> 02:18:55.820]   Well I do, I do like Tesla.
[02:18:55.820 --> 02:19:00.020]   You can, you can say, because it has slacker, you can say, I did that on the way in, play
[02:19:00.020 --> 02:19:01.980]   medieval music.
[02:19:01.980 --> 02:19:04.420]   And it'll, it has, it has radio stations.
[02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:05.420]   So you can say that.
[02:19:05.420 --> 02:19:06.420]   What?
[02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:07.420]   Yes.
[02:19:07.420 --> 02:19:08.420]   I like the music.
[02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:10.780]   I'm, I'm just like, that was not what I was expected.
[02:19:10.780 --> 02:19:14.940]   And it's also very different than mine's like, play Justin Bieber's crazy.
[02:19:14.940 --> 02:19:15.940]   I just hit it.
[02:19:15.940 --> 02:19:18.620]   Actually, you would like the medieval music I got because it played a nice, you know,
[02:19:18.620 --> 02:19:19.620]   medieval concert.
[02:19:19.620 --> 02:19:22.380]   And then it played Drake.
[02:19:22.380 --> 02:19:23.380]   Yes.
[02:19:23.380 --> 02:19:24.860]   So you might like it.
[02:19:24.860 --> 02:19:25.860]   I might.
[02:19:25.860 --> 02:19:26.860]   You're right.
[02:19:26.860 --> 02:19:30.620]   I think it's because that song Drake said, I'm going to go all medieval on your ass.
[02:19:30.620 --> 02:19:32.900]   Okay, Google.
[02:19:32.900 --> 02:19:36.740]   Play medieval music.
[02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:41.940]   By the way, music station called folk metal folk metal.
[02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:45.980]   What is even, what even is folk metal?
[02:19:45.980 --> 02:19:47.780]   Oh, well, that's awful.
[02:19:47.780 --> 02:19:52.220]   I gave my love a gerund that had no stone.
[02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:56.060]   Okay, Google.
[02:19:56.060 --> 02:19:57.060]   Next.
[02:19:57.060 --> 02:19:59.700]   No, no more folk metal.
[02:19:59.700 --> 02:20:01.500]   All right.
[02:20:01.500 --> 02:20:10.940]   Oh, that's like, that's like, that's like, that's like drop, get the drop.
[02:20:10.940 --> 02:20:16.740]   That's Patrick Norton's favorite music.
[02:20:16.740 --> 02:20:18.940]   Stop it.
[02:20:18.940 --> 02:20:20.940]   Stop it.
[02:20:20.940 --> 02:20:23.940]   Okay, Jarvis, stop.
[02:20:23.940 --> 02:20:24.940]   All right.
[02:20:24.940 --> 02:20:34.460]   Your other is an echo skill because I, I whined about this.
[02:20:34.460 --> 02:20:37.020]   And then so I went, I had to go find something for me.
[02:20:37.020 --> 02:20:41.100]   This is called Sergeant Tabata, T-A-B-A-T-A.
[02:20:41.100 --> 02:20:45.460]   And last week, I think it was that I was talking about high intensity interval training and
[02:20:45.460 --> 02:20:46.460]   I needed a timer.
[02:20:46.460 --> 02:20:48.260]   Well, holy cow, this does it.
[02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:51.540]   This is a, it does a, you can do custom intervals.
[02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:53.260]   It's an interval timer.
[02:20:53.260 --> 02:21:00.020]   So I'm like, hey, she should not be named, you know, start Sergeant Tabata.
[02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:04.620]   And then it's like, do you want to custom or do you want it every, you know, 20 seconds
[02:21:04.620 --> 02:21:06.020]   on, 10 seconds of rest.
[02:21:06.020 --> 02:21:07.020]   There you go.
[02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:08.020]   Does he go?
[02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:09.020]   Higgin' about them.
[02:21:09.020 --> 02:21:11.020]   Drop and give me 20.
[02:21:11.020 --> 02:21:15.700]   So this is all of the echoes, fitness things, including the seven minute workout.
[02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:20.220]   Drive me nuts because it's always the same voice and it's so chill.
[02:21:20.220 --> 02:21:23.260]   And sometimes when you're exercising, especially if you're going to be trying to go all out
[02:21:23.260 --> 02:21:28.820]   for 20 seconds, you're kind of like, yeah, you need to be driven.
[02:21:28.820 --> 02:21:30.460]   I need a little more oomph.
[02:21:30.460 --> 02:21:31.460]   Yeah.
[02:21:31.460 --> 02:21:35.340]   My, my trainer is a former Marine.
[02:21:35.340 --> 02:21:36.340]   You would like him.
[02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:37.340]   There I would.
[02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:40.060]   I, I like anybody who's like, shoo.
[02:21:40.060 --> 02:21:41.060]   Oh man.
[02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:43.580]   All right, Jeff, your story.
[02:21:43.580 --> 02:21:46.380]   So I just put this up there.
[02:21:46.380 --> 02:21:47.380]   It's kind of cool.
[02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:55.540]   So, uh, Loufton's a held a, in honor of New York Fashion Week held a fashion show flight.
[02:21:55.540 --> 02:22:00.940]   So on the flight, you had the, the, the, it was a runway.
[02:22:00.940 --> 02:22:04.740]   And see, this is one thing.
[02:22:04.740 --> 02:22:06.940]   I actually don't like about modern flying.
[02:22:06.940 --> 02:22:09.820]   I, they, they, they, I hate it.
[02:22:09.820 --> 02:22:14.060]   They do the announcement saying, and we have a lovely catalog full of wonderful things.
[02:22:14.060 --> 02:22:17.900]   And they go down the aisle on some airlines and try to sell you crap.
[02:22:17.900 --> 02:22:20.020]   This is just one more way to do that.
[02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:21.580]   Now you have models walking by you.
[02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:22.580]   What's the wrong with that?
[02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:23.580]   I don't like that.
[02:22:23.580 --> 02:22:25.380]   And I just want to keep my head down.
[02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:26.380]   I'm sorry.
[02:22:26.380 --> 02:22:28.980]   Jeff, are there any hot male models?
[02:22:28.980 --> 02:22:31.780]   Because if there are no, maybe I don't know, there might be, I don't know.
[02:22:31.780 --> 02:22:33.700]   I forget who's, there was whose line it was.
[02:22:33.700 --> 02:22:34.700]   They had a line.
[02:22:34.700 --> 02:22:35.700]   All right.
[02:22:35.700 --> 02:22:36.700]   Well, nevermind.
[02:22:36.700 --> 02:22:37.700]   So much of my friends.
[02:22:37.700 --> 02:22:38.700]   Isn't it?
[02:22:38.700 --> 02:22:44.460]   Didn't lift on just do a big collaboration for new uniforms or was that somebody else?
[02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:45.460]   With like a high fashion designer.
[02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:46.460]   Well done.
[02:22:46.460 --> 02:22:48.940]   They might have, they might have, I forget.
[02:22:48.940 --> 02:22:49.940]   Ivy Revel.
[02:22:49.940 --> 02:22:52.700]   All right.
[02:22:52.700 --> 02:22:54.420]   Jeff Jarvis, give us a number.
[02:22:54.420 --> 02:22:57.700]   A number of thousand three.
[02:22:57.700 --> 02:23:02.780]   So last weekend meetup held a three day hackathon, but there was a meetup with on where they
[02:23:02.780 --> 02:23:07.020]   decided to enable a thousand resistance meetups.
[02:23:07.020 --> 02:23:10.700]   Sorry, it's political, but that's where it is.
[02:23:10.700 --> 02:23:14.900]   And in combination with the likes of ADL Amnesty International Planned Parenthood Human Rights
[02:23:14.900 --> 02:23:18.020]   Campaign, and they're using it to get people together.
[02:23:18.020 --> 02:23:19.020]   Nice.
[02:23:19.020 --> 02:23:20.020]   Try some kind of interesting.
[02:23:20.020 --> 02:23:23.020]   Nice.
[02:23:23.020 --> 02:23:26.180]   Stacy Higginbotham.
[02:23:26.180 --> 02:23:27.780]   You got something for us?
[02:23:27.780 --> 02:23:29.460]   Oh, those are my things.
[02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:30.460]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:23:30.460 --> 02:23:31.460]   I gave my things early.
[02:23:31.460 --> 02:23:32.460]   I saw.
[02:23:32.460 --> 02:23:33.460]   I see those are things.
[02:23:33.460 --> 02:23:35.780]   Oh, yeah, I was in thinking.
[02:23:35.780 --> 02:23:36.780]   So what were your things?
[02:23:36.780 --> 02:23:38.260]   Just remind me.
[02:23:38.260 --> 02:23:41.180]   Sergeant Tabata, the new echo scale.
[02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:45.500]   And then the update on the Logitech zero.
[02:23:45.500 --> 02:23:46.500]   Oh, good.
[02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:47.500]   Are those acceptable to you?
[02:23:47.500 --> 02:23:48.500]   There.
[02:23:48.500 --> 02:23:49.500]   Yes.
[02:23:49.500 --> 02:23:52.860]   I will give you a past young lady this time.
[02:23:52.860 --> 02:23:56.620]   Okay, because I have a pen that erases.
[02:23:56.620 --> 02:23:58.540]   No, no, no, no.
[02:23:58.540 --> 02:24:01.420]   Mine is just for all the lovers out there.
[02:24:01.420 --> 02:24:06.780]   Six last two years ago for Christmas did a very strange, a very merry, very merry Christmas
[02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:07.780]   with Bill Murray.
[02:24:07.780 --> 02:24:08.780]   Remember that?
[02:24:08.780 --> 02:24:09.780]   Oh, yeah.
[02:24:09.780 --> 02:24:10.780]   Oh, no.
[02:24:10.780 --> 02:24:11.780]   I know what you're going to say.
[02:24:11.780 --> 02:24:13.180]   They got one now for this one.
[02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:20.140]   For Valentine's Day, it's a Michael Bolton Valentine's Day special, but it's tongue in
[02:24:20.140 --> 02:24:21.140]   cheek.
[02:24:21.140 --> 02:24:23.580]   It actually is available now on Netflix for streaming.
[02:24:23.580 --> 02:24:28.460]   It's put together by the folks who did the who are lonely island, right?
[02:24:28.460 --> 02:24:30.420]   So it's going to be funny.
[02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:34.300]   In fact, I'll, because guess who plays Kenny G?
[02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:42.980]   Let me see if I can find the trailer for Michael Bolton's.
[02:24:42.980 --> 02:24:48.260]   I'm watching it tonight with my honey and her new sport bra.
[02:24:48.260 --> 02:24:49.260]   Let's see.
[02:24:49.260 --> 02:24:50.260]   No, that's right.
[02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:51.260]   We're not doing that.
[02:24:51.260 --> 02:24:52.260]   Diamonds.
[02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:58.140]   Diamonds and her new diamond.
[02:24:58.140 --> 02:25:00.980]   You want to see the apparently there's a giant eagle involved.
[02:25:00.980 --> 02:25:02.820]   It's very tongue in cheek.
[02:25:02.820 --> 02:25:04.980]   This Valentine's Day.
[02:25:04.980 --> 02:25:08.420]   Spend the evening with the world's greatest lover.
[02:25:08.420 --> 02:25:13.420]   I'm Michael Bolton.
[02:25:13.420 --> 02:25:15.140]   I've been waiting for you.
[02:25:15.140 --> 02:25:17.020]   I believe in two things.
[02:25:17.020 --> 02:25:18.660]   One, ghosts.
[02:25:18.660 --> 02:25:22.300]   And two, that there's somebody out there for everyone.
[02:25:22.300 --> 02:25:26.660]   Can every day be Valentine's Day?
[02:25:26.660 --> 02:25:30.100]   I think this looks pretty funny.
[02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:39.500]   So if you're not making love already, you will be soon.
[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:41.940]   Fred Armisen's in it, Will Fort.
[02:25:41.940 --> 02:25:42.940]   Sarah Silverman.
[02:25:42.940 --> 02:25:48.220]   That's how I found out about Sarah tweeted this morning.
[02:25:48.220 --> 02:25:49.820]   Michael Sheen.
[02:25:49.820 --> 02:25:51.780]   Maya Rudolph.
[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:53.420]   Adam Scott.
[02:25:53.420 --> 02:25:57.100]   Chris Parnell is one of my favorite fake doctors ever.
[02:25:57.100 --> 02:25:58.700]   What is that sound?
[02:25:58.700 --> 02:25:59.700]   And he's Samberg.
[02:25:59.700 --> 02:26:01.700]   You guys can't eat you.
[02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:02.700]   Let's do this.
[02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:08.980]   Why do you care so much about this stupid holiday?
[02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:10.380]   I don't know.
[02:26:10.380 --> 02:26:12.780]   I think this is what's been missing in Valentine's Day.
[02:26:12.780 --> 02:26:13.780]   All these--
[02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:14.780]   What the--
[02:26:14.780 --> 02:26:15.780]   What is going on?
[02:26:15.780 --> 02:26:19.740]   This is a tale of Captain Jack Sparrow.
[02:26:19.740 --> 02:26:26.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:26:26.220 --> 02:26:27.220]   Anyway, you get the idea.
[02:26:27.220 --> 02:26:28.660]   This is what I'll be doing tonight.
[02:26:28.660 --> 02:26:30.700]   I hope you'll be doing something equally lovely.
[02:26:30.700 --> 02:26:33.980]   Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for joining us for this week
[02:26:33.980 --> 02:26:38.940]   in Google Stacy Higginbotham from StacyOnIOT and the IOT podcast
[02:26:38.940 --> 02:26:40.180]   at IOTpodcast.com.
[02:26:40.180 --> 02:26:41.340]   @AkiGustacy on the Twitter.
[02:26:41.340 --> 02:26:42.860]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:46.820]   Have a wonderful evening with your June oven.
[02:26:46.820 --> 02:26:48.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:49.580]   Me in the June--
[02:26:49.580 --> 02:26:50.580]   Like this.
[02:26:50.580 --> 02:26:52.580]   --feas you like this.
[02:26:52.580 --> 02:26:55.180]   That's my Valentine's Day gift for Andrew right there.
[02:26:55.180 --> 02:26:56.700]   Yeah, right there, baby.
[02:26:56.700 --> 02:26:59.420]   And thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:26:59.420 --> 02:26:59.980]   Oh, I forgot.
[02:26:59.980 --> 02:27:00.980]   I was forgot.
[02:27:00.980 --> 02:27:03.300]   I wore this T-shirt in honor.
[02:27:03.300 --> 02:27:05.940]   F8 registration is now open.
[02:27:05.940 --> 02:27:07.260]   Oh, is that an F8?
[02:27:07.260 --> 02:27:08.260]   Is that a Facebook F8?
[02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:08.980]   Did I say T-shirt?
[02:27:08.980 --> 02:27:10.060]   Yes, it must.
[02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:10.700]   I doesn't--
[02:27:10.700 --> 02:27:11.780]   They're all T-shirts too.
[02:27:11.780 --> 02:27:13.340]   They do good T-shirts.
[02:27:13.340 --> 02:27:13.820]   Yeah.
[02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:15.340]   Are you going?
[02:27:15.340 --> 02:27:15.900]   I hope so.
[02:27:15.900 --> 02:27:17.620]   Will you cover it for us?
[02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:18.620]   Sure.
[02:27:18.620 --> 02:27:20.260]   Last year, I had to sit on the floor.
[02:27:20.260 --> 02:27:21.260]   I know.
[02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:21.820]   That was awesome.
[02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:22.900]   That was a decent Wi-Fi.
[02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:24.540]   That was awesome.
[02:27:24.540 --> 02:27:26.660]   I didn't talk about the Visios, but we did it yesterday
[02:27:26.660 --> 02:27:27.500]   on security now.
[02:27:27.500 --> 02:27:29.940]   So you can listen to Steve Gibson's take on it.
[02:27:29.940 --> 02:27:31.820]   The Visio TV, apparently.
[02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:35.340]   Visio has settled with the FTC since 2014,
[02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:37.020]   big gathering information about everything
[02:27:37.020 --> 02:27:38.300]   you've been watching on TV.
[02:27:38.300 --> 02:27:39.300]   And selling it.
[02:27:39.300 --> 02:27:40.340]   And selling it.
[02:27:40.340 --> 02:27:43.940]   Although, as I pointed out to Steve Gibson,
[02:27:43.940 --> 02:27:47.260]   I remember 15 years ago being offered that same data
[02:27:47.260 --> 02:27:49.380]   from T-Vo.
[02:27:49.380 --> 02:27:52.100]   Presumably, everything that knows what you're watching
[02:27:52.100 --> 02:27:55.300]   has some value and everything that knows it
[02:27:55.300 --> 02:27:57.780]   is probably selling it to somebody.
[02:27:57.780 --> 02:28:01.420]   The Visio did something quite clever because it's not
[02:28:01.420 --> 02:28:02.060]   like a T-Vo.
[02:28:02.060 --> 02:28:04.300]   It's not a tuner, unless you're--
[02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:05.380]   but most people don't.
[02:28:05.380 --> 02:28:09.340]   So it would look-- it would do pattern matching to the pixels
[02:28:09.340 --> 02:28:11.500]   on the screen to figure out what you were watching.
[02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:11.860]   Yeah.
[02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:14.020]   Which is actually really interesting technology.
[02:28:14.020 --> 02:28:14.820]   Clever, isn't it?
[02:28:14.820 --> 02:28:18.140]   It's a grace note for TV shows to be really--
[02:28:18.140 --> 02:28:19.700]   Comcast should really get up on that.
[02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:20.060]   Yeah.
[02:28:20.060 --> 02:28:20.540]   So--
[02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:21.500]   Yeah.
[02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:23.900]   Anyway, they've consent decree with the FTC.
[02:28:23.900 --> 02:28:25.100]   They're not going to do it anymore.
[02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:27.100]   And they're paid a $2.2 million.
[02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:27.500]   Fine.
[02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:29.060]   But I got to tell you, I would guess
[02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:33.660]   that any device you connect and watch TV on is probably
[02:28:33.660 --> 02:28:34.900]   collecting-- why wouldn't they?
[02:28:34.900 --> 02:28:36.940]   Is collecting that information?
[02:28:36.940 --> 02:28:37.460]   OK, wait.
[02:28:37.460 --> 02:28:38.060]   Stop Leo.
[02:28:38.060 --> 02:28:39.420]   Stop Leo.
[02:28:39.420 --> 02:28:43.780]   So many of your devices, Netflix collects that information.
[02:28:43.780 --> 02:28:46.220]   The difference with Vizio is three things.
[02:28:46.220 --> 02:28:49.820]   One, they had it-- they didn't tell people about it.
[02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:50.320]   Yeah.
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:52.140]   And that's one of the things they have to do in the consent
[02:28:52.140 --> 02:28:53.700]   decree is tell people--
[02:28:53.700 --> 02:28:58.580]   Two, they collected data-- they collected data not just
[02:28:58.580 --> 02:29:01.780]   on its TV, but anything watched over that TV
[02:29:01.780 --> 02:29:04.620]   unlike a service like Netflix or Roku Box, right?
[02:29:04.620 --> 02:29:08.580]   Which is only collecting data from what you're doing there.
[02:29:08.580 --> 02:29:11.620]   Yeah, but Roku watches across a bunch of services, right?
[02:29:11.620 --> 02:29:14.900]   It puts your data with your IP address, which is the worst.
[02:29:14.900 --> 02:29:16.420]   Yes.
[02:29:16.420 --> 02:29:17.740]   Yes, I agree with you.
[02:29:17.740 --> 02:29:19.260]   The data should always be anonymized.
[02:29:19.260 --> 02:29:22.420]   And I'm sure the Tivo data that we got didn't specify.
[02:29:22.420 --> 02:29:25.940]   Oh, Stacey watched and rewound this episode over and over again.
[02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:30.260]   Stacey watches Buffy whenever she's sad.
[02:29:30.260 --> 02:29:32.380]   And who does it after all?
[02:29:32.380 --> 02:29:33.500]   Hey, thank you, everybody.
[02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:35.100]   It's been a great show.
[02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:35.940]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:29:35.940 --> 02:29:36.580]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:37.460]   Thank you for watching.
