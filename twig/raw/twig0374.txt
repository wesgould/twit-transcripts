[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   That joins us.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   We're going to miss Stacy.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   She's not here this week, but don't worry.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   We've still got Danny Sullivan, a search engine land, and Kevin Marks
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   to talk about the Note 7.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   It's time to say "buy by Google Assistant" and what it does and can't do
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   and why you might want a Google Home.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   This is Twig.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   This is Twig this week in Google, episode 374, recorded Wednesday,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   October 12, 2016, somewhere between Scandal and Rosoto.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   This week in Google is brought to you by AwayLuggage.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Away makes first-class luggage at Coach Prices, allowing you to

[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Twig at checkout.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And by the all-new Basecamp 3, discover a much calmer, more organized
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   way to work with your team.

[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   of the price because everyone deserves a great night's sleep,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   get $50 off any mattress purchased by visiting Casper.com/twig
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   and entering the promo code Twig.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   It's time for Twig.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   This week in Google will show where we cover the latest and anything we want.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Don't be fooled by the name, kids.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   There is some Google in here, but there's also Facebook, Twitter,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   and media and everything else.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Jeff Jarvis' wide-ranging intellect is part of the reason for that.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Good to see you.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Actually, when we start discussing something obscure, you can look it up on Google,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   and that's why we call it this week in Google.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Yeah, we googled the answers.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   He's at buzzmachine.com, writes many great books, teaches journalism to those
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   lucky kids at the City University of New York at the TOW.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   What is it, the TOW school?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   TOW school?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Thank you for being here again, Jeff, because you were here on Sunday.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I was so delighted to see you.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I was sitting down in my family pizza, email comes in from Lisa.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Help!
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   We need guests!
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I said, "Yes, I'll be about 10 minutes."
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   We had slurped the wine.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I need the pizza.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   We had been on top in Taipei scheduled, and as you know, because of the time
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   difference, it's early morning for him, and he just overslept.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   He slept through it.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   He had us all.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Kevin Marks is also here.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   He's in our time zone down there in Silicon Valley.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Good to see you, the champion of the Open Web, the Indie Web, as he calls it.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I was thinking we could bring the Google Assistant into the conversation and have it
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   listening and suggest things as we speak about them.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   If only it were that smart.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Lisa and I have a mutual joke.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Now I've been using an iPhone since the iPhone 7 came out, and I try to use Siri.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Every time I use it, every time she uses it, and it comes back with a nonsensical answer,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   which is almost every time either I or she will say, "You have an unusual..."
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   What does it we say?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I find your faith in Siri distressing.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Also with his Danny Sullivan, the king at Search Engine Land, always a pleasure to have Danny.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   He's been watching Google since Google was just a little baby learning to walk.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Little tiny baby.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Sometimes I would give a little poke and watch follow.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   You're so cute, Google.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And Danny would change Google's diapers.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Oh, the stuff that comes out.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Well, now Google is a behemoth.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Bigger and bigger all the time.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Last week, I guess, you probably talked about it on Wednesday.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Google had its event, the October 4th event, announcing all sorts of new products.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Some wag said a copy of the iPhone, a copy of the Roku, a copy of the Amazon Echo,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and a copy of the Gear VR.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I think it's funny, it is in a way.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   It's kind of true, but it's kind of non-finished.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Google had its own Google juice to it, which could be tasteful or tasteless depending.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Or thoroughly disgusting depending on your imagination.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   But I do think it's interesting that Google looks like it's copying Apple a little bit.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Apple envy has snuck in in the sense that Google wants an ecosystem just like those boys down
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   the road in Cupertino.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   In fact, the weird thing, I'll say one more thing and let you talk to me.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   The really interesting thing is for the first time ever, Google has put features in the
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Pixel, its phone, that are not available to other Android users, particularly Google Assistant.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I think it's not that they want an ecosystem.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Suddenly, they've wanted an ecosystem for a very long time.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I think it's just that they're getting serious about the hardware almost in the same way we
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   see Microsoft getting serious about hardware.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Microsoft pretty much didn't do hardware for the longest time, didn't make its own laptops,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   do all that sort of stuff.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And now we have surface stuff and everything because the old model was you built the software
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   and you partnered with other people.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And Google built Android on the back of partnering up with other people.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And to me, in a lot of ways, this is sort of like taking the gloves off.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Like, well, you guys can keep doing Android phones and everything if you want and build
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   your other devices, but we're going to build our own stuff.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   So, you know, we're going to do everything from our own high end phone to the Google
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Home Voice Assistant.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   The interesting thing to me is going to be whether or not people actually buy it.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Because today they really haven't been that successful with selling the devices themselves.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And not that they don't sell them, but they just don't sell them in the numbers that people
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   go, "Aha!" and Google's the number one, number two hardware seller, you know, it tends to be Samsung.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   So, will they actually sell these phones?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And I've been watching the commercials, goodness, those are spending on the commercials.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I just--
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   It was like two million-- it was a huge amount of money in the last 24 hours.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Oh, yeah, they're jumping the money.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   But I'm struggling to understand like what that commercial's telling me.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Like--
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Those are the worst-- can I just say those are the worst commercials?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   It's the ones with the frame.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Yeah, it's like--
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And it's like--
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I'm trying to figure out what is that box?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   I can't see what's behind it.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I mean, my wife watched and I asked her, she goes, "Oh, that's clever.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Oh, they're taking the search box and they're turning in--"
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Right.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   That's what I thought too.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And I'm like, "Does that make you want to buy the functions?"
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Well, I mean, I guess maybe it makes me think Google's more in the phone maybe.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   But-- and I'm watching it.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And I'm just like, "I don't even know what you're getting."
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.520]   To where as when they were running those ads for Google Photos where the person's taking
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.000]   the picture and it stalls, it's like, "Oh, oh, out of room."
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.640]   You're like, "Oh, that's a problem.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.640]   I know I need to get that."
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.920]   Yeah, that was a good ad.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   That was direct--
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.280]   Yeah, so for me the crop of ads are just not expressing any reason at all why I think--
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.280]   I agree with you.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.280]   You know what, I shouldn't get the picture.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.760]   Well, what would have been a good ad if like, you know, they were saying, "Get the
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.760]   pixel.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.560]   It won't blow up in your face."
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.200]   That would be very powerful.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.000]   Our phones don't blow up.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   What a feature.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.080]   Well, now we can't apply any explosive technology.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.520]   I just think there's a risk that Google might-- I don't know.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.920]   I see-- Microsoft's done this.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:54.480]   Apple's never had to do this, but Google might hurt the OEMs by saying, "No, but we're
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.480]   going to make a phone that has capabilities.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.480]   Yours cannot."
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.480]   I don't--
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.480]   But I don't think--
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.280]   Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.280]   That's the thing.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.600]   It's not really true either.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.840]   It's been confirmed more since.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.600]   On Twitter I asked whether I should buy the phone because the main selling point is it
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   has AI.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.120]   It has assistant.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.800]   But there's nothing in the hardware that makes that required.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.960]   And one of the stories in the rundown says, "Well, here's how you can put on assistant
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.300]   on any new phone."
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.840]   Well, if you root it, that doesn't count.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.840]   No, no, no, no.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.600]   That's not because there's a capability in the phone.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.440]   There's no physical hardware.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.440]   That was your question.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.440]   Yeah, that's legit.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.440]   It's not like a motor-rorororo thing, man.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.600]   So the motor-rororophones had the extra chip that was listening all the time that let you
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   do it, Google, more easily.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.600]   It's not that.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   It's something like that.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   It's just that they've-- why something different than that.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   But that's even more.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.120]   But that isn't even more aggressive thing.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.960]   That means they're actually keeping something out of the Android codebase for competitive
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.960]   reasons.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.960]   It's just--
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.960]   It wouldn't be an Android anyway.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.960]   It would be in the other piece, right?
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.960]   It would be in--
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.960]   It's Google services.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.960]   Google services for your handset as Samsung, LG, HTC, and others do, you don't get it.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.520]   We're not keeping it out.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.520]   We're just doing a very limited launch at the moment until now.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.960]   It's-- and it'll come to other providers.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.840]   And I'm sure it will make you tell you, uh-huh.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.040]   By the way, the ad spend-- I understated it.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:25.160]   In the last two days, Google spent $3.2 million on those really bad ads for the Pixel and
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.280]   the Pixel XL.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.960]   It's actually not a lot in a tip.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.120]   I don't think I've seen them.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.120]   That's one Super Bowl ad.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.240]   They're not-- they're not good.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.520]   You're not-- you know what?
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.040]   You're not watching the baseball cards.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.040]   I don't wish TV anyways.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.040]   Oh, that's really--
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.040]   You have to watch the baseball cards.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.040]   I'm not a real man.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.040]   You're in the middle.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.040]   We've known that for a while.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.040]   I'm presenting Operation.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.480]   Well, there was anything in this state whether we're anywhere in the game.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.480]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.480]   I love you, Jeff.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.480]   Hit the whole of the belt.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.480]   Literally.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.400]   Right, since I need them to sync that money into some more native advertising and movies
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.720]   until I see a TV show where on Agents of Shield they're suddenly using all Pixel devices.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.800]   Yeah, look how well that worked for Windows Phone.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.320]   For a while every TV show had a Windows Phone in it.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.320]   But now they-- I don't know.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.040]   I'm not even working for Surface though.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.360]   I mean, the hard thing with Windows Phone is like, why do you want to buy the Windows
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.360]   Phone?
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.360]   What do you get around it?
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.360]   Right.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   But with Surface-- oh my goodness.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.560]   I keep flashing back to under the dome when I've never seen so many Surface devices.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.560]   I know.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   I know.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.560]   It's funny.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.560]   Or I--
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.800]   I think it was like Blackish where she was using her thing.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:31.120]   The best thing was when she got done, she flipped it down and then left the key-- kickstand
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.120]   sticking up or whatever.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.120]   You know.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.920]   She was like, how do I shut this to indicate I'm done?
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.800]   It's not a laptop, so I don't quite know what they've got to call us to see.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.800]   I know, flip it down.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.800]   But what about the--
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:47.960]   You know, ultimately why those product placement is backfire is because they stand out like
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.440]   a sore thumb because you never see anybody actually using those devices.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.840]   So it's like, what are they using?
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.840]   Well, it's like-- so scandal.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.840]   We had the Microsoft devices.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.920]   And I thought that was just-- they were in this parallel universe where we have--
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.920]   I'm surprised.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.280]   And Microsoft won the phone wars.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.240]   It cracks me up.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   That's weird.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.240]   What is that for?
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.240]   All of a mad dream.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.240]   All of a mad dream.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.240]   A lot of placement on Seinfeld.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.240]   Was there-- I don't think there were--
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.240]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.240]   Cereals.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.240]   Hit a Mac.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.240]   Hit a Mac.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.240]   Hit an old Mac.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.240]   One of those little--
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.240]   She never used.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.240]   SE30 or something.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.640]   And then, of course, brand name cereals.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.640]   Lots of that.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.640]   And that bike.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.640]   Was--
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.640]   But I think at that point--
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.640]   Yeah, some bike.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.640]   Back.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.640]   Some paint.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.640]   Never used.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.640]   Apple never pays.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.640]   That's Apple's-- well, at least that's what they say.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.640]   Apple says, oh, no, we don't have to pay.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.640]   All we have to do is provide product because--
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.640]   But they also--
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.640]   But they have a--
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.640]   They have a group that spends--
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.640]   --spends--
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.640]   --spends providing that product.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.640]   Sorry, Kevin.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.640]   Sorry, Kevin.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.640]   So they have a group that works with them to make it easier to film.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.240]   And there was a chunk of work to actually make the screens right
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.240]   at the right frame with fulfillment, things like that.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.240]   So there was some--
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.240]   Yeah, that's much easier now with those EDs.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.240]   But--
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.240]   They call that playback.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.040]   And every TV show now has somebody that does that because
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.040]   designs the screens and does the playback because--
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.040]   Jerry used Mac.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.040]   I'm betting that the George had Windows.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.040]   And surprisingly, surprisingly, Kramer knew Linux.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.040]   You're right.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.040]   I want the Cosmo distro.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.640]   All right, let's talk about the Note 7.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.640]   This is sad.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.640]   Today, the Wall Street Journal said Samsung is discontinuing the
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.640]   Note 7.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.640]   It's done.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.120]   Why do I have to show up before them?
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.240]   I got one and turned it in, of course.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.840]   Because I never got a replacement.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.840]   And the real problem is there--
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.440]   Why did you want the Note 7 over the edge anyway?
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.440]   I have the edge.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.440]   Why would you want it every day?
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.440]   Because it has a stylus and a bigger screen.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.840]   Oh, is it that much bigger of a screen?
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.240]   Yeah, noticeably bigger.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.040]   And it was advanced technology.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.520]   And I think we're learning--
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.840]   New York Times had a very good article speculative somewhat
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.040]   saying even Samsung doesn't know why these phones are bursting
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.240]   into flame.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.320]   And obviously, that's true.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.240]   Otherwise, their replacement wouldn't have also burst into
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:08.540]   flame.
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.040]   There have been six cases in the US alone.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.640]   That's a great quote in there.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.160]   Like, it's so advanced we don't.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.320]   The last line of the article-- scroll down to the bottom
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.040]   of the card, and the last line of the article is, the phone was--
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.320]   we rushed out a phone so sophisticated even we
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.640]   don't know how it works.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.560]   Which is what the people who do AI say.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.720]   So I suspect that there's AI in their design.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.920]   Here's the quote.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.400]   "Samsung seems to have packed it with so much innovation,
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.480]   it became uncontrollable."
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.760]   Oh, that's going to feed technopatic everywhere.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.880]   But I mean, this happens every now and then.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.840]   Apple had a laptop exploding problem a few years back,
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.280]   didn't they?
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.280]   Remember that?
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:53.720]   Didn't Apple--
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.560]   No, Dell did.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.680]   Dell had a--
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.080]   I'm exporting batteries.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.040]   Did Apple--
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.000]   I've never heard of Apple's having any--
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.760]   There was one way the batteries would swell up inside.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:11.840]   Only there was some way we could quickly check battery.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.840]   Sorry, I was under the table or I would have responded.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.720]   Yes, Apple did--
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.880]   Oh, yes, yes.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.800]   Apple did the swelling batteries.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.600]   I had one.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.640]   Sony has done a recall.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.360]   Dell has done a recall.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.680]   Apple has had phones even burst into flame,
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.080]   although it's been so rare that it hasn't had to issue a recall.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.680]   It's a fundamentally dangerous technology lithium ion.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.360]   It is.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.640]   It is.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.320]   But I feel so bad for-- well, on the one hand,
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.360]   I feel bad for Samsung.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.200]   But on the other hand, if they didn't really
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.920]   understand what's going on inside the battery,
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.240]   they obviously rushed it to get it out before the Apple iPhone
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.600]   7, right?
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.240]   Well, I wonder if there's some kind of a software--
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.760]   one of the nice things about the Samsungs is how quickly
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.360]   they'll charge with those fast chargers or whatever.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.000]   And I don't know the degree that that depends on the software
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.040]   that's monitoring how quickly you're throwing in there,
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.600]   whatever.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.720]   But it was interesting to find out it wasn't just the battery.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.560]   Like, that was like, oh, it's just the wrong battery.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.760]   We used a different battery manufacturer.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.440]   And actually, it looks like it's something much more than that.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.520]   Which makes me nervous for every other phone out there,
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.600]   because it's some way of the direction of somebody
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.440]   has a patent on something here that is used.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.800]   You kind of want them to know what went wrong.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.040]   Sure, all these phones would be perfectly fine.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.400]   Never kill us.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.720]   But that's the thing.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.480]   They did ship a lot of them and a small number of caught fires.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.040]   So the challenge is, testing them out to find that case.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.000]   I get the impression, though, from the way
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.480]   that Samsung's doing this recall,
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.480]   including sending out special boxes.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.480]   Special boxes.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.840]   Do you want those things in mailboxes?
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.840]   No.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.560]   And the box says, "Contains potentially explosive lithium ion
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.520]   battery, not to be put on an airplane."
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.000]   And it has gloves in there.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.440]   Now, maybe that's an overabundance of caution.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.880]   But it certainly indicates that for a while,
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.880]   they had an IMDI.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.280]   They said to you gloves.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.600]   They said to you gloves.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.880]   But while they had an IMDI search where you could look up
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.280]   the IMI number and say if your phone was OK or not,
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.320]   they abandoned that.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.040]   They realized they, for a while, they
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   thought the Chinese batteries weren't the problem.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.520]   They abandoned that.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.200]   And they've now not only recalled every single note
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.120]   seven told everybody who has a note seven, turn it off,
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.960]   do not turn it on.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.720]   And they're not going to make them anymore, which tells me
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.880]   they're still baffled.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.960]   They don't know what happened.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.800]   That's scary.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.360]   How can I turn it off if I haven't received
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.200]   my important protective gloves?
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.560]   They should say something like that.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.160]   I mean, they can go outside, put on some--
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.120]   --product recall security theater.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.320]   And throw some gloves in there.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.560]   That'll make it sound like we're really doing a good job.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.240]   Maybe.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.680]   Or maybe they really are--
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.680]   Well, look.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.680]   If it's so dangerous to pick up your phone
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.240]   and put it into the box that they have to send you gloves,
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.520]   then you can't even touch the phone in any way, shape,
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.040]   or form.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.880]   You shouldn't have it in your house at all.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.000]   You can't even touch it to turn it off.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.560]   I don't know.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.240]   I'm plugging it with a pole or something.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.560]   They don't need the gloves.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.480]   I'm wondering if--
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.440]   I don't know what's going on, Kitty Cat.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.360]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.520]   It's a cat-studded dial, hang on.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.920]   If your Skype suddenly disappears.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.440]   I feel bad for Samsung, but I feel--
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.040]   it's clear the note seven brand is dead.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.200]   Maybe even the note brand is dead.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:40.520]   Maybe even the Galaxy brand is dead.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.680]   I mean, it's not going to impact Samsung
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.360]   because that's the mobile business, 5% of the business,
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.760]   although I just saw that it's 2% of Koreans exports.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.280]   Korean exports are Samsung phones.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.800]   Well, I've seen people say that this
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.720]   is going to kill the Samsung brand, but--
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.040]   No, no.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.120]   It's a bigger brand than that.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.880]   But it's certainly not going to help the phone.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.320]   It's like the Galaxy phone is a good phone.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.080]   There are a lot of people that are using them,
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.720]   that are enjoying them.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.960]   Yes.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:09.480]   And so it's like, I don't know that people are going to suddenly
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.120]   go, well, I'm never going to buy my Galaxy again.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.200]   If you've been using it, it's been working fine,
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.320]   and you never got the note.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.480]   And the number of people using notes are relatively small.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.880]   So I don't know that this kills them.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.720]   It certainly is a terrible black eye for them, though.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.560]   Like, this is not what you want to do when
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.080]   you're trying to expand against Apple.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.520]   But fortunately, Apple released a really kick
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.080]   ass new phone with a lot of great features that
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.400]   are so different from the previous phones that we had that--
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.480]   Hey, it has the number one feature everybody's looking for.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.720]   It doesn't burst into a flame.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.800]   Well, that's it.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.320]   That's what you--
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.560]   I agree with you, Leo.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.880]   A phone that does not kill you is so much what people are
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.000]   looking for in this case.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.360]   So much better than the one that does.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.640]   So much better.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.520]   We shouldn't mock this.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.320]   I mean, at least half a dozen people
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.360]   have been sent to the hospital.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.480]   This is with burns and smoke inhalation.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.840]   And apparently, the gloves I'm being told now
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.760]   with Gardener and our chatroom are for people who
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.720]   are sensitive to the ceramic fiber paper
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.840]   that this fireproof box is made of.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.160]   Oh, OK.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.000]   OK.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.600]   Now I can go with that.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.440]   Because gloves aren't going to protect you from flame
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.880]   and explosion.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.520]   It's hard not to make a joke about this.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.480]   And yet, this is not a joking matter for Samsung.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.200]   This is life or death for Samsung.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.680]   So much money.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.120]   Well, and Google has to be thinking,
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.640]   well, we timed that pixel release perfectly.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.040]   The thing that is really true is that there's nothing
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.480]   like the Note 7 on the market.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:48.560]   This was a phone that really was differentiated by the stylists.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.720]   The fact that it had a 5.7 inch screen in a body that
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.640]   was smaller than the 5 and 1/2 inch screen of an iPhone.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.080]   It was a beautiful phone.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.800]   It worked really well.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.360]   I loved the Note 7.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.080]   I think it was absolutely the best.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.000]   How long did you use it?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.280]   Maybe.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:07.720]   I don't know.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.600]   Like two weeks.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.000]   When the first issues started happening,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.840]   the initial thinking was, oh, this is only the phones
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.200]   with the Korean battery.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.080]   And mine-- even though I got it from T-Mobile
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.760]   had been made in China.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.160]   And even the T-Mobile guy said, oh, you probably are right,
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.800]   because it's made in China.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.200]   So I wasn't in a hurry.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:27.800]   But you know what?
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.520]   As more and more cases happen, I thought, I'm not
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.400]   going to take a chance.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.440]   And I got my money back.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.640]   I didn't ask for an exchange.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.240]   I got my money back.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.680]   Partly because I was leaving the country.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.240]   It wouldn't have made--
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.440]   Did it ever feel hot?
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:38.920]   Never.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.400]   It's different now.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.320]   But the other reason this is a cost or concern--
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.360]   we talked a little bit about this with Steve yesterday
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.000]   on security now.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.080]   He's kind of a polymath, an expert on everything.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.360]   And he was talking about lithium ion batteries.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.440]   And part of the reason this was of great concern to me
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.080]   is that many of these phones were not being charged when
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.760]   they burst into a flame.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.400]   But what Steve said, which was interesting,
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.000]   is that doesn't mean it wasn't the charging that was doing it.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   He said it's very possible that the charging itself
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.360]   began a process, perhaps short-circuited something
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:19.760]   that would then later result in combustion hours later.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.920]   But it was concerning for me that these phones were bursting
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.280]   in a flame, not when they were plugged in,
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.840]   but just when they were sitting in a pocket.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.200]   That's really not good.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.920]   So just in case you are living under a rock,
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:35.400]   if you have a Note 7, Samsung has strongly urging everybody,
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.120]   they will completely reimburse you.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.080]   They will send your money back.
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.160]   They will send you a box.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.000]   Best thing to do is bring it to the retailer.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.400]   But if you bought it online, they'll send you a box.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.800]   They'll give you a credit--
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.200]   I had something, a $25 credit--
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.480]   and turn it off immediately.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.880]   Just turn it off right now and don't mess with it.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.920]   And they've decided not to make it anymore.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.080]   Samsung has already cut $2.3 billion
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.280]   from its profit projections, which wipe out the profits--
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.560]   the entire profits of the mobile business for that quarter.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.680]   Some analysts say the cost ultimately
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.880]   could go not only to $4 to $5 billion, but even more.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.840]   In fact, Samsung's share prices cost
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.880]   has lost $21 billion.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.400]   So--
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.640]   We have to wonder, does that mean it's like,
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.040]   will we get a note ever in the future to be bigger?
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.200]   I think not.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.560]   That is a damaged brand.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:39.080]   Or do you call it the Galaxy Edge S?
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:39.840]   You call it--
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.440]   It's a stylist.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.880]   Incombustible 9.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.760]   You call it something completely different.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.840]   It's not related.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.440]   And I think this is going to be a tough one
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.720]   for Samsung to come back from.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.600]   It's not like there aren't lots of other choices.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.480]   Just none of them with a stylist.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.320]   And the last phone that allows you to move the battery, the LG G4--
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.640]   I'm sorry, G5--
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.840]   is probably going to be a premium product.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.440]   You can actually take the battery out.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.880]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.640]   Actually, Samsung was in the Supreme Court on Tuesday,
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.840]   arguing its case against Apple.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.080]   I guess what they're really debating
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.120]   is whether that half-- almost half a billion dollar judgment
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.880]   was too much.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.160]   But it's over the design patent, over the ability
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.600]   to make a phone that looks like an Apple phone.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.960]   And Samsung already lost that case,
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:40.640]   but the question is, should they have to pay so much money for it?
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.360]   I mean, tragically, the court room case
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.840]   was disrupted because someone screamed, look out.
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.720]   He's got a note in his hand.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.280]   He's got a note, 7.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.120]   Talk.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.080]   There was a great tweet this morning.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.240]   I think it was Charles Arthur, a British journalist.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.840]   I think it was his.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.160]   "And I leave to my son a million pounds in currency
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.720]   locked in the vault with my Samsung Note 7."
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:10.920]   Oh, man.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.480]   You know you're in trouble when people are making jokes
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.800]   like that about your product that it's all over.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.880]   It's just a lot.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.360]   Our show today brought to you by--
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:25.080]   I love this-- luggage with a battery in it.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.520]   But actually, it's a great idea.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.520]   This is a carry-on from Away.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.000]   Away luggage is made with a premium German polycarbonate.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   So it's very light, but very tough.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.760]   This is a great carry-on.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.080]   They also have a medium and large, all of them less than $300.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.560]   But what I love about this is look under the handle.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.760]   By the way, these are the kind of luggage
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.120]   I always get nowadays, the four wheel.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.160]   They roll in any direction.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.280]   That's the only way to go.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:57.600]   When I see people walking down the airport
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.400]   carter with their luggage tilted because they only
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.200]   have two wheels, I feel sorry for them.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.240]   This is luggage.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.360]   You just push it with your finger,
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.800]   and it rolls along wherever you're going.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.600]   But look under the handle here.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.400]   This is awesome.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.880]   There's two USB ports.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.960]   And you've got a 10,000 milliamp hour battery in this.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.960]   Awesome.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.760]   It's TSA-approved combination lock.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.560]   It's built right in.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.240]   You has inside a removable washable laundry bag
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.240]   to keep dirty clothes separate from clean.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.560]   And a lifetime warranty.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.600]   And what?
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.160]   A risk-free 100-day trial period.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.040]   I love sitting in the airport with my phone plugged
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.080]   into my carry-on because if I need a little juice, it's got it.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.120]   And the thing is, there's such lightweight luggage.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.560]   It does not feel heavier in any respect than what
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.480]   I was used to use as a carry-on.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.680]   This is just great.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.840]   Let me unlock it here.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.800]   It's got the TSA lock out.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:54.440]   You'll open it up, Leo.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.360]   So we have one of the founders of away on--
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:58.920]   Dot Zero.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.520]   Dot NYC.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.040]   Dot NYC.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:00.880]   Dot NYC.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.560]   And they really-- they reengineered as they go.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.800]   The stuff inside, they really follow
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.480]   through how that can't be closed down.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:06.980]   Oops.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.520]   Yeah, no, it's very-- to me, the inside of carry-ons
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.560]   is just as important as the outside.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.520]   And they've got all the little features I like,
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.920]   including this zip-expandable bag,
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.760]   because that's where I put all the wires, right?
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.840]   All the chargers and stuff like that.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.240]   Most people put their underwear there,
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.200]   but you put the wires there.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.200]   Is that what that's for?
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.400]   I don't know.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.400]   I always figured this for electronics.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.120]   They also have-- and this is also-- this is the compartment
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.400]   where you put your underwear, where it has the zip.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.520]   It's hard for me to show this.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.760]   I guess we don't have the over-the-shoulder shut today.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.240]   But this is awesome.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.720]   Anyway, a way luggage.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.160]   So there are New York City startup?
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.000]   Yeah, I think one of the founders was Warby Parker.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.480]   Oh, yeah, you're right.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.200]   That's right.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.120]   That's right.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.280]   And so they really bring that kind of experience of looking
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.640]   for something that needs disruption.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.320]   Suitcases generally suck.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.280]   Well, keeks really, keeks really-- by the way,
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.160]   this is also impervious to coffee spills.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.560]   And you'll like that.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.040]   Because you just proved it.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.760]   I just proved it.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.600]   Awaytravel.com/twig.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.680]   Into the promo code twig.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.240]   And you're going to get 20 bucks off a checkout.

[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:18.800]   That beautiful red.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.960]   I'm getting that for Lisa.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.040]   I've got the black.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.440]   The polycarbonate shell is very, very tough,
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.240]   but also very, very light.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.040]   And free shipping anywhere in the continental US.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.640]   Go to awaytravel.com/twig.

[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.800]   Awaytravel is a brand new sponsor.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:45.240]   And we welcome awaytravel.com/twig.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.400]   Make sure you use that offer.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.160]   We were talking before the show.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.760]   People, just basically, they go to awaytravel.com.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.480]   But we won't get credit unless you go to awaytravel.com/twig.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.800]   So you want Jeff and everybody to get--
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.440]   You bet.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.240]   They have a pop-up store in London right now.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.760]   They had one in New York and they wanted London.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.440]   Oh, nice.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.000]   Yeah, because you kind of want to see this.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.880]   But you could take my word for it.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:13.800]   I am kind of-- one of my fetishes is luggage, bags and luggage.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.040]   Oh, my god.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:15.360]   Right?
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.320]   You too?
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:16.880]   Oh, my god.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.380]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.200]   I had a bag room.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.840]   Yeah, I have a bag room now.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.320]   I do.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.440]   That's interesting.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.800]   Pens, watches, bags.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.680]   I don't know what it is.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.120]   There's something--
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.400]   Yeah, I really need to come up.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.720]   We need to bond a lot more.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.680]   We should do a bag thing.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.080]   Oh, life just hates my bags.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.400]   Hates that I have them.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.920]   Well, you know, I'm of the Johnny Jet persuasion
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.360]   where if you cannot check bags, you're better off.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.360]   Oh, amen.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.280]   And of course, they have bags that you can check.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.920]   But this is a carry-on with all the features you want.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.720]   And it's the longest you've ever gone just
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.320]   on a carry-on land.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.880]   Oh, probably 10 days.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.000]   I've done 14.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.360]   Wow.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.440]   But you must have laundry.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.560]   It's so good to sell, right?
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.240]   No, no, no.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.000]   You just managed to--
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.400]   Do you wash your socks out in the sink kind of guy?
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.280]   You just wear black.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.840]   There's no variety.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.720]   I don't mind wearing black, but what about laundry?
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.840]   Jeans can go.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.920]   I use the air squeezy things.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.520]   When you get home, the jeans are standing up on their own,
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:15.960]   aren't they?
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.440]   Well, yeah.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.160]   But the air squeezy thing, that's what they're for.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:20.600]   No, that's--
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.600]   And then you can put more in there.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.920]   No, I'm all about the air squeezy thing.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.560]   And I use little tiny--
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.840]   when you're lucky enough to fly business class
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.520]   and you get the giveaway thing and has that little,
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.320]   tiny toothpaste thing?
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.280]   You're surprised how many days you get out of one of those.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.240]   So you don't need to carry tons of liquids.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.040]   A little dab will do you on a lot of these things
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.840]   and never carry shampoo because they'll tell all that kind of stuff.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.840]   You don't have everything--
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:45.840]   Great advice.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.520]   Great advice, sir.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.360]   Get everything about it.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.400]   Johnny Jed, who's a regular on the radio show,
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.040]   is also like you.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:56.520]   He's like, how far can I want can I go without?
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.000]   All right.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.240]   This just in.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.720]   Yeah, I spoke a little behind the scenes thing here.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.280]   Apparently, in spinning that four-wheeled spinner luggage
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.160]   around, which I like, what I neglected to note
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.840]   was that I had a cup of tea sitting right here.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.120]   How bad is the floor?
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.040]   Well, the floor will absorb it.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:26.560]   It's my--
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.840]   A closer--
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.880]   The computer's full.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.960]   Mostly it's my pants.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.640]   But you're a pro though.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.400]   You kept going.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.120]   Oh, hey.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.160]   You didn't take a beat.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.440]   Oh, no, not me.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.960]   I stopped for nothing.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.000]   No, actually, I'm kind of excited.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.680]   I mean, this is a-- this bag is awesome.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.160]   So excited.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:47.660]   It is.
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:48.000]   It is.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.960]   They are great.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.560]   You know, if you like to--
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.160]   here they come.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:56.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.440]   Who's got the mop?
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.840]   All right, we got that.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.000]   It's all-- that's good.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.600]   It's fine.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.100]   That's good.
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.120]   I only spilled one cup.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:08.960]   I'm more sad about the tea than anything else.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.680]   All right, yeah.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.840]   Let's talk about Yahoo.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.040]   Yay.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:14.560]   Yahoo.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.880]   What from one said, don't we do another?
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.240]   [SIGHS]
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:20.840]   Let's not.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.480]   Is it unreasonable for me to blame--
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.000]   Let's not talk about them.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.560]   Is it--
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:24.920]   No.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.040]   Because why?
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.640]   I guess you're right.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.600]   Is it unreasonable for me to blame Marissa Meyer for this?
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.960]   Well, she is the CEO.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:41.440]   For two years, they knew that the entire password user
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.680]   database was hacked.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.280]   For two--
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.320]   I thought they didn't know for some amount of that time.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.720]   I thought it happened two years ago,
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.280]   but then they didn't know.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.560]   They knew for two years?
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.280]   Well, now that's a good question.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.040]   I'm quoting Steve Gibson yesterday.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.120]   Let me see if I can find the story.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.160]   Yeah, I'm not--
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.720]   They certainly knew for longer than they--
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.160]   I thought there were two shocking things.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.520]   One, how long they didn't know, and then two,
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.160]   how long they knew and didn't tell.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.400]   Could be wrong.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.640]   I mean, to be fair, it was the don't ask, don't tell, Paul.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.320]   They were still operating because people were not aware
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.560]   that if you didn't ask them whether or not
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.960]   you thought your password had been somehow
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.960]   vulnerably hacked, they felt they shouldn't tell.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.200]   Well, I don't know how-- OK, how long did Yahoo know?
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.240]   Does anybody know about the hack?
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.680]   That's only half of the story, though.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.080]   Because then the government came to them.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:43.800]   Now, again, in their defense, they
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.760]   had fought government orders before and lost.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.960]   And once that FISA court says it's OK,
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.440]   it's pretty hard to convince another court to say no, no.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:00.160]   However, they not only did not fight it,
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.240]   they complied in an egregious fashion,
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.760]   completely bypassing Alex Stamos, who is now at Facebook,
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.560]   interestingly enough.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:12.280]   And his entire security team, to put what was effectively
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.520]   a root kit, we had initially heard that, oh, no,
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.680]   we just modified the anti-spam filter
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.800]   to look for the signature the government was looking for.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.360]   No, no, it was a root kit.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.800]   And in fact, when Stamos and the security team saw it,
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.600]   they thought they'd been hacked.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.400]   And then the guys on the other side--
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:30.840]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.280]   Yeah, said, oh, no, that was us.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.280]   They don't ever mind.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.920]   So let me see here.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.360]   Yahoo, this is Fortune.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:45.320]   Yahoo is under fire over cyber hack timeline.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.360]   On Friday, Yahoo faced pointed questions
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.240]   about exactly when it knew about the cyber attack that
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.360]   exposed the email credentials of half a billion users.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.320]   The largest hackable, bigger than my space,
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:01.400]   bigger than Ashley Madison, half a billion users.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:05.360]   It has not provided a clear detailed timeline yet.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:11.360]   But as soon as the deal with Verizon is complete--
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.240]   Yeah, then we'll tell you.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.760]   And they're done with the audit.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.400]   They'll be happy to release that.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.280]   And Verizon, by the way, has already asked for a billion
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:17.880]   dollars off.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:21.360]   But I think it could be possible it could scotch the whole deal.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:26.400]   I'm sure this is enough cause for them
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.360]   to get out of the deal without any penalty.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.160]   Yahoo CEO-- Verizon CEO says they're evaluating whether Yahoo
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.000]   hack had, quote, material impact, end quote.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.560]   This is in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.160]   Rich Blumethall, Democratic Senator from Connecticut,
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.560]   says, as law enforcement and regulators examine this incident,
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.840]   they should investigate whether Yahoo
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.280]   may have concealed its knowledge of this breach
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.240]   in order to artificially bolster its valuation
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.640]   and its pending acquisition.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:35:02.280]   The Financial Times, which is reliable,
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.120]   said last week that Marissa Meyer knew of the breach in July.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:10.120]   So maybe they didn't know for two years,
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:15.120]   but she knew many months before it was revealed.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.880]   Can I say, Leah, what are the reactions that came off of this
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.360]   and Snowden, I think, was one of the people who said it as well.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.600]   It was like, delete your account.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.520]   Good luck trying to do that, by the way.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.360]   No, you can delete your account.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.560]   I just wouldn't recommend you do that.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.920]   I would go in.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.480]   I would delete your emails.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.680]   I would take out all the stuff you need to have.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.240]   I would empty your trash and clear it all.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:39.040]   But you also have to remember that Yahoo recycles emails.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.320]   So would you delete your account if it was, you know,
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.280]   whatever, leoleport@yahoo.com?
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.160]   Good guess, that's exactly what it is.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.040]   Right, so you delete that and then you delete it
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.720]   and in a few years, potentially someone else comes over
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.920]   and gets that name and you've left that link
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.760]   with all your accounts.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.840]   Now Yahoo and I guess Facebook does the same.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.760]   You can look it up when this was getting more closely
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.400]   examined in like 2014.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.160]   They apparently have systems that are designed to see like,
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.120]   oh, I'm getting an email, but we've never seen this before.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.640]   Let's not send it 'cause that was probably
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.640]   for the old person or whatever.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.360]   But, you know, at this point, do you really want to trust
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.120]   Yahoo's algorithms and Yahoo's got all the safety for you?
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.840]   I think you'd be much safer to just--
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.000]   No, you're right.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.640]   I hibernate the account.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.640]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.480]   Don't do that to me.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.480]   And you were that too.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.720]   Years ago, Yahoo just killed my email address.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.040]   Oh, yeah, they announced that they were due that.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.000]   If it was left fallow for any--
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.560]   You irritated the hell out of the internet.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.560]   They'd get recycled and I had nothing to do with it.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.280]   'Cause they was Yahoo mail, but not notified, nothing.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.000]   So you need to check in once in a while.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.400]   What I did is I changed my password and turned on
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.280]   two factor, which you can do.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.280]   And that should be sufficient to protect you.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:55.760]   The thing that's really scary is, yes, the passwords were
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.760]   hash, we don't know how well or whether they were salted.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.480]   But the secret questions were in the clear.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:05.280]   And secret questions are, you know, it's--
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.560]   Huge vulnerability.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.200]   First of all, I hate secret questions.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.200]   Yes. Yes.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.360]   And people use the same secret question,
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.160]   same secret at question answer all the time.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.040]   So that is it.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.160]   Yeah, what's your favorite--
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.000]   (laughing)
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.440]   What, you know, what street did you grow up on?
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.280]   What was the name of your first pet?
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.120]   Me.
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.080]   Yeah, I recommend--
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:23.920]   Bestie.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.200]   If companies insist on secret questions,
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:31.200]   A, screw them, 'cause that's the worst security flaw ever.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:37.240]   And B, don't use real answers, use passwords in effect.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.080]   Random.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:38.920]   You never remember them.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.040]   No, and put them in your last pass, your password manager.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.840]   Put the question in the answer question answer.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.520]   You have to do that otherwise.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.520]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.360]   So starting with El Capitan,
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.920]   Apple has allowed two factor on Apple accounts.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.880]   Damn straight, I'm gonna use that.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:58.480]   So I get home and I'm gonna turn on two factor
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.000]   and it said, okay, what street did you grow up on?
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.960]   Okay, I put what I think was right.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.960]   Who was your best friend in high school?
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.280]   When did I set these up?
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.680]   I don't remember this.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.600]   I couldn't figure it out, couldn't figure it out.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.040]   Finally, I had to call Apple and said,
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.160]   you have to reset these.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.120]   I don't know what the answers are.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:19.960]   And they then verified my identity in several,
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.240]   frankly, not very good ways,
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:26.240]   but to their satisfaction and cleared the questions.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.160]   So then I log in again and say, okay, good.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.200]   Now I wanna put on two factor authentication and say,
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.080]   sorry, you can't.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.240]   Your account's been significantly changed.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.120]   You have to wait.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:40.520]   And the first it said three days, then it said 30 days.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.600]   Now I understand the delay because if a hacker gets
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.080]   in your system, they're gonna change things like that
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.960]   so you can't recover it.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.800]   But 30 days,
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:53.720]   this is offensive.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:57.800]   Now I have no secret questions, no two factor,
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.680]   and I can't do anything about it for 30 days.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.040]   What if I'd been hacked?
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:06.520]   Stop secret questions, stop the insanity.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.480]   And frankly, I have to think Yahoo knew
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.320]   before they revealed it.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.000]   There's lots of evidence, no smoking gun,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   but head of security who had left said,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.720]   we think they knew he ran a guy named Jeremiah Grossman
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.400]   who was head of security.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.960]   He's currently head of security strategy at InfoSec,
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.120]   but he ran security for Yahoo until 2001.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.960]   He said, I also don't think that the claim
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.680]   that the attacker was state sponsored makes any sense
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.800]   because state sponsored hackers don't usually go then
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.720]   to sell the data on the internet.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:51.280]   Unless they're trying to make it seem
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.360]   like they're not a state sponsored hacker
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.520]   and that's designed to throw you off.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:03.280]   Yahoo did not encrypt the security questions,
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.400]   some are readable in plain text.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.320]   Just hope you didn't use the same security questions
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.840]   and answer somewhere else.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.200]   That's depressing, so bad.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.840]   Yahoo really has gone from one of the pioneers
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.080]   of the internet to--
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.960]   Oh, it passed that stage law, law, law.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.800]   Did it?
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.640]   Did it?
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.560]   All right, yeah.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.960]   I don't think, I think I'd agree with Danny,
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.120]   there's not too much cause for whistles here.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.240]   No, not anymore.
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:33.520]   And what makes me sad though is I had some respect
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.160]   for Marissa Meyer, now I'm starting to think,
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:39.920]   hmm, maybe she really did not do a good job there.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:44.360]   All right.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.200]   Danny looks like he's getting ready
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.200]   to put on fighting gloves.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.360]   Okay, see that?
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.360]   How can I see it?
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.200]   What is that you're wearing?
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.320]   I can't even see myself.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.160]   What are you wearing?
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.640]   It's my PBS USB key thing.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.680]   Oh, it's a wrist, it's a bracelet USB key.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.000]   Yeah, I got like a--
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.160]   You got it from PBS?
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.320]   It's got it, you wear it.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.760]   Don't accept USB keys from strangers,
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.560]   don't you know anything?
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.760]   Look, it's PBS, how could that be bad?
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.240]   Look, it's fine.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.800]   It's got a little smiley kiss, it's PBS kiss,
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.800]   there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.680]   Do not plug that in any machines.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:19.880]   So while we're talking about security,
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:20.720]   can I bring up something?
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.560]   Yes.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.720]   It's all good, it's okay.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.280]   Go ahead.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:29.920]   So the, the Wiki leaks latest Podesta hackers,
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.560]   but there's, I put a few links up,
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.960]   there's a Zane up to Fesky, Glenn Greenwald,
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.600]   a Nick Comfissori from The New York Times,
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.880]   there's been some interesting discussion online
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:43.880]   about journalistic standards with these kinds of leaks
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.960]   and you know, the general journalistic view is,
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.640]   hey, if it's out there, it's all fair game,
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:53.760]   it's journalism, Sony hack, Podesta hack, whatever.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.880]   Let's go mining, let's go find stories, that's what we do.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.400]   But things have changed from the time
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.760]   that that kind of ethic arose.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.600]   One, a hell of a lot more is stored
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.040]   in ways that can be stolen.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.960]   Two, a lot more is stolen at scale.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.400]   Three, there are national agents like North Korea
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.480]   and Russia doing the stealing.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.080]   And so the question I have for you all is,
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.800]   does journalism have a culpability here
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.000]   for creating a demand?
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.600]   Let me explain that real quick.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.240]   So if you're Reuters or the Associated Press
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.280]   and there's a really dangerous war zone,
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.920]   they decide not to buy any freelance material whatsoever
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.160]   'cause they don't wanna create a demand
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.400]   that would send freelance journalists into danger.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:44.400]   They recognize the creation of demand as a responsibility.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:48.240]   So in this case, every time media rams onto this stuff,
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.640]   so for example, Epicurious, the food site
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.400]   used for the Podesta hack or not hack,
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.320]   or the Podesta theft.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.400]   Wait a minute, don't tell me,
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:02.400]   how could Epicurious tips on good risotto
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.600]   from Podesta's emails?
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.680]   - Yeah, yeah, Russia was from.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:26.760]   - So the question was on the
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.600]   - Okay.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:30.120]   Yeah, what else?
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:31.400]   - What do you think they do?
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.280]   - Well, probably was it a speech for Walmart, I would guess,
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.160]   but I'll have to read that for the smoking gun.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:42.960]   Behind closed doors, Hillary Clinton sympathized
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.760]   with Goldman Sachs over reform.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.560]   Okay, that's a bad one.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.680]   I thought Glenn Greenwald wrote an interesting article
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.520]   which we were talking about.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:53.400]   - Goldman Sachs was the gold standard
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.680]   of the finance industry for many, many, many, many years.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.840]   It only became besmirched fairly recent in history,
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:43:59.880]   recently in his story.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.840]   So it creates his kind of demand.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:08.080]   And Zayna Tefesky, who's brilliant, absolutely amazing.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.240]   - I think it's a good question.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.320]   I think it's a very fair question.
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:17.320]   - This causes a problem for people who are dissidents
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:21.120]   with even greater fear that there's a market
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:24.360]   for hacking and theft and exposure,
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.080]   and that innocent people are gonna be brought into this
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.040]   more and more and more and more.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.640]   - Let me ask you, that's a good question.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:34.280]   And then just let me ask you as a professor of journalism
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.320]   about the journalistic ethics,
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:41.320]   is there an ethical behavior when it comes
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:45.080]   to using material gained illegally?
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:48.000]   - The standard has always been,
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.480]   as long as you did not participate
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.440]   in that legal activity to get it, fair game.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:56.440]   So when Gizmodo gets an iPhone that was,
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.200]   let's say stolen, that's okay.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.200]   If they pay for the iPhone,
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.840]   - If they put part in that,
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.400]   in a way that makes you an accessory, right?
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.240]   You're paying for it.
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.080]   - Basically if they caused it,
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.280]   if they caused the theft to happen,
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.920]   they motivated the fact that creates a demand too,
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.720]   but yeah, it's a little bit different.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.160]   - So their first standard is,
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.320]   I mean, 'cause otherwise, Pentagon Papers was illegal,
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.160]   snowed was illegal.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.320]   - Leaks are always illegal.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.760]   - Or not always, but often illegal.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.600]   - They're often illegal,
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.640]   so we can't have that standard that if it's illegal.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.000]   So what Zaina proposes is a standard that says
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.360]   that there's national concern about this,
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.240]   that it's truly a scoop, it's a scandal.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.480]   Is there a scandal line?
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.360]   So in the case of the Sony hack,
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:37.760]   which is another great example,
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.400]   there were all kinds of things that were juicy and fascinating,
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.640]   but that we really didn't have a right to know.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:43.480]   There wasn't a-
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.280]   - That was also, we believe, state-sponsored-
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:49.200]   - It's not gonna do that, but it's kind of laughable.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:53.200]   I mean, I'm on me-marandom, like every day,
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.120]   if not every hour, which is like the political version
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:00.320]   of TechMeeam, and there are publications on there
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.160]   that I've never heard of that, you know,
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.320]   but are known in certain circles,
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.800]   both left-wing and right-wing,
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.920]   and they're gonna publish whatever they want.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:09.760]   So then-
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.600]   - You might be.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.600]   - The New York Times could decide,
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:13.520]   well, we're not gonna publish this
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.480]   because it was in this thing or whatever,
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:16.840]   but that doesn't mean someone else
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.920]   isn't going to pick it up.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:18.760]   - Okay, but-
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:19.680]   - And they're running, that becomes a-
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:21.040]   - That becomes an ultimately-
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.280]   - And ultimately, it will turn into a news story
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:27.120]   if it turns out that it's a big enough thing.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:27.960]   - Okay, so two things about this-
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.960]   - So it's like, hey, I've got a risotto recipe
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.440]   and they hate risotto and they don't get to publish it.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.240]   Maybe nobody really cares, it doesn't pick any legs,
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.120]   but if it does pick up some legs,
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.520]   then that becomes, you know, an issue.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.320]   - Yeah, well, there's two things there.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.400]   - I just don't know that you get to put all that stuff back
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.400]   into the-
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:45.720]   - You don't.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.040]   - You don't.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.040]   - No, but so two things.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.880]   One is there's a Trumpian argument there.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.000]   Well, if everybody else is doing it,
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   then what's not to me from doing it, right?
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.280]   If everybody else has locker room talking
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.720]   about locker room talk too,
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:00.120]   that's the seventh grade kind of argument, I think,
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.360]   that doesn't hold water.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:05.560]   And second that, yes, obscure sites can publish it,
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.640]   but the New York Times unquestionably brings
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:08.800]   a lot more attention to it.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.200]   CNN brings a lot more attention to it.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.120]   They do have a responsibility that line.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.160]   So that's where we go to say the standard.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.400]   If it's a scandal, and one can argue
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.720]   is a scandal for, you know,
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.080]   American government spying on its own citizens
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.400]   without real permission is a scandal.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.440]   And so that deserves to rise up.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:28.440]   So the question is, should responsible news organizations
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.000]   hold themselves to a responsible definition
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.560]   before they choose to join in the revelations
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.400]   that were stolen?
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:40.160]   Let's say you now, Mr. Sullivan.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.800]   - I think the definition should be you cover things
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.080]   that you think have a substantial public interest
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.160]   in being covered.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.200]   - Okay, good.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.040]   Which does not mean risotto recipes?
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.800]   - No, I mean, what do I care about a risotto recipe?
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.360]   But I mean, on the other hand, with Epicurious,
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:00.160]   it's like, if I'm Epicurious, I'm like,
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:03.080]   see, there's a risotto recipe, it's kind of funny.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.240]   - Oh, it is, I know, I know.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.440]   - And it's not that sensitive,
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.880]   it's not like I'm revealing his nude photo,
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.440]   doing risotto or whatever, right?
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.680]   - Well, there should be a standard of the public interest.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:16.880]   - I mean, I'm sure that that's standard,
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.160]   that's part of the standard, right?
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.800]   If the public's need or right to know.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:23.160]   - No, no, no, it's no, the view kind of is that if it's,
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.920]   oh, it's very broadly defined,
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.320]   would somebody be interested in this?
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.480]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.120]   that's not what I mean by public interest.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.560]   - I know, but that's the standard that's being used.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.400]   - Oh, that's too bad.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.240]   - The standard is not being used as,
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.400]   should the public know this?
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.560]   - Yeah, I think that that's the higher--
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.560]   - The standard is the higher--
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.400]   - That's interesting.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.800]   - Yes, see, I would hold it to a higher standard
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.840]   that it has to be something that,
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:45.600]   like the Pentagon Papers, that the public has a need to know
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.320]   or a right to know, because I don't,
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.800]   which I don't think risotto recipes count.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:56.280]   But I think Hillary, any entanglements that Hillary Clinton
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:00.000]   has with political donors absolutely satisfy that standard.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.280]   But then there's the additional--
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.160]   - No, if, well, just throw it out here.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.200]   If you have the Russian government enabling the--
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.800]   - Okay, that's what I'm about to throw in.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.520]   - That's what I'm about to throw in.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.440]   That's what I'm about to throw in.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.000]   Then there's the additional calculus that you have to make
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.520]   is this a foreign government trying to impact our election.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:23.240]   But I don't think that that's the responsibility,
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:26.920]   let's say of the intercept, to make that decision.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.920]   I don't think, I think the provenance--
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:29.920]   - But they're being in the end.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.480]   - You're saying they should consider
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.680]   the provenance of the information,
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.960]   not the legality, but the provenance of the information
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:39.360]   where who got it and what their intent was--
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.360]   - That's what I'm asking.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:41.560]   I don't think they should consider that.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.560]   I think they need to look at the information.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.520]   - If you go back to Epicurious, the reason
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.840]   that they are running that article
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:48.880]   had nothing to do with a public interest thing,
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.600]   it had everything to do with SEO,
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:51.440]   and can I get a lot of traffic?
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.280]   - Of course.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:55.360]   - The headline is, "Wicki Leaks October Surprise."
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.080]   So someone-- - For so many recipes.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.520]   - And then it's colon, you can't rush for Zoto.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.400]   So there's someone going,
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.720]   "Hey, there's a lot of people interested
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:03.640]   "in Wicki Leaks in this October surprise,
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.960]   "probably trending on Google.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.320]   "How can we tap into it?
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.720]   "Let's go ahead and do this."
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.800]   Right?
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.840]   And it's cute and it's clever that they found it or whatever,
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.720]   and they come up with it or whatever, but you know,
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.640]   all that was designed to do with--
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.760]   - Yeah, that's fine.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.960]   I think that that's, yeah.
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.680]   But I think there is this larger question of whether,
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.840]   let's say the intercept or the Washington Post
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.360]   should consider not merely the legality.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.480]   We've settled that.
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.040]   That's not an issue.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.480]   The provenance, who got it, and then the intent--
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.320]   - Why?
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.680]   - And then the intent of the,
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.760]   and I think they do not need to.
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:44.760]   If they can verify that the material is real,
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:48.120]   that would be important because there's some concern
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.200]   that maybe the Russia, they did not, I don't think so,
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.440]   but there's some concern that the Russians might have modified
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:55.880]   this and apparently they did not.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.320]   Wicki Leaks, by the way, says,
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:01.400]   "No, that's one of the things we want to be very clear about."
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.160]   - I'm not exactly trusted.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.200]   - Assange apparently has an agenda too, but okay.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.080]   But I don't think that the intercept
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:09.840]   of the Washington Post should consider the agenda
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.120]   or the provenance of material
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.040]   if they're not the consent of the legality of it.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.120]   - There'd be, there'd be a minute to wait here.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:14.960]   - So what?
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.960]   - If the information is what matters--
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:19.000]   - There's one side, not the other.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:19.840]   - No, but it doesn't matter.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:22.000]   The information is what matters.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.600]   And if somebody handed you something incriminating
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.440]   about a presidential candidate,
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:31.560]   if you're not gonna consider whether NBC
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:34.520]   or the Washington Post had a secret agenda
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:37.960]   revealing the Billy Bush, Donald Trump tape,
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.800]   you're gonna consider the content of the tape
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.800]   and it's import for the American people,
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.200]   for your readership.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.040]   That's what's important.
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.160]   - I think you're gonna,
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.440]   I think you're also gonna look at things overall.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.520]   If you have somebody who decides every single day
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.000]   they're going to do a press conference
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.480]   and there really is nothing new
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.160]   in that press conference other than,
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.800]   hey, every time I do a press conference
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.240]   you guys will come cover it.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.040]   At some point, if you're a news organization,
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:02.120]   you might just say, you know what?
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.560]   It doesn't matter what the content
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.320]   of the individual press conferences
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.880]   we think were being played.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.720]   So we're just not gonna come in the press conference.
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.120]   - We have to find the press humer of Senator New York.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:12.800]   Every Saturday or every Sunday he holds a press conference
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.720]   and dutifully the TV stations come out.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:19.040]   - Well, I would say, I would say here's the standard is,
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:22.800]   is the information of interest of import to our audience.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.800]   If it is, then if it's every Saturday, it's every Saturday.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.960]   But the standard it has to rise to is this has to be important.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.560]   I don't think you should,
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.800]   here's one of the reasons I don't think you should consider intent.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.800]   It's so hard to measure intent.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.720]   That is a really difficult thing to know.
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.720]   That's why we have a criminal justice system
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.280]   and advocacy and juries because intent
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.080]   is very difficult to determine.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.040]   - Measure intent all the time as a journalist.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.320]   I get press releases that are sent to me
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.880]   where you can tell they're just sending you
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:51.720]   out of press releases.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.160]   - Yeah, but if there were information there
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.680]   that was of interest and important, no, no,
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.120]   but that's what I'm saying is all you should,
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:59.120]   all you should need to do is say,
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.640]   is there information that my audience should or needs
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.320]   or no to no, not wants necessarily,
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.480]   but needs to know and it doesn't matter
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.800]   then how it came to you.
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.080]   - Well, but there's, I hesitate to use this work
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.080]   'cause it's misused all the time of balance
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.760]   and I don't mean balance in terms of false balance,
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:16.120]   but there is a point at which all the leaks
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.880]   are aimed to destroy one side
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.960]   and we end up playing along with that.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:23.320]   And in the end, is there an informed public?
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.680]   Becomes a standard too.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.840]   And the public is hyperinformed about that guy's bad stuff,
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:29.840]   but not at all informed about that guy's bad stuff.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:31.560]   What we also know is that we can't get a hold of
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.080]   'cause the Russians didn't leak it,
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.600]   the North Koreans didn't leak it,
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:35.480]   then we're doing it in power.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:37.040]   - And you should re-double your efforts
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.520]   to find that other stuff.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:39.920]   - Fine, easy to say.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:40.760]   - Well, wait a minute,
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:42.560]   you're saying that if there's a smoking gun
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.400]   in those documents, if Hillary Clinton said,
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.400]   "If a thank you for your $100,000,
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.680]   "I'm gonna make sure that your interests
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.480]   "are protected by me in the White House."
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.480]   - The standard is very hot.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.440]   - That would be, and you wouldn't release that?
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:55.520]   - The standard is very, very hot, no.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.800]   - The standard is that high of true scandal, yes.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:58.680]   That is passed.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.080]   It's this layer below, this is,
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.040]   well, that would be of interest, yes,
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.800]   I should know that, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.800]   - Well, admittedly, those are judgment calls at that point.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.840]   - You could be in scandal and risotto.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.080]   - Yeah, somewhere between scandal and risotto.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.480]   - And there's a line somewhere.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.200]   - Yeah, but I think the line should be judged
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.520]   by its importance, not by its provenance
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.200]   or the intent of the provider.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.320]   That's my only point.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.080]   - I just think it can be a factor.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:23.080]   - Well, I mean it, no, and then what you do,
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.280]   and what you do is you do a sidebar that says,
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.480]   "By the way, this material came to us, we believe,
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.560]   "and the federal government believes from the Russians
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:34.320]   "who according to this, this, and this have an interest
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.240]   "in the election going in a particular way--
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.960]   - And they just played us like a violin.
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.880]   - And well, you should say that as a sidebar,
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.280]   but it doesn't mean you should sit on the material.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:46.040]   I think you gotta trust the public
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:50.160]   and you cannot sit on material information.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.520]   You cannot, regardless of its source.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.240]   - You know, we're doing a reverse Leo here.
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:59.080]   I believe this one, this one I'm serious about.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:02.240]   - Okay, so usually it's the opposite role playing here.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.080]   - All right.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.600]   - I'm trying to press this question and see where are these--
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:05.440]   - Well, what do you think?
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.680]   Have I made my case?
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.000]   - Yeah, no, no, you have, but it's still troubling
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.600]   because we immediately can cause demand
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:15.160]   that Putin can know how he can play us
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.720]   and anybody who cooperates can play us,
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:22.240]   and we play to a script and we end up being their pawns.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:25.080]   - I mean, to some degree, but to some degree,
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:28.240]   you can go to any number of sites,
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.320]   or even our own sites, it's got a tip, let us know.
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:32.840]   I've read articles on leaks and they're like,
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.440]   if you have secret emails, send them on to us.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.160]   You have journalistic organizations asking,
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.240]   this isn't even new.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.960]   - I acknowledge-- - You find some source
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.080]   to leak you some things.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.960]   Anytime you get these people in Washington
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.720]   that are like a unnamed source, who we cannot name
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.480]   because they weren't able to disclose this,
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.880]   i.e., they weren't supposed to talk about it at all.
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.840]   That's the nature of--
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.120]   - That's a source, that's called a deep throat.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:01.280]   - So, I get what you're saying,
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.880]   I still think the public interest thing
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.280]   is the thing you look at, but--
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.600]   - Right, oh, you weigh all these factors.
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:07.880]   It's not a perfect world, I agree.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:09.400]   - The other factor that occurs today,
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.960]   that's different from 10, 20 years ago,
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.760]   is to state the obvious to a prior audience,
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:17.480]   there's huge amounts more data that is now stored
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:20.600]   and stealable and stolen than was ever possible before.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:26.880]   We didn't have 50, 10 years of emails stored before.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.960]   - Yeah, no technology changes everything.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:30.240]   - Absolutely. - And so,
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.480]   the vulnerable, what part of what Zena's point is, I think,
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:34.880]   that the vulnerability of more and more people,
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.760]   people who wouldn't have been vulnerable for,
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.600]   now anyone who has their email on Yahoo
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:43.240]   could be vulnerable to things being exposed about them.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.320]   And if that person is doing something,
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.320]   that if they are a person at risk for some reason,
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.440]   then they are now at a multiple of risk
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.640]   versus you or me or other people.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.200]   - No, and to answer your original question,
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:59.560]   I think one must be very careful not to incent
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:00.520]   dangerous behavior.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:04.320]   And I think the tech tie in on this has to do
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:09.320]   with the discovery of exploits and flaws in software.
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:12.920]   You've got to be very careful on Apple, for instance,
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.200]   and be very careful not to pay until recently,
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:20.120]   bounties for exploits, because they didn't want to encourage
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:21.880]   people to find exploits, right?
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:26.080]   They wanted to minimize that risk,
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:29.480]   but once there was already this marketplace for exploits,
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:31.840]   Apple had to participate.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.920]   And in fact, the dollar amount now to be paid for exploits
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.560]   has gone up to $2 million in some cases.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:38.600]   They're that valuable.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.920]   If you have a zero day that can unencrypt an iPhone,
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:45.960]   worth $2 million, and the moral hazard there is now,
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:47.720]   you really are getting a lot of people going out
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:49.120]   and looking for these flaws.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.840]   I think on the one hand, that's not a bad thing.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.240]   Since they do, if they do exist, we want to root them out.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:57.280]   The bad thing is that they often don't get given to Apple.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:01.240]   They're given to some state actor to use against dissidents.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.400]   And that's terrifying.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:05.320]   - Good article, by the way.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.920]   - Good article, by the way.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.160]   And then we'll move on because this is,
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:11.760]   but what did you think of Glenn Greenwald's article
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.720]   in the Democratic echo chamber,
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:16.760]   "Inconvenient Truths or Castes, Putin Plots?"
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:19.160]   He's actually being very critical.
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:21.200]   - Yeah, but this is a very complicated story
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:24.360]   because this is also where Kurt, I can wall.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:25.200]   - Kurt, I can wall.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.040]   - I felt gut and bone.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.600]   - Yeah, I feel like those two were just having
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:28.680]   a little fight back and forth.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:29.520]   - Little Tiff.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.360]   - And you did so well.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:31.200]   - I'm not a wall, exactly.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:33.440]   - And I didn't want to read it, but I read it.
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:36.360]   And because I thought it was my duty to read it
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.480]   and understand Glenn's point,
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.560]   and I think Glenn does have a point.
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.160]   - Did you also read "I Can Wold's Peace?"
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.600]   - In response, yes, of course.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.520]   - Well, actually no, I think I can wall actually
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.360]   go first.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.640]   - The first one, yes, I did read.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.200]   That's in fact why I read,
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.400]   I didn't want to read Glenn's peace
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.160]   'cause I liked Kurt's peace so much.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:53.000]   (laughing)
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.440]   I liked Kurt's vision of the world.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.800]   - His first piece had such a confusing headline on it.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.720]   Like I, you know, like going, what, what?
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:58:59.740]   It's like,
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:03.880]   - He says, I am not Sidney Blumenthal, what?
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.720]   - Yeah, all I needed was a thing saying,
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:08.880]   hey, there's saying Sidney Blumenthal says this,
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.520]   but he didn't say it.
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.400]   They're just quoting my story.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.240]   Okay, we're getting back to screw up.
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:17.400]   - He's saying the Russian news agency Sputnik,
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.680]   misinterpreted one of the little Wikibilly emails.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:21.760]   - He got a heads up and all this other speculation
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.840]   that comes in and it seemed like Glenn was coming
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:24.840]   and he's like, well, all this others.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:26.960]   And it's like, can we get back to the main point
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.400]   that was undisputable?
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.320]   You, someone quoted something that was not
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:34.240]   from Sidney Blumenthal that got stated as if it was.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.160]   Let's just clear that up.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.000]   That's all we needed.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.200]   - And Glenn was concerned, I think,
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.520]   about the veracity of Wikiligs being challenged.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:43.800]   And in fact, I can wall wasn't directly doing that.
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:45.480]   So it got, that got all, Danny, you're right.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.520]   It got all then mixed up the whole thing.
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.640]   - Well, he's clearly not happy.
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:53.040]   With a lot of the suggestions that this wasn't like,
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.680]   I think everybody's fairly certain.
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:56.720]   And I think I guess Clinton at one point said yes,
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.720]   these were real emails.
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.360]   But it was this whole let's play it up
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.760]   as if we don't confirm it, then we don't have to acknowledge
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.360]   if they were that or whatever.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.920]   Because you know, you clearly have this bad blood now
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.640]   between Wikiligs and the Clinton campaign.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.000]   Oh, whatever. - Well, that's not new.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.040]   I mean, Assange said months ago, I hate Hillary Clinton
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.360]   and I want to do everything I can to defeat her.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.360]   So that's nothing new at all.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.560]   He sees her as a hawk and a warmonger.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.400]   And...
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:26.120]   - But there are also sort of modified versions
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.680]   of the emails going around as well.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.840]   - Are there? - And I'm not sure,
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.040]   I'm not sure any press by that has done them,
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.760]   but there's definitely variations on a theme
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.400]   being circulated that...
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.440]   - Well... - Snopes is flacking up
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.600]   continuously. - Yeah, well, yeah, exactly.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.000]   Thank God for Snopes and PolitiFact
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.440]   and all these other fact-generators.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.040]   - Right, yeah, but I mean, you might,
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.960]   you may be seeing what's emerging the next thing
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.160]   is like the anti-league.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:52.680]   It's like if you have a leak and then you get the polluted data
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.360]   out there, either deliberately polluted or whatnot,
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:56.800]   then people don't even know what to believe anymore.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.400]   And then suddenly the whole idea that we have leak,
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.800]   you can't even know if you want to trust it.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.960]   - Well, we're really seeing... - I don't know whether this is...
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.640]   Tech news or not, but breaking news
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.080]   is that the CEO of Wells Fargo is resigning.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.480]   - Good. - Good.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.760]   - Rightly so, of course he was castigated by...
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.560]   Who was it that yelled at him?
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.400]   - The God of the Lord. - In the God of the Lord.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.240]   - Yeah, I thought so.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.600]   Elizabeth Warren, God lover, said, "How dare you?"
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.560]   He was of course CEO at Wells Fargo
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:26.200]   when they incented or somehow encouraged their employees
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.760]   to basically steal from their customers
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.760]   by creating fake accounts without their knowledge,
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.800]   things like that.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.960]   - Good, he should...
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.520]   We gotta start seeing some of these guys take the fall
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.520]   for this really reprehensible behavior.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.440]   So few of these...
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.720]   Good, stump.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.160]   You might say he's been stumped.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.320]   - He's been stumped.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.400]   Let's take a break.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:53.320]   Do wanna talk about some other tech stories.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.320]   I'm sure there are some.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.920]   Oh, I know what I wanna talk about.
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:58.080]   Twitter.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.680]   - Oh, that... - Great, great article
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:03.120]   about what's gonna happen to Twitter, I thought.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.720]   - Wow. - I mean, I'll tell you
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.200]   when we come back, how about that?
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.800]   Stay tuned. - Oh, the tease.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.560]   He's just teasing you. - I hope it survives.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.680]   - Really?
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.960]   I hope it dies a miserable death.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.120]   (laughing)
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.840]   So we could talk about that too.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.040]   - We've had that discussion two weeks ago.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.000]   - Oh, I have it every week, it seems.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.440]   No, you know what?
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.760]   I maybe modify my stat, standing on Twitter,
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.560]   but just because it's so fun to read Twitter
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.400]   during this election campaign,
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.360]   it's full of information,
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.240]   but you don't need an account to do that, right?
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.160]   You could just read it,
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:43.520]   and I think maybe that's the best way to consume Twitter.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.440]   If you haven't made an account, don't.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.920]   - Well, we'll look up back to that, 'cause that's hard.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.120]   - Is it? You can't just read the timeline?
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.240]   Oh yeah, 'cause you need to choose
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.400]   who you're gonna follow, don't you?
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.720]   - And that's part of their failure,
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:56.880]   which is why they probably need to just make it
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.560]   so you can consume the news,
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.120]   which might be part of why we're getting the new Explorer tab.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.520]   Breaking news, we can come back up.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.920]   - Stand by for news.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.040]   Hello, Americans, time to talk to you.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.320]   (mimics music)
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.320]   About news.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.240]   So many of you, I know, listen to our shows
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.040]   to learn about products,
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:21.040]   how technology can help you get your job done.
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.560]   Here's one you really gotta check out.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.240]   I'm sure you've heard about Basecamp,
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.480]   everybody knows about Basecamp.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.520]   I love Basecamp.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.640]   I am a huge fan of Basecamp.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.560]   Going back to Jason Freed and David Hanamire Hanson.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:40.560]   David wrote Ruby on Rails to create Basecamp.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.880]   The company was originally 37 signals.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.360]   They renamed the sales to Basecamp.
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.520]   Basecamp is the best way to get teams on the same page
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.760]   to have people working together, communicating together,
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.600]   and they've just done the third iteration,
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.680]   Basecamp 3, taken everything they've learned
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.480]   from, it must be almost a decade now of Basecamp,
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.560]   and put it in the new version that's great.
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.440]   Basecamp, what is it?
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.600]   All right, it's a private, secure space online
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.400]   where teams can stay organized,
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:13.000]   they can discuss everything they need to get a project done.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.680]   It's so much better than email or chat or messaging
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.840]   because you've got all the tools in one spot,
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:24.280]   message boards, file storage, to-dos,
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.240]   chat schedules, automatic check-ins.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.240]   It's all in there.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.520]   It's perfect for internal collaboration,
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.480]   but you know what's great about Basecamp.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:36.720]   You can also invite clients in and control what they can see,
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.000]   so you still have your private space,
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.040]   but clients can see what they need to see
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.200]   on an ongoing project, something you're working on for them,
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.120]   which is really great.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.760]   Over 100,000 companies use it,
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.600]   but I think a million companies should use it.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.160]   That's my goal right now,
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.800]   is to get you and your company to use it
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.680]   at basecamp.com/twit.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.160]   And it says, "Design up for free, Trauma,
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.640]   "can I tell you there are no per user fees?"
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.320]   They don't charge you by the seat.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.640]   You can add as many people as you need
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.960]   inside and out of the company
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:08.440]   without worrying about licenses and seats.
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.040]   Anybody who needs to use it can use it,
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:14.000]   and you don't pay a penny more,
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   and you're gonna love their straightforward,
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.800]   all-inclusive pricing.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.560]   Look at this, $29 a month.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.800]   That's it for internal teams
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.680]   if you wanna use it with clients 79 a month.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:26.520]   That's it!
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:31.600]   No matter how many users, that's it.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.760]   So I'm not talking a big expenditure here,
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.320]   and you can try it without even paying that just to see.
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:42.200]   Last week, 8,757 companies got started with Basecamp 3.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:44.320]   Let's make it 8,758.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:47.320]   This is gonna really change the way you face the workday.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.360]   You could set up your own work notification schedule,
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:53.400]   so notifications, this is, I was talking to Jason Fried.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.320]   I love him.
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.160]   I don't know if you've read his books rework and so forth,
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:59.160]   but he really thinks about how work gets done.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.720]   We were talking about how,
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.680]   the problem is now work is 24/7.
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:04.680]   I said, "I don't want something."
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.000]   He said, "No, you know what?
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.560]   "You set your work hours in Basecamp,
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.760]   "and you can say, 'I'm not working.
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:12.480]   "'Don't bug me until I go to work.'"
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.880]   So you're back and control your projects.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.840]   Makes your workplace calmer,
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.160]   more productive for everyone.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.080]   I love it.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.200]   You're gonna love it too.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.640]   Basecamp.com/twit.
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:26.600]   Make sure you go there so that they know you heard it here,
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:32.160]   and you could try it for free basecamp.com/twit.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.400]   It solves so many problems.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.400]   This was the problem we had.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.640]   When you start out and you're small, it's easy.
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.560]   You got 10 employees, five employees.
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.080]   Everybody can talk to everybody else.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.960]   And then there's a point,
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.840]   I think for us it was around 20 employees,
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.640]   where it does, you suddenly things start to
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:49.480]   been out of control.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.960]   You don't know who's doing what.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.880]   And you need a way to kind of
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.360]   bring it all back in and Basecamp is such a good solution.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.440]   Basecamp.com/twit.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.840]   It'll solve, it'll take the pain
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.760]   out of it for you.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:03.600]   So,
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.960]   Twitter.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:09.240]   Disney's not gonna buy it.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:10.800]   Google's not gonna buy it.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.040]   Apple's not gonna buy it.
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.360]   Increasingly, it doesn't look like Salesforce
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.360]   is gonna buy it.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.200]   You should buy it for the brand.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.960]   (laughs)
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:19.960]   If I could afford it,
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.560]   and actually if the stock price keeps going down,
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:22.560]   maybe I will.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.360]   Who is gonna buy it?
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.720]   I read a great article
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:30.100]   today by a finance guy.
[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:35.100]   And his conclusion was,
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.740]   the reason no big company can buy it
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:42.580]   is because of the evil thing they're gonna have to do
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:43.420]   the minute they get it,
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:46.740]   which is to fire, to recover half a billion dollars
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:50.060]   in your inexpensive, fire a lot of people.
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:53.300]   So it's gonna be a hedge fund guy.
[01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:56.020]   It's gonna be, or an investment group
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:01.300]   that doesn't have a name that can be tarnished
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.980]   because the first thing you're gonna have to do,
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:06.260]   so Twitter makes two billion revenue,
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:07.380]   but is losing money.
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:09.740]   You have to cut the fat
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:11.660]   so that Twitter can make money.
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:12.540]   - Well, that's easy to do.
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:14.180]   You don't have to worry about getting up
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:15.220]   your name tarnished.
[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:17.580]   First of all, you're gonna cut all your salespeople
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:19.740]   'cause if Google bought them,
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:21.060]   you have an existing sales team,
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:23.020]   so you're gonna lose a lot of your salespeople.
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:24.140]   This happened with Microsoft
[01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:26.620]   when they did the whole Yahoo deal.
[01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:29.620]   One way or the other, like salespeople went.
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:32.940]   And no one's gonna cry over the salespeople,
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:35.340]   which is terrible 'cause salespeople keep us all in business,
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:36.300]   so I would be sad.
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:39.340]   But I don't know who they think
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:40.980]   are gonna give them a black eye.
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:43.980]   Plus, companies lay people off all the time
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:45.340]   and it doesn't collapse.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:47.060]   It's like that really if Twitter says--
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:49.180]   - Well, but you don't wanna be Disney,
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:51.060]   you wanna be Disney that bought Twitter
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:55.420]   and then fired 10,000 employees.
[01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:58.220]   - I think Disney, how could Disney have ever had Twitter
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:59.780]   given the brand damage?
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:01.420]   - Yeah, and that's another reason.
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:03.460]   - It just doesn't make it, that never made the slightest.
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.340]   - Google makes sense because Google could really use
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:07.780]   all the data and the signals and that information.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:08.620]   - Facebook makes sense.
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:10.060]   - Facebook, maybe Facebook.
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:12.740]   Facebook's probably got everything that's on Twitter, right?
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:13.580]   - There's an art, no, there's an art,
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.100]   I put up something on the rundown
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:18.220]   that argues that Facebook has complimentary data.
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.260]   - Is Google definitely out of the running?
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:23.900]   - They say they don't want it, but who knows, right?
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:27.780]   - So no one wants Twitter right now, right?
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:29.980]   - Or see how low the price can go now.
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:31.220]   - Well, I think they don't want it that price,
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.220]   that's kind of--
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:38.100]   - Well, yeah, as the stock keeps taking a hit.
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:42.540]   - But I mean, the sales force, well,
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:45.380]   I argue that that could make some sense for sales force.
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:47.980]   - Yeah, but all the shareholders are emailing Mark Benioff
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:50.060]   saying over our dead body.
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.620]   - Yeah, can I explain?
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.860]   - It doesn't make any sense, I don't even understand why
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:56.460]   I mean-- - Yeah, explain how it makes sense, Kevin.
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:59.700]   - It makes sense in that it's a very good channel
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.540]   for companies to talk to their customers.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.300]   And that's the piece, that's the thing that Salesforce
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.140]   already does with it, and they've got some connections there.
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:08.500]   So it's also a great source of, as you say,
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.340]   advertising and marketing materials
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.180]   and things like that as well.
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:14.500]   So there is some correlations with Salesforce's business there,
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.900]   but I'm not sure it's enough for them to spend
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.740]   that much money 'cause they don't actually have that much money,
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:22.060]   they would have to do some kind of rights issue to do it.
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.580]   - John Hempton writing for Bronte Capital,
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:27.580]   Bronte Capital.blogspot.com says,
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:31.900]   "Here's who should buy Twitter, a Wall Street bastard."
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:35.420]   Some Wall Street bastard armed with a lot of debt,
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:37.760]   that bastard will fire a lot of people,
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:41.380]   and that's who needs to buy it
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:43.820]   because they can do what needs to be done,
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:48.140]   which is the really hard stuff of cutting costs.
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:51.100]   Revenue is two and a half billion dollars a year.
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.860]   It could easily run in a quarter of a billion in costs,
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:57.460]   that's what he says, and I think he's probably right.
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:00.260]   He says, "If you can't make this have a 40% operating margin,
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.540]   then you're inadequately brutal."
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:06.860]   So expected to be bought by a Wall Street bastard?
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:09.460]   - Yeah, I totally don't buy into this idea
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.340]   that some big company can't buy them
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:14.460]   because they would have to make heartless layoffs.
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:15.540]   - No, it's the brand-net.
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:16.620]   - Company's just all the time,
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:18.180]   they lay people off all the time.
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:20.700]   - But he says, insufficiently brutal.
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:24.460]   They'd lay off as few people as they thought they needed to.
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:26.500]   - I don't even know that that would be the case.
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:29.460]   And it's also, it's like, if you were Google
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:30.900]   and you were buying Twitter,
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.140]   you might decide that you don't need to lay people off
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:36.060]   because you don't even need to make that much money off of it.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:39.300]   You have a lot of cash coming in from other things.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:40.860]   You might think this is perfectly fine.
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:42.020]   We'd take our time with it.
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:43.540]   - So you think Google's just buying it's time
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.300]   waiting for the stock price to tank?
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.460]   - Sure, I don't know.
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:50.500]   I think Google personally,
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.220]   and I don't have any insight, knowledge on here.
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:54.940]   So, what you could do,
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:57.900]   I just suspect that Google just doesn't really want
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:00.740]   to get messing around with anything social.
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:02.940]   They burnt themselves so badly.
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:04.620]   - Yeah, good way for me.
[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.940]   - Then they go, then we go and get Twitter,
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.820]   which has got problems.
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:11.940]   And then if it doesn't grow,
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:14.340]   despite everything that they do or whatever,
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:17.620]   they're like, "Oh look, Google screwed up in social again."
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:21.100]   And at this point, it's like, in contrast,
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.380]   it would be entertaining perhaps for Google
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:25.300]   to watch Facebook actually put it in a bid
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:26.500]   because then if I were Google,
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.740]   I'd immediately launch an antitrust challenge.
[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:31.820]   Not directly, I'd get someone to do it for me.
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:34.740]   And I'd probably be successful in walking that deal
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:37.860]   and causing Facebook to burn some time and energy on Twitter
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.620]   and it caused Twitter to kind of drop down
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:41.500]   and kind of get messed up with it from there.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.660]   - You think there's some urgency to get this deal done though.
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:48.660]   - Isn't Twitter slowly losing users and cashier?
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:51.460]   - Cashier, they've got lots of money in the bank.
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:53.540]   They haven't got a burn rate that's going to destroy them.
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:57.300]   Their challenge is they gave a metric
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.420]   that was based on growth and they haven't been growing.
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:01.260]   So now they're trying to revise that
[01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:02.540]   and come up with other metrics
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:04.220]   they can persuade Wall Street about,
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:06.020]   which is the point about the live TV stuff.
[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:08.260]   So the fit with Google is around YouTube.
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:11.460]   That was the thing I said last time I discussed it.
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:13.380]   Twitter has been doing gangbusters,
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:16.700]   with live TV, they had millions of viewers of the debates
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:19.300]   and they had huge amounts of traffic there.
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:22.100]   - Something weird goes on now when I go to Twitter.
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:25.180]   For some reason I'm getting Bloomberg technology
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:27.700]   feeds in my ad blockers blocking it.
[01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:29.500]   So I guess it's an ad, right?
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.600]   Why am I getting this live video?
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:35.580]   - It's just video, just enjoy it.
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:37.220]   - But I mean-- - It's a big thing.
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:39.500]   - I mean, I used to happen to be one at the Bloomberg site.
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:40.620]   I hated that.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:42.340]   Now it's happening to me when I go to Twitter.
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:43.180]   Is that just me?
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:44.020]   - I don't know, I'm not saying that.
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.100]   I'm not doing it.
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:46.700]   - Maybe it's just me. - No, it's again.
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:49.100]   - But what do you think of the answer?
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.780]   - No, I'm not clicking anything.
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:52.540]   This is going to Twitter.com.
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:53.380]   - Just go down a bit.
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:54.220]   - Okay.
[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:56.380]   Twitter.com, above the trends,
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.340]   I'm getting live video from Bloomberg.
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:13:59.420]   - Yeah, I don't get that.
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:01.260]   - And a scowling Trump.
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:02.940]   - You must be on a little display.
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:06.620]   You must be on a little test.
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:07.580]   - You're in a test bucket.
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.580]   - Well, I don't like being in this bucket.
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.260]   - But hang on, I'm gonna screenshot that
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.300]   so we can write an article.
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:13.340]   Go back and show me that again.
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:14.460]   - Okay, screenshot that.
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:16.060]   I'll take my mouse out of the picture.
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:16.900]   - Just give me a minute here.
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:18.460]   Give me a minute. - It's a good screenshot.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:20.260]   - Get my sketch going here.
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:22.980]   - Is it gonna come with a sound up Leo or down?
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:25.180]   - Do you hear sound, Carson?
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:26.100]   - Oh, I can hear sound.
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:27.340]   Why is that sketch not going?
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:28.740]   Oh, there we go, here we go.
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:29.580]   Hang on.
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:31.060]   - This is the most annoying thing.
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.620]   I hate it when I go to Bloomberg site,
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:33.460]   but that's enough.
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:35.380]   - It makes you get your profile in there.
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:36.340]   Rogue one's trending.
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:38.060]   Okay, gotcha.
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:39.140]   - Rogue one is trending?
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.620]   - Why is Rogue one trending?
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:42.580]   - Because Steve Kovac is talking about it.
[01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:43.660]   What is Rogue one?
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.380]   - Oh no, oh no, that guy's.
[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:47.100]   What is Rogue one?
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:49.300]   - Is that a Star Wars thing?
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:50.180]   Oh, it's the new movie?
[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:51.020]   - Yeah.
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.180]   - Yeah.
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.340]   - Yeah, oh, so is Danny, yeah.
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:56.180]   - Oh really, I'm a Star Trek guy.
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:57.260]   I don't care about Star Trek.
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:59.420]   So, see, I don't even follow.
[01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:00.420]   - This is good tricks.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.260]   - Okay.
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:04.300]   - So you don't get Bloomberg in your home.
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:07.420]   - Was that Twitter.com or Twitter.com/theillum?
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.420]   - No, no, no, Twitter.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.740]   Well, because I'm logged in.
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:13.900]   Oh my God, quick, get your blaster, Luke.
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:16.260]   - Rogue one's gonna be the new Star Wars thing.
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:18.060]   And they're gonna get the secret plans
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:19.700]   and they're gonna get all the, you know.
[01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:21.980]   - I have a bad feeling about this.
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:24.540]   - Oh, I just, what makes Danny such a pro
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:25.380]   is that he got the headset off.
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:26.380]   - I just got it too.
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:27.220]   - The same time.
[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:28.060]   - What do you get?
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:28.900]   - Mine's on the right.
[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:29.740]   I have it on the right, yeah.
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:30.980]   - You get it too?
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:31.820]   - Yeah.
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:32.660]   - What'd you get?
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:33.500]   - Bloomberg.
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:34.340]   - I have it on the right.
[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:35.900]   - I want it.
[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:36.900]   - I just, I'm first in the app.
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:38.180]   - I don't care about trends.
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:39.780]   - I wish that it's running out of time.
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:41.500]   - I'm not Twitter.com/
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.900]   - It's my front page because it's my feed.
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:44.740]   I'm logged in.
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.300]   - I have it now.
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.860]   - We all have it.
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:48.940]   - It's a flight to the face.
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:49.780]   - It's a flight to the face.
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:50.620]   - Breaking news.
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:53.780]   - Now if it were Rogue one, I wouldn't mind, but I don't.
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:54.940]   - My video.
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:57.020]   Let me just, you know.
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.620]   - Is this, this isn't on TV.
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:15:59.780]   Is this Bloomberg technology?
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:02.100]   This is an internet stream that they do?
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:02.940]   - Yeah.
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:05.820]   But Bloomberg was doing the debates for them as well.
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:07.300]   That was, they were doing that as a partnership
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:08.140]   with Bloomberg.
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:08.980]   - This is like a list of--
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:10.620]   - This is gonna happen on your Facebook page.
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:13.380]   I guarantee they're gonna promote video on everybody's home page.
[01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:14.860]   And I hope they get rid of that stupid trending
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:15.860]   that doesn't work.
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:18.020]   And they're gonna promote video on a bit.
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:18.860]   It's gonna be a lot of video.
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:19.700]   - It's not anything.
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:20.540]   - So.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:22.460]   - Ah, it's auto starting.
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:25.140]   I don't know if it's auto, if it's auto playing the audio.
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:26.860]   That would be really bad.
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:27.940]   - It's not playing the audio.
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:28.780]   - Good.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.620]   - Oh, it's not.
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:32.420]   Even if I mouse over, usually if you mouse,
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:35.180]   if it's not auto play audio, but I mouse over,
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:37.180]   it's giving me a watch button.
[01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:38.020]   - Yeah.
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:40.460]   - So all it is is just basically a moving ad
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:42.700]   that if I push it, push the watch button,
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:44.660]   I'll get audio, I would presume.
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:46.580]   - Okay, so when you hit the watch button,
[01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:47.860]   it does open up in a new window
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:49.700]   and the audio is on, of course.
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:50.540]   - Yeah.
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:53.940]   - Whether or not these things are running--
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:57.100]   - I'm materially an ad to them.
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:57.940]   - Goodbye.
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:01.180]   - But yeah, what if it was us and what was that?
[01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:02.020]   - What was that?
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:03.020]   - I would never do that.
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:04.580]   I would never do that to anybody.
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:05.980]   That's horrible.
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:06.820]   - How am I?
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:08.580]   - Well, no, 'cause I'm getting good at my video.
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.820]   - They did this, they did this with the Monday night,
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:13.580]   Thursday night football, they did this with the debates.
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:15.180]   They put a little thing in the feed and said,
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:16.980]   the debates are starting now, do you wanna watch it?
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:19.540]   - You got peanut butter in my Twitter feed.
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:20.700]   - No, this is exactly what I was talking about.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:22.580]   So I'm saying Twitter's doing a play
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.260]   for live video with commentary.
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:25.740]   And they've done it with the event they start.
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:26.660]   - Oh, all right.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:28.220]   But see, I usually do it myself.
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:30.540]   I'll have the debate on the TV and I'll run tweet deck
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:34.740]   'cause Twitter doesn't, unaccountably does not live scroll,
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:35.940]   but tweet deck does.
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:38.340]   And I'll just sit there and watch it scroll through.
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:41.980]   - But the version that they have in the app
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:45.380]   shows you the debate and the hashtag that goes with it.
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:47.420]   So the hashtag is going by, which is,
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:48.900]   I'll give you the best news, but I'd like to be able
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:51.060]   to see the people that I'm following,
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:53.700]   but I can see how that makes sense as a tool
[01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:55.500]   for people who aren't using Twitter much.
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.380]   - So Danny, what's your scoop?
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:00.380]   There's a new Twitter feature coming?
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:02.460]   - Oh, they're doing something.
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:04.660]   Hey, tech meme, it was like not my scoop,
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:06.820]   just the scoop I saw that they're not--
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:09.740]   - New given Gabe Rivera two plugs in this episode.
[01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:10.580]   You know what I mean?
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:11.420]   - That's a good place to read news.
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:14.820]   - I know, that's my first page I start on every single--
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:17.620]   - But you know what, I mean, people know tech meme,
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.300]   but I love--
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:20.420]   - Me, me, or random.
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:21.260]   - Yeah.
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:22.220]   - And I don't think anybody knows it.
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:24.980]   And every time I'm like, Gabe, it's like elections again.
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:26.780]   You gotta do something more with this, it's awesome.
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:31.780]   It wraps up all, and you get news content from mainstream.
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:35.980]   I get news content from far right sites that freak me out,
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:39.260]   but I like, I at least have feel like I understand
[01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:41.140]   what's going on, like you're like, oh my God,
[01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:42.540]   you really believe that?
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:43.820]   Okay, but at least, and then you get them
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:45.940]   on the other side too, so it's interesting.
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:49.460]   Anyway, they're testing an Explore tab according to Mashable.
[01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:55.220]   Where on mobile, that would be in place of the Moments tab,
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.820]   where they're gonna try to let you explore
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:58.100]   different things that are happening.
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:58.940]   I don't have--
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:01.100]   - I thought I already got that, that sounds familiar.
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.700]   - I don't think I have it, I think I just--
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:03.860]   - Is that my highlights?
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:05.140]   This is like the third thing,
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:06.500]   'cause I get highlights, but I think they're saying--
[01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:09.140]   - They're so many different things they have these days,
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:10.420]   it's just lots of things.
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:11.260]   - Oh, no, I saw them.
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:13.140]   - Although I was very impressed,
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:14.940]   and I tweeted this yesterday, I was surprised
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:17.620]   the amount of attention it got relatively for me,
[01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:21.020]   but we were sitting there at home, as we do,
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:22.460]   and my son said something like,
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:25.420]   "Oh yeah, I saw this thing on Twitter Moments."
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:28.300]   And I'm like, "You saw something on Twitter Moments?"
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.260]   Like, you used Twitter Moments, and he said,
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:32.380]   "Yeah," and he's like, "I use it all the time,
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:34.140]   "and yeah, my friends look at it," so I was like,
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:35.140]   "Oh."
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:36.540]   So maybe they've been successful
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:38.900]   in getting that new stuff pushed out there.
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:41.700]   - Well, this is a good time to be doing that, right?
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:42.780]   - Well, it's a highlight.
[01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:43.620]   - So it's a highlight.
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:44.460]   - It's a highlight.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:45.740]   - You don't get that on the website or on the--
[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:46.580]   - It's a highlight.
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:47.940]   - I don't have highlights.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:50.980]   - I used to subscribe to highlights for children
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:52.140]   when I was young.
[01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:55.340]   - Wait, you're talking about it?
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:57.700]   Have you guys, you guys have seen this, right?
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:59.340]   - No, I don't remember it.
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:01.100]   It's very bright and shiny.
[01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:01.940]   - Yeah, hang on.
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:05.020]   - You really need to clean your screen.
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:05.860]   - Yes, gross.
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:07.860]   (laughing)
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:10.300]   No, I think it's like, it looks like acid.
[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:11.620]   - That, you're in a test.
[01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:13.420]   You're in a test pattern, does something tell you?
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:14.780]   - Yeah, no one's gonna say this has been here for a while,
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:16.700]   but I think of this ship to an Android first.
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:17.540]   - Maybe that's it.
[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:19.460]   Yeah, I'll see it on iOS.
[01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:20.580]   - 'Cause it's--
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.300]   - Okay, so I'm gonna grant you,
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:24.620]   I have to revise a little bit my--
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.580]   - It's kind of like moments, but it's things--
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:27.420]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.260]   - It's a good thing to roll it out.
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:30.540]   - There's some valuable things.
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:32.780]   I think Twitter is, you know, I mean,
[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:36.640]   especially in terms of news, and I guess in football,
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:40.500]   they're making some progress here.
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:44.100]   Maybe they should just give up trying to sell.
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:44.940]   - You think you're gonna sell--
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.620]   - Well, I think the problem is they got a value
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:52.060]   that was, we are also like Facebook, and they're not.
[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:53.620]   - Yeah, so something else.
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:54.460]   - They're not gonna be.
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:56.460]   They could be a good little business,
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:21:00.220]   and there's a lot of great stuff to love about them,
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:03.940]   but if you've got investors that just expect a lot more,
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:04.780]   that's tough.
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:06.060]   - Here it is, highlights.
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:06.900]   - They're going public.
[01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:08.820]   - The most interesting content from Twitter,
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:10.220]   tailored for you.
[01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:11.060]   - Yeah.
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:12.460]   - Yeah, popular conversations, tweets,
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:14.100]   how do I get highlights?
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:14.940]   - So only on Android.
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:16.260]   - You're calling only on Android.
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:18.140]   - I'm not hallucinating, okay.
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.180]   - Tap the navigation menu icon, the hamburger,
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:22.580]   or your profile icon.
[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:24.580]   Tap notifications, mobile notifications,
[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:27.260]   and there's a checkbox next to highlights.
[01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:28.300]   - Oh, there's a little,
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.140]   a little light.
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.860]   - It's a new Rogue One poster.
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:32.100]   So it's got all this.
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:32.940]   (laughing)
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:35.380]   (humming)
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.220]   - But highlights--
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:37.220]   - There's five--
[01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:38.900]   - It's been highlights and moments.
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:40.580]   It's highlights is based on who you follow.
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:41.420]   - This looks good, I like it.
[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:42.340]   - It's global.
[01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:43.180]   - Yeah.
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:44.000]   - You know what?
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.260]   - Well, reuse it for a bit, you won't.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:46.740]   (laughing)
[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.060]   - Orange, it's not the only one.
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:48.900]   - It's not the only one.
[01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:49.740]   - You already know it.
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:51.580]   - Well, no, but if Leo is not going to Twitter much,
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:52.500]   then he will actually like it.
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:53.420]   It's another one of these things
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:55.060]   that makes sense if you don't use Twitter much.
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:55.900]   - Yeah, right.
[01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:58.980]   It'll be like, it's like almost here's what you've missed.
[01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.100]   - Yes, it's like, here's what you've missed,
[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:01.100]   but slightly different,
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:02.420]   but there's more moments like presentation.
[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:03.460]   - Yeah.
[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:04.860]   - They also let you create moments now.
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:05.700]   You saw that, right?
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:06.900]   That was last week or week before.
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:08.580]   - I can make my own moments.
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.580]   - Yes, if you go to the website, you know the moments
[01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:12.860]   on the website, there's a, on the right hand side,
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:15.100]   there's a make moment button and you can add tweets to it.
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:17.340]   - I was gonna do that and then I couldn't get it going
[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:18.460]   'cause they didn't make it.
[01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:20.060]   Is that working now?
[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:20.980]   - Yeah.
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:21.900]   I made it, I made it.
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:22.740]   - I wanted to make it on the other side.
[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:23.580]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:24.740]   I see it, you can now create moments.
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:25.620]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, but now I don't care.
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:27.940]   - So is this like track?
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:28.780]   - I don't care.
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:29.900]   - Is this, have they finally brought back track
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:30.900]   eight years after they've done really?
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:31.940]   - No, it's not track.
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:33.220]   Basically it's curated.
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:35.380]   So it's basically a collection post.
[01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:39.260]   You go there and then you put a bunch of tweets into it
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:42.060]   to create a collection of tweets that makes sense to you.
[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:47.580]   And then you publish the moment and then it says,
[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:49.500]   oh, can you give us some phone shape crops
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.500]   of the photos in it and I'm like, really?
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.220]   - And then who sees it?
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:56.260]   - And then it's, it tells you to share it with a link.
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:57.420]   You've got a permanent to it.
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:58.260]   - Okay.
[01:22:58.260 --> 01:22:59.540]   - And it shows up in the moments page
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:00.540]   for people who follow you.
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:04.380]   - Ah, maybe I should make some twit moments.
[01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:06.380]   - I was very excited about it when I was a female.
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:07.700]   - You can do a show moment.
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:08.540]   Yeah, when you publish the show,
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:11.220]   you can make a moment of the show with the links
[01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:13.060]   and the tweets and the things that were in it.
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:13.900]   Yeah.
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.580]   So it's a way to, so it starts to make more sense
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:19.060]   because the moment is only being made by them was a bit weird.
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:22.100]   And this was a tool I think they gave to some content partners.
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:25.140]   So yeah, you get ones that are credited to NFL and things.
[01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:26.940]   So now you can make your own as well.
[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:31.340]   So it's, you know, as I say,
[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:33.940]   they're clearly rethinking themselves as a media company
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:34.980]   and not as a social company.
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:36.500]   And that's, they've been saying that for a while,
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:39.580]   but they're actually starting to deploy things that add to that.
[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:42.580]   And that's the piece that would make sense for Google,
[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:44.460]   particularly in combination with YouTube.
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:49.180]   Because YouTube, you know, the live YouTube experience is there,
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:51.820]   but there's the commentary stuff is not strong
[01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:55.100]   whereas Twitter's live commentary on real things is very strong.
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:59.140]   And it's a piece that basically Google had bits of this in reader.
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:01.940]   The real debacle of reader was them saying,
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:03.580]   oh, there weren't enough users for this.
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:06.140]   But they didn't realize that the users they had
[01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:07.500]   were all the people who published news.
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.940]   It was everyone Jeff knows was using reader
[01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:12.700]   because the journalists were using it to gather stories
[01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:14.580]   and share stuff back and forth.
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:17.140]   And that's the piece that Twitter rebuilt
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:20.380]   with some very good work by the media team there,
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:22.660]   making sure that everyone who was in media was on Twitter,
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:24.380]   was verified, was part of the conversation
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:26.620]   that was having their conversation inside Twitter.
[01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:29.660]   And that, and also make it easy to break Twitter
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:30.900]   into new stories, things like that.
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:33.860]   And that's what we're seeing in the election.
[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:37.220]   Twitter is in the news cycle every day and is part of it.
[01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:40.260]   And that's a piece that Google has sort of--
[01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:42.620]   they had bits of it with reader, they had bits of it with news,
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:45.020]   but they never quite got the two together into a thing
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:46.020]   you can share well.
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:47.020]   So if I was--
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:51.580]   you know, it would make sense to put them in Google
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:54.300]   or maybe alphabet, but Google makes--
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:57.540]   because then they could be wired up with YouTube.
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:24:59.740]   But the question would be the turf war
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:02.980]   of who gets to own it and run it and make it work inside Google.
[01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:06.540]   All the issues that Twitter has since its IPO,
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:10.980]   Snapchat is now about to move into the same position.
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:16.820]   It would be probably the largest social media IPO since Twitter.
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:19.900]   They've picked Morgan Stanley Goldman to lead the IPO.
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:23.620]   That means they're moving ahead.
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:27.340]   As soon as March, according to some sources, again, these are all--
[01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:28.940]   It's the same woman from Bloomberg.
[01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:29.740]   Yeah, back.
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:33.100]   I can't get away from her.
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:34.220]   This is Bloomberg now.
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:35.300]   I'm on the Bloomberg site.
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:37.380]   I'm getting the same video feed.
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:40.940]   Snapchat has changed its name to Snap, which is Snapier.
[01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:42.100]   If you go to Twitter, log down.
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:44.220]   It's even bigger.
[01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:46.660]   I just went to an incognito window, and it's like--
[01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:47.660]   It's two thirds of my--
[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:49.140]   This is the problem I have with Twitter.
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:50.620]   You can try to change the subject,
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:53.860]   but Twitter still sneaks into the subject.
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:58.380]   People give-- you people, you tech no literate didgerati,
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:00.500]   give Twitter way more importance than it ought to have
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.740]   in the general culture.
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.300]   And also, I think you can make the argument.
[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:06.100]   It's had a kind of a baleful influence
[01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:10.940]   on the political dialogue of late.
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:14.460]   Amazon has launched a service for you, Echo owners,
[01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:17.580]   a streaming service called Music Unlimited that has--
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:20.660]   they're not saying, but it sounds like close to the same number
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:26.860]   of tracks as all the others, Spotify and Google music
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:29.420]   and Apple music.
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:32.500]   But it's got a better price if you're a prime member $8 a month,
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:37.060]   $79 a year, $10, the usual $10 for non prime members.
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:43.140]   And if you don't mind having it on only one Echo, $4 a month.
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:44.900]   So if you have an Echo in the house
[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:47.900]   that's connected to your stereo, and all you care about
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:50.940]   is having a great unlimited selection of music on your stereo,
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:54.820]   that's a very good deal, $4 a month.
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:58.740]   Amazon is not resting on its Echo.
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:02.260]   They are beefing it up.
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:04.540]   Washington Post tracked Facebook's trending topics
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:10.700]   and uncovered over the last three weeks, five fake stories.
[01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:11.780]   Just kill trending.
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:13.420]   It is the worst face of the future.
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:17.940]   And three undeniably or profoundly inaccurate ones.
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:19.580]   OK, who cares?
[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:21.220]   Oh, here's a big one for people who
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:22.420]   are interested in the Pixel.
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:23.780]   Remember, Ronamadio's story.
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:28.820]   Under no circumstances should you buy your Pixel from Verizon?
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:33.460]   The update is Verizon says, "Pixels will get updates."
[01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:36.940]   Even if you bought them from Verizon at the same time as Google's,
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:38.180]   they won't stand in the way.
[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:40.580]   And Google confirms, yes.
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:42.140]   Yeah, I'll believe that when I see it.
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:43.060]   Really?
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:47.300]   So you would say, don't get your Pixel from Verizon as well.
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:48.260]   No.
[01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:49.900]   Jeff, you left Verizon, right.
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:51.300]   Is there still a Verizon?
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:52.740]   No, no, no, no.
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:53.740]   You're long gone.
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:54.460]   OK.
[01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:56.340]   Yeah, I'm not going to buy Verizon files to be crazy.
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:57.500]   I love that, but Verizon--
[01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:01.860]   Well, still probably should get your Pixel on locked, right?
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:02.860]   Not Verizon.
[01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:05.100]   But you still think I should just return it?
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:08.420]   What advantage would you have in buying through Verizon?
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:10.460]   Right.
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:11.980]   Right, good point.
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:14.580]   What does it-- do they have to do a different version?
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:16.180]   Or are they a multi-band now?
[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:17.460]   I think they're all multi-band.
[01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:17.940]   I don't know.
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:20.100]   But the real concern was initially that Verizon
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:23.540]   would be a gatekeeper to Google's updates, which, of course,
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:24.500]   you don't want.
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:27.140]   If you buy a Pixel, just the same reason
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:30.460]   as you bought the Nexus because you want the updates promptly.
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:32.220]   Here's a good one from the New York Times.
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.580]   Facebook's voter registration reminder
[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:38.580]   that it's plated for a mere four days in September
[01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:41.700]   contributed to substantial increases in online voter
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:43.540]   registration across the country.
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:44.660]   At least nine secretaries of state--
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:45.460]   Look at the graphic.
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:46.420]   It's great.
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:51.300]   Have said that four days made a huge difference.
[01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:51.820]   So there's--
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:53.380]   Now, of course, some will argue and complain,
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:55.820]   oh, they're having an impact on the election we have.
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:56.820]   Wow.
[01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:59.340]   But just simply saying, registering more people
[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:00.060]   is a good thing.
[01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:05.620]   This is the Facebook bump in Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon,
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:06.300]   Pennsylvania.
[01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:08.700]   It's across the board.
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:10.020]   Big difference overall.
[01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:14.700]   And, of course, as the Times points out,
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:17.380]   it's notable not just for boosting voter registration,
[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:20.340]   but maybe for the kinds of voters.
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:23.780]   Facebook did not provide demographic breakdowns,
[01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:28.180]   but it is more popular among females and males, younger,
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:29.820]   more than older.
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:31.820]   Is that still true?
[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:34.460]   I feel like it's all old folks in Facebook.
[01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:37.420]   If Snapchat did it, it would be for sure younger.
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:39.700]   And skewed probably towards the females.
[01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:42.300]   I got to say, as you know, I spent the last few weekends
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:43.860]   in Pennsylvania, registering people.
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:46.460]   And it's terribly inefficient.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:47.940]   One day, I spent three hours there.
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:48.860]   I got three registrants.
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:50.900]   Wow.
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:53.900]   But yet, it's so gratifying when--
[01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:57.900]   it almost always was Latino who would say, oh, good.
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:59.020]   I can register for winning the register.
[01:29:59.020 --> 01:29:59.300]   Thank you.
[01:29:59.300 --> 01:29:59.900]   I can register.
[01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:01.940]   And the excitement they had, it was great.
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:02.380]   It was great.
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.420]   I had two people who moved from Puerto Rico
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:06.620]   or were citizens who could now vote and it mattered.
[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:08.100]   And they were terribly excited.
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:09.660]   They could vote in Puerto Rico, too.
[01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:10.820]   I hate to tell you.
[01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:13.060]   But not in a way that's going to have the impact
[01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:14.500]   it will participate in.
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.460]   No, and that's why I'm moving to Pennsylvania
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:18.980]   because it doesn't matter who I vote for in California.
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:20.900]   No.
[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:22.380]   But I'm still voting.
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:23.860]   Dang it.
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:24.820]   That's right.
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:27.660]   Roarbacher is going to defend my right to have Donald Trump
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:28.980]   be my candidate forever.
[01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:29.940]   What state are you in?
[01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:32.380]   You're in Pennsylvania?
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:33.380]   Who me?
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:34.260]   I'm in Orange County.
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:34.780]   Oh, that's right.
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:35.340]   He's in Orange County.
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:38.100]   You're a day in a Roarbacher, of course I should have known.
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:39.180]   Yeah.
[01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:41.540]   Is he up for election?
[01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:42.260]   Roarbacher?
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:43.300]   Yeah.
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:44.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:46.540]   He's going to win because Orange County.
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:48.380]   The state of the opposition in Orange County
[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:51.380]   is such that the opposing candidate
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:55.300]   did not even have a statement in the official booklet.
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:55.740]   You don't even--
[01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:58.300]   Mike didn't even bother to file it.
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:30:59.900]   I don't even worry about it.
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:02.180]   Like, yeah, whatever.
[01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:03.660]   That's going to change, young man.
[01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:06.140]   I just saw an article that says, Santa Ana.
[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:09.140]   Was it Santa Ana is all Latino in the city council?
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:10.260]   Oh, it'll change.
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:11.580]   A Latino majority.
[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:14.140]   We're like, there's a little coastal enclave that just
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:15.220]   hangs in there at the Republican.
[01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:15.580]   I know.
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:16.340]   I was in Irvine.
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:17.100]   I couldn't believe it.
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:18.820]   It's like, wow.
[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:20.900]   If you're kind of Irvine, you've got to tell me
[01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:22.380]   you've got to come out to Newport Beach.
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:23.540]   I actually was in Newport Beach.
[01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:28.060]   I was staying at the whatever they call that ridiculous tower
[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:29.540]   in the sky there.
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:31.540]   Leo, come by.
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:32.980]   What is the name of that thing?
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:34.180]   It was a couple of months ago.
[01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:34.700]   It was fun.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.140]   I didn't realize you were there.
[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:36.820]   You know, who else is there?
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:37.940]   Steve gives us an Irvine.
[01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:39.540]   Didn't see him either.
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:40.540]   Yeah.
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:42.340]   I can't recall any.
[01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:47.340]   In Connecticut, in three days, in three days in Connecticut,
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:52.860]   because of this Facebook campaign, 14,883 people registered
[01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:56.780]   a 12-fold increase over the week before.
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:59.020]   And how many people--
[01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:02.420]   Tiki, Michigan, every 27, I think, right?
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:03.340]   The mid-a-difference.
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:04.580]   It's amazing.
[01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:05.340]   12,000.
[01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:15.260]   Pandora is also doing its music service Pandora Plus.
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:17.420]   And they've unveiled a new company, Logo.
[01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:17.780]   Wow.
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:19.660]   I hope they didn't spend too much money on that.
[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:25.700]   Did somebody get their fingerprints on it,
[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:26.500]   or the logo, or--
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.140]   Kind of looks like finger painting.
[01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:31.580]   Yeah, potato cutouts.
[01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:32.100]   Oh, that's it.
[01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:34.260]   They did it with a potato.
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:34.700]   You're right.
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:35.660]   It's potato prints.
[01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:38.900]   No, that's not it.
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:39.740]   I'm sorry.
[01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:40.380]   That fooled me.
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:42.060]   TechCrunch stopped that.
[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:43.580]   Along with new company, Logo TechCrunch
[01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:45.860]   did its own potato illustration, but that's actually
[01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:47.580]   the new logo.
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:51.300]   The new service will be $4.99 a month, but it's--
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:51.580]   Whoa, wait.
[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:54.020]   No, Pandora Plus--
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:55.420]   Oh, I'm confused.
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:58.060]   Pandora 1 has always been around.
[01:32:58.060 --> 01:32:59.940]   I don't know.
[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:01.300]   I don't get Pandora.
[01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:03.660]   Can you just play whatever you want, or is it still that
[01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:04.540]   case where--
[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:05.140]   No, you can't.
[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:07.260]   And you have a limited skips and all that.
[01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:08.340]   Yeah.
[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:11.380]   Yeah, I just-- why wouldn't you just use Spotify?
[01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:14.220]   Everybody has a radio style product now.
[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:16.900]   I know, but with Pandora, I kind of gave up
[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:18.820]   because I'd want to hear a particular song,
[01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:20.940]   but they weren't allowed to play you that song.
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:24.540]   With Pandora Plus, there's no ads.
[01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:26.340]   You could skip more songs, more replays,
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:27.700]   and they have offline listening.
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:29.020]   So it's a little bit--
[01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:30.460]   I'll just use Spotify.
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:31.420]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:32.380]   For me.
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:33.100]   I actually--
[01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:35.260]   All the echo thing is good, because although the echo thing
[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:38.540]   is good, because you can-- you know, you ask it for a song.
[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:41.100]   And if you're a prime member, you get the song sometimes.
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:43.020]   But then sometimes it doesn't have it.
[01:33:43.020 --> 01:33:43.540]   But--
[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:45.620]   So I quit Spotify for Amazon.
[01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:47.580]   I'm going to use the Amazon instead.
[01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:48.340]   Yeah, well, you can hook.
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:50.340]   But you can hook Spotify up into the echo.
[01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:52.060]   But the thing is, then you have to go--
[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:53.620]   You have to say on Spotify.
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:54.100]   On Alexa.
[01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:54.700]   Right.
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:55.940]   Turn on my lights.
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:56.420]   Right.
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:57.060]   I wonder if my lights went on.
[01:33:57.060 --> 01:33:58.340]   Sorry, no.
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:33:59.060]   You have to go on--
[01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:01.220]   Don't say the A word.
[01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:01.780]   Alexa.
[01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:02.580]   Echo.
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:03.540]   Don't look--
[01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:05.140]   Spotify.
[01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:05.980]   Alexa.
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:06.500]   Stop it.
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:07.980]   I didn't get bored.
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:08.980]   Stop it.
[01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:09.500]   Alexa.
[01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:10.340]   Stop it.
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:11.340]   Stop it.
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:14.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:16.220]   You know what I did learn in that announcement
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:18.500]   is that the number one command on Echo--
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:20.260]   do you know what it is?
[01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:23.420]   Echo listened to music.
[01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:25.220]   Not any kind of music.
[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:27.460]   Just listen to music.
[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:29.460]   And I tried it and actually does a pretty good job.
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:31.220]   But if you get the new paid thing
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:34.140]   and even do a broader variety of stuff--
[01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:37.020]   what's our betting on Google Home?
[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:41.020]   Is it going to be good or is it going to be another disaster?
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:42.340]   I'm glad you're out.
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:43.900]   What do you think Danny Sullivan?
[01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:44.260]   Is he--
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:45.300]   Is he going to do it?
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:46.780]   I think it might do all right.
[01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:47.460]   I think being--
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:47.980]   Nobody has a game.
[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:50.020]   --kind of less than Amazon.
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:51.980]   That's very interesting.
[01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:53.980]   I think it's going to be really successful
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:58.060]   if you have some music bundled into it, though.
[01:34:58.060 --> 01:34:59.780]   I think that's one of the key things with Echo
[01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:01.980]   is because the Echo, you are a prime member.
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:03.420]   I think originally when you got it
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:04.780]   and then it would play your music.
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:07.300]   And then it's really convenient for that.
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:08.980]   It'll be interesting to see how well they
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:10.460]   do it with some of the other skills, though,
[01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:14.420]   because it's just amazing the stuff you can do with Alexa
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:16.460]   to get to your flash briefings and things like that.
[01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:18.580]   But I think people are interested in doing it.
[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:20.140]   And so that way I think--
[01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:20.940]   I think it'll do all right.
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:24.700]   If you are an Echo user and you like the flash briefing,
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:27.860]   go into the app and search for Twit
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:29.980]   because we are in the flash briefing now.
[01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:31.580]   Monday through Friday we have headlines
[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:34.100]   from Tech News today with Megan and Jason.
[01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:35.700]   And then we'll have clips from Twit
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:38.940]   and the new screensavers, typically on Saturday and Sunday.
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:40.740]   So there's new content every day.
[01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:42.580]   Add us to your flash briefing.
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:46.100]   They've done a lot where when I was at the thing,
[01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:49.660]   I got in trouble kind of because they were doing the Google Home
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:50.100]   demo.
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:51.780]   And so they're like, look, and they can do this,
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:53.420]   and they can do that, and they can do this.
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:56.100]   And they're like, they're doing like,
[01:35:56.100 --> 01:35:57.140]   now let's play Jeopardy.
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:58.780]   And it's like, hello, time to play Jeopardy.
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:00.740]   So you can tell that they've done a lot of stuff
[01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:02.940]   to build in to try to get you excited about it.
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:04.100]   I love that.
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:06.500]   I finally said, can I just ask it a few of these questions?
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:07.700]   No, no, no, no.
[01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:08.460]   Yeah.
[01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:10.060]   They're like, no, I don't know if I can answer that.
[01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:13.260]   And I'm like, well, that is sort of what I'm trying to find out.
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:14.260]   All right.
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:14.760]   Ooh.
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:15.260]   Right.
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:15.460]   But it's it.
[01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:18.140]   I gave it three questions that I had run against the Amazon
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:20.460]   Echo that the Echo could not answer.
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:23.860]   And Google Home got two of those three's correct.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:25.580]   So it's more like the Google-- well,
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:26.660]   it is the Google Assistant.
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:27.980]   So it's anything--
[01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:29.500]   Yeah, it's Google Assistant built in.
[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:33.340]   I think Google Assistant is really whatever direct answer
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:36.100]   you get at the top of your Google search results.
[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:38.940]   So, Jeff, I'm sure you ordered the home, right?
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:39.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:42.420]   Mine supposedly comes--
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:43.260]   let me see, ordered these.
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:46.740]   I think November 8th through 10th.
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:50.380]   So soon, a couple of weeks, three weeks.
[01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:52.380]   Is yours sooner?
[01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:53.380]   How I find it was sooner--
[01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:54.740]   I think if you ordered right away,
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:57.100]   it was as soon as November 4th, I think.
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:59.980]   Because one of-- I think Anthony Nielsen ordered it,
[01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:02.420]   and we're going to have it for that new screensavers,
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:03.500]   November 5th.
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.100]   I was a bit delayed because I kept
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:07.260]   trying to figure out how to order the other colors
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:09.380]   until I realized there are no other colors.
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:11.380]   Yeah, I think that got me about 30 seconds.
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:13.220]   There's colored bases, right?
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:13.720]   Yes.
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:16.860]   And they're not even available.
[01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:18.100]   November 8th, Leo.
[01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:19.100]   You're also November 8th.
[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:19.820]   All right.
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:20.320]   OK.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:21.580]   It got the soonest of the phone.
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:22.820]   I'm getting--
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:24.580]   Soon, October 20th, you should.
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:26.100]   Again, October 26th.
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:27.100]   OK.
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:30.100]   What do I keep it or not?
[01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:31.700]   You keep asking me that.
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:32.660]   I know I do.
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:34.740]   You're my-- I don't know.
[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:35.460]   Sensei.
[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:37.380]   It's supposed to be a much better camera.
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:40.340]   The pictures are great.
[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:42.700]   And I'm really curious what-- I still don't know.
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:43.580]   Maybe you do, Danny.
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:46.820]   The difference between OK Google and--
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:47.580]   sorry, everybody.
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:49.780]   And then the Google Assistant.
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:51.420]   OK, Google, here's how it works.
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:53.860]   Alexa.
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:55.860]   Now, Siri.
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:38:02.060]   So the Assistant will still respond to OK Google.
[01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:04.100]   The Assistant will still respond to the hot word
[01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:06.260]   like you used to have in the hot word before.
[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:07.500]   So that will change--
[01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:08.700]   Can I customize it?
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:09.780]   I really missed that.
[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:12.420]   I'm trying to remember when I--
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:13.940]   The Moto X was the last thing that--
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:16.220]   I think it was an option to change the wake word.
[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:18.820]   But that might have been-- no, I can't recall.
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:19.700]   I can't recall.
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:22.340]   I suspect probably not.
[01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:24.860]   But the speaking to it part hasn't changed.
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:27.820]   It's just that the Assistant part is built in.
[01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:29.500]   Like, right now, if you have a phone
[01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:32.820]   and you do the Google and you tell it what you want to do
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:35.820]   as a voice search, it will come back with Google search results.
[01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:37.340]   So that's how to think of the difference
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:41.020]   between what Google Assistant does versus what you get now.
[01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:45.460]   With what you get now, you say to Google, hey, Google,
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:46.940]   what movies are playing near me.
[01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:50.700]   And it comes back and it says, here's some listings.
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:54.420]   With the Assistant, you say, hey, Google, but the other way.
[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:56.220]   What movies are playing near me?
[01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:58.460]   And it comes back and says, I can show you the movies here.
[01:38:58.460 --> 01:38:59.780]   Would you like the no-show title?
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:01.420]   And it gives you basically a little button.
[01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:03.940]   And then you could buy tickets.
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:06.900]   The ticket stuff isn't quite there yet.
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:09.100]   I think it depends on what application you have.
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:10.900]   Like, we had a launch fan dango.
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:12.540]   But it's a little more interactive.
[01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:15.100]   But eventually, that's the plan, is that we'll actually
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:15.740]   assist you.
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:18.700]   So it will take a step beyond search
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:20.700]   to actually assist you in doing actions.
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:21.820]   Although I was having fun.
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:24.500]   And I don't know if I can show you, especially because my wife
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:28.220]   and I tend to get very intimate.
[01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:31.860]   No, no, we curse at each other in our text.
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:32.420]   Oh, nice.
[01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:34.420]   Oh, you've been very longer than I have, I guess.
[01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:35.420]   As a joke.
[01:39:35.420 --> 01:39:37.980]   But she said to me something like, I was saying, look,
[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:39.460]   I need to test this Google Assistant.
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:40.100]   Can you run it?
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:42.340]   So we were doing this thing going back and forth
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:42.980]   on trying to find out.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:44.620]   Jeff and I had a great conversation
[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:48.580]   on Aloe while I was at the airport in Paris.
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:49.100]   Yeah.
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:50.180]   It was fun.
[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:52.740]   I liked all the things I could do with the Aloe.
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:54.780]   I just wish Google--
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:55.820]   I still don't understand.
[01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:58.220]   And I think this is going to be the case still with the Pixel
[01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:03.460]   Y. It's not their default text messaging app.
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:04.500]   Oh, Aloe?
[01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:06.180]   Yes.
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:06.660]   I don't know.
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:07.780]   I hate Aloe.
[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:11.860]   But if you're going to call in on your messaging platform,
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:15.620]   don't have three messaging apps, plus whatever the carrier
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:16.620]   and the manufacturer--
[01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:17.820]   I'll use Aloe just for assistance.
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:21.780]   I can't even-- I can't even within the messaging.
[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:23.260]   I can't even.
[01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:28.820]   I don't even-- I can use Aloe on one phone.
[01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:29.300]   But no.
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:29.800]   No.
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:30.300]   Oh, you're right.
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:31.300]   It's tied to your number.
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:31.500]   So you--
[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.820]   It's tied to your number.
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:34.740]   And I have a Google voice number.
[01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:36.340]   So then I'm tying it to one phone.
[01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:37.900]   But I can't use it on the other phone.
[01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:39.500]   Meanwhile, I have a Google voice number that was
[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:40.980]   supposed to use Google Hangouts.
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:42.420]   So now I can't use Google Hangouts,
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:44.340]   because they are kind of going away from that.
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:47.780]   It's like, why couldn't you just give us one good app?
[01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:52.780]   And then I don't know what duo is supposed to be versus Aloe.
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:53.460]   I agree.
[01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:54.900]   I can't even.
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:57.540]   So while you were away, Leo, we did talk about this.
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:59.340]   There was an article in--
[01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:01.940]   I was technical saying Aloe makes sense
[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:04.860]   if you think about India, which I just stuck in the--
[01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:05.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:07.020]   So does WhatsApp.
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:07.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:07.980]   Well, good.
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:08.660]   If I were in India--
[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:09.660]   But I'm not in India.
[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:10.540]   That would be helpful for me.
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:11.980]   No, totally.
[01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:15.580]   But that explains why they're not making it the default app
[01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:16.900]   yet, because it's not ready for it.
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:17.900]   Because they're focused on--
[01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:21.420]   Can I make it an option to be the default app?
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:22.380]   No, because that--
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:24.380]   What, out there?
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:27.940]   You can't on the Nexus?
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:28.820]   No, you can't.
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:29.820]   They haven't decided to do it.
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:31.380]   But at the moment, half my app's on Android
[01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:32.900]   want to take over SMS already.
[01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:35.540]   Facebook wants it and Hangouts wants it.
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:37.820]   Well, they better hurry up, because I'm using Facebook
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:39.460]   as my messenger now.
[01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:40.460]   Yep.
[01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:42.020]   I'm sure they'll get to it at some point.
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:46.580]   I'm just going to list the whole--
[01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:47.580]   I'm the first to raise you.
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:49.340]   It's the reason I hate WhatsApp as well.
[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:50.340]   It's like--
[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:51.340]   But they've--
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:55.180]   I understand that in much of the rest of the world,
[01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:59.020]   the rapacious cell carriers and mobile companies
[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:02.580]   charge you so much for SMS that people won't use SMS.
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:05.180]   They use a data-only system like WhatsApp.
[01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:08.260]   That's explaining the popularity of WhatsApp worldwide.
[01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:11.660]   And the ALA would be a plug-in replacement for that.
[01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:14.220]   But that does not mean it shouldn't also
[01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:18.420]   be like Apple's messages or even its own Hangouts
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:22.300]   and be an SMS plus messaging app.
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:25.340]   Apple does it quite well, where it will use SMS
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:28.460]   or it will use data, depending on which is available.
[01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:29.340]   And if you--
[01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:32.980]   I presume in India, you could tell Apple, oh, just use data.
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:35.780]   I don't ever want to use SMS.
[01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:37.980]   Unless you have to, because sometimes if somebody's
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:39.020]   not on the iPhone, you have to.
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:40.700]   Which is also the great thing about a Hangout
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:42.340]   is it works just like the Apple message is where
[01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:43.460]   you can send this down by an email.
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:44.860]   And it's cross-platform.
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:46.420]   And they're beautiful on cross-platform.
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:49.700]   So why they made ALA non-cross-platform?
[01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:52.500]   Because it tied to your freaking phone number.
[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:53.900]   Well, it's cross-platform in the sense
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:56.180]   that you can talk to somebody on an iPhone
[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:57.780]   from an Android phone and vice versa.
[01:42:57.780 --> 01:42:59.500]   Yeah, but heaven forbid you want
[01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:02.940]   to talk to somebody from your iPhone and your iPad,
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:05.700]   because only one of them gets to run ALA at a time.
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:06.700]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:08.700]   But that's not much time.
[01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:09.700]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:10.460]   Which is very odd.
[01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:11.420]   Very not googly.
[01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:14.660]   And that's the advantage of having an email account be the way
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:15.180]   to do it.
[01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:16.940]   But the advantage, I guess, to them
[01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:18.620]   is if you're just doing your phone number,
[01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:21.220]   they've hooked you up without you having to do passwords
[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:21.940]   or something like that.
[01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:23.220]   Without having to create a Google account,
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:23.860]   it's part of the point.
[01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:25.740]   You can use it on the phone without a Google account,
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:28.580]   which means they can deploy it on Android's that aren't
[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:29.460]   googlyphied.
[01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:32.460]   So that's the-- if you want the actual internal turf
[01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:34.180]   for, that's what it is.
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:37.020]   Do you think it's important or a significant number
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:41.100]   that YouTube had for the second presidential debate
[01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:45.460]   124 million views?
[01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:49.740]   That seems to me a real harbinger of a change
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:53.260]   in how people consume content.
[01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:56.340]   That's almost shocking, especially since the debate
[01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:58.140]   was on every network.
[01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:00.900]   You couldn't-- any TV you turned on would have the debate.
[01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:03.180]   And yet 124 million people chose their--
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:04.180]   So how did they--
[01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:08.380]   Didn't they see that the viewing on television was down?
[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:10.700]   Like fewer people watched the debate on television.
[01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:12.660]   So it's interesting if more people were actually
[01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:14.540]   watching the second debate on Twitter.
[01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:17.780]   The peak concurrent viewing was one and a half million, which
[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:19.180]   isn't huge.
[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:21.740]   So that tells me to answer your question, Kevin.
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:23.100]   So it's click views, yeah.
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:26.260]   It's people clicking and clicking away.
[01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:28.860]   This is YouTube-- this is not YouTube live.
[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:29.180]   Is it?
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:32.460]   This is YouTube all stuff around it.
[01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:33.620]   The distinctions kind of--
[01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:34.140]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:37.740]   And well, since it took place Sunday--
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:38.220]   Yeah.
[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:40.300]   So this is people not just from the US,
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:43.260]   probably everybody in the US watched live on television,
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:45.500]   but all over the world.
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:46.980]   The country with the highest number was the US,
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:51.580]   but then Canada, Mexico, Australia, the UK, and Vietnam.
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:52.900]   Did Twitter release figures on that?
[01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:55.020]   I remember there being like 3 million or something
[01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:56.500]   from then, but--
[01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:58.420]   Yeah, we're really-- this is rapidly happening,
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:02.340]   this consuming content over the internet,
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:05.220]   as opposed to broadcast.
[01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:06.660]   Very interesting.
[01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:11.140]   Will Cheryl Sandberg be the next Secretary of the Treasury?
[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:12.940]   She says no.
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:16.940]   She's going to stay at Facebook.
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:19.580]   I like the idea that she could Secretary of Treasury
[01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:20.340]   or commerce.
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:21.820]   I don't know who thought that up.
[01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:23.820]   We all remember we thought it was going to be Schmidt,
[01:45:23.820 --> 01:45:26.020]   with the suddenly being in the cabinet.
[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:28.740]   When did that be a mistake?
[01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:30.180]   I like Eric, but--
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:31.380]   Yeah.
[01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:34.860]   Elon says he's going to announce something next week
[01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:37.940]   to blow your mind.
[01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:41.820]   That they're actually going to ship those cars to buy.
[01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:43.780]   No, that he found the wormhole into the people who
[01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:44.580]   were running this all.
[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:49.180]   He's paying-- we mentioned this on Sunday and Twitter.
[01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:52.500]   According to rumor, he and some others who believe we don't
[01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:55.060]   live in the real world but live in a simulation
[01:45:55.060 --> 01:45:58.780]   are paying programmers or experts or whatever, whoever
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:00.900]   you'd pay to break through.
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:03.020]   He's trying to develop the red pill.
[01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:04.500]   Physicists?
[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:05.000]   Yes.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.660]   Why not?
[01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:09.060]   How would you-- Kevin Marks, if you--
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:10.020]   If you were going to pay for this--
[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:11.540]   If Elon came to you with a blank check,
[01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:13.740]   how would you break through the simulation
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:16.980]   to the real world?
[01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:20.820]   Well, the point is you look for low resolution stuff.
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:22.820]   Glitches, in the words of the matrix.
[01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:23.700]   It's just in the matrix.
[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:28.080]   You look for-- is there an alignment that
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:29.500]   implies there are pixels involved?
[01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:31.660]   Is there an alignment of that kind of--
[01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:32.940]   or voxels involved?
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:35.700]   Is there some quantization thing that is--
[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:36.500]   Yeah, because--
[01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:38.500]   You got a figure that some of the simulation--
[01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:39.220]   There's no pixels in my brain.
[01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:41.460]   There's no pixels in my brain.
[01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:43.500]   There's no low resolution in my brain.
[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:44.420]   No, but it's--
[01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:44.940]   What is the--
[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:45.940]   I don't think it's actual voxels.
[01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:48.180]   The whole mind's getting more low resolution.
[01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:48.980]   Actually--
[01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:52.980]   There is because you don't-- you think you're seeing clearly
[01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:55.060]   when, in fact, you are not-- your brain
[01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:57.060]   is piecing together of you--
[01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:58.140]   I'm in these classes.
[01:46:58.140 --> 01:46:59.100]   Now I can see clearly.
[01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:00.500]   No, you don't see what's out here.
[01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:01.540]   You just think you do.
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:03.660]   That's because they're like right here.
[01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:05.500]   You've got a fovea in its cating and its picket.
[01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:06.500]   It's maybe a model of--
[01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:08.740]   It's a cating which is the jiggling of your eyes
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:10.700]   all the time is building up an image.
[01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:11.700]   So in fact--
[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:12.220]   That's just--
[01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:12.780]   You're rasping--
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:13.860]   It's a raster image.
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:15.660]   You're rasping.
[01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:22.540]   So-- so-- the argument is that--
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:24.940]   and the crazy version of this argument
[01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:25.860]   get very crazy.
[01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:27.580]   But it's like if you look at quantum mechanics,
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:30.460]   if you look at the way the physical laws work,
[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:32.140]   they don't tend to have higher order terms.
[01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:34.900]   They look-- the observer problem in quantum mechanics
[01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:36.620]   is-- that's kind of a give-away.
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:38.220]   There are any rendering things we look at.
[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:40.100]   You argue things on those bases.
[01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:45.580]   But trying to break out the simulation is kind of silly.
[01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:46.500]   Yes.
[01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:47.540]   I don't know.
[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:49.100]   I hope he does.
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:50.340]   I'll go to a match in this.
[01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:54.220]   I would say, look, if I was in the simulation,
[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:56.700]   I wouldn't be allowing some billionaires to fund
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:58.500]   the ability to break through the simulation.
[01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:00.820]   So we're not in the simulation stupid.
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:01.780]   Unless--
[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:03.700]   Well, that's--
[01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:05.540]   I think that'd be kind of interesting, wouldn't it?
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:07.180]   Then you get an escaton scenario, didn't you?
[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:08.180]   Yeah.
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:10.140]   Or I'd say I must be in a simulation,
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:11.700]   because only in a simulation do you
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:14.060]   have people with more money than God throwing up money
[01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:15.980]   to try to find out whether or not there's actually
[01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:19.500]   a God controlling us in a simulation or not.
[01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:22.820]   And also, why is your model like so expensive?
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:24.420]   Oh, but I like it.
[01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:25.500]   I have a model like--
[01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:26.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:27.500]   Is it really--
[01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:29.180]   I need to get a new car and I was like,
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:30.420]   lathe them all out.
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:31.260]   And I'm like--
[01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:32.260]   It's very expensive.
[01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:34.140]   --that is like five times more.
[01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:36.340]   Why do I want that?
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:36.980]   I could find--
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:38.380]   You could drive a Chevy.
[01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:40.980]   And the amount of gas I would use--
[01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:41.980]   No, no, no, no.
[01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:45.020]   You're being-- that's not about that.
[01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:47.820]   It's the pleasure, the sheer joy of driving
[01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:49.620]   an electric-- all electric vehicle
[01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:51.780]   and knowing that the solar panels, which I also
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:55.860]   bought from Elon, on my roof are charging the battery, which
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:59.340]   I also bought from Elon in my garage, which is charging the car,
[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:00.860]   which I bought from Elon.
[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:03.660]   And it's a virtuous circle, somehow,
[01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:04.660]   Elon's in every part of it.
[01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:06.020]   Now, I'm asking solar panels on my roof
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:08.020]   that I don't want to charge Elon's car because it's
[01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:10.380]   better for me to sell the electricity in the daytime,
[01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:14.180]   back to SoCal, and then charge my car at night rather
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:15.620]   than put it in the battery.
[01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:17.740]   It's just all economics and not just by the gas--
[01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:18.820]   It's not economics.
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:19.660]   It's not.
[01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:23.020]   It's the sheer joy of driving a car that
[01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:24.660]   has so little footprint.
[01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:27.940]   And it feels just like a gas car with the acceleration
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:28.700]   and everything.
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:29.660]   It's fun to drive--
[01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:29.660]   I don't know.
[01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:30.780]   It's a little footprint.
[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:31.900]   It's like a car.
[01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:34.020]   And it's using electricity.
[01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:37.780]   Which I make, which I take on loan from God.
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:39.700]   Yeah, I'm just putting it out there for other people who
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:40.980]   need it.
[01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:42.860]   Well, you can buy a Chevy bolt.
[01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:43.860]   Get a bolt.
[01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:44.300]   It's expensive.
[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:45.860]   If you don't care, get a Chevy bolt.
[01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:46.780]   I'm getting a bolt.
[01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:47.780]   Good.
[01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:49.140]   But that's not expensive.
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:52.020]   Yeah, and it's not as much fun.
[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:54.380]   I just want to get one place or the other.
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:55.220]   Oh, well, then fine.
[01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:56.700]   I do want the wings, doors, and buildings.
[01:49:56.700 --> 01:49:57.780]   You should get a bicycle.
[01:49:57.780 --> 01:49:58.580]   Get a bicycle.
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:49:59.580]   I want doors of a billion.
[01:49:59.580 --> 01:50:01.340]   And you know why they call doors of a billion?
[01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:01.860]   Yes.
[01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:05.100]   You don't make an a billion off those doors.
[01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:06.620]   I want doors that go like this.
[01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:08.620]   They don't just go like this.
[01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:11.420]   They go like this.
[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:13.460]   Is there anything you don't like about it?
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:14.740]   It's not a luxury vehicle.
[01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:15.940]   I mean, for the price you're paying,
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:18.380]   it should be a little bit more luxurious.
[01:50:18.380 --> 01:50:20.140]   Well, none of their vehicles really
[01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:21.060]   are luxury vehicles.
[01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:22.220]   They're just luxury price.
[01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:27.220]   You know, but no, I love it.
[01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:32.220]   I every day I think I pinch myself every time I get into it
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:33.020]   and feel good about it.
[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:35.300]   I just really love the idea of driving an electric vehicle.
[01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:36.860]   And that's fun to drive.
[01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:39.380]   And we just got version eight of the software.
[01:50:39.380 --> 01:50:41.500]   So I'm going to do the review on the new screensavers
[01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:44.060]   on Saturday because we've held off on the review
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:47.820]   until the new software came out with 200 improvements
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:50.340]   to autopilot and all of that.
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:51.460]   Last story before we--
[01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:53.300]   I automatically stop your car, by the way.
[01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:54.340]   Does what?
[01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:56.660]   It's a do the automatic if some of these stops are in front of you.
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:50:57.660]   Oh, yeah.
[01:50:57.660 --> 01:50:58.740]   Oh, yeah, of course.
[01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:00.020]   I mean, it's fascinating for you
[01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:02.180]   because I haven't bought a car for like eight years, right?
[01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:03.980]   Next time you're out here, come up, Danny.
[01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:07.340]   And I will let you take the Tesla for a day.
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:09.940]   And you could go anywhere you want, drive it around.
[01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:11.300]   Seriously.
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:12.300]   But what's fascinating is--
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:13.380]   It's just not the line country.
[01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:13.900]   That's all.
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:14.620]   Look at these cars right now.
[01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:16.940]   And I'm like, wait, you don't have all--
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:19.660]   you still have like an old navigation system.
[01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:21.420]   You don't automatically stop my car.
[01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:25.700]   And I'm like, why are you guys not dis-advanced?
[01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:29.580]   Yeah, well, because you didn't pay $130,000 for it.
[01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:30.860]   Well, no, but some of them are.
[01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:31.660]   Like some of them are.
[01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:33.180]   The reason I spent that much money
[01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:35.580]   is because I am an altruist.
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:38.100]   I want to fund the next generation
[01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:41.580]   so that you, Danny, can have a Model 3.
[01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:43.500]   That's what Jason Calakan has told me.
[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:45.620]   I bought my solar panels not just because I
[01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:47.340]   thought they'd make money, but because I actually
[01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:48.900]   want to be more environmentally sound.
[01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:51.820]   That's what we said, even if we just break even, this is great.
[01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:54.620]   And we do save a lot of money on our solar power.
[01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:56.060]   We save hundreds of dollars a month
[01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:57.180]   because we got solar panels.
[01:51:57.180 --> 01:51:57.740]   Oh my god.
[01:51:57.740 --> 01:51:59.420]   I got my first bill and it was like negative.
[01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:00.260]   Yeah.
[01:52:00.260 --> 01:52:01.260]   Honestly.
[01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:02.260]   Yeah.
[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:04.260]   Yeah.
[01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:04.760]   Last--
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:07.100]   I got to go away.
[01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:08.380]   I'm really sorry I have to leave.
[01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:09.260]   I'm like, I'm--
[01:52:09.260 --> 01:52:09.940]   Your fault.
[01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:11.860]   I was trying to wrap this show up hours ago.
[01:52:11.860 --> 01:52:12.300]   All right.
[01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:12.660]   OK.
[01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:13.260]   See you.
[01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:13.740]   Goodbye, Danny.
[01:52:13.740 --> 01:52:14.940]   Why do you got your wrap up?
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:15.460]   I'll hang in there.
[01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:18.300]   Search Engineland.com, MarketingEngineland.com.
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:20.020]   I'm sorry I have to go.
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:20.500]   You know what?
[01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:22.620]   Give us one little tip or trick or something
[01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:24.580]   we should know about that if we had just
[01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:26.580]   been reading Search Engineland assiduously,
[01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:27.420]   we would already know.
[01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:28.620]   My way through has been fairly quiet.
[01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:31.660]   You've got that RGB hex thing already on the list.
[01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:33.940]   So I'll leave that RGB hex thing to you.
[01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:35.420]   OK.
[01:52:35.420 --> 01:52:37.700]   So I will say Snapchat's had some redesigns.
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:39.700]   We've got some articles up on that at Marketingland.
[01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:42.100]   And the most of the news this month
[01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:47.020]   has really been like, hey, Google's not penalizing you
[01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:49.420]   anymore, and that's not as boring as--
[01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:51.340]   No, have a great afternoon, my friend.
[01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:51.860]   All right, you guys.
[01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:52.620]   Sorry I got to go.
[01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:53.140]   No problem.
[01:52:53.140 --> 01:52:53.860]   Have a great time.
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:56.900]   Danny Sullivan, the greatest Search Engineland--
[01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:57.900]   Ah, Danny.
[01:52:57.900 --> 01:53:00.860]   MarketingEngineland.com.
[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:01.380]   See you.
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:03.860]   OrangeCountyLand.com.
[01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:05.620]   Orange-- but it's nice in the summer.
[01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:06.380]   Beautiful.
[01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:08.620]   I mean, in the winter, too.
[01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:10.260]   NewportBeachLand.com.
[01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:12.580]   Our show today brought to you by Danny's Mattress.
[01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:14.660]   The Casper-- oh, my mattress, too.
[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:17.340]   I love our Casper mattress.
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:18.900]   They've reinvented the mattress business.
[01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:20.340]   You know there are a lot of copycats now.
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:21.580]   Have you noticed that?
[01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:23.140]   Yeah, but you know, you should go with Casper.
[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:25.900]   They were the ones who have revolutionized the whole thing
[01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:27.940]   by eliminating the middleman.
[01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:28.940]   No more resellers.
[01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:30.460]   No more showrooms.
[01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:31.940]   You're buying directly from the factory.
[01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:35.420]   US made obsessively engineered premium mattresses
[01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:38.540]   for a fraction of the cost.
[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:42.060]   They're combining two technologies-- springy latex foam,
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:46.580]   supportive memory foam-- to create a amazing award-winning,
[01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:48.180]   in fact, sleep surface.
[01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:49.660]   Just the right sink, just the right bounce.
[01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:50.620]   It's cool.
[01:53:50.620 --> 01:53:52.500]   It breathes.
[01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:54.820]   It's environmentally friendly.
[01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:55.860]   It's just lovely.
[01:53:55.860 --> 01:53:59.860]   2016 Business Intelligence Group Innovation Award winner--
[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:03.300]   long-lasting, too, by the way.
[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:06.100]   Now, you might say, but Leo, I want to try before I buy.
[01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:09.540]   Yeah, you can, by getting it now in your home.
[01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:12.300]   Without any risk, you have 100 nights.
[01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:16.100]   And if at any time, in the 100-day period, you say, nah,
[01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:16.500]   call them.
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:17.660]   They'll take you like a set of career.
[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:19.140]   They'll take it back.
[01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:20.060]   Refund you every penny.
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:22.260]   They'll have cost you absolutely nothing.
[01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:25.940]   The nice thing is, it comes in this great little compact box.
[01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:28.660]   So it's very-- I sent one to my son in college,
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:30.580]   because he could easily heft it up the three
[01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:31.740]   flights of this dorm.
[01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:33.980]   He didn't have to sleep on that ratty dorm mattress.
[01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:38.100]   Instead, he's had a great mattress for his college experience.
[01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:41.420]   And it's affordable $500 for that twin I sent to Henry.
[01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:43.380]   And I'm going to save you in more an additional $50
[01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:44.380]   towards a mattress.
[01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:45.700]   A bit just because you're listening.
[01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:48.820]   If you go-- but you've got to go to Casper.com/twig
[01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:51.300]   and use the offer code twig, $50 off.
[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:54.540]   Please do that so that they know that you heard it on this week
[01:54:54.540 --> 01:54:55.420]   in Google.
[01:54:55.420 --> 01:55:00.100]   Casper.com/twig, offer code twig to get $50 off some terms
[01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:01.300]   and conditions.
[01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:04.020]   Apply Casper mattress.
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:06.860]   I love my Casper, and you will, too.
[01:55:06.860 --> 01:55:08.420]   But you can try at risk free.
[01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:11.660]   So why not?
[01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:13.900]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:18.580]   Do you want to do a number, or what do you want to do these days?
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:19.020]   Uh-oh.
[01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:19.780]   He's silenced.
[01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:21.220]   You're silenced.
[01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:22.340]   You're silenced.
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:25.500]   Sorry I was training up the TV, so I turned that down.
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:28.620]   So yes, I wanted a number, a very important one.
[01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:30.500]   Our friend of everyone on the internet,
[01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:35.140]   a friend of openness and great things
[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:38.820]   about the net John Perry Barlow, has
[01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:41.300]   been sick with unknown conditions that are heart attack
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:41.820]   and so on.
[01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:44.380]   And his family just put up a plea for money
[01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:49.300]   to help him pay for his very expensive, very difficult care.
[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:50.380]   He's as funny as ever.
[01:55:50.380 --> 01:55:56.900]   If you go to his Facebook page, you'll see him doing a New
[01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:59.420]   Year's Eve noise maker.
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:00.820]   He's got the same spirit as ever.
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:05.020]   But he needs a lot of equipment and ongoing care.
[01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:08.820]   And the guy is courageous in the face of all this.
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:13.060]   But the best humor you can imagine online on his Facebook
[01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:15.980]   feed, but he's somebody who's really important to the net,
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:17.140]   who's given greatly to the net.
[01:56:17.140 --> 01:56:20.940]   So as soon as we're off, I'll be giving some money to him.
[01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:22.860]   Well, and I'll add to that, because they're
[01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:26.180]   doing a concert down the road to peace.
[01:56:26.180 --> 01:56:28.500]   And Lisa and I are going, and we bought the top level,
[01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:30.700]   because I wanted to contribute as well to John,
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:32.140]   because I love John dearly.
[01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:33.660]   He's been on the show several times.
[01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:35.300]   And we owe him a lot.
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:40.140]   He was a founder of the EFF and just a really important person
[01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:43.220]   in the development of technology and of the internet.
[01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:45.700]   And the concert, if you can go--
[01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:46.100]   Yeah.
[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:47.540]   So who's played at the concert?
[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:49.140]   Well, Bob Weir of The Grateful Dead
[01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:50.420]   is kind of putting it together.
[01:56:50.420 --> 01:56:51.620]   And so that'll give you some idea.
[01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:57.180]   Of course, you should just go anyway.
[01:56:57.180 --> 01:56:58.860]   But I'll be there.
[01:56:58.860 --> 01:57:00.380]   Lisa'll be there.
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:02.300]   Let me see if I can find the Facebook--
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:03.620]   Boyboy was down.
[01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:04.460]   They had it.
[01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:10.620]   I will look it up at this.
[01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:13.700]   If you go to Sweetwater.com, that's their site.
[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:15.860]   And you can buy tickets if it's not sold out.
[01:57:15.860 --> 01:57:18.420]   The event is called "Everyday Miracle."
[01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:19.980]   Jerry Harrison of the Talking Heads.
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:21.260]   He was the keyboardist.
[01:57:21.260 --> 01:57:23.260]   Lucas Nelson, members of String Cheese incident.
[01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:24.940]   Ramlin Jack, Elliot.
[01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:27.340]   Sean Lennon, Les Claypool.
[01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:29.500]   That's who's on the bill right now.
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:30.660]   But you've got to believe there'll
[01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:33.460]   be a lot of other people at this event.
[01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:34.220]   Now it's in Marin.
[01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:37.020]   So you have to be in the Bay Area.
[01:57:37.020 --> 01:57:39.140]   But definitely, I bought tickets immediately
[01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:41.580]   because I really care about John Perry Barlow.
[01:57:41.580 --> 01:57:45.740]   And we really want him to get well soon
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:48.860]   and certainly want to help him with his medical expenses.
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:51.340]   There'll also be a live in silent auction.
[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:54.980]   And all the proceeds go directly to his care and recovery.
[01:57:54.980 --> 01:57:58.460]   So there you go.
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:00.740]   There you go, John Perry Barlow.
[01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:01.980]   How about you, Kevin Marks?
[01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:03.980]   You got something for us?
[01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:08.180]   Well, I've got my usual thing, which is indieweb.org.
[01:58:08.180 --> 01:58:10.540]   It's not a pretty bright sunlight, anyway.
[01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:11.060]   I like it.
[01:58:11.060 --> 01:58:13.420]   I love jealous.
[01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:16.020]   So there are two indie webcams coming up in November.
[01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:18.180]   November the weekend of the fourth
[01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:20.780]   the sixth in Berlin and Los Angeles,
[01:58:20.780 --> 01:58:23.420]   depending on which side of the planet you're on.
[01:58:23.420 --> 01:58:26.180]   So those are the next two.
[01:58:26.180 --> 01:58:29.380]   And we've got also our regular Wednesday meetings,
[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:32.060]   not this week, but next week in various places
[01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:33.620]   and the week after in San Francisco.
[01:58:33.620 --> 01:58:34.020]   Nice.
[01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:35.420]   So go to those.
[01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:37.180]   The other thing I wanted to mention was
[01:58:37.180 --> 01:58:38.900]   Ada Lovelace Day.
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:39.940]   That was yesterday.
[01:58:39.940 --> 01:58:43.380]   This is the annual recognizing women in tech day
[01:58:43.380 --> 01:58:44.860]   organized by Sue Jarman.
[01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:49.980]   And they-- it's a day to-- they have a live event in London.
[01:58:49.980 --> 01:58:52.700]   But they also encourage people to write about women in tech
[01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:55.900]   and just show them as role models.
[01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:59.460]   So that goers will find women role models
[01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:00.780]   to look up to and so on.
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:03.340]   So that's a great organization, a great site.
[01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:04.780]   And there's a lot going on there.
[01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:08.260]   I've got a podcast as well now and a series of other things
[01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:08.700]   they put out.
[01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:11.460]   But yesterday was the big day.
[01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:15.660]   Does anybody know what the RGB to hex calculator that Danny
[01:59:15.660 --> 01:59:18.260]   was talking about, what that is?
[01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:18.980]   Well, I play with it.
[01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:22.180]   If you just type in RGB to hex, you can put in any color
[01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:22.980]   and get the numbers.
[01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:24.660]   Oh, Google does this for you.
[01:59:24.660 --> 01:59:25.780]   Yeah, I guess.
[01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:27.740]   It's under my numbers.
[01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:31.140]   So if you search for RGB to hex on Google--
[01:59:31.140 --> 01:59:32.740]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:33.260]   Is it?
[01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:35.940]   I was searching for-- oh, look at that.
[01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:37.020]   Google is so funny.
[01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:39.100]   This is something we used to do all the time, right?
[01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:40.700]   In the web, I don't know if you still do it.
[01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:41.620]   But--
[01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:42.980]   Yeah, but this is--
[01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:44.740]   I mean, there's a color picker that looks exactly like that
[01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:45.260]   in the browser.
[01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:48.820]   But it's kind of funny to--
[01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:50.500]   In the search.
[01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:53.340]   Somebody's 20% project.
[01:59:53.340 --> 01:59:54.260]   I love it.
[01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:58.340]   Search for RGB to hex on Google.
[01:59:58.340 --> 02:00:01.820]   And you never will have to guess what the hexadecimal
[02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:06.380]   representation is of a particular color.
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:11.700]   Remember the days when you had to use color safe colors?
[02:00:11.700 --> 02:00:12.460]   Oh, yes.
[02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:12.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:14.020]   There are only 256 colors.
[02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:15.380]   And they were really bright.
[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:16.140]   Oh, it is.
[02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:17.100]   Yes.
[02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:19.220]   And if you didn't, then you couldn't guarantee the browser
[02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:21.060]   would do the right thing.
[02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:22.340]   You might get dithering, yeah.
[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:23.340]   Yeah.
[02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:25.580]   We don't want dithering.
[02:00:25.580 --> 02:00:27.700]   But there, there were only every--
[02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:29.100]   you can literally look at it in there.
[02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:31.140]   There were only every three hex.
[02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:35.420]   So it was 0, 3, 6, 9, A, F. Sure, that makes sense.
[02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:37.220]   And then all the permutations of that,
[02:00:37.220 --> 02:00:39.140]   there's the colors you got, which meant there weren't any very
[02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:39.900]   subtle ones in that.
[02:00:39.900 --> 02:00:43.620]   They were all variously quite sort of glowing.
[02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:45.100]   Yeah.
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:48.580]   And if you're not already a Google Fi subscriber,
[02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:49.620]   you're really ought to be.
[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:54.820]   And they've now added just a couple of days ago group plans.
[02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:59.780]   So now, if you are a Google Fi person, like I am, Jeff is,
[02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:01.660]   you can add your family members.
[02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:04.820]   They have to have Nexus or Pixel phones to do it.
[02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:07.260]   But I think that's fantastic.
[02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:08.420]   $15 a month?
[02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:09.540]   Yeah, $15 a month.
[02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:11.340]   And I guess they're in--
[02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:13.100]   instead of your $20 a month, and they're
[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:15.420]   in on your data plan at $10 a gigabyte.
[02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:18.540]   Oh, so they share the data?
[02:01:18.540 --> 02:01:20.180]   If they don't have separate data,
[02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:21.340]   make sure the same data.
[02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:22.340]   I don't know.
[02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:23.300]   That's a good question.
[02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:24.180]   That's a big difference.
[02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:27.020]   Not really, because you're paying $40 through way, right?
[02:01:27.020 --> 02:01:31.260]   So I just think of it as a $15 instead of $20 entrance fee.
[02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:35.260]   If five people use five gigs each--
[02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:36.860]   It's $10 a gig.
[02:01:36.860 --> 02:01:37.860]   Yeah.
[02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:39.620]   So five people use half a gig each.
[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:41.980]   That'd be $25.
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:43.780]   Aren't you paying for it anyway?
[02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:47.420]   No, no, what I'm saying is that if you can't add it up,
[02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:49.340]   in words, if five people use--
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:50.100]   Oh, I see.
[02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:50.460]   I see.
[02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:51.700]   You don't get the fractional usage.
[02:01:51.700 --> 02:01:53.180]   That would be two and a half.
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:54.220]   Yeah, no, no.
[02:01:54.220 --> 02:01:57.420]   I think each person has their own data counter.
[02:01:57.420 --> 02:01:58.700]   OK.
[02:01:58.700 --> 02:01:59.220]   That's $10.
[02:01:59.220 --> 02:02:00.740]   So really, essentially--
[02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:01.700]   Yeah, so--
[02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:03.900]   Yeah, but essentially the big changes--
[02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:06.500]   you get a $5 discount, an additional people
[02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:08.460]   on your account, basically.
[02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:09.420]   It's fine.
[02:02:09.420 --> 02:02:11.900]   It's great.
[02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:14.820]   And up to six, I think, something like that.
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:19.260]   I'm loving Fi.
[02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:23.140]   And I should report that I took both the Fi phone
[02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:26.380]   and a T-Mobile phone to the 10 countries
[02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:29.620]   that I visited on vacation.
[02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:33.260]   And what I found was that in many cases,
[02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:36.580]   T-Mobile was a little faster than Fi.
[02:02:36.580 --> 02:02:40.340]   And T-Mobile was cheaper because T-Mobile--
[02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:41.500]   Now maybe that was the phone.
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:41.940]   I don't know.
[02:02:41.940 --> 02:02:44.220]   I was using the iPhone 7 compared
[02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:46.820]   to Nexus 6P.
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:50.380]   Presumably, if I'm on T-Mobile, the Nexus phone
[02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:52.740]   is also using T-Mobile.
[02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:54.780]   But maybe Fi is paying them something for it.
[02:02:54.780 --> 02:02:55.300]   Maybe?
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:55.860]   I don't know.
[02:02:55.860 --> 02:02:56.260]   Because yeah, you--
[02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:57.980]   Because they were going to be in a--
[02:02:57.980 --> 02:02:59.740]   And you still pay the price.
[02:02:59.740 --> 02:03:02.820]   Whereas with T-Mobile, it's just part of your account.
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:03.380]   It's unlimited.
[02:03:03.380 --> 02:03:04.700]   Yeah, the T-Mobile did get free data.
[02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:06.220]   Throttle to 120 kilobits.
[02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:08.500]   That's the point is that it wasn't throttled.
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:10.940]   They had said over the summer they weren't going to throttle.
[02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:12.660]   And then they've continued that.
[02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:14.700]   I suspect they're going to continue that forever.
[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:17.220]   So it was LTE very often.
[02:03:17.220 --> 02:03:18.940]   And that was nice.
[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:20.020]   That was nice.
[02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:21.820]   I was very happy with that.
[02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:23.500]   So I did a mix of them.
[02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:26.220]   Now I'll let you know when I get my bill.
[02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:27.060]   I might regret that.
[02:03:27.060 --> 02:03:28.460]   I don't know.
[02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:30.260]   But it really is--
[02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:33.260]   it's really great to be able to go now, travel,
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:37.500]   and not have to worry about crazy data roaming costs.
[02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:40.220]   So if you travel, either a iPhone or--
[02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:42.700]   they were close enough that I think you'd be happy with either.
[02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:44.900]   Either a iPhone or a T-Mobile phone.
[02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:48.420]   And you don't have to make any special travel arrangements.
[02:03:48.420 --> 02:03:53.140]   Yeah, maybe that makes sense.
[02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:54.500]   Because they're an MVMO.
[02:03:54.500 --> 02:03:58.700]   And oh, maybe they get a lower priority than T-Mobile direct.
[02:03:58.700 --> 02:03:59.860]   I don't know.
[02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:01.780]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:02.860]   It was close.
[02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:05.940]   But I noticed in most cases, I preferred the iPhone
[02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:06.900]   over the next six--
[02:04:06.900 --> 02:04:09.700]   But maybe an extra handshake is your own or something
[02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:11.260]   that it's got to look up.
[02:04:11.260 --> 02:04:12.260]   All right.
[02:04:12.260 --> 02:04:13.460]   So the other one that was in the rundown
[02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:15.460]   was the patent trolling thing, which I think is fascinating.
[02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:16.820]   Oh, I was going to talk about that.
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:18.340]   And I just-- because Danny wanted to get out of here,
[02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:19.180]   I didn't.
[02:04:19.180 --> 02:04:19.660]   I love you.
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:20.340]   Let's mention it.
[02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:23.060]   It's kind of complicated to explain.
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:23.900]   Sure.
[02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:28.900]   Is it that or is it the one about these weird cases,
[02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:30.300]   the suspicious court cases?
[02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:32.020]   Which one is it that you want to talk about?
[02:04:32.020 --> 02:04:33.100]   I would do the patent one.
[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:34.940]   But the court cases one is interesting too.
[02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:36.900]   They're related.
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:38.020]   They're related.
[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:39.340]   Kind of.
[02:04:39.340 --> 02:04:41.220]   The other one's more of a section 230 thing.
[02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:41.740]   OK.
[02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:43.460]   So do that one.
[02:04:43.460 --> 02:04:44.740]   So just do this one first.
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:49.580]   So the suspicious court cases, they want people--
[02:04:49.580 --> 02:04:52.620]   they want stuff taken down.
[02:04:52.620 --> 02:04:55.060]   So let's say you're not living in Europe
[02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:56.100]   with the right to be forgotten.
[02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:59.500]   But you want Google to take down that article.
[02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:02.420]   The problem is Google or Yelp or a lot of places
[02:05:02.420 --> 02:05:03.740]   won't do it just because you ask them.
[02:05:03.740 --> 02:05:05.940]   On the other hand, if you get a court order saying
[02:05:05.940 --> 02:05:08.220]   it's defamatory, well, then they're
[02:05:08.220 --> 02:05:09.540]   going to take it down.
[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:10.940]   How do you get the court order?
[02:05:10.940 --> 02:05:14.780]   You do a fake lawsuit with fake defendants.
[02:05:14.780 --> 02:05:15.460]   You're both sides--
[02:05:15.460 --> 02:05:16.940]   The same name as the person.
[02:05:16.940 --> 02:05:17.300]   Yeah.
[02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:17.980]   The same name.
[02:05:17.980 --> 02:05:20.300]   That's critical so that the order looks the same.
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:23.220]   You play both sides as the defendant.
[02:05:23.220 --> 02:05:24.780]   You say, oh, you're right.
[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:26.340]   It was defamatory.
[02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:28.140]   The court goes, oh, well, case closed.
[02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:29.140]   It's defamatory.
[02:05:29.140 --> 02:05:30.380]   Issues in order.
[02:05:30.380 --> 02:05:33.060]   Which you send to Google saying, see, it's defamatory.
[02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:34.900]   And Danny Sullivan says so.
[02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:36.820]   And they pull it down.
[02:05:36.820 --> 02:05:40.500]   And Washington Post has found at least 25 court cases.
[02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:42.740]   And I bet there's many, many more.
[02:05:42.740 --> 02:05:45.820]   The suspicion is that it's reputation defense companies
[02:05:45.820 --> 02:05:46.620]   that are doing these.
[02:05:46.620 --> 02:05:48.940]   You pay them a lot of money.
[02:05:48.940 --> 02:05:49.420]   Right.
[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:51.900]   And what they're doing is basically
[02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:56.100]   they're going into a jurisdiction, making up a plaintiff,
[02:05:56.100 --> 02:05:59.500]   making up a defendant with the same-- it's very brazen--
[02:05:59.500 --> 02:06:03.340]   with the same name or somehow that could easily
[02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:06.380]   be confused for the same person that you would
[02:06:06.380 --> 02:06:10.940]   like to sue for real, have them plea.
[02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:13.500]   So for instance, Matthew Chan, a Georgia resident,
[02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:16.700]   posts a negative review of a Georgia dentist on Yelp
[02:06:16.700 --> 02:06:18.740]   in a few other sites.
[02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:20.980]   Several months after he put up his post Yelp emails,
[02:06:20.980 --> 02:06:23.220]   I'm saying it's about to take his comment down
[02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:26.820]   because it got a court order that says the comments
[02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:27.340]   defamatory.
[02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:28.180]   But wait, says Chan.
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:29.140]   No one sued me.
[02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:30.500]   How'd you get a court order?
[02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:35.120]   Well, the suit was against a Matthew Chan of Baltimore,
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:38.020]   who doesn't, by the way, exist.
[02:06:38.020 --> 02:06:41.120]   It was filed in court by somebody apparently working
[02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:43.920]   on behalf of the dentist.
[02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:47.060]   And well, actually the dentist says, well, we didn't do it,
[02:06:47.060 --> 02:06:49.960]   but we did hire reputation management company.
[02:06:49.960 --> 02:06:51.740]   And so the reputation management company
[02:06:51.740 --> 02:06:55.060]   goes to another jurisdiction, in this case, Baltimore,
[02:06:55.060 --> 02:06:58.040]   files suit, and then responds to the suit saying, yes,
[02:06:58.040 --> 02:06:59.300]   your honor, you're absolutely right.
[02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:00.180]   It was defamatory.
[02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:01.160]   I'm sorry.
[02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:03.600]   And then they have a court order that says Matthew Chan agreed.
[02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:07.600]   It's not illegal.
[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:08.600]   Is it?
[02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:10.120]   Well, no, it's impersonation of a sort.
[02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:12.280]   Yeah, your impersonation, even though the name is the same,
[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:13.920]   you're impersonating someone.
[02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:16.120]   I think that that does sound like it's illegal to me,
[02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:16.960]   but I don't know.
[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:19.960]   Well, it would be up to the court that's being horn swaddled
[02:07:19.960 --> 02:07:22.200]   to do something about it, I guess.
[02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:24.920]   Lawsuits, post found lawsuits in California, Florida,
[02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:27.880]   Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Texas.
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:31.440]   Half of them have been in the Baltimore area in Philadelphia,
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:33.040]   which means it's probably a company
[02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:34.600]   in that doing business in that area.
[02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:36.440]   It's fascinating.
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:36.960]   Fascinating.
[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:38.200]   Anyway, that's a great story.
[02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:40.560]   And then the other story is a judge
[02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:45.480]   wants to make patent trolling a First Amendment issue.
[02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:48.640]   Well, so this is interest for me in that this is how far this
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:50.240]   has moved.
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:53.840]   So having been someone who's campaigned
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:55.560]   against software patents for a long time with people
[02:07:55.560 --> 02:08:00.200]   and I set up fixed patents.org and handed it over
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:02.360]   to an engine advocacy later on when
[02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:03.360]   they took up the calls.
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:06.640]   And by the way, we're very helpful in the podcast
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:07.920]   troll patent troll case.
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:10.800]   Thank you for providing some prior art and so forth.
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:12.120]   I think it was very helpful.
[02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:15.400]   So the thing is that it seems that that actually has moved.
[02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:19.440]   We have the Alice judgment now, which says, which is being used
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:20.240]   as the precedent here.
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:21.240]   And we're starting to see it.
[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:24.680]   The precedent's being written up where basically just saying,
[02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:27.720]   add a computer to something no longer makes it patentable.
[02:08:27.720 --> 02:08:29.520]   And those kinds of patents are being challenged.
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:32.320]   And basically, this judge is taking a bit further
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:35.800]   and saying there are ways of using patent trolling
[02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:36.960]   to suppress speech.
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:39.720]   And we don't want to do that.
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:41.160]   So that's--
[02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:42.840]   Wow, that's an interesting take.
[02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:44.040]   Yeah.
[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:45.320]   So this is interesting.
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:48.560]   But it's also-- the thing for me,
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:49.760]   as if you look at the trend on this,
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:50.720]   is this is very encouraging.
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:53.320]   Because we've had lots of very, very stupid patents
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:55.080]   and many of the mid-around software.
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:58.880]   And the Samsung Apple One and the Supreme Court
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:00.880]   about design patents, I think, is also, you know,
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:01.920]   factitious.
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:06.240]   But this is a sign that things are moving in a good direction,
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:07.600]   which is good.
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:10.040]   Or it may be just that computer firms are better at lobbying
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:12.080]   now than telco firms.
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:14.800]   There may be a sign of the shift in that direction.
[02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:17.040]   We point you at Sarah Zhang's article
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:19.200]   in the October 7th in the Verge.
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:21.640]   A judge wants to make patent trolling a First Amendment
[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:25.680]   issue if you want to understand this in a greater detail.
[02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:26.560]   It's good.
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:28.120]   Sarah is very good at covering these things.
[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:29.600]   She's a great legal writer.
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:32.720]   Yeah, she was writing about what was great.
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:34.040]   A good, good, good, good, an article.
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:34.880]   The Google R--
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:38.440]   She did such a great live blog of that.
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:39.520]   Hey, we're out of time.
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:40.360]   But thank you so much.
[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:41.440]   So much fun as always.
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:43.440]   I just-- this is one of the shows I really miss doing.
[02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:45.920]   Because it's like, you know, I just keep asking--
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:46.720]   We missed you.
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:48.000]   What would Jeff say?
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.160]   Stacey was not here this week.
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:50.280]   I presume she'll be back next week.
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:51.600]   She was traveling somewhere where there was
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:53.720]   an internet connection.
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:56.280]   But we will get her back on next week, I hope.
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:56.760]   Right?
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:58.000]   Carson, she could be here next week.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:09:58.520]   Yes.
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:09:59.000]   All right.
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:09:59.320]   Good.
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:01.200]   I will be in Frankfurt.
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:03.320]   So I'm going to look up the hotel.
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:05.680]   I hear they have internet in Germany now.
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:06.560]   Well, you wouldn't know.
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:08.360]   Sometimes these hotels.
[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:09.040]   Well, you--
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:10.040]   T-Mobile works there.
[02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:10.720]   It's in the--
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:11.600]   Actually, yeah.
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:14.320]   Your T-Mobile should work great.
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:16.520]   Should work great.
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:17.400]   Well, I'll give you a car.
[02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:18.720]   No, we'll send you a whole last book.
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:19.480]   Good.
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:20.320]   Well, I hope we have you.
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:23.640]   If not, we will have a significant replacement
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:25.480]   of some sort.
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:26.880]   Someone worthy of--
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:31.520]   Someone with your intellectual stature to replace you.
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:33.200]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:34.360]   at the City University of New York.
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:36.600]   He also writes at buzzmachine.com.
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:38.320]   You'll find his articles on Medium frequently.
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:40.400]   And look for his books, great books.
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:41.200]   What would Google do?
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:42.800]   Public parts?
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:45.240]   Gutenberg the Geek, which is an Amazon single,
[02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:47.320]   Kindle single.
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:50.000]   And the latest Geek's bearing gifts.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.920]   How to reinvent news.
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:54.720]   Always a pleasure, JJ.
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:55.640]   Always, sir.
[02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:57.840]   Are you going back to Pennsylvania?
[02:10:57.840 --> 02:10:58.760]   Oh, yeah, every weekend.
[02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:00.280]   Going to knock on some doors.
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:00.800]   I'm going to--
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:01.840]   You're living PA.
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:03.160]   Look for JJ.
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:03.680]   Yep.
[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:03.960]   Yep.
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:06.400]   I'm going to go canvas and get the vote out.
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:07.280]   Yep.
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:07.680]   You know what?
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:09.680]   Getting the vote out and registering people, that's great.
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:10.960]   That's God's work.
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:12.400]   It is.
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:14.080]   I'll confess it was scary the first time.
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:14.640]   You know, it won't be--
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:15.200]   I'd be terrifying.
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:16.160]   --strangers doors.
[02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:16.680]   Yeah.
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:19.320]   But do you say that you're doing it partizently?
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:21.400]   Or do you say, "I'd just like to register you"?
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:22.480]   Yeah, I wear this.
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:23.000]   Oh, OK.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:24.360]   So they know.
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:25.400]   You got the hoodie.
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:27.920]   He's got the hoodie.
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:31.600]   Kevin Marks, indiewebcamp.org.
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:36.840]   He is fighting for the right to party.
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:38.720]   KevinMarkz.com, if you want to know more.
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:40.000]   The right to third party website.
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.400]   The right to third party.
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:42.560]   I like it.
[02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:45.320]   Fight for the right to third party.
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:46.760]   Yeah.
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:50.400]   We do this show every Wednesday at 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern,
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:51.840]   2030 UTC.
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:53.960]   Come be in the studio with us.
[02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:56.480]   Email tickets@twit.tv if you'd like to.
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:58.480]   It's always nice to have a studio audience.
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:01.360]   But you can also watch live on our stream.
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:04.360]   We stream everything we do because we're just crazy that way.
[02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:07.600]   And you can also be in our chat room, IRC.twit.tv.
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:10.000]   And that runs pretty much 24/7.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.680]   If you can't be here live or on the internet,
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:14.920]   make sure you download an episode--
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:17.560]   audio and video available at twit.tv/twig.
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:20.240]   Or wherever you get your podcasts, in fact,
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:21.960]   you could subscribe that way.
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:25.320]   And you won't miss an episode.
[02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:26.280]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:28.520]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:29.960]   Bye-bye.
