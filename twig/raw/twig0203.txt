[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It's time for this week in Google. Twig is on the Airelyo report here with Gina Tarpani from SmarterWear.org. Hello, Gina.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Hello, how are you? Good to see you. Good to see you too.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Jeff Jarvis is here. He's in Nuremberg, Germany from Buzzmachine.com, Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York, the author of Public Parts.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Did you say paperback is coming out now?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   No, they're not doing paperback.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Oh, I hate publishers.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Damn them.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Is there an ebook?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Yes, there is. There has been.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Welcome.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Is it late at night? No, it's only 837.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It is 1030.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   1030. Okay.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Well, we won't keep you up too long.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I'll just follow.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I'll just follow.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   What do you do?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Oh, and Kevin Purdy is also here.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Hey, Kevin.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Hello.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Great to see you too.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Long time no see.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Yes, I'll have been secretly doing things.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Kevin is the author of the complete Android guide.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   What are you carrying these days?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I guess you probably carry them all.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Phone wise?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Galaxy Nexus, yo.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   You're a Nexus 4 guy.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   No, no, Galaxy Nexus.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Galaxy that old, huh?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Oh, geez.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Well, outside of the...
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   In the first world that I live in, I'm thinking about getting HTC One as is Gina.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I love the HTC One.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   However...
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Oh, the Google E version that comes out in a week.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Well, that'll be interesting.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   See, I feel like there's things on Sense.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   We talked about this, Gina.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   The camera and the gallery after you really want.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Yeah, you know, I haven't had it yet, so I'm not convinced that I'm going to miss it.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   But yeah, the ZO-E is cool.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Like, I've seen, you know...
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Yeah, they're great.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   That most of you have done have been really cool.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   But then, again, I look at Google Plus and say, "Look at all the cool stuff they're doing.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   The photos there."
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I could have my, you know, auto-awesome gifts and all that stuff.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Would you get that too?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   That way.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   You also get that.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.120]   It'll give you an auto-awesome or a ZO-E.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.440]   I have to say, I also have the Galaxy S4 and this is the international unlocked one.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.760]   Yesterday, Samsung pushed out a firmware update for the camera that fixed my camera flaws
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.760]   with the S4.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.000]   So now, I don't...
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.720]   I'm thinking that the HTC One is less, for me, desirable.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.720]   I would...
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.800]   I would, if I were you...
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   Are they...
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.360]   Is Google gonna offer a 32 gigabyte version of the S4?
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.600]   I believe so.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   That might be the way to go.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.040]   The stock edition Google S4.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.040]   That...
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.200]   Then, I don't know, the camera on this is really good.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.680]   13 megapixel cameras.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.320]   Beautiful.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.920]   And now that they fixed the firmware, it was crashing a lot.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.560]   And now that they fixed the firmware, it's good.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.520]   Now, remember, we still got the Moto X.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.520]   That's true.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.320]   There's always a new thing around the corner.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.320]   Kai Kawasaki.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.320]   Kai Kawasaki.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.440]   There's a name you remember.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.080]   Is now working at Motorola.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.080]   Oh, really?
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.800]   Yes, and invited me to an event at the Googleplex next month.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   Oh.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.440]   Just like in a broad invite sensor, do you hand you a card or something?
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.600]   He sent me an email and said I would like you to come.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.800]   It's gonna be a small get together of about 50 journalists.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.800]   Oh.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.920]   I'm thinking Moto X.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.920]   I'm hoping Moto X.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.640]   Maybe there's a really awesome cable modem coming.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.880]   The new set top box is here.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.680]   You guys are getting it before even the cable installers are getting it.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.480]   I'm hopeful.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.560]   Now, of course, a lot of the rumors about the Moto X are it's kind of a low end phone, not
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.560]   the high end phone we were hoping for.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.320]   I'm going to be like the Nexus 7.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.120]   Maybe it'll be remarkably cheap for what it is and smooth and impressive.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.120]   Well said.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.520]   Well, I can't wait.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.120]   But it's Motorola at Google.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.120]   It's a good sign.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.440]   First time I think they've admitted it.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.760]   And yeah, we own that company.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.920]   Yeah, we own them.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.920]   Did he count us off?
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.520]   Did he work at Google and then move to Motorola?
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.520]   No, no, no.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.840]   He was remember for a long time he was the Apple evangelist, the very first evangelist.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.880]   And then independent for a long time, he's written a number of great books, his book
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.880]   on startups.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.400]   Google Plus lately.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.080]   He has been the king of Google Plus for the last two years.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.240]   By the way, happy birthday Google Plus.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.240]   Is it two?
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.240]   Is it two years old?
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.240]   Possibly be true.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.240]   No.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.240]   Oh, never mind.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.240]   No, wait.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.240]   We're here.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.240]   We're actually years old.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.240]   Checking, checking.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.240]   Because I thought that they were going to have a.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.240]   Something.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.840]   I just see that seems like so long.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.240]   No, it can't because we're literally we're two years old, right?
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.640]   Chat from do some.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.640]   No, it's PC guys.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.640]   It has to be two years at the end of June.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.640]   Really?
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.640]   Are we?
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.840]   I got invited to the Google Plus two year anniversary photo walk.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.600]   And parade and marathon and photo pop lip and Google Palooza in New York sponsored by
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.880]   Smug Mug and that's June 29th.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.720]   Why didn't they invite me?
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.840]   I'm in New York and you're not.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:40.640]   Can I add please invite Jeff Jarvis because I love Smug Mug.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.640]   That's why.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.840]   Yeah, you're old in two years.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.680]   Feels like two weeks and launched in 28 2011.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.080]   Two years.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.320]   Who's food and nude?
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.680]   Well, happy birthday Google Plus.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.640]   And I have to say I'm using it a lot more after they keep adding features.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.120]   They keep pulling me in.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:07.280]   They also fixed the multi four tiered slide bar problem with the alerts.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.080]   And have you got the new notifications?
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.080]   The little the bell.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.240]   I haven't gotten the bell yet.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.240]   The bell?
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.240]   Have you?
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.240]   I have a bell.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.240]   You have the bell?
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.240]   Yes, I have the bell.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.520]   The disadvantage is you get rid of the literally four slide bars it had.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:33.320]   The disadvantage is besides it making you very fuzzy on twig is that it's sorry video
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.920]   people is that it's a more solid experience of the notifications.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.080]   It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.080]   Yeah, I don't have it.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.320]   But everybody's been crazy about it.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.320]   So that's good.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.320]   I want the bell.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.320]   I keep shift refreshing.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.320]   I get the bell.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.320]   Look.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   Chad has the bell.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.320]   That's what's new.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.320]   It holds on to it.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.320]   You can't next next next.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:08:02.440]   Go to the item and then back, which is rather silly.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.280]   Well they're always tweaking it.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.280]   Can you?
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.240]   Jason says you can.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.240]   You can?
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.240]   How do you go next?
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.000]   No, it's up in the corner.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.760]   You have a previous and next button.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.560]   You really do look like Ferris Bueller.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.040]   I try.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.240]   I love this beam this week.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.240]   Isn't he?
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.760]   That's all folks mean.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.280]   I look like the turkey.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.600]   What was it?
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.680]   The Hungarian flag was the...
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.560]   You look like the Hungarian flag.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.920]   The meme is what is Chad Johnson look like?
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:36.920]   Pretty much.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.920]   Wow.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:38.920]   You're a meme?
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   God, I'm jealous.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.920]   I've never been a meme.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.920]   Wow.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.920]   Dye your hair, Leo.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.400]   That'd be fun.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.440]   What color would you dye your hair, Leo, if you were feeling
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.040]   adventuresome?
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.040]   Brown.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.960]   I always wanted brown hair.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.960]   You could look like this.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.120]   You do look like the Hungarian flag.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.760]   That's all folks.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.840]   I don't think that's on the Hungarian flag.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.840]   Yep.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   I like purple.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.600]   I don't know what should I do.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.000]   What color would go well with my olive skin?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.160]   My bright white teeth and my shining brown eyes.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.160]   Black.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.160]   Black.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.640]   Alright, so let's move on.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.640]   Limited time.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.640]   We've got to move.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.600]   Jeff's going to fall asleep.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.640]   Kevin's going to turn into a pumpkin.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.640]   Projects loon.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:37.160]   On Sunday we had Trey Rakcliffe on Twit because he was one of a couple of people.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.440]   It was Stephen Levy of Wired and Trey Rakcliffe.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:47.240]   Who were invited to go up in the helicopter and watch the launch of the first Google
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.400]   Project Loon Balloons.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.480]   They go up in the sky.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:58.040]   These balloons, eventually Google hopes this is a Project X plan to provide 3G quality
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:03.720]   internet access to the entire globe from hundreds of these balloons floating 10 miles
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.880]   up in the stratosphere, well above the commercial aviation traffic.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.640]   The advantages of being so high is they can tune these balloons.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.640]   There's two chambers.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.400]   There's a helium chamber and an air chamber.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:22.000]   They can tune these balloons remotely to make them go up or down to catch the particular
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   jet stream flow to move these balloons to keep them in position.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.280]   Are there humans actually making them go up and down to catch the right airframe?
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.280]   That's a good question.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.280]   Or is it just autonomous?
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.280]   Of course not.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.280]   An algorithm does that.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.720]   Well, only if you consider a Python program a human.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.080]   There's a dot pie.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.480]   It's a dot pie.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.080]   Or is it a dot pie?
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.520]   Are they pulling the signal from cell towers on the ground?
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.480]   Not cell towers specifically.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.280]   They're towers designed to do this from cities.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.720]   Oh, that was going to say if you let airline passengers know that balloons can do this
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.720]   but they can't, man.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.920]   It's going to destroy the navigation.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.480]   We're going down.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.720]   These are the-- pause that, Chad.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.720]   Pause that.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.560]   These are what you get.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.160]   It looks like a red Tootsie Pop antenna.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.760]   This is what people in New Zealand who are the first beta testers of this will get.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.520]   Somebody said it kind of looks like a place pin on Google Maps.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.520]   No, it does.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.520]   You think that's attention?
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.960]   3G level at best, I think, right?
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.960]   Well, I don't know.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.120]   Trey said he was really impressed.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.680]   It was very fast.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.680]   Really?
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.680]   So I don't know.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.680]   It's a whole dot expectations.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.680]   I don't know.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.680]   It's going to be far.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.080]   I mean, 10 miles is a long way away and the latency is going to be horrendous.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.800]   Every time I see photos in New Zealand, I always just want to move there.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.080]   I want to be a hobbit when I see photos in New Zealand.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.080]   Yeah, but not only--
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.080]   I mean, like a balloon test photos and the videos are just amazing looking.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.080]   That's-- it's very-- what's interesting in-- I don't know if it's intentional.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.040]   It's very near Queenstown where Trey lives.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.400]   So he and his family drove over and got in the helicopter.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.120]   He got in the helicopter and watched us and made some great movies.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.840]   You can catch those on StuckInCustoms.com.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.320]   Jeff Levy's writing articles for Wired about this as well.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.480]   Better latency than a satellite.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.480]   That's a good point.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.920]   I mean, my satellite has bad latency, but it won't be as bad as that.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.360]   The point of this is to get to remote areas that just simply can't be covered and have
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.520]   enough balloons up there.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.280]   You can cover-- you know, if we can bring internet connectivity to huge swag of the
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.560]   earth, imagine what happens when there's power there.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.200]   And nobody better to do this in Google.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.480]   You wouldn't see-- there's no extra governmental organization that's going to do this.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.480]   No NGO.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.480]   That's the other great thing.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.720]   If they can put some servers up there, maybe we're safe from the NSA.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.480]   I think the NSA can even tap the stratosphere.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.400]   However, you know, it isn't-- this is Google's mandate.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.400]   They've always said this.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.160]   The more you use the internet, the more we make.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.760]   They might charge for this, but I don't think this would be a business anymore than
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.480]   Gigabit is a business for them.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.560]   This opens up entire new nations.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.560]   There are--
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.280]   They call it the last mile problem, right?
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.760]   Yeah, last 10 miles, yeah.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.640]   Last 10 miles.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.600]   There are 5 billion people who don't have internet access.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:20.040]   So you're talking about a significant increase in your market share.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.040]   And they're solar powered, which is really cool.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.040]   Yep.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.040]   Yep.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.400]   They are set up in such a way that they can take them down when they wear out.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.400]   Yeah, they wear out.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.320]   They take them down in the recycle apart, which is cool.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.400]   They're landing-- or collection areas, right, that they can steer them to, which is really
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.400]   neat.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.720]   I wonder how that has to be coordinated with air traffic control, though.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.720]   That's what--
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.720]   The up and down.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.520]   Well, you know, it's not that crowd out there.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.160]   Coming down to Earth.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.960]   I don't think this is the Leo question, but when can I buy one?
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.960]   Cool.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.440]   The Kevin Purdy balloon.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.400]   There they are going up in New Zealand.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.200]   This is-- is this a Trey Rachlos video?
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.840]   Yeah, this is one of Trey's videos.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.200]   The one he was talking about with the technical demo still hasn't been approved yet, so it's
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.200]   not up yet.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.200]   Right.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.760]   But he apparently was able to go to the staging, uh, uh, uh, Quonset hut and record a bunch
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.240]   of tech talks and whiteboard stuff.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.840]   And he's hoping-- Google has to approve it before he can oppose it, but he's hoping to
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.720]   post it that would give us a lot of more tech information.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.800]   This is recorded using his Google class.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.720]   Yeah, pretty neat, huh?
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   Oh.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.720]   Pretty neat.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   I guess that's his son.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.720]   I guess he did bring his kids.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.720]   Either that or he's scratching Stephen Levy's hair, which is a little bit--
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.240]   --and now he was on the right.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.240]   OK.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.240]   That was a son.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.240]   Look at that.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.240]   That's really amazing.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.480]   These are more robust than weather balloons.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.400]   They're pretty tough.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.280]   So is the solar stuff on the top of it and that on the bottom is the transmission piece?
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.280]   I don't know.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.280]   We'll have to--
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.640]   Well, from-- if you look at this photo, it looks like that bottom piece is-- has the
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.640]   top layer is-- is--
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.640]   Oh, it does.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.640]   OK, yes.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.640]   There you go.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.640]   Yep, yep, yep.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.120]   The other thing with this is it's a mesh network.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.120]   Right.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.440]   They connect with each other, the balloons network with each other to do things.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.000]   And they need that because most of them are not over these uplink facilities.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.680]   Those are in major urban areas.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.080]   So only one has to be above an uplink.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.800]   They uplink and then it spreads it via mesh to all the other balloons.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.440]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.840]   It's amazing that the 2013 solution to this looks a lot like what would probably be the
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.840]   1913 solution.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:22.840]   I know.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.840]   You know what?
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.560]   That's really out of the box thinking.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.560]   And I love it.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.440]   But you know, I just think that's great.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.120]   I am thrilled.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.040]   And I think this might actually work.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.960]   This is, by the way, not the first time people have talked about something like this.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.280]   Even a few months ago, Google was saying, we're going to do this in Africa.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.080]   But I've heard of-- remember somebody was going to do an internet where it was planes
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.680]   that were always up in the air?
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.280]   This was quite a few years ago.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.280]   That's too expensive, obviously.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.880]   Well, there were airships not long ago.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.320]   Yeah, I'm not sure why they don't use Zeppelin's to do this.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.000]   But I guess this is the same thing, right?
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   They're lower towels.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Little less expensive.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   They need fuel.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   That's why.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Isn't that cool?
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   It's really cool.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   What strikes me about it is that it doesn't look very futuristic.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   I mean, they look like floating garbage bags.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   It's really cool.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Right?
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   I mean, I would be like, oh.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   I remember Bill Gates--
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.360]   That's the land of the ocean and chokes and fish, you know?
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.840]   Bill Gates spent a billion-- I think a billion dollars on Teladesic, which was designed to
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.320]   put low Earth orbit satellites up doing the same thing.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.960]   But this is so much more economical.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.960]   So small.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.960]   Well, that's great.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.960]   Harmless science experiments.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.720]   Yeah, that's if it crashes.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.880]   It was science experiments.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.880]   It's hard.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.240]   Do not-- it is not a bomb.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.960]   It is not for the NSA.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.800]   Well, maybe it is.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.800]   We laugh because we're scared.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.720]   You always joke about the thing that most worries you.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:03.440]   By the way, this is now confirmed from Microsoft and their Xbox newsroom.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.160]   Don Matric, who is president of an interactive entertainment business.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:14.360]   Microsoft is backing down on the most criticized feature of its new Xbox One, which will be
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.960]   out later in the year.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.040]   This is frankly a stunner.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.600]   When I first heard this, Jeff Gerstberg, Gerstenberg from a giant bomb broke the story, I didn't
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.920]   believe it.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:31.000]   Microsoft will not require an internet connection to play Xbox One games offline.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.880]   You can set it up and then once get online and from then on, it will work just like an
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.680]   Xbox 360.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.600]   You will be able-- there will be no limitations according to Microsoft.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.480]   Using and sharing games, it will work just as it does today on the Xbox 360.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.400]   You can lend, resell, gift, and rent disk-based games.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:56.720]   Microsoft has, for the second time in living memory, completely back down the first time,
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.360]   of course, is Windows 8.1 where they put the desktop back.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.360]   What a shocker.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.120]   I didn't think this was possible because, of course, this is all at the behest of publishers.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:12.960]   They must have-- I mean, they have, I guess, enough cloud to say to the Electra-- yay.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.600]   What was this how we're going to do it?
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.600]   We're getting a lot of heat from the military, from soldiers.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:23.080]   We want to bring this out to-- we love these games during our downtime.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.480]   We don't have internet access in Afghanistan, always.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.040]   Yeah, that's a big PR problem.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.040]   PR problems.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.720]   We're keeping the soldiers from enjoying our games.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.720]   Like, that's a problem.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.000]   That's probably why it's in the backtrack on that.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.160]   Well, and PlayStation was also eating their lunch.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.200]   Everybody was saying, "I'm going to buy a PlayStation."
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.200]   I thought that's breaking news.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.200]   I thought I'd mention it doesn't really have anything to do with Google.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.720]   Little bit to do with the cloud.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.880]   Never bothers us.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:56.200]   No, I never stopped us before.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.880]   Let's take a break and do the change log.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.440]   Do we have some good change log stuff today?
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.440]   Let me just--
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.280]   Yeah, we got a couple of good things.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.280]   Sure.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.160]   All right, we'll do a change log in a moment.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.160]   Sound the horns.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.120]   Yeah, not yet.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.160]   We'll give you some time to warm yourself up.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.160]   OK, OK, OK.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.640]   Maybe just a little quiet horn in the background.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.640]   Put your glass on.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.640]   OK, there.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.640]   There you go.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.640]   That's all we get.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.640]   Just to get you in the mood, do you get nervous?
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.640]   You're home for sure, Randy.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:28.840]   All right, show today brought to you by 99designs.com, a great marketplace that brings really talented
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:34.680]   designers together with people who need graphics, art, design, better looking menus
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.800]   and apps, better looking t-shirts, two at last count.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:47.160]   232,515 designers are on 99designs.com.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.160]   Here's what you do.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.760]   You post-- they call it a contest.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.360]   You post your contest on 99designs.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.760]   There are 1,952 open contests.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.560]   That's why there's so many designers there.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.600]   You go there and the designers-- you say, I need a t-shirt design.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.320]   This is what we did, by the way.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.320]   Designers will submit their specs.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.320]   You go back and forth.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.960]   You pick the winner.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.040]   And you pay that person, and it's very affordable.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.600]   We paid $199 for our t-shirt design.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.000]   It's a good one too.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Looks good.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.440]   We'll love-- fact, love it.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.440]   Lots of people come in.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:23.080]   These are all-- we've got some great submissions that we had our audience vote.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:28.560]   99designs paid out $1.7 million to graphic artists last month.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.840]   A total of 50-- almost $55 million.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:39.400]   This is a system that works a marketplace for designers and people who need design.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.640]   Here's how it works.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.280]   Go to 99designs.com/twig.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.680]   And they're going to set you up with a $99 power pack of services for free.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.800]   The power pack gives you more designer time and attention.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.680]   99designs will bold, highlight, and feature your design product in their marketplace,
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680]   your project.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.360]   In their marketplace, you'll get nearly twice as many designs as a result.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.960]   They also have a great San Francisco-based design team that can work with you to hone
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.200]   your request.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   And the price is incredible.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.480]   Logo design starts at $299.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.480]   Web design.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.120]   A full website, $599 and up.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.480]   Landing pages, Facebook cover design, banner ads, infographics, $199 and up.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:26.280]   Brochures, flyers, menus, all that print stuff, greeting cards, product packaging, even.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.760]   $199 and up.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.880]   What's great about this is bringing great design to the world.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.840]   Stuff doesn't have to look so bad anymore.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.840]   Thanks to 99designs.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:40.360]   We're going to talk to them about, Lisa's going to yell at me for saying this.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:46.160]   We're going to work on a mobile app for a Twit, but it's not going to be a game.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.960]   Oh, cool.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   Really?
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.960]   Shh.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.960]   Don't tell Lisa I said that.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.760]   99designs is going to help us.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.360]   We're going to get the design, but they're going to hook us up with the programmers too.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.240]   I promise it'll be Android as well as I do.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.400]   They'll do that too.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.960]   Yeah, they do it all.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.960]   They're great.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.960]   Oh.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.960]   99designs.com.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.960]   Well, they do it for us.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.760]   I presume they'll do it for you too.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.760]   Yes, they will.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.840]   805131678.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.280]   That's a special number just for TwiG listeners.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:18.160]   805131678 or visit them online at our special site.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:23.560]   99desiGNS.com/Twig.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.560]   99designs.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.080]   Yeah, they're really great people.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.320]   I'm really excited about this, but I don't want to say anymore.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.320]   I have two.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.320]   I want to ask you questions and I'm just reading myself.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.560]   You may not be as excited as it's not anything that will play back podcasts.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.560]   That all exists.
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.480]   It's something for fun.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.240]   No, no, I, that's exciting.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.800]   Gina and Dorsey's fun.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.800]   I like fun.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.880]   You'll like this.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.920]   You may even be a character in the game, Mr. Fanny.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.920]   No way.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.320]   In fact, I could pretty much guarantee that you will be.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.320]   Oh, man.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.320]   Whoa.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.320]   Whoa, you, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.320]   That's very exciting.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.320]   That's very exciting.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.320]   Ooh.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.320]   Now I'm a little--
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:06.320]   Can't believe it's a little church in a game.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:12.320]   I shouldn't say anything because there's many a slip, twix, the cup and the lip, but
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.320]   that's our plan anyway.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.440]   Very intriguing.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:23.880]   A link to Major Nelson's blog from our chat room.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:29.720]   Very interesting saying that Major Nelson said we feel like we had to listen.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.720]   Wow.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.360]   What a thought.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.920]   Your feedback matters.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:39.040]   Of course, that site is very, very, very slow because everything having to do with this
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.240]   is very, very, very slow right now.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.240]   That's fascinating.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.240]   It's great.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.320]   It's kind of unheard of.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:53.840]   I encourage you to read the entire post from Don Mattrick for additional details.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.240]   No regional restrictions.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.440]   Thank you for your continued support.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.280]   Larry Herb, Xbox Live's Major Nelson.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.280]   Wow.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.560]   That is a big deal.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.800]   That is a big deal.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:08.240]   You don't see big companies like Microsoft turn on a dime like that usually.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.240]   Not that quickly even.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:18.600]   Privacy authorities say Google, you got some splaining to do.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:25.480]   In particular with glass and letter address to Larry Page 10.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:34.800]   Privacy authorities from all over the world.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.240]   And they all got together.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.200]   And they want their eight questions around privacy issues.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.440]   Will the guy next to be wearing these at the urinal?
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.440]   One of the questions.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.440]   Probably is one.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.800]   Did they send a letter to Mr. Kodak?
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.720]   They would if they could.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.520]   Are you trying to steal our souls?
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.520]   Canada.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.520]   Yes.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.520]   Right.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.520]   Pictures.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.520]   No.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:10.160]   Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Israel, Mexico, Switzerland.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:17.400]   Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard got an up close look at glass earlier this year.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:22.520]   Let's book in Southern Australian Liberal Senator Corey Bernardi labeled glass the end of privacy.
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.800]   Oh, come on.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.440]   It really is just a camera.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.720]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.200]   It's a piece of hardware.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   And they don't even understand that anybody can create software for something.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.120]   I can make a hardware to mobile.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.520]   I couldn't actually anyone can make a piece of hardware tomorrow camera and make it small
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.400]   and do anything with it.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.760]   It's big, bad, ugly American company time.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.760]   Right.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.320]   Yeah, I noticed it's not coming from the US.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.440]   They want to know how glass complies with data protection laws, what privacy safeguards
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.760]   are, what information Google collects through glass, who that information is shared with
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.760]   NSA, and whether Google has undertaken a privacy risk assessment.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:08.920]   Oh, it's a smartphone on your face.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.280]   They said it's not different.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.600]   And then they said, can you come over and show us?
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.280]   And by the way, we'd like some.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.800]   They want to test it for themselves.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.760]   Yes, we'd like to be glass explorers, please.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.760]   That's all Google just needs to give them some glasses.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.520]   We have less misinformation.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.520]   Right.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.760]   Oh, well.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:36.960]   Google's head engineer says we're going to be able to live forever within the next 20
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.960]   years.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.120]   Ray Kurzweil has been saying this for a while, but now he's Google's head engineer.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.120]   Holy new.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.120]   I was a real Kurzweil.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.120]   I don't know.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.120]   Okay.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.120]   Exactly.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.120]   I got all excited.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.720]   You mean somebody besides Ray Kurzweil says this?
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   No, just Ray.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.720]   No, it's Ray.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   It's just Ray.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:59.080]   He's subtitle of his last book was, I want to live long enough to live forever.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.080]   But you know what?
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.080]   That's fine.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.080]   I don't care.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.720]   He's working with somebody to build.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.640]   Who told me this?
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.120]   Was it, I think it was Jason.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.120]   What's his name?
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.120]   Who told me this?
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.960]   The guy we had on triangulation last week, that they're building these robots to pour
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.960]   your brain into.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.000]   They're working on that.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.920]   I just want mine to have a six pack abs.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.840]   That's all I ask.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.680]   Rock solid thighs.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.680]   I want to look like the Henry Cavill guy.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:41.080]   Google will be offering unlimited music free via Starbucks and Google all access.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.000]   Smart move.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.920]   How is it different from, it's not a partnership.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.360]   It's basically a marketing deal.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.360]   Coffee is better with music.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.520]   You go into a Starbucks, you log in to their usual login here to get online.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.560]   While you're logging in, it'll say, "Hey, you can listen to music unlimited while you're
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.800]   here at Starbucks."
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.560]   So that's pretty much like iTunes.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:11.360]   iTunes only gives you one or two songs though, right?
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.440]   Yeah, so they're saying, listen to all the music you want for the two hour slot or whatever
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.640]   you get Wi-Fi at Starbucks.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.400]   All right, we got the trumpets all warmed up.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:27.640]   This would be a good time to play them because it's time for the Google change log.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.040]   The Google change log.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:37.960]   Gee the jimmy, that's the log.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.520]   Google has added a carousel of search results for nearby restaurants and bars and other
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.320]   local places to your search results.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.120]   Yeah, it's really, really nice.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.720]   So if you go to google.com and you type in a query like, "Mexican restaurants I tried
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.560]   here in San Diego," because there's really good Mexican food here in San Diego, and Google
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.560]   will show a horizontal grid of businesses close to your current location across the
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.000]   top.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.800]   And you can click on an image or name to drill down.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:10.160]   You can also scroll, you can zero in on an area on the map shown inside the search results
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.960]   to limit the results to an area on the map.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:17.240]   So let's just get pizza places in more a minute.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:21.240]   Oh, yeah, yeah, really nice.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.080]   Little Italy.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.800]   Yeah, that is cool.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.160]   Yeah, and this has been, I guess this has been available on iPad for tablet users on
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.400]   the iPad for a while, but this is the first time it's showing up in the desktop and it's
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:39.960]   rolling out for in English, but users based in the US today, this week.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.960]   What else?
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:46.640]   Google's got a new recent sign-ins area in your account area.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:51.800]   So if you go to security.google.com, there's a new link, recent activity, and it'll show
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.640]   you a list of your recent sign-ins and other security related actions if you've made a
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:00.880]   new application password, if you change your password, where you signed in from IP address,
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.560]   what kind of device, so it'll say, hey, you signed in from Android device from California
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.440]   here, Chrome here.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:11.400]   This is, this feature is kind of similar to Gmail's recent activity feature, but it's
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.880]   not limited to just Gmail.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.320]   It's whenever and wherever you've logged into your Google account, which is really nice.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.480]   And it's cool across the top, it says like, see something here that you don't recognize,
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.720]   you know, here's where you can change your password.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.480]   So nice little security, security enhancement.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.720]   This was kind of like what was at the bottom of Gmail before, right?
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.720]   Exactly.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:34.920]   Very similar to Gmail's account activity feature, which the Gmail feature is nice because if
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:40.440]   you've enabled, you know, if you've given an app access to your Gmail, like via iMap,
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.960]   and it's kind of constantly accessing it, you can kind of see that like automated, you
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.840]   know, requests, which is nice.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.480]   But this is sign-in, this is general account sign-in, not just Gmail.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.680]   Well, for instance, it tells you when you create application-specific passwords.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.680]   Yes.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.720]   So I did one on June 2nd, and I can even see where I was, because there's a dot on the
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:04.040]   map, I can see what the application was for, you know, what I named it, and I can click
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.840]   manage and delete it if I want.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.840]   That is really great.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.840]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.240]   Boy, everybody should do this.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.240]   That is fabulous.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.480]   Nice transparency about what's going on with your account, especially if you're concerned
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.600]   that there's been unusual activity.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:22.960]   Google's also added 18 new languages for Drive Docs, Sheets and Slides, bringing up the total
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:31.880]   to 65, including Hong Kong Chinese, Estonian, Canadian French, Icelandic, Zulu, Swahili,
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:35.280]   majority of languages supported by the built-in spell checker, and users can switch back
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.760]   and forth between languages.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:41.600]   You can also collaborate on Drive files in one language while your fellow collaborators
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.320]   use another, which is pretty cool.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.320]   Pretty cool.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.920]   Another Google Drive update, you can print Google Forms.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.920]   I love Google Forms.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:55.080]   I feel like it's a really undersung, super handy way to collect data into a spreadsheet.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.720]   Now if you create a form online for people to fill out with drop-downs, radio buttons,
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:03.520]   and text boxes, and text fields, you can hit the print button and Google will create a
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.080]   printable form that makes it--that's easy for people to fill out on paper.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.200]   So you can see their chats got up on screen.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:14.440]   So you can see what the online form looks like and then the digital form is nice to fill
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.440]   in as well.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:19.720]   So you can see really good for students and school.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.560]   And finally, this is not a user thing, but I thought it was kind of fun.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.160]   It's a developer thing.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.800]   Google's announced sneaker nets.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.360]   For developers who want to use Google Cloud Storage, if you've got a hard drive full
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.640]   of so much data that will take too long to transfer it over the internet, you can mail
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.800]   them your hard drive.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.800]   This is a technology they perfected for the NSA, obviously.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.760]   You can share it with the world.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.800]   So if you're a developer, you've got a ton of data, you want to import to Google Cloud
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.480]   Storage, you ship them your hard drive.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.240]   It's got to be from a US address.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:54.600]   And for $80 per hard drive, Google will take the drive and upload the data in a cloud storage
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   for you.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:01.080]   This Google says can be faster or less expensive than transferring data over the internet.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:05.920]   This is a limited preview, and it's just for users with US-based addresses.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.560]   So sneaker net, FedEx.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.000]   FedEx to data to Google.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.360]   Now you can actually do that.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.360]   But that's kind of fun.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.920]   That's all I got.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.920]   That's the changelog.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.880]   That's what's new from Google.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:28.560]   Noam Chomsky says Google Glasses or Wellian, Ridiculous, and destroys people.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.520]   And then after it amastulates you.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:38.960]   In an interview with Laura Flanner's on Grit TV, he says it's also recording as a camera
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.600]   and a recorder, which means everything that's going on around you goes up on the internet.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.400]   And of course, that's wrong.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.400]   It's wrong.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.760]   And this is a guy who hangs out at MIT.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.760]   You did better.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.760]   He had to know better.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.560]   Obviously, not paying that much attention.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:58.640]   But I think that that's the knee jerk reaction of a lot of people to glass is, you know,
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.920]   it's spying on me.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.960]   And the truth is who the hell cares if Google's spying on you now?
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.720]   Now we know we've really got a problem.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.720]   Exactly.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.720]   It's the government.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:12.960]   The government, fancy's itself the protector privacy of the government is our worst privacy.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.280]   That's the bad one.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:19.520]   You know, if Google wants to know what I'm doing so it can serve me ads, that's commerce.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.840]   That is not nearly as scary as being imprisoned for the rest of my life because the government's
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.840]   decided I'm an enemy.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.000]   I also know it.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.680]   I also consent to that and I can withdraw my consent and you can't.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.640]   Yeah, go ahead and try to withdraw your consent from the government.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:33.640]   That's fine.
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:39.480]   David Drummond went into the lion's den, Google this afternoon right before the show, and
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.520]   the Q&A there links up on the rundown.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.720]   And just said straight, you know, he just had repeat the same.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.000]   Sorry, you're disappointed.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.200]   It's not really us.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.480]   The problem you have was with the law.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.880]   And one of the favorite things was, are you lying about anything?
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.040]   Are you forced to lie about it?
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.040]   You're taking these to know.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.040]   But he could be lying about whether he can lie.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.040]   He could be lying about lying, right?
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:04.600]   No, I'm not going to get there.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.600]   Right?
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.840]   I mean, there's no way to know what another lie because they're legally obligated to lie.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:14.240]   Well, Apple released a very strongly worded statement on its website this week in which
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:18.120]   they said, we cannot see what you're doing on FaceTime.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:23.840]   We cannot, it's encrypted and only you have the keys on messages and I message.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.480]   We can't see it.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.480]   But that doesn't really matter because.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:32.760]   To me to ask you, Leo, what would stop now Google from saying we're going to make it
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.720]   a priority to encrypt everything we can encrypt?
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.000]   I don't think it even matters.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.160]   I mean, for one thing, people don't understand that.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:47.160]   And the big question that's raised by this Apple statement is it does seem as if Apple
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:53.120]   can unencrypt the stuff for you when you get a new system, for instance.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.960]   So there's some question about what Apple can and cannot do.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:02.400]   And but even okay, let's say Apple's telling the truth.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.640]   As we well know, the metadata could be even more valuable, not what you're saying, but
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.000]   whom you're talking to.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.080]   And the metadata is what enables them to make a specific warrant request.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.080]   Right.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:20.820]   I think it's, I think it's to me, it's extremely clear that the US government is now saving
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.920]   all electronic transmissions.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.400]   By the way, that's probably true of other governments as well, the UK government, I'm
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.400]   sure is doing the same.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.400]   Yeah, that's why they're not screaming.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.400]   Yeah, you don't hear anything from the UK.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.320]   They're in cahoots on this one.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.040]   And so there's the recording, everything, whether they're sifting through it or not,
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.040]   is not unknown.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:42.640]   If it's a you can ever offers you a cup of coffee, say no, because I mean, listen to
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.640]   you.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:49.080]   If it's if it's encrypted, they could probably can't see into it as long as you're using
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.080]   open source encryption.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.640]   And this is the other problem is that there are back door, I'm pretty sure they're back
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.000]   doors into a close source encryption technologies from a lot of big companies.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.880]   So assume that you are being a spied upon and that, you know, I mean, I would encrypt,
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:11.920]   but I don't I don't know if even that's enough because the metadata is so valuable.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.280]   You know, so who cares if Google's spying on me?
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.800]   That's the least of our worries, right?
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.840]   Drummond said there's no gun to my head.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:20.840]   I'm not lying.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.840]   Yeah, I believe this.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.560]   He says, Google does not give the NSA unfettered access to user data.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.840]   We talked about this last week.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.840]   They don't need to.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.000]   The NSA can get it upstream.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:37.280]   And it's absolutely clear to that that they can't make a direct query to the server.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.400]   That's now the NSA had said it now.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.560]   Google's everybody said it.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.080]   Google isn't legally bound to lie about anything.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.120]   He says, no, no gun to my head.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.400]   He chose what questions to answer.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.000]   So Gina, partly to answer your question is there's a huge route to questions.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.200]   If he felt he couldn't have answered that question, he would have answered would not
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   have answered.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.200]   Right.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   Right.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.000]   And they could be honest if they, you know, he could have said I'm obligated.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.200]   I can't answer this question because there is, you know, I'm not allowed to, right?
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.360]   He could have said that.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   It's fine.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.120]   I believe that I don't I completely believe that they're not giving access.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.120]   Why would they?
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.120]   It's absolutely compelled to.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:22.560]   However, that there's plenty of ways that this information could be gathered without
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.520]   any cooperation on Google's part or even knowledge on Google's part.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:33.360]   Nobody's asking cogent and level three and the other, you know, or 18 or Verizon or sprint.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.360]   Nobody's asking them.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.360]   Ask that.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.840]   I quoted Steve Gibson in The Guardian this week saying that that's the question that still
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.840]   has to be asked.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.840]   That asked.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.200]   I'm asking those guys.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:49.400]   Are you, you know, find out who Google's upstream provider is and ask them, are you,
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.440]   is the NSA have access to your servers?
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:57.800]   The other issue is Snowden appeared on The Guardian Q and A and I'm not, it was a heavy
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.040]   on rhetoric.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:04.800]   I think I'm not specific and I'm not confident direct operational knowledge he has.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   Right.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.360]   I think he read the PowerPoint like we did.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.360]   Right.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.600]   He's still alleges though that it's really, really bad.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.600]   There is direct access.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.800]   The NSA is recording everything that the host companies are lying.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   Right.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:22.480]   I mean, he said that their language was the same and that's because they were all lying.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.600]   He's pulling back some, but he, yeah, he said that they're still pervaryicating and that
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.600]   kind of stuff.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:31.280]   But he didn't say how, you know, I'm glad we're having this discussion, but I'm not sure
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.080]   how much faith I have in him as a direct source and expert.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:40.200]   Oh, I mean, it's interesting to see how the companies are now using this as a way to prove
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.520]   how committed they are to privacy.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.520]   Right.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.520]   I mean, just what you said, they're basically saying, look, it's not us.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.080]   We're not the ones you have to worry about.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.080]   We're about these people.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:54.080]   Look, and then Google, Google filed, they tried to get, I don't want to know.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.080]   They're asking for a file.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.400]   They filed with the FISA court.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.400]   They revealed the file to motion with the FISA court.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:03.520]   They already filed with the DA saying, let us release the number.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.040]   And now they filed with, as a court saying, it's a matter of their first two.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.040]   It's amendment free speech.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040]   They're setting two speech.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.840]   Talk about their court requests.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.360]   Is that what they're asking for?
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.640]   Yes, because they want to break down.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:19.240]   You know, as they said, when Facebook released its numbers, it was a step back for users
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:24.240]   because the Facebook numbers included local law enforcement as well as, you know, federal
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.240]   law enforcement.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:30.960]   When I worked with local sites, believe me, the number of chicken poop subpoenas that came
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:37.480]   right off, oftentimes they were local cop chiefs and sheriffs who mad about underlings
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:42.080]   who anonymously complained about them in forums.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.600]   That was the major volume of our subpoenas.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:52.400]   So that penny stuff is now mixed in with true federal Asian of some measure of privacy
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:41:01.280]   we don't know and to mean this mean this release of data.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:06.680]   Well I am sure that the FISA court will laugh in Google's face, but Google, I think what
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:11.280]   Google realizes is a FISA action is public.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:16.920]   Well, at least if nothing happens, we'll know the FISA said no, whether they'll release
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.920]   a public rule.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.920]   Right.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.400]   So what happened, well, they either say they said no, or we're not allowed to say which
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.400]   is not no.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.400]   Right.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.400]   Well, no, they said no.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:30.440]   The real, the reason they're doing this though is, is, is a little self-serving because it's
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.440]   hurting Google.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.440]   It's hurting Facebook.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.440]   It's hurting Microsoft.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.240]   People are, assuming that these companies are spying on them and it's just, it's one
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:41.680]   more challenge to these companies.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:46.560]   And so they're trying to be proactive, but I would, again, assert that this isn't the
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.560]   issue.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.560]   People are really focused on the wrong thing.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.560]   Yep.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:55.000]   So Microsoft and Facebook have published the numbers, the FISA numbers.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.480]   No, they've published aggregate numbers.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.480]   Aggregate numbers.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.480]   And that's the problem.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.480]   It can't break down.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.480]   Gotcha.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:06.720]   So that includes people looking for lost phones and includes people whose, you know,
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.720]   parents have Alzheimer's and have disappeared.
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.120]   It includes all sorts of stuff.
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.920]   And you, it's not broken down.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.920]   So that's Google's stuff like that.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.920]   Right.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.080]   Chiefs of police don't like what people said about them in Forbes.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.080]   That kind of thing.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.280]   18,000 accounts from Facebook over a six month period.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.440]   It's actually a smaller number than I thought.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.440]   Oh, hi.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.440]   That's just a big thing.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.440]   That's a big thing to me.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.640]   I suppose relative to Facebook's whole population, it's small.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.720]   Microsoft was 31,000 accounts over the same six month period.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.720]   That's a lot.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.720]   That seems like a lot.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:41.760]   But I guess when you put your love thing together, all of the little stuff, it's not
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.760]   as big.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.760]   Right.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.880]   But what's surprising to me there is that people had enough interactions with Microsoft.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.680]   Versus Facebook, you would think Facebook would be more valuable.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:56.040]   But let me just, let me just emphasize again that they're, in my opinion, this is pure
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:59.240]   opinion, they're collecting everything.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:04.520]   Those subpoenas, those requests for information are just when they've got a criminal investigation
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:09.520]   going on and now they want to know all this data we have, who's that?
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.760]   And so that doesn't happen that much.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.400]   That's not the limit of how much data they're gathering.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.640]   It's merely at the collection and analysis of the raw data.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.640]   Right.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.040]   Fewer subpoenas they're going to be.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.040]   Right.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.000]   That's merely the number of people they want to take the next step on and we want to actually
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.960]   physically identify them.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.960]   Yep.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:34.640]   So I don't think that, so what, if it's 5,000, that's not relevant because I believe they're
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.360]   collecting all of our information.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.960]   Yours, mine and everybody else's.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:38.960]   Right.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.440]   That's what's relevant.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.160]   And the thing I'm most scared about, I mentioned this on security now, is not now, but the
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.160]   future.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:49.240]   What if they decide, what if they decide that they just really don't likely ill report?
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.560]   And they got me on something, you know?
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.080]   Now's the time that they go and they say, well, let's look what else we got.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.600]   And they go back in time through everything else they've been collecting over the last
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.840]   few years or five years or who knows, it could be 10 years.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.960]   It really is only limited by the five zeta bites of storage that they have, which is,
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.560]   by the way, 5 billion terabytes.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:14.840]   But the discovery, well, here's the two side of edge.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:19.600]   The discovery, your attorney would say, how did you get this data?
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:23.080]   And is this allowable in court?
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.640]   No, because it's a secret action.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.800]   That's the problem is when that answer comes back and then you become gagged about that.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.800]   Right.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.800]   But you would know it personally.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.800]   I would know personally, but I could never tell you.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.840]   Well, if you look at what they did.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.400]   It was like you could ever keep your mouth shut.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:44.600]   Then I'm going to jail and probably not a jail around here.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.560]   And sometimes it's not the things that they use in court or the things that you actually
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.560]   press on people.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.680]   It's the things that they collect and then the agencies themselves use them to pressure
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.680]   people.
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.880]   I mean, if you read that book about Jeff might know what the book that just came out and
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:00.880]   it was the journalist's like 40 year crusade to get the FBI's investigation into left wing
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.680]   groups on the West Coast.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:03.680]   Oh, right.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.080]   We'll get the title of it.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.400]   They wouldn't necessarily press charges or anything.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:12.800]   They just use all this information they gather to send letters to people and say, you know,
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:15.600]   hey, maybe your wife finds out about the affair.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.600]   Maybe she doesn't.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.280]   Maybe she quit Greenpeace, you know, that kind of thing.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.240]   You're watching the Americans now.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.080]   No, I hear it's quite good though.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.280]   I haven't been pretty good.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.280]   Yeah, but it'll leave stokes your paranoia.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:34.320]   Well, speaking of the Soviet Union, it was Joseph Stalin's chief of secret police, Barry.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:39.400]   Yeah, remember him who said, find me the man and I'll find you the crime.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:42.560]   And I think that that's exactly what this is all about to be honest with you.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:50.200]   And you know, I mentioned this, but according the Department of Justice interprets the electronic
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.760]   crimes act in such a strict look what they did with Aaron Schwartz.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.000]   They said, Oh, you know, we're going to give it's a federal crime to violate a websites
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.920]   term of service, which it is.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.400]   That's how they interpret it.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.080]   So if you violate, you know, be careful when you violate websites, terms of services being
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.920]   recorded in some day, they may be using that against you.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.840]   Yeah, Aaron's really, that's a really good example.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.840]   Perfect example.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:23.160]   So I don't care if Google wants to give me targeted ads for crying out loud.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.160]   Really?
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.040]   Are you worried about that?
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:32.640]   By the way, it is the 10th anniversary of AdSense.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.440]   $2 million publishers earned seven.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.440]   Is this one of your numbers?
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.440]   $7 billion last year via AdSense.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.440]   Wow.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:45.720]   So, so Google plus two years old AdSense is 10 years old.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:46.720]   Pretty cool.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:52.880]   I made I've made, I don't know, I was making $1000 a month from AdSense for many, many
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.760]   months on my blog.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:59.320]   It was a radio show website in the blog.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:04.960]   It's not, you know, I'm going to Vegas money, but it's better than nothing.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:09.280]   I think that's really, maybe in some ways AdSense's most important thing is, you know,
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.640]   a little pocket money, a little support for blogs for smaller blogs.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.080]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.840]   It's a very easy way to do that.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:20.680]   Well, and the game I always make about AdSense is that the publisher would have tried to
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:25.960]   control a scarcity Google found a way to exploit and grow an appearance.
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.200]   And it wanted more ads and more places and that's the essence.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:33.400]   So credit, I think a lot of credit over the last 10 years of the growth of the blog, blog
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.880]  osphere, the blog economy goes to AdSense.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:42.040]   Meanwhile, Tom Brokaw today went on complaining about how the worst thing to happen is the
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.200]   growth of the blogosphere.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:47.400]   So it was the worst juggler I showed.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:55.040]   Okay, eMarketer says Google made more, made half of all worldwide mobile internet ad revenues
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.040]   last year.
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.640]   That's only just begun.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.080]   It's only just that doesn't surprise me at all.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:06.840]   $8.8 billion in mobile ads last year.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.000]   Google about $4.61 billion.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   This is an estimate.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.960]   Google's not saying Facebook considerably less, by the way, Facebook, which had no mobile
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:24.960]   revenue in 2011, tripled it to over $2 billion in 2013, still less than half of Google made.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.960]   But they're turning around mobile.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:31.760]   Yeah, Facebook I bet is going to shoot up in the next few years.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   They already are.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.800]   I mean, 333% increase from year to year.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:42.640]   Yeah, they're just playing catch up.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:48.040]   What do you think actually I'm going to ask you of the new Twitter analytics stuff?
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.320]   It's not so much new, but it's just it's native.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:52.320]   All of us now, right?
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.320]   We can see it.
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:55.240]   Yeah, yeah, we can see it.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.360]   You know, I so they opened it up to everyone, right?
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:00.360]   I had seen it a while back.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.120]   And I think it's good.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.120]   I think it's charts.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:07.120]   I mean, I think it's, you know, kind of like it's an analytics dashboard for.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.120]   It's personal porn.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.120]   What's that?
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.800]   It's personal porn.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.800]   It's personal porn, exactly.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.880]   I mean, I spent a lot of time, obviously, thinking about analytics with, with, with think up.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.840]   And you know, much like Google analytics, I think this is the kind of thing that I would
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:26.360]   like look at every once in a while be like, yeah, charts, but not necessarily maybe look
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.360]   at all the time.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:33.080]   I mean, every day I'm not thinking like, oh, you know, like, let me, let me check my charts.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:39.000]   We, you know, we think up we've been trying to kind of move away from the dashboard, the
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.400]   dashboard format and move toward kind of more of a narrative notification style.
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.160]   So hey, here's something that you should actually look at.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.640]   I think it's great though that Twitter opened this up to everyone.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.720]   And I think it's, I think like, like, I think it's a good start.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.280]   I think it's a really, I think it's a good start.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:59.720]   I think that it's good to offer these kind of tools to, to anyone versus just the, you
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.080]   know, the celebrities or the brands.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.080]   And there's a reason they do it.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.280]   Cause as soon as I went to it, it said, welcome to Twitter advertising, Leo Laport.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.320]   How would you like to promote your tweets?
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.720]   Where do I get the analytics?
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:13.360]   I've got a, I don't want the, oh, here we go.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.240]   No, how do I get the analytics?
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:27.640]   I want to see this where all I got was a come on for a, so I went to my profile analytics.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:30.160]   Tell us who you'd like to target.
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.760]   How much do you want to spend?
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.280]   How do you want to pay?
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.800]   How do you get there, Gina?
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.800]   I'm signing in right now.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.800]   Let me know.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.680]   You have to go through a whole, oh, off, which is odd because it's a, yeah.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:49.160]   It's a Twitter site, but it's fair.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.160]   I'm in.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.560]   Cause I saw a Sarah's analytics.
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:56.280]   They looked really cool with a guy, swoopy, doopy graphs and stuff.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.280]   I can see that.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:00.400]   So you didn't get, so maybe it's just me.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.080]   They're trying to get money out of.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:05.480]   I, I want a different computer.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:09.560]   Click analytics at the top.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.320]   You got to sign into the ads.
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.320]   Twitter.com.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:16.360]   And then after you get in through Twitter, it's an analytics tab at the top.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.400]   Right on the top of the page.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.680]   And this is what I get.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:22.400]   Welcome to Twitter advertising.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.800]   No.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:24.800]   Look at my page.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.800]   Turn it off.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.840]   Maybe it was, maybe it was a false report.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.520]   Maybe I didn't get it.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.040]   So I'm at my, like, and you say there's a tab up here that.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.800]   And not a tab, but it's right next to.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:37.240]   See if I tap analytics, analytics, this is what I get.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.400]   Welcome to Twitter advertising.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.400]   Maybe I just don't have it yet.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:42.880]   Maybe I'm just unlucky.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.280]   I wonder how much it would cost.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.320]   Let me just see.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:48.320]   Choose the location.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:53.480]   I'm going to say people in the United States add usernames, people of similar followers.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:56.760]   I want to have the same people who follow Ashton.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.760]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.720]   He's a plus K.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.720]   Okay.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.120]   I'm going to have those people.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.120]   Twenty one million.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.120]   Now we're talking.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.040]   Okay.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.240]   You can limit it to desktop iOS, Android, Black.
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:10.560]   No, let's uncheck Blackberry.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.400]   I really don't want to advertise to Blackberry users.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.400]   Any gender?
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:15.880]   No, I want, I want the ladies.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:16.880]   Okay.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.580]   Let's move on.
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:20.120]   What do you want to promote?
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.120]   Okay.
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.120]   Love me.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.520]   Love me.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:28.120]   Say that you love me.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.720]   This is my promoted tweets.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:35.280]   On the days where I have the most replies, I have the most unfollows.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.920]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.120]   Skip promoting tweets for now.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.120]   Good.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:41.120]   I like to skip it.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.120]   How much do you want to spend?
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.120]   Zero.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.120]   Zero.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.120]   Is that an option?
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:47.120]   This is a beard.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.120]   Why is it having you?
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.120]   Okay.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:52.040]   Well, apparently, dude, you are you getting, somebody else getting analytics?
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.040]   You are chattched.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.240]   I'm getting the same exact same thing.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.560]   They want you to spend money too.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.640]   I tried to click the get help button, but that that's helping.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:00.640]   Filling history account.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:01.640]   Hit me.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.640]   Hit me.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.640]   View my profile.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:04.640]   I am having trouble signing in.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:08.520]   Yeah, that's a lot of popular things I've written about really recently has been chicken
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:09.920]   wings and XKCD.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.920]   So keep it low.
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.480]   I'm an expert.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.480]   Keep it low.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:16.480]   Well, I don't know.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.320]   I'm going to stick to think up.
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.240]   Yeah, let's go back to think up.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.240]   That's the way to do it.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.760]   You really want to know.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.760]   Trust jeanner.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.760]   That's all stick.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:34.080]   I like Fred Wilson says Twitter's loss of Instagram to Facebook was an enormous huge
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.720]   mistake.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.440]   You imagine that board meeting?
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.280]   He's on the board at Twitter.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:42.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:49.440]   Oh, he's got spanked at Costolo.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:51.880]   But I think he's probably right, don't you?
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.880]   I'm Instagram is the social network.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.120]   If Twitter had Instagram, it would have been a killed Facebook.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.760]   It would have been better than Facebook.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:03.200]   Yeah, that's why Facebook, that's why Mark Zuckerberg personally said, you know, I'm
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.640]   going to negotiate with Kevin's sister.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.040]   I'm going to get this company.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.320]   I don't care if it costs me a billion dollars in it did.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:14.000]   And then of course, Twitter bought Vine realizing they'd made a mistake.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   But now...
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.920]   The Vine didn't quite do it.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:20.760]   No, Vine's I think Vine is growing faster than Instagram at this point.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.880]   The kids love Vine.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.800]   Seriously, I watch the kids.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.440]   I'm looking at the kids.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:30.560]   I've been told that to stay 500 feet away, but I'm...
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:31.840]   So no, I'm just...
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:34.440]   I watch my kids and they have moved.
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.280]   They were big Instagram users now they do Vine all the time.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:41.560]   But Instagram, supposedly the next few days, is going to put video on Instagram.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:48.400]   So Zuckerberg, I think Zuckerberg outplayed Twitter on that one.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.400]   Good move.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.600]   Well, played, sir.
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:58.760]   Facebook's going to offer free Wi-Fi though.
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.560]   This is cool.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:01.880]   You just got to say where you are.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:02.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:05.280]   All you have to do is check in at the places that offer this.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:07.720]   And apparently it will be more and more.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:08.720]   And...
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.200]   What's clever about that is that it's a really...
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:12.320]   It's a get for the venue.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.320]   Right.
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.320]   The venue as well, yeah.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.320]   Interesting.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.320]   You know, they get free internet.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.320]   And you learn about your customer.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.760]   You know, XFINITY has been doing this, you know, Comcast.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:27.640]   And there is at least here in Northern California, there are XFINITY hotspots everywhere.
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:28.640]   Everywhere.
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:29.640]   And...
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.640]   You can't check in though.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.400]   You have to be a Comcast customer.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.400]   That's right.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.480]   Yes, but to get to check the venue, you don't have to say where you are.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:36.800]   I mean, it knows where you are.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.080]   The NSA knows where you are.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.640]   But you don't have to say, "Hello, I'm at Leo's coffee shop."
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:42.640]   Right.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:43.640]   Right.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:47.960]   This Facebook thing, Cisco's going to build it into the Maraki routers.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:54.760]   Maraki's an interesting story because it was originally a mesh router public Wi-Fi play
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.640]   that was very cool.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:01.280]   And the idea was you buy this Maraki router and it has mesh capabilities.
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:06.280]   And you know, basically it was to kind of do a grassroots global Wi-Fi effort.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:08.960]   And I guess they pivoted a little bit Cisco bottom.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:12.400]   But now they're kind of back to their roots in some ways because they're talking about
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.240]   building this Facebook Wi-Fi in a Maraki.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.680]   So it wouldn't necessarily just be Joe's Java Hut.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:20.840]   It could be Leo's house.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:27.720]   Although most people with Maraki, I guess it ran by it for business.
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:35.080]   I'm still trying to get analytics.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.800]   Sorry, I don't mean to be quite in here.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:42.000]   We're going to wrap it up here in a minute.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.560]   Every time it's quiet, I think my connection in the hotel has gone down.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:51.080]   I'll go like this.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.520]   See you know, you're always on look.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:53.520]   I get charts.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.520]   I have charts.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:55.520]   You got charts.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.520]   How did you get the charts?
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:57.520]   I did.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.520]   I just signed in.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:56:59.520]   I just signed in the analytics and you got charts.
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.520]   Yeah.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:02.520]   And I was at Twitter.com.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:03.520]   Yep.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.520]   I got charts.
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:05.520]   So what is it about me and Chad?
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.000]   Did you go to ads. Twitter.com Leo?
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.120]   No, I should go to ads. Twitter.com.
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.120]   That's what you got to do.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:12.120]   I went to analytics foolish me.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.400]   No, go to ads. Twitter.com and click on the analytics link.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.440]   That's bizarre.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:18.440]   So okay.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.040]   So I went to analytics. Twitter.com.
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.640]   I think that's what I did.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.880]   I get a funny little dialogue.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:26.520]   No, I still get will come to Twitter advertising.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:27.880]   You're using adblock.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.120]   Please disable your adblock.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.120]   Oh, oh.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.120]   Are you using it?
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:34.120]   Oh, we probably do that on the production.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.120]   Production computers.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.560]   I would like to buy ads using ads.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:38.680]   By the way, that's a federal offense to use adblock.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:40.160]   You're violating it in terms of service.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.160]   No, they're going to get free.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:45.400]   Free crime, free crime.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:52.600]   Yes, if I go to ads. Twitter.com on the top, there is a link to analytics and I get it.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:58.680]   I think I've just not yet included in the fun.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:02.800]   Which is I want some mistakes that they made.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.200]   But they've always over this.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:05.200]   They bought ads.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.200]   Right.
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.400]   I got to say I got the same thing.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.680]   Oh, Burke saying now go to NSA. Twitter.com.
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:11.680]   Oh.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:12.680]   That's a different kind of thing.
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:18.040]   That'll give me my hand on leg.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.040]   Some good news.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:22.400]   I presume that a lot of owners of Galaxy S4 will be getting this update.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:26.560]   Eventually I have the unlocked international Exynos version.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:31.880]   But this morning, and word went out a couple of weeks ago that we're going to do this.
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:34.600]   But this morning I got an update pushed.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:37.560]   I was pleased because I had already rooted this thing because I was getting so frustrated
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.240]   by the camera crashing.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:40.480]   It unrooted me.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:42.760]   But on the bright side, the camera stopped crashing.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.520]   It's updated the camera firmware.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:49.200]   Apparently they added, according to Kevin Tofol, they added HDR video which I haven't
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.200]   seen.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.120]   And they did add and I found this a moved SD card in the app manager.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:59.200]   So you can, because there's 16 gigabyte Galaxy S4s are so constrained for memory.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.040]   I only have a gig left.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.640]   Because they have a lot of stuff on it to begin with.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:05.640]   And that's another thing.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:06.920]   Apparently this is a little smaller.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.640]   The firmware is a little smaller.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:14.600]   So you get something like eight or nine free gigabytes which I immediately filled up.
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:18.360]   And you can only move so much to the SD card, unfortunately.
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:20.480]   All right.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:25.840]   I think we're going to get ready for our tool of the week, our tip of the week.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:27.840]   Jeff, a number of the week.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:28.840]   Got one.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:29.840]   All right.
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:33.040]   And we can talk to Mr. Purdy, get something from him.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.040]   Maybe.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:35.040]   Something cool.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:40.040]   Maybe.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:42.540]   Shutterstock.com.
[00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:46.140]   20, every time I go to Shutterstock the number goes up,
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:47.380]   I should see what it is now.
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:50.520]   Last time I checked, it was 26 million high quality
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:55.520]   stock photos, videos, vector graphics, illustrations.
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.220]   Shutterstock is really sweet.
[00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:01.340]   It's really an amazing place for people who are looking
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:05.700]   for images for their blog, for their production.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.800]   When we had Jason Silva on last week,
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.200]   he does those shots of awe on YouTube.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.520]   They use a lot of Shutterstock video clips in there.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.600]   They're gorgeous looking.
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.280]   And it's royalty free, and prices are great.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.160]   In fact, you could buy a package of images
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.440]   or do what I do and get the subscription.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.600]   I get 25 images a day.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.200]   Great for blogging.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.880]   There are 10,000 new images every day,
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.760]   so every time you'll visit, you'll find something new.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.800]   And really the great thing about Shutterstock
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.360]   is the search engine, an amazing search engine,
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.400]   which allows you not only to search for subject matter,
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.880]   so we'll do Android.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.080]   I could search for subject matter by,
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.480]   oh, I don't know, emotion, happy Android.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.040]   Let's see what I get.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.640]   Do we gonna get happy androids?
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:52.000]   Yes, there's a happy Android right there.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.680]   He looks so happy.
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.680]   Here's a happy Android user or something.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:01.360]   There she is.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.280]   Oh, I'm a happy Android user.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:06.160]   So you can also view by category,
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.640]   so we can have abstract animals,
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.040]   the arts, backgrounds, textures.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.640]   I can go with the color wheel.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.960]   It's so fantastic because you can actually choose a color.
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:20.280]   So if you wanna say, you know, I only want green androids.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.560]   You can do that, and that's great if you've got a palette.
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.000]   Sign up for a free account today,
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.960]   and you can start sharing and saving your images
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.440]   via their light boxes.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.840]   It's a great way to store inspirational images
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.240]   and share them with your colleagues and friends.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.400]   Really great search tools, really great,
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.240]   and take a look at the iPad app too, Webby Award-winning.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.200]   Shutterstock.com, they're a truly global company
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.760]   with offices all around the world,
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:48.200]   including Germany and China and Italy and Brazil
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.960]   and Belgium and on and on and on.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.480]   They travel as much as Jeff Jarvis does.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.400]   Try it today.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:54.440]   Sign up for a free account.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.880]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:59.200]   Just start using it, but once you decide you wanna buy,
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:02.840]   may I suggest you use our offer code Twig and the number six,
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:06.000]   all new accounts will receive 30% off any package.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.040]   That is amazing.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.880]   Twig six to get 30% off right up front.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.240]   Shutterstock.com, we thank them so much
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:17.200]   for their support of this week in Google.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.920]   Let us get a tip from Gina Trapani.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.040]   - So, okay, this isn't the biggest news in the world,
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.600]   but last week we were talking a little bit about iOS 7
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.000]   and how you can swipe up that one finger swipe up
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.600]   to bring up control center.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.920]   And I think I was complaining about how Android,
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.680]   you have to pull down the notification shade
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.280]   and then tap the button to flip it
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.000]   to the quick toggle settings.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.360]   Several people told me over the week
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.280]   and reminded me of this short time.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.280]   - Again, again, jitter jitter jitter.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.480]   - You two finger swipe down on Android
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.680]   to get to your quick toggle settings.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:53.360]   So it's one of those things, not very, very discoverable,
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.160]   but once you remember that you can do that,
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.560]   it's really nice, I've been using it all week.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.840]   So two fingers swipe down and go directly to quick toggle.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.440]   So iOS 7 doesn't have a link up.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.360]   Android with control center.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.360]   - There you go.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.440]   - I retract my original statement.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.000]   Thank you to the 675 people.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.080]   (laughing)
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.480]   - It's kind of frustrating.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:15.360]   You can't really make a mistake on these shows.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.800]   It's really, kind of annoying.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.880]   - No, it's good, it's good.
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.240]   - No, it's good to keep it safe.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.280]   - It was a humbling Thursday last week,
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.520]   so I just wanted to make that correction.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.280]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.520]   - Well, I found this interesting.
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.960]   I had to do a long trip for numbers this week,
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.960]   but the LA school system has agreed to spend
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.680]   $30 million for iPads for the schools
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:42.480]   at a cost of $1078 per higher than retail
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.520]   because it has some software involved.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:48.280]   And sorry for being Mr. Croton guy,
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.760]   but I really wonder whether or not they specifically say,
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.440]   "Boy, a lot of these are gonna have to get keyboards
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.360]   "and that's not included."
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.200]   - Aye.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.480]   - 200 dollar Chromebooks have been a better investment.
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.320]   - Yes.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.760]   Yes.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.920]   Unless they have apps that are specific,
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.000]   iOS specific apps that they wanna use,
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.040]   there's a lot of educational apps on iPad.
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.840]   - Well, teaching kids how to deal with iPads.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:11.680]   - It's all the way up.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:12.680]   (laughing)
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.360]   - It really depends on what they're doing with them
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:17.320]   and what grades, I think for the lower grades maybe.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.760]   I mean, if all you need is a browser.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:19.760]   - The lower grades.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.160]   - But, well, even for the lower grades,
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.480]   there's a lot of iOS apps.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.320]   I don't know.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.160]   - Yeah, it's the web.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.880]   - And there's, well, but that's,
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.840]   iPad is not the web, that's the point.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:34.720]   The iPad has these amazing textbooks
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.100]   that are not websites.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.980]   They have lots of apps.
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:42.440]   I would presume that they looked at that.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:47.040]   I know you love Chromebooks, but they don't do everything.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.080]   - Well, no, I'm just a price.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.960]   I'm not searching to get the $1,500 model,
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.400]   but the $200 model.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.240]   - Right.
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.360]   - And you get a full computer?
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:54.200]   - No, you don't.
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.160]   You get a browser.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.480]   - Oh, no.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:57.320]   - Here we go.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.320]   (laughing)
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.160]   - Here we go.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.400]   - You don't get a full computer, Jeff.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:04.000]   You can't install applications in your Chromebook.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.040]   - Oh, well, that's better for school systems.
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.360]   - The iPad is closer to a full computer
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.440]   than the Chromebook is by a long shot.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.440]   You can install apps on it.
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.640]   - You know, he kicks me when I have jet lag
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.760]   and I can't do it again.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.600]   (laughing)
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.040]   I'm not kicking you, but there is a difference.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.880]   You cannot install apps.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.520]   You can install Chrome extensions.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:25.360]   - And there are people.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.800]   - And there are very severely limited.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.800]   If you look at the variety and choice of apps on the iPad,
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.520]   three quarters of a million, there's a big difference.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.720]   And if any of those apps are apps,
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.760]   you know, I'll give you an example.
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.840]   Autistic kids have great results using the iPad
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.080]   and software design, especially for them,
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:46.120]   that's just absolutely not available on a Chromebook.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.960]   I can go on and on and on and on.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.840]   - And you would.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.760]   (laughing)
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.320]   - Now, if you want to teach Python,
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.840]   you probably should get a Chromebook, I agree.
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:01.240]   And I admit that there's a lot less administrative hassle
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.560]   to have a Chromebook,
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.040]   but I think that it's not unreasonable to say,
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.840]   "Hey, if you've got a school,
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.640]   "you need to be able to install some apps."
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.240]   But it's a 30-year bond,
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:15.240]   700,000 kids in the school district will be getting them.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.240]   That's amazing.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.360]   I mean, they could have saved money by giving them an abacus
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.760]   to Jeff, doesn't mean it will do everything they needed to do.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.280]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.280]   (laughing)
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.120]   - Man, okay.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.280]   (laughing)
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.240]   - 700 bucks per 700 bucks.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.120]   - It's expensive, I agree, but it's cheaper than a computer.
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.840]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:39.800]   - I'm not saying that they should buy iPads either.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.600]   - No, I think it's gotta really cause.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.440]   - Yeah.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.720]   - It's called for the sex appeal.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.680]   - Yeah.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.520]   I mean, you might make a strong case
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.840]   that they could buy Android tablets.
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.960]   - Done too.
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:53.880]   - Save money by buying next-ses.
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:59.120]   They're gonna pay for iPads for 30 years.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:01.280]   They're still paying that bond in 30 years.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.880]   It's like Homer Simpson says and tapped out,
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.800]   "Man, are you gonna be happy you bought that
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.960]   "in the years to come?"
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.200]   (laughing)
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:14.200]   Mr. Kevin Birdie, you got something for us?
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.040]   - Yeah.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.440]   I like Chromebooks.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.440]   - Really do.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.480]   I really do.
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.160]   So I have a Chromebook.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.320]   I use Chromebooks all the time
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.680]   and I use them late at night
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.080]   turning articles that should have been turned in the day before.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:33.200]   And I use on my regular desktops and stuff,
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:36.440]   apps like Flux, F.LUX,
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.440]   which interestingly enough was made by a guy
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.040]   who works on Picasa.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.400]   Apps like Flux, they change the color temperature
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.040]   of your screen so that when you're up late at night,
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.800]   you're not blasting your eyeballs.
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.640]   - That's nice.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.840]   - You gotta stay light tuned.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.720]   Yeah, daylight tuned light
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.280]   and Gina probably can tell you programmers also
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.560]   have issues with staying up late and looking at monitors
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.680]   and getting that kind of keep you awake stuff.
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:00.880]   But the reason I'm telling you about F.LUX
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.080]   is that in the Chrome store,
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:06.680]   there is a extension called G-LUX or G.LUX.
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:09.640]   And it is a Chrome extension that basically mimics
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:11.440]   that kind of color tuning.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.440]   So you install it and then it puts a button
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.560]   in your toolbar and basically you click it
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.880]   and you choose what color temperature you want,
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.680]   whatever webpage you're looking at to be.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.480]   Tungsten, halogen, daylight, black, white, fluorescent,
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:26.320]   things like that.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:29.560]   So you might have to refresh the page after you set it,
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.680]   but basically any webpage you're looking at
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.360]   will be recolored to be kind of more nighttime
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:39.720]   and low light friendly.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.840]   So I like it because it's one of those apps
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:46.760]   that kind of mimics desktop functionality inside of a Chrome
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.720]   or Chrome OS environment.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:49.800]   So help me.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.040]   Wow, this is cool.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:55.280]   So you adjust it for your lighting for day and night.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:59.400]   It knows your location so it knows when day and night is.
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.040]   Yep.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.840]   And generally Tungsten and halogen are work the best.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.400]   The others are kind of wonky, but you can experiment with it
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:10.200]   and see if you like color.
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.040]   I mean, you might not want to use that in the middle of the day,
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.680]   but if it's late at night, it definitely helps.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:18.280]   Make the sunset on this desktop wallpaper.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.280]   Oh.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:20.720]   Wait a minute.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.520]   I think the stars are coming out.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.760]   Holy cow.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.960]   With the Chrome version, just to have an extension.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:26.840]   Yes.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.680]   I think the problem you're having with your eyesight
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.520]   is the day glow green walls behind you.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:36.240]   Yes.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:39.040]   So this is my Twitter account.
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.120]   And so I've changed it using the thing
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.720]   to like say fluorescent and save it.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.160]   Oh, I see.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:44.640]   You made it.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.000]   You made it.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.720]   I couldn't figure out why you were showing your Twitter account.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:47.040]   Right.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:47.200]   And so--
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:47.560]   I get it.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:48.040]   OK.
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.880]   And so now, yeah, this is using the Chrome extension.
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.520]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.480]   There is some weird one.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:56.160]   But halogen-- so Tungsten is probably the best.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:56.600]   Yep.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.800]   If you want to really do something nice.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:00.920]   I like it.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.160]   So it's great for Chromebook users and great for those who
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.280]   are just using Chrome in the web late at night
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:08.040]   or in low light conditions.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.880]   The stark white of the Google Home page
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.880]   won't shock your system anymore.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:12.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:12.320]   It's--
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.320]   It's funny.
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:14.840]   Very funny.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:15.320]   Very funny.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.800]   It's only my college room that's in college
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.560]   that had this.
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.760]   I would have saved so many hours of sleep.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.280]   I can set it to candlelight.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:26.640]   It's candlelight.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.320]   I'm going to do a number, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.480]   How about that?
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.440]   None of them are going to poo poo your pixel.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:34.360]   But I'm going to give you a number $403 million.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:38.560]   That's how much stratus is just paid to buy MakerBot.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.480]   Whoa.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:44.400]   Stratus, I think, makes big industrial 3D printers.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.280]   It's been around for a long time.
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.160]   And MakerBot, of course, everybody knows,
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:53.200]   is Bree Pettis' plucky little personal 3D printer.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.200]   Bree.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:54.880]   Good for Bree.
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.560]   Good for Bree.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:00.720]   Big exit, $403 million for the MakerBot.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.560]   So that is pretty awesome.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:08.120]   Is a stock swap, stock for stock transaction.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.640]   MakerBot will be the consumer and desktop market
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.040]   while stratus will continue to focus on industrial 3D printing.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:17.760]   So revolutionizing the way that we make products
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:22.480]   in the future, $403 million, Instagram, a billion.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.600]   Yeah, I think MakerBot might be worth more, huh?
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.440]   But it's not used by as many people.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.600]   I mean, you really buy in the users, aren't you?
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.640]   Yep.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:34.800]   When you buy Instagram, and you're trying to save yourself.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.160]   Save yourself, Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.680]   Save yourself.
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.000]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.760]   I want to thank Gina Trippani for smarterware.org.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.480]   And think up the best Twitter analytics program you can get.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.240]   Oh, thank you.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:47.760]   So there.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:48.680]   Thanks for the mail.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:49.440]   Thanks for the mail, yeah.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:49.920]   To do text.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.800]   And of course, the host of all about Android every Tuesday.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.640]   With Jason and Ron Richards.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.400]   We do a little Android talk in here,
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.000]   but it's nothing compared to all about Android.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:00.640]   It's a must-watch.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:03.640]   Yeah, we get to really dive in on Tuesday nights.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.600]   Kevin Purdy, thank you for being here.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.240]   The complete guide to Android is still
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.800]   online at completeandroidguide.com.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:10.080]   Yep.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.240]   And you can follow me on Twitter @KevinPurdy,
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.360]   where I tweet about all the stuff I'm writing lately.
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.440]   I don't know why I thought your Twitter account was the Purdy man.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.600]   No, that's my website.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.880]   Ah, that's what it is.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.800]   @KevinPurdy, where I'm tweeting about all the weird video game
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.320]   coffee and Android stuff I'm writing about.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.920]   So are you happy now about Xbox One?
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.040]   You think it's the future?
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.800]   My Twitter feed is filled half with people
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.800]   who are saying way to hold back the future, everybody.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.880]   And people being like, yay, Microsoft
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:39.520]   responding to public pressure, like smart company does.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.280]   It's weird.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:42.000]   Discs live forever.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.600]   And thanks, of course, to Jeff Jarvis, who
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.760]   stayed up very late with us in the Netherlands.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.960]   Or no, the Nuremberg's.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:48.920]   No, this is Nuremberg.
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.800]   And it's very, very hot here, 75 degrees.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:54.200]   So I had two vise before the show, and even so,
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.520]   I didn't have a rant against anyone.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:57.640]   Yeah, you're so calm.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:57.960]   You did.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:58.600]   Very mellow.
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.000]   Always great to have Jeff on Smarter.

[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.200]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.800]   We'll see you next time on This Week.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:13.800]   Bye-bye.
