[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.240]   This week in Google, the show that talks about--
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.680]   and somebody emailed me and said, boy, with what's going on
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.080]   right now with Amazon, you really
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.840]   should say this week in Amazon and Google.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.360]   Or we'll just say this week in Google and the cloud.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.640]   How about that?
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.440]   Our guests, as always today.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.800]   Gina Trapani from smarterware.org.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.760]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.240]   Hello.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.960]   Great to be here.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.280]   Great to see you, as always.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.600]   Jeff Jarvis, who's at a conference right now.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.800]   For continuing care-assisted living facilities.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.840]   I mean, communities.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.880]   Are they interested in the Google?
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.320]   Yeah, they are, actually.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.640]   It's a business like every other.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.760]   And they have all kinds of--
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.960]   You're not speaking to the old folks.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.800]   You're talking to them.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.800]   No, no, to the people who own the places that came.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   Oh, my God.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.320]   And by the way, Jeff is the author of this great book.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.920]   What would Google do?
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.000]   At his new book, Public Parts Went to the Printers, right?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.680]   Went to the copy editor, yep.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.480]   Oh, man, there's another layer.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.280]   There's another layer.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.280]   Congratulations.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.760]   I know it's a series of steps.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.520]   Yes, it is.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.120]   Yes, it is.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.160]   Bit by bit, inch by inch.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.840]   Death by 1,000 cuts.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.440]   Paper cuts, yes.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.360]   Paper cuts.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.640]   And good news.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.120]   We've got Chris Tibona with us.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.800]   Hey.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.720]   Very kind to allow us to defer and defer and defer.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.480]   And we're glad to get you on.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.080]   I'm just not that important.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.000]   You are super important.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   You never had skull surgery and has the things
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   still attached to him.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.440]   Yes.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.560]   Yes, I'm wearing-- so I couldn't find my regular,
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.640]   sort of like, discrete, really lovely--
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.200]   I like those.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.640]   --dark, sesk headset.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.280]   And so I decided to go with really big.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.360]   He's wearing his gamer headsets.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.400]   It was actually-- they had it at a tech stop here.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.440]   So I was like, do you have--
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.960]   I just need one with like a mic and a USB interface.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.480]   Here.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.840]   I'm telling you, they're gamer headsets.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.920]   Just resist the urge to say, I teabag you.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.920]   OK?
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.920]   I wouldn't say that.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.800]   I'm not bothered.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.480]   You're not that kind.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.240]   Yeah, you're not the littaker.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.480]   Chris, first of all, is an old friend, of course.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.440]   He came on regularly on the screen savers
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.720]   to talk about open source software.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.240]   He was at SourceForge, where he was involved in--
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.680]   actually, it wasn't SourceForge.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.360]   It was-- you were responsible for SourceForge.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.520]   It was VA Linux.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.960]   Well, responsible is the strong word.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.760]   I named it, and I'll defend that to my death.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.200]   But the other guys wrote the code.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.760]   OK.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.280]   I just made--
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.400]   He just gave it the name.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   That's all.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.400]   And he's now a Google.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.120]   He's a program manager for their open source projects.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.080]   Quite a few of them, as you might imagine at Google.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.160]   Code.google.com is a place to go to find out about that.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.480]   In fact, it is the summer of code.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.720]   Yeah, we just launched student applications.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.560]   So we've already gotten a couple of thousands
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.280]   student applications in.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.600]   Would you tell us what that is?
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.280]   Last year, Google bought advertising
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.520]   on our open source show, which--
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.280]   I know we've done that again.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.160]   Which Chris hosted, by the way, in the early days,
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.320]   Floss Weekly.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.840]   Randall Schwartz has ably taken over.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.720]   Is that still going on?
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.720]   Oh, more-- yeah, we just did it this morning.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.280]   It's been-- no, the thing about Randall, you were so busy.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.680]   It was hard to get a weekly show out of you.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.640]   And I kept erasing the shows, which didn't help.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.920]   That did not.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.880]   Brian Acre will never forgive me for that.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.360]   But three times we had to talk to--
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.880]   Three.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.720]   Three.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.920]   After I raised it accidentally the second time,
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.000]   I said I'm a basket of coffee goods.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.520]   That was nice to see you.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.040]   And just really felt terrible.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.560]   But we finally did get that Brian Acre interview on the air.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.120]   Randall Schwartz took over a couple of years ago.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.560]   He's done a great job.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.080]   Well, he's kept it alive.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.120]   And I really appreciate it.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.840]   But both of you, of course, are great friends of open source.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.800]   And I brought that up for some-- oh, yes,
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.080]   because Google sponsored Floss Weekly last summer.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.840]   Didn't do it this year, but nevertheless, Chris,
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.640]   here's your chance to put in a big plug,
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.600]   because I think this is a great tip for a program that
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.120]   I could discuss.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.760]   So if people are in university or attached to a university
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.840]   in some strange way, you can try out for the summer of code.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.480]   You basically apply to take part in the program.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.520]   And what it is is various open source organizations
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.680]   work with us to mentor students through the summer.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.560]   And we pay you if you're successful.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.960]   If you meet the goals of the program,
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.760]   you get paid $5,000 the course of the summer.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.520]   And yeah, so it's pretty good.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.640]   You bring in-- it actually starts
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.520]   with companies who have open source projects.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.040]   Cool.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.520]   Oh, some companies, but mostly just pure sort
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.440]   of open source projects and organizations
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.640]   like Python, On Apache, and all the names you'd expect to see.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.520]   So they apply--
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.560]   And then you pick the 107 projects?
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.320]   170 different projects.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.880]   70.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.360]   We had about 600 apply this year.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.560]   And it's always heartbreaking because they're also great.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.640]   Well, most of them are.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.760]   And we have to pick really a smaller number
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.800]   than we wish we could because we're
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.520]   spending about $7 million on the program this year.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.520]   Wow.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.760]   We want to make sure that the organizations that are taking
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.400]   part get a good flow of students.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.480]   And so that restricts the numbers we can take on.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.560]   Because we're accepting 1,200 students this year.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.160]   So yeah, it's really something.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.680]   If you go to code.google.com/soc, you can find out more.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.200]   This is--
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.160]   And let me encourage students, computer science students,
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.520]   to follow up on this.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.680]   This is a great way to get an experience
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.760]   of working for an open source project
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.400]   to get paid while you're doing it, which is great.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.680]   And often, many of these students
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.040]   go on to very successful careers as coders,
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.920]   sometimes for open source, sometimes not.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.800]   I mean, it's a really great thing for your resume.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   Jane, it's actually a fairly successful one.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.240]   I hear people from other companies, even folks
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.080]   like the Facebooks and Microsoft world,
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.720]   they said, if I see a summer of code, successful summer
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.960]   of code student, I can almost guarantee
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.960]   that they'll get hired.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.720]   OK.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.240]   Wow.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.560]   That says it right there.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.720]   Jeff, what did you say?
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.320]   I was asking Gina how her summer of code person worked
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.800]   last summer if she knows where--
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.720]   Yeah, that was a he.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.680]   Because we fail people if they're bad.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.240]   Right.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.600]   We had a great experience.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.880]   So I was a mentor in last summer, summer of code.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.480]   And myself and my other lead developer were mentors.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.880]   And we had two great students.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.480]   And it was a really, really successful--
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.480]   my student built the installer for ThinkUp.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.240]   So you don't have to edit any config files.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.680]   It's kind of a wizard that steps you through a three-step
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.400]   installer.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.880]   And our other student built a Google map
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.120]   of geo visualization of tweets and replies and retweets.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.640]   And it was amazing.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.600]   It was such a good experience that we
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.080]   continue to do mentoring programs in-house at ThinkUp.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.600]   Because it was just such a great way to develop.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.080]   I mean, our students were just-- they were so smart,
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.160]   and they were so eager, and they wanted to do such a good job.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.680]   And in fact, one of the two students
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.320]   that we mentored during last summer
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.960]   is still very active in the project
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.800]   and still contributing, which is awesome.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.280]   So it's a great program for students and mentors.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.440]   I highly, highly recommend it.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.440]   Why does Google do this, Chris?
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.400]   You know, we started because Larry
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.360]   felt that there were a lot of computer science students that
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.360]   weren't doing computer science over the summer.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.520]   And he wanted to figure out a way of productively
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.000]   to pay them to work on coding and to retain their edge
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.640]   instead of having that summer drop off of knowledge
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.400]   and sort of like the momentum of their computer science
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.400]   career and studies.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.800]   So it's purely pro bono?
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.600]   Yeah, yeah, pretty much.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.560]   I mean, if you look at pro--
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.040]   Pro-do-do-bono.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.800]   Pro-do-bono.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.960]   And if you look at the rules, we don't even
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.400]   require that the organizations accept the code,
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.640]   even if they pass the student.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.880]   So because we didn't want there to be this situation where
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.840]   the student wrote good things, but it really wasn't quite right.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.680]   So you're going to do the station, right?
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.760]   But probably about a third of the students
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.360]   go on to keep working on their projects
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.760]   and making sure they're integrated with their mentor's
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.600]   project and remain members of that community, which
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.360]   is pretty exciting.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.560]   Especially when you consider these guys,
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.360]   they're going back to school.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.960]   These guys are going back to school.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.840]   So it's pretty nice.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.520]   And then we do feel that open source has done an awful lot
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.200]   for Google and for the internet.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.520]   And it seems this is a pretty good way of getting back.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.040]   It creates more open source developers.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.880]   It creates more open source code.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.480]   And those are things that are actually really, really hard
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.920]   to make happen.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.000]   So it's sort of like a really nice sweet spot.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   And there's a lot of love for the program internally.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.400]   If you talk like Alan Eustace, who's
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.600]   one of our senior VP's of engineering,
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.400]   he just loved the program.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.720]   So even if I go away, I know the summer of code,
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.720]   which is great here.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.880]   Well, thank you for doing that, Chris.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.760]   Really appreciate it.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.560]   Yeah, I've got a great team that does all the work here.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.480]   I'll have Kat now.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.880]   We are going to put Chris on the spot in a little bit,
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.680]   because there's a little talk about Android, whether it's
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.600]   open or not.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.720]   This was Larry Page's first week as CEO.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.040]   Yes, Monday was a big day.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.040]   Everything's different.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.880]   And everything's changed.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.840]   Everything's blue now.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.520]   Paper is room up here.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.040]   And there was a big exit.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.240]   Eric, to Larry, you know, in our shrines.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.880]   We're going to talk about that in just a bit.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.680]   And also, I'm going to challenge myself.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.880]   You see these?
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   These are two tablets.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:14.640]   This is the iPad 2 running iOS.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.280]   This is--
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.040]   You can't even see if it was OK to turn it on before doing anything.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:18.920]   I had to get permission.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.960]   You like to have control.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.320]   This is a zoom.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.880]   Now, I know how to turn on the iPad 2.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.360]   In fact, if I lift the magical revolutionary coverage,
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.040]   it just turns itself on.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.640]   But I'm a little puzzled.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.800]   There's no on/off switch.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:38.440]   So in a moment, when we return, I will attempt to turn on the zoom.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.960]   Yes, it's an exciting new feature.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.880]   How do you turn on the zoom?
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.920]   Coming up with this week in Google first, though,
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.760]   I'd like to mention one of our great sponsors, the great folks
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.840]   at carbonite.com backup King's extraordinaire.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.040]   My kid was in here a few minutes ago.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.840]   And he's a great example of how the cobblers' kids have no shoes.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.840]   So he's been making a lot of music.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.400]   He uses Logic Express.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.800]   And he's really into it like morning, noon, and night.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.360]   And I was very supportive of it.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.320]   But his hard drive died on his iMac.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.760]   He came downstairs and said, Dad, I can't-- the computer won't boot.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.960]   And I said, oh.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.240]   And I said, you've been backing up, right?
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.520]   He said, what?
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.600]   And I thought, that's really not his fault.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.840]   It's my fault.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.040]   And he lost everything he'd worked on for about six months.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.560]   Now, fortunately, I was able to recover that drive.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.360]   Thanks to some wizardry that I've learned in the past.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.000]   But man, next time from now on carbonite.com.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.880]   Because it's automatic cloud backup.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.560]   So even if you're backing up locally, which he's also doing,
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.400]   I brought up an external hard drive.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.960]   And it's automatically using Chronosync to back up to that.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.920]   I have a network attached.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.400]   Storage is backing up to that.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.400]   And I have carbonite.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.600]   And it's never-- he's never going to lose any data again.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.120]   While you're online, carbonite trickles your data back up
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.720]   to the internet, where it's always safe.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.880]   The nice thing about this, $55 a year is unlimited storage.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.960]   All the personal stuff in your internal drive.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.280]   So I don't have to worry about how much music he's making.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.120]   I don't get teared up.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.400]   The price doesn't suddenly go up.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.760]   I buy your subscription.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.960]   I know that's good for the next 12 months.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.680]   And I have to say, it's really cloud storage.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.320]   I mean, $55 sounds like a lot.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.480]   Look at how much it costs to do 50 gigs on Dropbox.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.400]   This is half that, less than half that.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.000]   And it's just like Dropbox in the sense
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.200]   that I can log onto my carbonite account on any computer
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.480]   on my iPhone, my Android phone, my BlackBerry.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.200]   And there's my data.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.200]   I can access it and use it even before disaster strikes.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.840]   Carbonite is so great.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.160]   You get your data back with a couple of clicks of the mouse.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160]   It's PC or Mac, cloud storage, encryption-- of course,
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.200]   under 28-bit SSL to the cloud.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.560]   But you can also add--
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.360]   I think it has blowfish and triple-desk encryption
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.440]   available so you can have completely secure, private data.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.240]   Look, try it for two weeks free, carbonite.com, offer code
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:55.880]   twig.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.120]   Please do use that offer code.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.560]   So we get credit for that, TWIG.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.840]   And that's two weeks free, no credit card or anything,
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.480]   just the word twig.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.200]   And if you decide to buy, continue to use that offer code.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.720]   When you buy, check out for the year subscription,
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.200]   because that 12 months turns into 14 months automatically,
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.440]   two months free with your subscription
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.640]   if you use the offer code twig.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.240]   Carbonite, you got to back it up to get it back.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.960]   So do it right.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.400]   The carbonite.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.920]   OK, now don't laugh at me.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.760]   I'm sure there's an easy way.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.840]   There's no buttons on the front.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.680]   I was a good five minutes Leo.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.160]   So you and Gina both have-- well, all three of you have one.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:31.680]   I'm sure Chris is.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.360]   No, I don't have one.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.880]   I was in the store.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.200]   OK, nothing there.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.880]   Nothing on the bottom.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.280]   Do the same exact thing.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.360]   Oh, yeah, don't tell them a secret word.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.600]   Is this it?
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.360]   This must be it.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.400]   Yay.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.440]   So there's a button on the back.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.160]   That wasn't that hard.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.440]   Once you know it.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.000]   And it even has a little icon.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.160]   13 seconds.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:51.680]   That wasn't bad.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.400]   It has an icon was on, off, and locked.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.840]   So OK.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.880]   So now what?
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.440]   Slide.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.000]   There you go.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   That's cool.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   App Store.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Oh, you installed the new Amazon App Store?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.800]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.320]   Now there was an interesting story that said that Steve Jobs
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.200]   actually vastly overestimated the number of native honeycomb
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.000]   applications.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.200]   He said hundreds.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.800]   There's about 17 or something like that.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.520]   Top right, apps.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.640]   OK.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.080]   There we go.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:24.920]   So let's say Beluga.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.240]   Now that's written for Android phones.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.880]   But that scale is perfectly nicely.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.160]   I mean, it's got a lot of stuff on the right there,
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.640]   but that's OK.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.120]   If I go in there, the message is that's fine.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.040]   I mean, that's all they mean is it doesn't--
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.520]   it's like not taking advantage of the real estate.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.720]   So what do you think, Gina?
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.040]   You've had it for a couple of weeks now.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.200]   Are you happy with it?
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:44.720]   I like it.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.400]   I like it a lot.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.440]   The only app that I found that doesn't run fullscreen
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.920]   is Mint, which I guess when they built the app,
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.520]   they just said it should be this size.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.200]   But everything else kind of fills the screen.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:55.800]   I like it very much.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.520]   I like the Gmail client a lot.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.360]   I mean, the Gmail client is kind of like--
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.640]   is what a real honeycomb app looks like,
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.520]   taking advantage of all those emails.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.720]   That's one of the 17.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.120]   Right.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.760]   And honestly, Gmail, the Gmail--
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.040]   I was the reason why I'm on Android to begin with.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.200]   I live my life in Gmail.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.720]   I'm just the best client anywhere.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.920]   Actually, this is pretty much--
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.000]   this is very usable.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.840]   So it's slid over like that.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.080]   I like that.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.240]   That's great.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.760]   Angry Birds is obviously awesome.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.000]   Love the Kindle app and InstaFetch.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.160]   I like to read it later, things from InstaPaper.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.000]   So I like it very much.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.120]   It crashes once in a while.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.880]   It still feels a little half baked here and there.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.040]   But it's heavy.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:37.720]   Like you said, ladies--
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.680]   It is when you compare it to the iPad, too.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.480]   But you're saying, Chris, how many apps are there now, Chris?
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.040]   I don't know the exact number, but it's well over 17.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.040]   OK.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.120]   That's 20, 25, 100.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.560]   It doesn't matter.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.520]   The truth is, if most apps look fine,
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.880]   I don't think that makes a big difference.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.800]   Yeah, most of them scale just like no problem.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.240]   So the issue, though, is how well this and the Atrix
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.800]   are doing the two Motorola products.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.440]   This one is the first Honeycomb tablet.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.680]   The Atrix is that dual-core phone.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.600]   Well, Atrix has that thing where you can dock it in a laptop.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.800]   Yeah, for 500 bucks.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.400]   I've tried it.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.400]   It's kind of nutty because it's so expensive.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.400]   It's nutty, though.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:13.800]   I mean, you know.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.440]   Well, here's the deal.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.760]   You're going to get a little docking station.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:21.760]   It's about the same size and weight as a netbook for $500
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.160]   over and above the phone.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.600]   And it's running kind of Linux.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.760]   It's not a familiar operating system.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.480]   I don't think it's selling that well.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.240]   In fact, that's the story.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.760]   I think the Asus one will do.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.160]   You know, the one with the built-in.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.240]   You can slide it off the keyboard dock thing.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:37.760]   You know?
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.760]   I haven't seen that one.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.240]   No.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.920]   Yeah, it's coming out in America.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.760]   Ish.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.280]   And right.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.160]   Yeah, no, it's running Honeycomb.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.160]   And then you can just use it as a 10-inch tablet.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.840]   And then you can also dock it in this keyboard battery-based
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.160]   thing that makes it into--
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:53.960]   look like a netbook.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.560]   But it still runs Honeycomb.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:55.960]   So--
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.800]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.760]   So then it turns into--
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.240]   Can you do like an x-ray at hours of battery and everything?
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:16:59.880]   It's pretty--
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.380]   --pretty--
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.040]   What about Andy Rubin saying, Honeycomb, we kind of rushed it.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.800]   It wasn't ready.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.280]   It's--
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.000]   And then actually, let's put you on the spot, open source
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.240]   program manager.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.360]   What about the people who say, ha, see, we told you.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.920]   Android's not open source.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.040]   So what I want you to do is whenever you read an article
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.920]   like that, see if they conclude with,
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.400]   and therefore I'm going to use an iPhone?
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.600]   Yes, almost always.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.280]   It's like, you know, that's not ever open source at all.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.040]   Not even close.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:33.360]   So we've delayed the release of Honeycomb's stuff.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.120]   It's still compliant with the open source licenses
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.840]   for the GPL and all GPL components.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.840]   That's all fine.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.440]   But the Apache stuff, which is what most people think of as
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.200]   Android, we're just delaying it until--
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.440]   until later.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.160]   When we brought out Honeycomb, it wasn't that we rushed it out.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.720]   So much as we--
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.040]   if we put that on the phone, it would be terrible.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.120]   And it would look right.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.120]   And we haven't harmonized that for the phone.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.840]   The UI, the UI.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:03.280]   So Android is open source in the sense that is the open
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.560]   handset alliance.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.240]   There is a source code base.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.760]   Google adds stuff on top of it.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.360]   But each new version, Google holds on to the source code
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.320]   for a while, right?
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.280]   Only recently did we ever delay.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.480]   So before Honeycomb, we actually commonly always
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.920]   released by first-customer ship, but commonly released up
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.880]   to a month ahead of time.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.080]   So this was the first time we actually delayed--
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.120]   But why hold it at all?
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.840]   Why not have it in code.google.com?
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.360]   Why not just keep the source up there?
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.320]   Well, I mean, Andy really feels that to reduce the chance
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.080]   of people installing this on phones and reducing
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.400]   fragmentation that we should delay at this time.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.920]   Does that make it not open source?
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.920]   It makes Honeycomb not open source.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.520]   OK.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:51.880]   Yes.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.920]   It doesn't make Android not open source, though.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.640]   I know that seems like splitting hairs.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.680]   But basically, up through Gingerbread, it's all there.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.000]   All the code is there.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.960]   You can't take it back.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.680]   We wouldn't take it back.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.080]   And we're committed to open sourcing the code.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.920]   So it's just a matter of time.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.480]   What is the license?
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.120]   So it's Linux on the bottom.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.880]   So Linux is GPL.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.160]   And then we have various system utilities, some of which
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.400]   are GPL, but most of them are BSD.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.840]   And then you have the Android frameworks and UI and the rest.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.320]   And those are Apache.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.600]   And then there are some proprietary software,
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.320]   like the Gmail clients for proprietary, the Maps client
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.520]   is proprietary.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.600]   And that's just proprietary software.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.320]   So I mean, I don't see how you can say something that's
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.760]   licensed to BSD or GPL or Apache is not open source.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.640]   Well, people are-- they're a little upset because they want
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.920]   honeycomb out now, in total.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.640]   They don't just want the kernel and the rest.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.720]   They want everything.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.520]   And I understand that desire.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.320]   But they'll be satisfied when we do it.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.640]   Unfortunately, they won't be satisfied until we do it.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:04.080]   And so some people don't go from love to respect.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.440]   They go from love to hate.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.440]   Right.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.400]   There's no middle ground.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.680]   And so all I'll say is that we know and it'll come out.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.680]   But sorry it's not out yet.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.180]   Right.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.720]   Gina, you got anything?
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.760]   I think that--
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.000]   Halisa, I think that's reasonable.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.720]   To me, Android is open enough.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.000]   I mean, the thing that people are upset about,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.360]   it's like open source.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.720]   It's not open unless the source is released, right?
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.760]   Honeycomb source isn't released.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.000]   That's why Chris just said honeycomb is an open source.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   But Android is.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.360]   Leo's question is, do you define open source
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:43.000]   as I get to see the days commits that night versus kind
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.560]   of dropping it kind of later on?
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:50.920]   To some people, to the purists, that doesn't necessarily jibe.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.800]   And the thing I keep hearing is Google
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.800]   is using the open word as a marketing gimmick versus--
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.720]   they're not walking the talk.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.840]   I don't necessarily think that.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.160]   But when you're kind of going to base Android's whole cells,
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.240]   developers, and end-to-users, to some extent,
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.720]   and handset makers as that it's open,
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.960]   not releasing the source, it feels uncomfortable.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.040]   I wish that we had a date.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.360]   We had an idea.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.600]   Chris, can you say that honeycomb will drop some time
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.520]   this year or this quarter?
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.600]   I mean, honestly, I don't want to put you on the spot.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.120]   But I feel like--
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.280]   It's OK to put me on the spot.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.080]   I can't actually answer the question.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.160]   I can't answer it for Andy.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.200]   I can't answer for the Android.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.960]   So it wouldn't be right for me to do so.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.480]   Right.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.840]   Is there a chance that honeycomb will never drop,
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.040]   but it will incorporate the honeycomb changes
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.760]   into the next version that will be phone-ready and tablet-ready?
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.960]   No, I mean, that code's moving forward.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.200]   It's not like we're going to pretend that honeycomb didn't
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:44.720]   exist.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.680]   I don't think that's likely at all.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.680]   I think the best--
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.600]   I would say, so the funny thing about Google is,
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.400]   we've done a lot of open source projects.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.480]   We've done Chromium.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.080]   We've done Android.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.080]   We've done-- we released 400 different projects last year.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.200]   And so if you look at Google, we have every kind of project
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.960]   that will either make you happy as an open source advocate
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.360]   or make you unhappy.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.520]   We have ones that are just pure API releases that won't work
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.920]   if Google goes away.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.120]   And we release them once.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.560]   We have Chromium, which is this huge project.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.920]   And they do all their development pretty much in the open,
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.800]   almost universally.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.280]   And it's like, so we have our prod kernels,
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.480]   which do a ton of patches out to the mainline kernel.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.360]   We have the Android kernel, which
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.720]   sort of does some funny things with WicLocks.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.560]   And so we're only now finally getting more mainlining.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.600]   So basically, you can pick and choose.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.240]   If you want to be upset at Google,
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.040]   you can find something that'll make you upset.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.760]   If you want to be really happy about Google,
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.120]   I can point out a million things that'll make you happy.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.800]   So it comes down to how can we do what's best for the product
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.840]   and what's best for the open source community
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.040]   and do those converge?
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.240]   A lot of times they do.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.560]   Sometimes it gets kind of weird.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.000]   And that's just the nature of being
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.520]   in a very large organization.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.960]   Well, it's also the nature of--
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.880]   and it's the slippery slope of providing a handset operating
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.880]   system.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.080]   Yeah, remember, we have people who are making phone calls
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.880]   with this stuff.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.360]   So it's not just a computer.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.920]   It's not Chrome OS.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.320]   It's something very different.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.760]   Network operators enhance it.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.760]   Manufacturers both weigh in with their requirements here.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.680]   I'm not defending it, but I just--
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.680]   Yeah, no, you don't need to--
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.600]   I mean, mobile, though, is substantively
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.760]   different than shipping a computer.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.640]   There are regulatory requirements that are incredibly
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.200]   difficult to navigate.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.080]   There are all kinds of things.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:36.760]   And we set out to change the world of mobile with Android.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.000]   And part of that strategy was open sourcing.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.200]   And if you look at what Android has done,
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.920]   and how many people have taken it and run with it,
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.200]   I mean, can you picture an Amazon App Store on iPhone?
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.520]   I mean, no way.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.440]   And it's like it's in the nature of Android
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.240]   to help that kind of thing happen.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.240]   So yeah, I think that it's important.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.400]   It's still very important.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.720]   And so you feel confident.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.600]   I know I'm not asking you for a commitment,
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.960]   although I'd like to, but I don't think it's yours to make.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.680]   But you feel confident that the source will
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.760]   be released at some point.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.080]   Yeah, yeah, I do.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:04.920]   I do.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.120]   I mean, obviously only Andy Rubin can make that commitment.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.600]   He might not even be able to make that commitment.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.160]   You know, the way that Andy works and the way that Android
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.160]   works is that instead of making commitments,
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.680]   instead of going on programs and talking,
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.760]   I'm more echoing, I guess.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.200]   But they'll just do it.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.880]   And that level of communication is probably
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.800]   what frustrates some people.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.600]   But in some ways, the Android team
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.600]   is just more integrated.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.720]   You know, when it comes to the rest of the world of open source.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.560]   I think that comes out of coming out of the mobile world.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.160]   You know, mobile companies are used to talking in a certain way.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.760]   They don't want openness at all.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.960]   I mean, it's amazing you could even
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.520]   get close to open on a handset, to be honest.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.640]   They're sensitive.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.960]   And so those sensitivities might be over rock.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.120]   But they are sensitive.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.640]   And so we want them to like Android.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.680]   We want them to use Android.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.840]   And so that means we have to work with them.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.040]   And we want to work with them.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.720]   So, you know, if you look at what Android's been able to pull off
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.600]   over the last three years, it's pretty amazing.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.360]   You know, I mean, the number of carriers and handset
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.760]   manufacturers that have adopted Android, it's pretty great.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.800]   So given the nature of the business, right?
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.800]   I'm looking at-- I think the most cogent of the arguments
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.560]   came from Ryan Paul and ours Technica.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.840]   And what he says-- and I think this is legitimate--
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.960]   is that it creates uncertainty.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.360]   The lack-- he says, unfortunately,
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.280]   the utter lack of transparency surrounding Android development
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.720]   and the absence of a public roadmap
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.240]   make it impossible to guess if or when
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.480]   Honeycomb will be released.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.520]   The lack of code availability is especially bad for enthusiasts
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.080]   who are hoping to be able to install custom firmware
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.800]   on their Android tablets.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.480]   But ultimately, he says, even after the matter is resolved,
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.360]   the fact is that Google is willing to withhold source code
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.000]   at its whim for competitive reasons.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.640]   Might argue about what the reasons are,
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.120]   but is going to cast a dark shadow over the company's
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.960]   increasingly hollow claim that Android is an open platform.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.880]   That's an angry thing.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.960]   And that was quite a rant.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.800]   It's a angry way.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:15.920]   But I think that the one thing that I do say is absolutely true
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.800]   is it creates an uncertainty, a cloud of uncertainty.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:20.720]   Sure, sure.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.880]   I mean, think about it when we announced Android.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.960]   I think it was in 2007 or something crazy.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.640]   Like that.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.440]   There was no code for a year.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.720]   When we brought out the first Rev of Android,
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.680]   there wasn't even a phone that was running it for another,
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.040]   I think, three weeks.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.880]   And there's always going to be uncertainty.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.400]   The world of software is not certain.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.800]   The problem with purists is that life is not pure.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.680]   I'm going to come off like a little family.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.840]   I would say to the purist, if they want purity,
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.520]   I have gingerbread.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.200]   Gingerbread is purity.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.720]   Gingerbread is--
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.760]   Fully open sourced.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.920]   It's all out there, except for the top layer.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.520]   That's Google, juice only, Gmail, and stuff like that.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.440]   All the rest of it.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.680]   And those people don't care about that.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.600]   And for those applications, we offer standardized IMAP interfaces
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.600]   so they can use the open source email program.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.280]   They can do whatever they want.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.840]   I'd love to know about a roadmap, though.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.240]   I think that's an interesting point, too.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.680]   There's not really been an idea.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.240]   I think that roadmap that will satisfy enthusiasts
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.480]   would be very, very difficult to come up with.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.920]   I think they have roadmaps that they share with handset
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.640]   manufacturers and carrier partners who
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.200]   are committed to shipping hundreds of thousands of units a day.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.600]   And so they prioritize.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.160]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.600]   This is the difficult part of it.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.720]   You ship the hardware, because they're
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.400]   the ones making the multi-billion dollar
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.480]   commitments to the platform.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.680]   That's the problem of being in it.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.880]   That's really hard for people to hear,
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.200]   because open source doesn't work that way.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.280]   It doesn't work on commitment.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.520]   So shipping tens of thousands of units a day
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.040]   or hundreds of thousands of units a day.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.400]   They work on the idea that developers
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.640]   can have control over their individual piece of hardware.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.920]   But when we have to pay attention to the 350,000 plus devices
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.280]   that are shipping every day, it means
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.720]   that you end up walking a little bit away
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.280]   from the people who can't ship that many.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.440]   And that kind of stinks, right?
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.440]   Because it makes you feel like, oh, am I not cool enough?
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.920]   Am I not popular enough?
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.520]   Well, you are.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.600]   But right now, we have to concentrate
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.080]   on the future of the platform.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.720]   And that means the people who will make that future, which,
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.240]   frankly, kind of isn't the enthusiast community.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.080]   That said, if you look at the application developers,
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.280]   we try to cater to them like crazy.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.160]   And they are being well-served by the SDKs and all the rest.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.240]   So it's like, it's really tough.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.880]   Because these are my friends.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.280]   I hate seeing them unhappy.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.000]   And these are people who I'm also paid to care about.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.120]   But I also care about them.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.880]   So I want to satisfy them.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.480]   But right now, Android satisfaction with Android
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.320]   means let me introduce you to Gingerbread and Honeycomb
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.560]   will come later.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.720]   Well, and the opposite of this would be open moku, which
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.480]   was a fully open cell phone platform that didn't go anywhere.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.840]   Because you couldn't get a handset manufacturer to use it.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.720]   Well, open moku tried.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.560]   And then they did some really remarkable things
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.520]   for what they had.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.320]   So good on them.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.600]   So I think with Migo and like Symbian,
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.680]   they've all tried open source.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.160]   Open source is really hard.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.240]   It's hard to do in that space.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.200]   I mean--
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.000]   Android's kicking ass.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.520]   Right.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.440]   Android's kicking butt, right?
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.360]   So the question becomes, so open source is really hard.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.560]   Sailor is really hard.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.880]   Mobile is really hard.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.800]   UIs are really hard.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.920]   All this stuff is really hard.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.280]   And the punishment for failure is you lose a lot of money.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.160]   You lose a lot of time.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.960]   You lose 400 engineers working night and day
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.400]   weekends for four years.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.560]   I mean, it's a tough commitment to make.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.040]   And then many people simply fail when they try it.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.600]   I mean, think of all the mobile S's
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.720]   that simply aren't around anymore.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.680]   I mean, can you picture the Sony Ericsson mobile
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.040]   in your mind anymore?
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.040]   No.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:44.560]   No.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.920]   And I really don't want to picture the Android robot
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.320]   with his son on thumbs.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.120]   But that's enough.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.480]   He's really like Android.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.160]   That's great.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.000]   But it's like, they also see it as a way of, wow,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.800]   we don't have to develop around an operating system anyway.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.280]   That's really good for us.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.280]   Right.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.880]   And that was, I'm sure, why Nokia took a billion dollar
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.840]   payout from Microsoft and said, OK, forget Symbian.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.560]   We don't really like that anyway.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.640]   And I'm not calling you.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.840]   So Larry's first week as CEO.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.680]   Where is Eric?
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.280]   Is he-- he's writing a book?
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.720]   I heard.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.120]   Yeah, he was working with a co-writer
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.320]   by the name of Jared Cohen on a book.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.600]   But I have no idea what the status is.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.080]   Yeah, Eric and I, we don't hang out.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.520]   I don't know if you know this.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.480]   I know of editors who've seen the book proposal.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.560]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.000]   Is it a tell-all?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.920]   Yes, it'll say all of the nasty things.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.520]   No, I don't.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.920]   I have to be honest with you.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.000]   So Eric is going to write, I'm sure, a very interesting book.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.880]   And I'm going to read it.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.880]   I have no idea what it's about.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.000]   We will too, of course, no matter what.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.160]   I understand it's a historical romance based in the 1800s.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:54.320]   So Larry Page takes power.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.520]   And Jonathan Rosenberg exits senior vice president
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.000]   of product management.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.440]   Yes.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.880]   Hard not to draw a connection.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.480]   I'm going to let someone else draw a connection,
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.800]   because I honestly have no idea.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:09.560]   What do you think, Jeff, was Jonathan Eric's man?
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.840]   What I've heard and seen, but it's not much more
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.800]   than anyone else has, is just that it's--
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.000]   number one word was that Larry wanted a long term
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.040]   of commitment from people.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.600]   And we'll try to understand that to be built.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.960]   He's building his team now.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:24.600]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.560]   And he's going to depend upon his team.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.600]   And then secondly, you're bound to have changes
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.760]   in how things operate.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.000]   And I don't know that it was Larry versus Eric,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.880]   because tell me if I'm wrong, Chris.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:40.320]   But I doubt you really could have much of the way of camps,
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.880]   because you had to please all three all the time, pretty much.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.520]   Yeah, I mean, the times when I've had to go for them
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.880]   for approval for things, I know it's all three of them
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.240]   in the room.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.600]   They always seem extremely collegial.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.680]   They all seem to work well and productively together.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.200]   So it's hard to criticize.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.880]   He wrote the meaning of open memo.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.380]   Right.
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.640]   Which was a great memo.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.600]   Right at the end of December, right before the holidays.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.080]   So have you seen-- have they changed the paint scheme?
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.760]   Anything going on around there that's
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.040]   a little different now with Larry?
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.320]   We installed more electric car parking.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.160]   That's good.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.680]   We like that.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.680]   I think that's what's going on.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.880]   I mean, what's funny is, you know,
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:25.360]   Eric transitioning to the, I guess, the chairman role,
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.000]   or whatever.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.040]   Was, I guess, almost a month and a half ago now.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.320]   And I guess, you know, I sort of like, oh, OK, it's changed.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.920]   Yeah, you kind of expect at a company
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.480]   that size business is usual, right?
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.840]   I mean--
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.520]   Yeah, I mean, Eric had been here almost a decade, right?
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.360]   So it's a long time, right?
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.720]   So yeah, you know, it was OK.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.280]   And I have nothing but respect for Larry.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.800]   So I don't just say that because he's the boss.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.920]   He's the best.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.560]   I may go a little valley wag on you, though, here.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.560]   OK.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.280]   According to search engine land.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.440]   Search engine land, OK?
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.240]   Chris Sherman writing.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.240]   Eric Schmidt apparently tried to get the search results.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:14.120]   This is an excerpt from Steven Levy's book In The Plex.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.160]   Asked Google to remove search results
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.360]   about a political donation that he had made,
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.960]   according to Steven Levy writing.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.960]   One day Denise Griffin got a call from Eric Schmidt's assistant.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.480]   Quote, "There's this information about Eric
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.840]   and the indexes," she told Griffin.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.760]   And we wanted out to her credit, by the way,
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.760]   or to Google's credit.
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.520]   They did not.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.520]   Which I think is important.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:36.200]   They did not.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.320]   That was the best part of that.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.120]   So I guess the time--
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:38.720]   If this is true--
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.480]   --probably this excerpt.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.400]   Yeah, this is from The New York Times.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.520]   Of Steven's book.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.680]   Steven's going to be on the show at the end of the month.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.400]   Oh, excellent.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.240]   I love Steven.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.000]   He's great.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.360]   Guy that wrote hackers.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:53.240]   He's performing doing a reading at the Computer History Museum,
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:53.840]   I think tonight.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.720]   No need.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.920]   No, very cool.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.840]   Griffin explained that it wasn't Google's policy
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.880]   to take things like that out of the index,
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.200]   just because people didn't want it there.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.720]   After she hung up the phone, she freaked out.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.360]   Does it-- Eric, no, we don't do that?
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.720]   That's my favorite line.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:10.400]   Was it Eric?
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.920]   No.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.120]   We don't know when this happened.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.720]   I mean, it might have been-- maybe it was his first day.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.160]   I don't know.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.880]   Well, it was so long ago that a certain Facebook executive
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.640]   was the one who supposedly said no.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.200]   Oh, that's Cheryl Sandberg.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.200]   Cheryl Sandberg, that's right.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.720]   It was awesome.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.520]   She did a really good TED Talk recently.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.640]   I don't know, a few.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.560]   But she's at Facebook now.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.320]   But she did a great TED Talk about women in the workplace.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.120]   But I love that she supposedly was the one who said no.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.200]   We're not taking it out.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:35.600]   So these--
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.560]   Griffin calls her boss, Cheryl Sandberg,
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.360]   and they had several conversations
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.200]   before they finally trudged up to Eric's office
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.080]   and told him it wasn't Google's job, nor should it
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.600]   be, to filter his personal information.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.120]   Sir.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.120]   And by the way, you can still get those search results
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.880]   for Schmidt's political donations.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.160]   I guess he didn't take a job as a Secretary of Commerce.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.600]   Is that off the table?
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.040]   Did Obama hire somebody?
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:03.760]   We don't know.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.080]   I know that he said the Secretary of Commerce
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.320]   was now the ambassador to China, which
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.760]   is in a shing, you graduated to that.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.400]   So I guess the spot's open if you want it.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:15.800]   Leo.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.320]   Do you think Rosenberg-- yeah, I do want it.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.200]   Do you think Rosenberg will go to Facebook?
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.200]   Oh, gosh.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.200]   I have no idea.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:22.760]   I got it.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.840]   They are.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:27.600]   They're building that nice new campus in the old Sun campus
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.640]   in Menlo Park.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.040]   So I actually asked if you-- what I heard about them moving
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.360]   to the-- well, we used to call that Sun Quent--
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.360]   Sun Quent?
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.440]   Yeah, because it's basically at the end of Willow Road,
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.560]   right on the water.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.440]   And it gets to it during traffic in the morning.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.640]   It literally takes like 20 minutes to do the mile from 101
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.600]   to that location.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.200]   I'm sure they're building a tunnel just for Facebook employees.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.800]   I want to say, they build like their own subway
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.000]   and their own monorail or something.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.400]   I'm like, wow, you just destroyed
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.680]   an hour's worth of productivity for every employee who
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:57.440]   worked on that site.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.880]   Well, no, the problem is-- and probably the much
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:03.520]   of the point of this is don't leave.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.440]   Do not leave.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.440]   They give them three free meals a day.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.000]   They're having special cafes built
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.680]   by a very famous restaurant designer.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.400]   No, I'm sure they'll be lovely.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.480]   But I mean, getting work is going to be a huge hassle.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.280]   I'll never leave.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.920]   If my sister actually used to work basically in one
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.440]   of the sublet buildings there.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.800]   She's like, it's miserable.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.400]   It took her less time to get to foster city every day.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.880]   Oh, man.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.800]   So I mean, I'm not trying to tease Facebook.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.400]   I mean, I have a lot of friends there.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.880]   I just-- man, find somewhere else.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.720]   They've got Roman and Williams.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.800]   They did Breslin and the John Dory restaurants
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.600]   at the Ace Hotel in New York City.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.040]   This could be very trendoid.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:52.880]   Very beautiful.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.400]   Well, John Dory--
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.720]   That person did something else, too, that I really liked.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.920]   But anyway, it's not important.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.040]   Yeah, Roman and Williams.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.560]   Well, we can go to their website and find out more.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.160]   Yes.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.720]   Let's do that instead of doing the podcast.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:04.080]   I like it.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:08.520]   The New York Times also knew that it was called Sunquinton.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.360]   That's good reporting.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:09.880]   Oh, really?
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.960]   No, that is-- I mean, that's kind of cultural out here.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.560]   Sunquinton.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:21.960]   Google is bidding $900 million for Nortel's patent portfolio.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:22.960]   Yep.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:27.200]   And they say they will use it as a defensive shield.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:27.720]   Yes.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.000]   Is that how this works now?
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.640]   They don't actually need any of the patents.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.560]   They just need to be able to have something
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.080]   to throw at others who would throw things at them.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.080]   Well, I mean, since we have articulated
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.040]   defensive patent policy at Google,
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.720]   it is worth saying that the Nortel patents,
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.920]   they cover a lot of areas around networking, which we
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.400]   are very heavily invested in.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.560]   So it kind of applies.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.640]   So yeah.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:55.040]   They say both Android and Chrome will benefit
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.040]   from this acquisition.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.400]   Yeah, we've talked about this before, Jeff, right?
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.840]   It's like mutually assured patent destruction.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.160]   Right.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.600]   It's just the damnedest business we've
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.400]   gotten ourselves into is all I'm saying.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:12.960]   If you sue me over my patents, then I'll sue you over your--
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.160]   Well, the worst thing about it is it's so deleterious
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.800]   on people's time.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.640]   You end up spending time in depositions.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.320]   You end up spending time in court.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.280]   You end up spending a lot of money on lawyers.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:31.920]   It's a tax, really, on successful organizations.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.400]   And I don't think it really helps the quote inventor
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.120]   unquote anymore.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.160]   It's like Larry Lessig says about fair use.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:41.960]   That's a right only to hire lawyers.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:46.160]   And in this case, too, this is the Legal Full Employment
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:46.960]   Act.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.520]   And it's not doing what it's supposed to do,
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.840]   which is to improve innovation.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.840]   Right.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.800]   I have a lot of opinions.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.080]   Most of which I can't share.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.040]   We can read your mind.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:58.560]   It's OK.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.760]   You don't have to say.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.280]   So--
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:00.640]   I don't know.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:04.120]   When you said you couldn't share an opinions in the May 6th
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:04.880]   episode of--
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.880]   What was that opinion?
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.480]   Big.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.000]   What was that opinion?
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.040]   Share with us now.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.440]   I'm going to show you why I'm moving to Italy.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.480]   And it's not for the pasta.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.200]   Isn't this the most amazing story?
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.040]   When I type Leo LePorte is into--
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.400]   Oh.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.800]   --into Google--
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.440]   --a legendary broadcaster.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.080]   Leo LePorte is an idiot.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.080]   He's a tooth failure.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.280]   He's a Mac fan boy.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.080]   Libel.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.840]   The robots committed Libel.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.080]   I get to sue.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.160]   Well, that's what it says.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.640]   And if I'm in Italy, I could win.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.400]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.120]   Chris Tobona is here, program manager,
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.560]   four open source at Google.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.920]   Great to have you, Chris.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.960]   Gina and Jeff also, we're talking about the Google and the cloud.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.200]   We'll talk a little bit more about the cloud Amazon style
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.240]   and just a little bit.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.640]   And of course, why I'm moving to Italy.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.080]   But it actually might be for the pasta, actually.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:56.680]   Pasta.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.960]   Pasta.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.240]   You might find it on, like, oh, come on.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.480]   Pasta's always involved.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.320]   Don't you talk about it?
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.600]   That's your ponnie's a town, right?
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.920]   Yes, it is, in Sicily.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.400]   Yeah, we're going, baby.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.280]   That's-- let's do it, baby.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:09.840]   It's your ponnie.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.960]   Here I come.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.320]   Meanwhile, in order to go to Tripani
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.440]   and live there for the rest of my life,
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.800]   I have to invoice some clients.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.920]   Unfortunately, I have a cheap and easy way to do it.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.080]   In fact, if you have fewer than three clients, three clients,
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.080]   it's free.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.120]   Three or less is free at freshbooks.com.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:31.440]   Actually, I discovered this about seven years ago now.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.040]   When I was still sending out invoices,
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.160]   I started using FreshBooks.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.680]   Amber MacArthur told me about it.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.280]   And I tell you, it made me money because I was--
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:40.000]   I hate invoicing so much.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.480]   And if you're a freelancer, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.720]   That I would forget, I would put it off.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.880]   I sent a company invoices nine months old once.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.280]   And they said, no, no.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.360]   We don't have to pay you after.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.800]   There's a statute of limitations.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.520]   I got the money, but it wasn't easy.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.880]   This changed my life.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.400]   FreshBooks.com.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.440]   You send them your logo.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.040]   They create-- and you know, create on the website.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.200]   You create these invoices that look great,
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.320]   look professional, but they have a special feature
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.360]   that I really love.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:14.400]   A "Pay It Now" button so that your clients can just pay you.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.080]   In fact, they can even set up automatic payment
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.600]   through their credit card.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.960]   They also use 11 payment services, including
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.720]   authorize.net, PayPal, first data.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.360]   Makes it very easy to get paid.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:28.760]   That means you're going to get paid more quickly.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.040]   In fact, according to FreshBooks users,
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.960]   they get paid on average 14 days faster
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.720]   than before they started using FreshBooks.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.040]   Got old fashioned clients who still want paper invoices.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.200]   FreshBooks will stamp them.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.280]   They're going to stamp them and mail them for you
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.440]   for an additional fee.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:41.800]   Not much.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.480]   I can't remember what it was, but it's very affordable.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.280]   It's a little bit over the postage.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.600]   I just love FreshBooks.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.160]   They even have an iPhone app that will automatically
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.440]   track hours and input it into the invoice,
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.760]   or you could do it on the web.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.120]   You can actually invoice from your iPhone.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.520]   Well, I wish they'd had that in 2004.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.720]   I want you to give it a try for freefreshbooks.com.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.640]   Sign up today, and you'll be in the drawing
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.160]   for a birthday cake.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.520]   You don't have to be your birthday.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.600]   You have free birthday cake every day this month.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.640]   FreshBooks.com.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.040]   Try it for free right now.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.920]   Click that green button in the upper right-hand corner.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.600]   We love them, and I know you're going to love them too.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.720]   FreshBooks.com, the easy way to invoice.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.680]   So what's the story?
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.840]   Somebody sued because they didn't like the instant search
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.120]   results on Google.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:28.600]   Right.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.240]   The Google suggests in the dropdown.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.880]   That's what I'm getting right here,
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.520]   where I go, Leo Laporte is an idiot,
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.720]   a douche, a Mac fanboy, that one.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.520]   I think Mac fanboy is the one you should sue him.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.120]   I want to sue him over that.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:41.480]   So--
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.200]   I tell you, you like the Mac?
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:47.520]   So this guy puts his name in, and the suggestion
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:51.760]   autocompletes, con and fraud, fraud, or con man afterwards.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.960]   And then he soothes Google for libel.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:55.560]   And he wins.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.080]   And wins.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.000]   This is in Italy.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:57.720]   Yes.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.160]   And he wins.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.680]   Which is really scary, because it then
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.600]   makes Google responsible for the content
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.000]   of the entire internet.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.720]   Exactly.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.080]   It's just--
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.440]   You really want to eat that pasta, knowing who makes it?
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.800]   Not anymore.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.480]   This is what the court--
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:16.320]   let's see.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.480]   What did the-- I'm trying to find the court what the court said.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.240]   I don't understand how this could even happen,
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.680]   except that the judge in the court was a nitwit.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.840]   Well, he has the judges the nitwit.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.280]   And don't forget that there's a Google antipathy in Europe,
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.520]   and also already in Italy, where three executives in Italy
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.280]   have been a found guilty of.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.080]   I forget exactly what the crimes were.
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.760]   But David and two other--
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.280]   Right.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:38.280]   Chris.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.280]   Right.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.440]   It's time legal system.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.280]   There was a video on YouTube that they felt
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.720]   we didn't pull down fast enough.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.200]   Thank you.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.480]   That they created some Italian boys beating up
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.760]   on another Italian boy, who was a special needs kid.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.280]   You know, so yeah.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.400]   I'm trying to think somehow how this could be justified.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.680]   I guess the only thing the judge might have thought is,
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.000]   well, clearly, this is gaming Google.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.800]   And that Google should be more insensitive to gaming,
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.800]   or could-- Who knows it's gaming.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.800]   Maybe it's like somebody's name's same name, right?
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.000]   I mean, it could be a couple of things.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.320]   It could be lots of things.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:19.320]   But the precedent it sets is that it's the same worldview
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.040]   as my dear friends in Germany that they expect the internet
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.840]   to be controlled and packaged like a medium
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:31.440]   and that they just don't understand what it is.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.360]   And they don't understand the freedom of speech issues
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:37.720]   that that's like saying that you can sue every library in Italy
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.600]   if it has a book you don't like in it.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:43.040]   Or it's like the libel tourism that we see in the UK that if you
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:47.360]   say something-- if I say something bad about some SCUS bucket
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.160]   and one person in the UK reads it,
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.240]   then he can sue me in the UK because the laws are better
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:51.740]   there.
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:53.720]   Why do I get Leo LaPorte as a douchebag when
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.280]   Gina gets Gina Trapani is married.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.240]   She's not right.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:58.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.360]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.320]   But the problem here is that what we get down to
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:05.120]   is the lowest common denominator or highest watermark,
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.680]   I guess, of idiocy that we become liable to.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.920]   So the EU, Vivian Redding, just put together a set
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.560]   of four principles for the internet, one of which
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.360]   is that it has makes sense on its face,
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.720]   but it doesn't in practice is that if you have data
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:26.800]   in a service in Europe and the data is stored in the US,
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.560]   that it's now, should propose European law,
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:33.440]   but it has to be stored under the same exact rules as Europe.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:39.320]   Well, if we grant that kind of reciprocity to the EU,
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.160]   rather, I'm saying to the EU, what happens when China says,
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.720]   ah, we claim the same rule.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:49.440]   And we're all ruled by the highest watermark of censorship,
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.400]   the highest watermark of controlled,
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.400]   and the internet cannot work that way.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.520]   By the way, Jeff.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:59.200]   It's a funny story, but it's a dangerous mindset.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.320]   Jeff, Google has a response to you.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.000]   Jeff Jarvis is an idiot.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.560]   Jeff Jarvis is a twit.
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.560]   But that's a compliment.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.200]   It seems like it's just a fundamental misunderstanding
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.800]   that this is content that Google is saying that this person is.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.320]   And I mean, the Google was doing some editing.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:19.440]   I mean, at the press event, when Google announced
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.600]   the auto suggest didn't Irina Stutsky, didn't she say?
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.120]   Sluts?
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.360]   I'm not sure how to say her last name,
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.720]   but her name, there were no suggestions for her.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.520]   She was black because of the slut.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.520]   Right, right.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.360]   Slutsky.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.880]   Which she's not now.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:32.320]   I see.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:35.720]   But Google is doing some of that kind of thing.
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.320]   I mean, I--
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.680]   If you're doing an error with word cases.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:39.680]   But just for Pondo--
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.960]   But I know you do safe search editing on suggestions.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.840]   Because safe search.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:44.640]   Right.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.120]   Right.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.600]   What if the guy is a condo?
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.280]   Right.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:52.280]   There's an issue here is that I'm going to go and use some company
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.680]   to do you not want to go to Italy again?
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.480]   It's like sub-detect.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.920]   Is that what you're telling us?
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:57.600]   Diddly.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:58.440]   You going to boycott?
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.520]   I mean, if you call him a con, he might--
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.440]   He could sue you too.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.200]   I get sued.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:03.720]   Right.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.800]   Well, let's say that I go on and I use Google the way it's used,
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:12.160]   which is to find a road or a subject tank cleaner.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.480]   And I'm comparing between three of them.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.000]   Well, one of them may be bad.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.600]   And there is reviews up all over saying the person's bad.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.440]   And Google ends up summarizing that as to say con.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:26.720]   Or in my case, perhaps the idea that Dell sucked.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.240]   Right.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.480]   Yep.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:32.840]   We're going to take a little break coming up.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:36.120]   Chipotle's hidden menu.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:36.960]   This--
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.000]   I can't wait to find that.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.040]   This is my gift to you.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.040]   Well, that was a huge app.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.000]   I thought that was Eileen.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:44.520]   Awesome.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:45.360]   That was me.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.640]   I'm going to give you a full field report.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:49.640]   And I'm--
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.200]   You're welcome.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.120]   This is why people listen to this show.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.720]   You thought it was Google, the cloud, Amazon?
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.960]   No.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.120]   Chipotle's hidden menu.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.320]   I'm actually really curious.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:00.840]   If my daughter--
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:03.280]   We could probably probably once every two weeks, you know.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.280]   Why do they not advertise on this show?
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.960]   I have just baffled.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.160]   Because we got to give Leo--
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.320]   Have you contacted them?
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.320]   Yes.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.640]   They wanted to give us free tacos.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:14.640]   Free tacos?
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.760]   Do you give the code twig at the counter or something?
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.680]   No, that would be good.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.160]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:18.680]   Sorry.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.840]   The guy said-- the guy said give us a proposal.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:21.680]   Oh.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.000]   Well, have we proposed?
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:23.680]   I don't know.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.960]   Ask your staff.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.680]   I am.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:27.680]   Please.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.680]   Please, sir.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.360]   All right, we shall work on that.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:37.400]   But we also have other news about Facebook, Google, Amazon.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.560]   Actually, kind of an interesting leak
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.920]   of the next Google Android Marketplace
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.880]   with an interesting application.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.320]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:50.040]   But before we do, I would love to mention our friends at squarespace.com,
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:54.120]   the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.400]   Squarespace is just doing a great job.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.840]   And I don't know if--
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:02.640]   I guess I can't talk about the next--
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.120]   version 6 is on its way.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.160]   And it's just amazing.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:05.960]   I want you to take a look.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.120]   Version 5, pretty darn good as it is.
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.080]   If you go to squarespace.com/twig,
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.920]   you can see what all the ruckus is about.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:16.560]   This is the next generation of web hosting and content
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.720]   management software all rolled into one.
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.480]   Now, if you've got an existing site,
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.360]   you can import it using the traditional APIs, Blogger, TypePad,
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.200]   WordPress, moveable type.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.240]   You won't just import the posts.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.560]   You'll import all the images.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:34.640]   The links will stay true, all the comments to.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:39.120]   And true to Google's data liberation organization,
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.520]   it goes both ways.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.920]   You can get into and out.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.160]   You're never trapped.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.920]   They've got a great iPhone and iPad app.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.360]   Actually, the reason the importing is important
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.760]   is when you try it for free, you can literally just
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.560]   create a site without a credit card or anything.
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:54.240]   And play with all the great templates and stuff.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.840]   And then import your data so you can really
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.160]   get a sense of what your new squarespace site would look like.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.320]   Add some social widgets for Flickr, Twitter, RSS feeds,
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.680]   and more.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.320]   Some beautiful photo galleries, a lot of photographers
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.520]   and artists use squarespace.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.480]   Of course, there's some advanced features
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:13.120]   like form building and data collection and forums
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.000]   that make it-- they're advanced in the sense
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.040]   that the capabilities are advanced, make it very easy,
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.800]   though you don't have to know anything.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.480]   No CSS or JavaScript needed.
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:22.520]   Very intuitive editing.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.440]   It's all drag and drop.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.240]   I'll tell you, just take a look at the examples.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:29.640]   You'll realize a squarespace blog can go anywhere you want to go.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.920]   squarespace.com/toy, try it free today.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:34.000]   Get two weeks free.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.400]   It's a great way to show your school, your civic group,
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:43.880]   your friends and family, what a website forum could look like.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.760]   And then you say, here's the password.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.640]   It's yours.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.720]   I think this is really a cool idea.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:53.960]   squarespace.com/toy, we thank them for their support.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.840]   This week in Google, Kristobona is with us.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:01.560]   He's a program manager for open source at the Goog.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.840]   I guess I teased it, so I better give it--
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:06.040]   give it, even though this really is like--
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:08.760]   what you would traditionally put it as the last story,
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:12.000]   the kicker, the silly season story of the show.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.120]   Is this the burrito?
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:13.520]   Chit.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:17.160]   Yeah, it's Chipotle's secret menu.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:20.440]   So I forget what's the blog there, Leo, on the list.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.800]   It is, "Serious New York Eats."
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.560]   Serious Eats.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.280]   Yeah, New York.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:25.040]   Yeah, come.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:25.280]   Serious Eats.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:25.880]   God bless.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:28.600]   You see, this is the beauty of network world.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:32.280]   Someone on Twitter, a Twig fan, said,
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.160]   Jarvis, you got to go to this, this Chipotle.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:37.400]   And like we did that, and this is a special Chipotle
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.080]   where there is a--
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:38.560]   In Chelsea.
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.800]   --world-known chef.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.080]   No, this isn't Manhattan, 18th and 8th.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.320]   I wasn't going to tell the world until I went.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.000]   Oh, I see.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.200]   So you gave us some just random link.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.320]   Aha!
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.440]   Now this is the real link.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.280]   And so at 18th and 8th, they have a chef
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.960]   who's been working behind the counter there
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.080]   and creating special stuff.
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:01.720]   So the best part of this is that he has a chicken
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:05.520]   and pork chorizo meat selection in addition
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.480]   to the usual chicken and beef and such and such.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.800]   And it is killer.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.080]   It is charred, spicy, and wonderful.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:17.080]   And they have margaritas.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.240]   They have margaritas, which is the other great part
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:21.040]   in which they make with patron.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:21.720]   Patron.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.680]   Whoa, patron margaritas, I'm there.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:24.880]   It is true.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:29.360]   And they also do the pork and the beef differently.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:30.800]   Because some of those things come in that,
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.200]   what's that way you cook it in the bag?
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:32.920]   It's--
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.120]   They do it-- they do it especially.
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:35.920]   What do they call it?
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:36.760]   What do they call it?
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.200]   El Paso store, is that what they call it?
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.880]   The sauces are all done differently in the store.
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.840]   The beans are done differently in the store.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.080]   They use a different rice.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:48.120]   It's more brownie stuff with stuff in it.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:51.160]   The tortilla is whole wheat.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:53.760]   It's like-- you remember the Bizarro episode of Seinfeld?
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.160]   This is the Bizarro Chipotle.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.600]   But it's a test kitchen for them.
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.080]   Yeah, it is.
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:58.560]   But it's public.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.560]   You wouldn't know if thing is different.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.040]   You wouldn't know anything at all, which
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.360]   is kind of brave of them.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.520]   The old Holiday Inn, no surprises.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.320]   McDonald's all the same.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:10.200]   You go into this one, and the flavors are just different.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.760]   And it's really good.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.040]   Chelsea's a pretty crazy neighborhood.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:14.840]   I like Chelsea.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:15.840]   I always like Chelsea.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:16.360]   I like Chelsea a lot.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.240]   I am so going to this store.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.680]   I'm coming out to New York for Blog World in May.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.200]   Ah!
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.400]   Field trip.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.440]   Why don't you come to, Jim?
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.560]   We'll have a field trip.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.840]   I'm thinking about New York in May.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.240]   What's-- what's the blog on the line?
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:29.800]   What are the blog movies?
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.080]   I was going to speak in Blog World, too.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.720]   Well, maybe we could all do the show from Blog World,
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.440]   Blog World Expo.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:38.040]   Oh, we do it from Chipotle.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:38.960]   Well, that's what I'm thinking.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:41.720]   Maybe we could go from this Chipotle.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:42.800]   Oh, this is good.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:46.560]   It is May 24 through 26.
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:47.560]   Oh.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:48.060]   Wow.
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:48.560]   Come on, Jim.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.760]   Just stay a little longer.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:50.560]   I can do.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.280]   Stay a little longer.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.280]   You know, I think I'll be in New York, then.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.200]   I'll come by.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.280]   Great, Chris, you're on.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:59.480]   So anyway, that's my little gift for you.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.480]   Thank you.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.840]   Usually, I'm a Chipotle for lunch only guy.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.400]   But the other night, I was teaching late,
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.760]   and my wife said to heck with you, I'm eating first.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.840]   And so I went by there, and I had a nice margarita,
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:12.720]   which I normally do.
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:16.160]   And I had the bowl, which was the chorizo.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.920]   And it was lovely.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.520]   I'm getting-- you're making me so hungry.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.280]   Let's run through the last few stories
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.680]   so I can get the hell out of here.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:26.160]   Twitter is getting a tax break from San Francisco.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.920]   San Francisco has a fairly onerous--
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:28.760]   That pass?
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.160]   Yes.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.320]   San Francisco has a fairly onerous payroll tax,
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.600]   one and a half percent payroll tax, not just on payroll,
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.280]   but on stock options.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.480]   And so when a company goes public in San Francisco,
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.200]   it costs millions.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.960]   They passed an exemption for-- not just for Twitter,
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:49.040]   but from any company that's in kind of the tenderloin,
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.200]   kind of the nasty areas of San Francisco.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.280]   Twitter is going to take over the old landmark
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:57.080]   on 10th and Market Street, which is just on the edge
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.400]   of that area.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.440]   They say they'll save $21 million in payroll taxes
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.880]   over the next couple of years thanks
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:05.760]   to this tax break in San Francisco.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:06.800]   I got no opinion on it.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:11.120]   I think it makes sense for the city to keep companies like Zinga
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.680]   and Twitter happy.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:18.840]   The commercial real estate prices, the employment in San
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:21.080]   Francisco is in great shape, the economies in great shape.
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.520]   And it's because of the tech companies that are there.
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.720]   So you want to keep them there.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.240]   But there are a lot of people who say,
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.040]   how I should Twitter get a break.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:33.360]   Mad Men will be streaming on Netflix joining Glee.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.560]   Netflix is interesting.
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.760]   I think that they're getting into the distribution business.
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:38.920]   That's exactly what they're doing.
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:41.480]   Mad Men is made by a company called Lionsgate
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.560]   and licensed to the movie, whatever, the A&E, whatever
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:47.000]   channel, AMC.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.440]   AMC.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:51.760]   For millions of dollars, they have made a secondary deal now
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.200]   for what's estimated to be a million dollars
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:58.000]   in episode for all the seasons of Mad Men for streaming.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.760]   Rather than selling it to TBS or some other--
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:00.760]   Right.
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:01.840]   --or worse outlet.
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:04.600]   How long before they go right to Netflix?
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:05.800]   And eliminate AMC entirely?
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:06.800]   It's already happened.
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:07.440]   It's already happened.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:08.480]   I think we had on the list last week.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:09.320]   That's right.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:12.160]   They're making Netflix-only products.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.360]   First one series.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:17.200]   And so Netflix-- and this is a beautiful, beautiful moment
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.480]   because it breaks open, potentially, the hegemony
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:24.120]   of the old networks.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:28.360]   And so we'll once again ask, why do we need a network?
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.720]   Why do we need a network?
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.960]   For the level that we don't really need?
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:34.320]   And why do we need a cable company?
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.640]   Why do we need all that stuff?
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.640]   You know, MSOs.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.120]   Well, you know, and the cable companies
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.920]   have really resisted allocart pricing, which
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.960]   has been very frustrating.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:44.160]   I mean, it's like, you know, to get the sopranos back
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:47.760]   when I had cable, you would end up having to pay $150
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:48.960]   a month for an HBO.
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:49.360]   Oh, an HBO.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:52.040]   We really didn't ever want to put that on iTunes or anywhere.
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.240]   I mean, they really-- they realized
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.480]   that was where their money was.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:57.120]   Although you have to wonder if Netflix--
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:59.440]   at $7.99 a month for a streaming
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.720]   subscription, are they going to make their million dollars
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.840]   an episode back?
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.360]   Or is this just their way of saying,
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:08.040]   we want to be in this business?
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:08.840]   I think you're right.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:09.960]   It's their way of saying that.
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:13.680]   But they can account for this in many ways, right?
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.840]   Because it's not just on the money on the Netflix.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.120]   It's how many people now-- you know,
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:20.200]   I'm going to confess something here, worse even
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.520]   than I go to Chipotle for dinner, which is--
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.760]   I don't use Netflix.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.760]   Netflix.com/Twit.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:29.800]   And for now.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.720]   We've been looking for people who don't use Netflix.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.480]   I don't think there are many, many of them.
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.000]   Please sign up today.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:35.720]   So I will.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:36.640]   I will.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.240]   And all the--
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:37.800]   You know the thing.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.520]   Well, it will be interesting, though.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:41.080]   This knocks me over the edge.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.560]   $7.99, and you can watch Mad Men, you can watch Glee.
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.360]   I'm doing it.
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.120]   I'm doing it.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:45.760]   It's great.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:46.360]   It's really great.
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:47.440]   Totally worth it.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.080]   Completely worth it.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:50.960]   And I have to say, you know, the other side of this equation
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:53.560]   is that now people with PlayStation 3s and Xboxes
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:57.360]   and Wees and Roku boxes, many new TVs, almost all
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:58.480]   the new Blu-ray players, they all
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:01.080]   have Netflix streaming capability on a big stream.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.360]   But not in Honeycomb.
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.360]   Not Honeycomb.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:05.160]   Not in Android.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.560]   In Android yet.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:07.160]   Anyway, sorry.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.040]   That was my last one.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.720]   No, I don't blame you.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.840]   You can get it on iOS.
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:11.520]   You can get it on.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:14.280]   But Google TV, which is an Android build, but not--
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.560]   It is on Google TV?
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.080]   It is.
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:16.880]   It is.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:17.760]   It's kind of the old--
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.680]   The old interface.
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:19.160]   But yeah.
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:22.080]   There's something related in a very different way
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.760]   that happened today.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:24.440]   God help me out.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.880]   When I mentioned this name on the show,
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.880]   there are certain people who get all mad at me.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.320]   They don't want him.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.360]   But Glenn Beck is leaving Fox, basically.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.000]   Is he?
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.160]   Where's he going?
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:36.000]   He's going to join Dr. Laura in an unholy alliance
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.680]   to take over the world.
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.240]   He's going to still provide some programming.
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:41.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:43.600]   Stop smiling.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:44.120]   You were really--
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.000]   You have a face.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.280]   That was a face.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:46.640]   Go ahead.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:47.240]   Where's he going?
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.720]   Where's Glenn going?
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.640]   I think he's going to help.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:51.120]   I think he's going to do some programming for him.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:54.160]   But the thing is that where's he going to go?
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.520]   I have a reporter called me today about it.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:56.600]   And I said, there's no--
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.520]   He's going to go to the internet.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.360]   He's going to go direct.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.080]   And you've talked to Howard, I'm sure, about this.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.200]   Well, I'll reveal a secret.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.600]   No, I've never said this out loud before.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:04.560]   So I'll reveal it here.
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.760]   Is that when the negotiations were going on
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:12.080]   with Sirius for Stern, I was asked to make contacts for Stern.
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:13.560]   And I made them with Google.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.000]   I made an introduction to Schmidt.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.080]   And it didn't happen.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:18.040]   Stern stayed.
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:20.720]   He stayed a bit chicken or wise.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.680]   Maybe the world wasn't ready.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:23.240]   So he's staying on Sirius for now.
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.680]   Sirius offered a Howard half a billion dollars.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.280]   That's why I--
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:29.640]   Oh, I didn't blame the guy.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.760]   I wanted him to make--
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:33.120]   But it's going to take one big star to make the internet
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:33.840]   ready for stars.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.360]   I was hoping it was going to be Howard Stern.
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:37.880]   I feared now it could be Glenn Beck.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.240]   But you're going to see entire series
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.880]   start through these new distribution ways.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:45.120]   And you're going to see stars who operate with great control
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.440]   in this new way.
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:49.560]   And so unfortunately, it could be Glenn Beck could become
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:51.400]   a hero of the internet.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.640]   What is that for turn, your star?
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.720]   It could be Oprah.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:55.840]   I'll take Leo.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:56.280]   I'm over Glenn.
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.360]   I need to--
[00:59:58.360 --> 00:59:59.520]   I'm going to start crying.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:04.280]   Oh, I'm trying to get a raise here now.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.240]   Actually, we did give you a raise, by the way.
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:06.720]   You did.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.280]   Just so you know.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.040]   Worked.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.200]   It could be Haskell-Trapani there.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.840]   Oh, yes, Mr. LaPouart.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.680]   You're the best.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.960]   Obama's going to go to the--
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.680]   Speaking of Glenn Beck, going to go to Facebook headquarters
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.240]   to do a town hall with Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:28.760]   And immediately the questions from many on the right
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.360]   were, is the Republican candidates.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.640]   When does Sarah Palin get her town hall at Facebook?
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.320]   Don't you just-- wouldn't you pay to watch Sarah Palin
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.960]   Mark Zuckerberg and the lack of ability
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.000]   to understand each other?
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.240]   That would be a beautiful thing.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:42.760]   I paid for that.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.280]   I paid to watch that.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:47.040]   Fortunately, these are not pay-per-view events.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.080]   Thank goodness.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.000]   I paid for that.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.040]   You got times about so short that I paid for.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:51.840]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:56.160]   You know, Arthur Ochsoltzberger, talking about the pay wall
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.360]   at the New York Times, first of all,
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.560]   it said it didn't cost us $40 million.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.320]   He didn't give a number, but he said it wasn't--
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.720]   It wasn't that much.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.000]   It's not accurate.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.200]   It's vastly wrong.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:07.880]   OK, fine.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.960]   $20 million, whatever.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.720]   But what he did say is, in response to the complaints
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:17.800]   that it's pretty darn confusing, because in fact, we were
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.280]   talking with Corey Doctorow this morning on triangulation.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.800]   I didn't see it tune in to triangulation 10.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.040]   He's great.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.880]   But Corey said, you know, the problem with this pay wall,
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.200]   among other things, is it's too darn confusing.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.440]   How do you know how many times you've
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.200]   visited New York Times this month?
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.640]   And to make it even more confusing,
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:35.920]   some visits don't count against the quota.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:39.280]   Salzberger said, we don't agree it's too complex.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.160]   It's new.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.560]   Let it breathe for a little bit before you make judgment.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:44.280]   It's like red wine.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.120]   We don't have any numbers.
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.320]   I wish he'd said, you know, but he's not.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.280]   I wish he'd give numbers.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.680]   You know, and they complain at the times
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:55.160]   how the Wall Street Journal gives no numbers for anything.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.520]   And the assumptions about the Wall Street Journal's pay walls
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.760]   are all off, say, to people at the New York Times.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:04.080]   But the New York Times should be transparent about this.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.440]   And it's good for the industry.
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:09.280]   If they believe that pay works and is necessary for journalism,
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.760]   well, then they should do it.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.760]   The other thing, the other reason they should do it,
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.520]   is that if it would only work for the Times and not
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.400]   work for the Cleveland Plain Dealer,
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.720]   then the Times should be aware of that,
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:21.480]   because the numbers I've gone through with some executives,
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.960]   maybe it'll work at the Times.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.960]   And I'll pay for it at the Times.
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.200]   And I want the Times to succeed.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.040]   And, you know, that's all wonderful.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.600]   But just because it works for the Times
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.840]   does not mean it will work for anyone else.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.920]   The numbers are not going to stack up.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.120]   A little leak of the Android Marketplace 3.0,
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.080]   number of Android fan sites had it.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:45.480]   And among other things, look, here's an app, a music app.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:49.120]   It's the Android player with streaming.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.240]   - Streaming capability.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.280]   - Can it be true?
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.240]   How do I find out if it's streaming?
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.480]   - Go on a setting.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.520]   - This is Eileen's phone.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.040]   Okay, we're going to go to settings.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.640]   Google account.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.760]   Stream music via wifi.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.440]   So there's streaming in here.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.800]   But what's missing in here is, what are you connecting to?
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.800]   So the presumption is, this is going to connect
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.360]   to a Google streaming music service.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.000]   Yes.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:16.840]   - Looks that way.
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.080]   I didn't have any success setting it up though.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.480]   I mean, if you tap Google account,
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.320]   nothing was listed.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.720]   - There's nothing hooked up.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.560]   - Right, so that's just not hooked up yet.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.320]   But interesting for sure.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.160]   - Interesting.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.000]   I wonder who--
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.520]   - Is that just a shot across Amazon's bottom?
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.880]   - I wonder who would know anything about that.
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.440]   - I wonder who we could ask.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.920]   If there were anybody--
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.560]   - I could go out in the hallway and ask it.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.960]   (laughing)
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.920]   - What outgoing open source guy do we know at Google?
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.400]   - Yeah, former open source program manager,
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.400]   Krista Bonham.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.040]   Awkward, I won't ask.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:51.880]   I won't ask.
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.280]   But that's interesting, of course.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:56.440]   Amazon really with a preemptive strike.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.200]   Although, I have a theory on this.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.040]   A couple of weeks ago said Amazon Cloud,
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.400]   actually a week ago Tuesday.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.280]   Still waiting for iTunes, Apple.
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.360]   Obviously, he's been working on this.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.320]   They bought La La.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.800]   They built this big network center.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:12.360]   Google music, we've heard rumors about this.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.240]   Everybody wants to get into this business.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.920]   I have a theory though.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:19.880]   I think everybody was standing right on the edge
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:23.480]   saying of the cliff, looking at the other guy.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:24.320]   You gonna go?
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.160]   You gonna go?
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.360]   And they tricked Jeff Bezos into jumping
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.720]   because now all the lawsuits from Sony
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.880]   and everybody else hit Amazon first.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.520]   Let Amazon establish the legal precedent for doing this.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.760]   Record companies aren't happy.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.880]   - Canary into the coal mine.
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.960]   - Yeah, let's see if Amazon can get away with it.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.240]   - Yeah, I'm picturing the cliff actually.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.520]   - One, two, three, psych.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.840]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.000]   Okay, well,
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.160]   maybe that was that meeting with Steven and Eric
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.520]   at that cafe, the last year.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.360]   Maybe that's what they were talking about.
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.440]   - That was like a year ago.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:00.080]   - I know, well, it takes a while.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.360]   - Let's make Jeff jump.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:07.000]   Okay, okay, you say one, two, three, and I'll go,
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.560]   and then we'll stop.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:11.400]   - And I hear this mad psychotic laugh
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.880]   fading off of the distance.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.240]   - You know, yes, the crazy Jeff Bezos laugh.
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.080]   - No.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.760]   - But Jeff might have been right.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.040]   Bezos might have been right.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:23.200]   Maybe by first move or advantage by getting this in there
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.800]   and a lot of legal experts say,
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.080]   "No, he'll be able to survive a legal challenge to this."
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.640]   Certainly Amazon thinks it's gonna be.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:34.280]   However, there we go.
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.120]   - Well, you're wonder too,
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.880]   whether Amazon is in a better position to survive
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:41.080]   but also because everyone is going to depend upon Amazon
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.840]   as the primary retail channel of the world.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.760]   - Right.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.120]   But far, I'd say Sony and everybody else
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.480]   would far prefer Amazon to Apple.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:49.320]   - Right.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.080]   - And I'm sure they don't have any faith
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:54.240]   that Google could create a successful marketplace.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.280]   They've really not shown that they can do this.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.440]   In fact, I think Google's smart.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.800]   I think Google encouraging Amazon to do an app store.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.920]   - Yeah.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:03.640]   - And to do vetting and all that, that's good for Google.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.400]   We've talked about that before.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.800]   All right, let's say we gotta wrap this up
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.320]   'cause it's time for TNT.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:13.560]   Gina Trapani, your tool of the week.
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.560]   - Like, typically we--
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.720]   - Tip of the week.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.680]   - Actually, yeah, this was kind of a big product launch
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.600]   this week and I have to confess,
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.560]   I have not turned it on
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.640]   'cause I'm kind of funny about this location thing.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:24.840]   But Google latitude added a feature.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:28.120]   If you enable it in the new Google Maps on Android,
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:31.080]   it basically tracks you where you go and where you've been
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.720]   and it gives you this private dashboard
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:35.800]   that shows you statistics about, you know,
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.200]   where you spend your time at work or at home.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.520]   And, you know, I haven't turned it on.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.720]   And actually Leo, I wanted to ask you
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.560]   if you had turned it on.
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.320]   - Yeah, 'cause I invited you and Jeff
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.920]   and you both ignored my invites.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.000]   - I did, I did.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.600]   Because I'm a little funny about the location stuff.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.000]   I use four square, but I only check in where I want to.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.400]   With latitude, this is sort of like
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.680]   in the background tracking wherever you go.
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.320]   You know, I use this software called Rescue Time
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.400]   which basically does the same kind of on my computer.
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:01.480]   It watches all the different apps that I use.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.720]   But there's something about tracking my location.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:04.560]   Oh yeah, that was my,
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.840]   so Leo's got up on the screen right now.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.920]   - Wrong tip. - This is my backup.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.240]   Yeah, it was, this is my backup tip.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.040]   But let's talk about the latitude.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.320]   - This is brand new.
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.120]   See your location history dashboard.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.480]   If you've enabled location history for latitude.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.000]   So I do use latitude.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.200]   It can see where I am and where my friends are.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.840]   I did, when I turned this on,
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.640]   I went through and pruned everybody out,
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.080]   who wasn't actually a friend.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.960]   Because I'm letting people see my actual location.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.600]   But I actually kind of like this
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.400]   'cause it checks in automatically.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.560]   It shows where my friends are on the map.
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.680]   I don't really mind.
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.240]   I kind of like it.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.280]   - So I guess if you haven't enabled for a couple of weeks,
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.120]   you get that dashboard with these charts about like,
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.960]   you spend this many hours a week at work
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.280]   and this many hours a week at home.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.040]   Which is this kind of nice like personal data dashboard.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.200]   - It's been available on the web for some time.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.320]   And it's very creepy.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.200]   - Is it creepy?
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.560]   See this is why I didn't enable it.
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:57.720]   'Cause I'm not sure.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.480]   Even though it's totally private,
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.240]   all the stats are aggregated and private,
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.560]   not for anyone else.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.760]   It kind of gives you an interesting look at,
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.000]   where you've been and what you're doing.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:06.840]   - Let me show you.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.120]   'Cause I have been using it.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.640]   I've had it enabled for several years.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.480]   - Wow.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.240]   - And so it says, it gives you like pie charts
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.400]   of how much time you spend at work,
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.840]   how much time you spend at different places.
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:20.520]   It shows you the places you've been to the most.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.360]   It's actually-- - Did it do?
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:22.960]   - It's actually used in divorces.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.280]   - Oh, well because it's, you know,
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:26.560]   you have to log into my account.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.400]   - Right. - Right.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.040]   - So it's kind of my material.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.560]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.160]   - We can do any insights about your whereabouts, Liam?
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.920]   - Yeah, I spend too much time at work.
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:35.760]   - Yeah.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:36.600]   - Yeah.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.680]   - That doesn't surprise me.
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.600]   - Mostly, that's what it was.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.720]   So this is the Google dashboard.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:40.800]   Everybody should know about this anyway.
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:41.640]   Google.co.com.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.000]   - Yeah, the privacy dashboard is the really important.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:43.840]   - Yeah, this is great.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.320]   So here's latitude.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:50.320]   So if I click location history, I have traveled.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.680]   What is that?
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:53.120]   Well, how many meters is that?
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.960]   I've traveled 19 million kilometers.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:56.960]   (laughing)
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.600]   19 million kilometers.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.640]   No, no, I'm sorry, 19 million meters.
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.640]   That's what is it, 190,000 kilometers?
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.800]   I don't know what it is.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.960]   So I've got it enabled and I can view my check-ins.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.920]   Where do I see my history?
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:13.480]   It's really kind of cool because you,
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:17.160]   yeah, see, I spend my time at work is green.
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.680]   My time spent out is blue.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.600]   My time at home.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.560]   So 50% of my time at home.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.720]   There, you see, this is the gym.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.800]   I spend a lot of time at the gym.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.280]   - Yeah, good for sure. - Oh, yeah.
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:27.960]   - 29 hours last week at work.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.360]   - You hacked that I know, Liam.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.880]   - I know that's, that's key.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.880]   - This is kind of embarrassing.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.120]   - Like the firebug, let's edit it.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.160]   - 'Cause I say how much, you know, oh, I work so hard.
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:38.320]   I only spent 29 hours at work last week.
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:41.440]   15 hours at work on average.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.520]   I suck.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.800]   I say, so there's a lot of insight in here.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.680]   15 hours a week, I spent out.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.440]   23 hours a week on average.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.400]   I spent a lot of time at home.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.840]   Here's the graph.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.880]   Countries visited airplane trips.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.000]   - I mean, this is pretty cool.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.800]   - It's super cool.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:01.640]   - Yeah.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.480]   - You know?
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.320]   - Except when you're getting divorced
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.760]   and your wife logs into your account.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.720]   But otherwise, it's really cool.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.640]   Just kidding, just kidding.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.360]   - Looks like it's been a lot of time in Jeannie's house.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.200]   I don't know.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.040]   (laughing)
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.440]   It's all there and it's automatic
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:16.200]   and it's on your phone and everywhere you go.
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.960]   And I, you know, so it's nice that you can see that
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.600]   in your phone, but that, but actually that dashboard's
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:21.720]   been around a while and.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:22.560]   - The old few run away too.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.920]   - I just really fly too much.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.040]   That's, whenever I look at those.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:25.880]   - That's what you see, yeah.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.280]   - What was I doing in Joe Hot?
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.960]   - Yeah, I like traveling so much.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.160]   - You know, if you were going to Tiffany's
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.120]   to buy your wife a present,
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.080]   you didn't want her to see that.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.960]   How hard is it to turn off temporarily?
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.360]   - Well, no one sees it unless they log in your account,
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.200]   right?
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.040]   It's not public at all.
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:45.200]   - You have to turn off location services
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.400]   on your phone, I guess.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.200]   You know, they're not really clear about that.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.240]   (laughing)
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.800]   - No, I see this is actually where I disagree with you.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.520]   Where, I think it would be creepy
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.720]   if we didn't show this information
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.920]   to you personally, not anybody else.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.320]   But it's like, you know, when you have these services,
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.800]   you know, they are keeping that information.
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.400]   And people don't read the term.
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:06.240]   - That's true, everybody knows.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.520]   You know what, that's a very good point.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.840]   Everybody knows this too.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.560]   It's just that they're showing Google saying,
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.160]   look, we do know this.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:16.240]   I've traveled 12,218 miles
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.720]   and I will reach the moon in 213,000,
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.400]   four to three more miles.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.200]   So this is like a graph of my way.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.040]   I like that.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.560]   That's how close to the moon I've gotten.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.400]   - Yeah, that's really neat.
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:26.800]   - I don't go anywhere, dude.
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:30.000]   - No, this must be, I mean, I must not have,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.440]   - Maybe just turn it on or--
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.440]   - I must have just turned it on
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.240]   'cause you're right, I've traveled a lot more than that.
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.400]   - Yeah, I've traveled a lot more than that.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.640]   So it mustn't have been on.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.600]   History range, oh, wait a minute.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:45.360]   That's only, yeah, see, I think she can enable the range.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.680]   Look at this, this is my map of travels in the last two days.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:54.840]   So that's how often, this is how often it checks in.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:55.720]   - Yeah, look at this, I mean--
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:59.000]   - Leo, I just put on the page at the very bottom
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.320]   and there also a German politician, of course.
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.800]   - Of course, suing.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.360]   - sued a phone company there to get all of their green,
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:09.760]   to get all of their data on everything they had for him
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.360]   in their phone system, right?
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.200]   - Yeah.
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.960]   - And so then, Dzite came along, my friend,
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:18.840]   Wolfgang Blau, and they visualized all the data.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:22.680]   And it's, it's actually, I mean, this gets creepier
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.240]   because the phone company has much more data on you, right?
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.280]   In terms of where you go, in their system,
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.760]   and it's all subpoena, bowl, and all that.
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.040]   - Right, that's right.
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.240]   - It's not even, you know what, this is the sad thing.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.240]   And I think I've mentioned this a couple of times.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.040]   It's not even a subpoena that they need.
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.680]   It's what's called a pen register,
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.600]   which doesn't even need a court order.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:46.400]   All the cell phone companies have portals
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.680]   that any law enforcement official can go to
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:50.960]   and just say, where was Jeff last night?
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.400]   And you can even set a standing pen register
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.280]   that they send tracking information all the time.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:58.000]   And the reason this is, is because the courts,
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.160]   at this point, say that, you know,
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.840]   search and seizure without content doesn't need to,
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:09.840]   is, you know, has a lower level of standard of proof.
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:14.280]   And that means to and from on email messages,
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:17.480]   not subjects, not contents, and GPS locations
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.600]   are considered to be non-content.
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:21.960]   So you're absolutely right, Chris.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.960]   This is information that every cell phone carrier
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:28.080]   knows about you and will gladly for a small fee share
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:31.720]   with any law enforcement agency, any government agency.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.200]   So, - Chris may have just convinced me
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.040]   to turn it on.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.400]   I might as well see what they can see, right?
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:36.240]   - Yeah, I like it.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.040]   - So don't show your wife, that's all.
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.240]   - That's a cool for things that they should be legitimately
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:43.320]   concerned about with their governments, you know?
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.520]   It's like, you know, we just try to be upfront about it.
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:46.520]   We say, here's our privacy.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:47.360]   - It's pretty amazing.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.600]   - It's all our privacy dashboard.
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.120]   Here's the deliberation.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.440]   You know, if you're not comfortable with this,
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.560]   don't use that tool, don't go to that site.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:59.400]   And you know, it can be really, you know,
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.360]   people get put onto Google that,
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.880]   which is really the province of their government.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.520]   - I do think that this would be incredibly useful
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:07.680]   20 years from now.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:11.400]   You know, if I've kept this for a long period of time,
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.800]   I do wish there were more data in here, actually.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.360]   I think it's fascinating.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.640]   And I think this reminds me that I can't,
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.080]   I'm looking for it now, but if you go to Chrome,
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:25.080]   and put it in Cognito, it warns you that it says,
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.640]   "Okay, this is what you can do,
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:28.600]   but it warns you in there.
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:29.760]   I can't find it right now."
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.000]   That, well, be also be aware though,
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.440]   even if you turn on a Cognito,
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:36.400]   that someone can be looking over your shoulder or secret,
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.960]   I swear it says, "The secret agents could be watching."
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.040]   (laughing)
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.480]   It says, "Surveillance by secret agents.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.680]   Malicious software that tracks your keystrokes
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.880]   in exchange for free smileys.
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.720]   Internet service providers are employers
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.400]   that track the pages you visit.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.720]   Websites that collect and share information about you.
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.280]   People standing behind you.
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:58.240]   - People standing behind you actually is irrelevant
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.840]   and important to tell people about it.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:00.920]   - Well, I mean, you know, 'cause the thing is,
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.120]   sometimes we get people who are like,
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:04.760]   "I am afraid that this government is following me
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:07.720]   and they probably have compromised Google."
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.840]   And I'm like, "You know, if a secret agency
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.000]   is really following you, you should look outside
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:12.840]   your front door.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.440]   You shouldn't leave your house and have them walk in
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.960]   and install something on your machine."
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.440]   I mean, these people are--
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.000]   - Stop using 4-square.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.880]   - And I even mentioned this.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:21.720]   - Stop using 4-square.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:22.920]   - If you're worried about Google,
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:23.760]   don't worry about Google.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.080]   Don't worry about your internet service provider.
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.600]   They actually even know more about you,
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.640]   your cell phone company and your internet service provider
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:29.480]   together and do more about it.
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:30.560]   - I think it's okay to worry about Google
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.120]   and your big company and we do a lot
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:34.040]   and people do search through us and that's really important.
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:38.080]   But, you know, don't just stop there
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.400]   if you're actually worried about these problems.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.400]   You know? - Good for them.
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.240]   - Yep.
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:45.360]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.600]   - Ah, it might have been trivial,
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:49.960]   but after the last week I did Lady Gaga's followers
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:50.800]   on Facebook.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:55.400]   This week I was struck that Argentine footballer Leo Messi
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.840]   in seven hours got seven million likes in Facebook.
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.400]   - Holy. - Holy.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.400]   - And what struck me about that,
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:05.560]   I think I keep forgetting how much smaller Twitter is
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.840]   than Facebook still.
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:11.200]   You know, Facebook has 10 times the photos that Flickr has
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:14.760]   and Flickr has five billion of them.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.760]   You know, the size of Facebook just,
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.480]   I kind of forget once in a while,
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:22.880]   but seven hours for seven million likes
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.560]   is one hell of a commentary on the power of Facebook, I think.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:29.600]   - I actually gave you a number.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.680]   - Oh, you did, I didn't see it.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.960]   - Well, that's okay 'cause I'm gonna steal it.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:33.800]   - Okay.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.480]   - I have a number for you guys if you want one.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:36.320]   - Good.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:37.400]   - Okay.
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.800]   - I'll do a number then you do a number, Chris,
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.880]   and then I'll do my tool of the week.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.280]   But the numbers, I got an email from StumbleUpon.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:48.280]   They hit one billion, one billion with a B monthly stumbles
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:54.480]   in the month of January, the first time
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.120]   they've ever reached a billion, that's this.
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:59.360]   If you thought StumbleUpon was no longer,
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.200]   you know, relevant in Jermaine, they've gone up,
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.240]   since this is July 2010 here, look at this deep jump.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.320]   - Wow. - Yeah.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.160]   - Good for them.
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.040]   - Somebody, the reason I noted that is,
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.560]   I was talking to some social media expert or somebody,
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.480]   maybe somebody would email me, he said,
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:14.680]   you know, really ought to get your pages on StumbleUpon.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:17.360]   It's an amazing traffic tool.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.800]   Doi.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.280]   - Your number, Chris Tobona.
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.680]   - Actually, I'm gonna let you down.
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:27.040]   I was gonna find the Lady Gaga questions
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.360]   on the question and answer service we have
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.080]   for once you visited.
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.400]   And I just remember being like 100 times with Elmo
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.440]   got when we did the public Elmo.
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.040]   - Gaga got more than Elmo.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.400]   That's all I need to know.
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.200]   (laughs)
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:41.520]   - I was a moderator, Chris.
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.960]   - I thought I'd find it before you shut down.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:43.800]   What's that?
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.520]   - That was on Google moderator?
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.880]   - Yeah.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:49.520]   - I'm gonna show you the, I really,
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.920]   this is kind of a long standing tool tip,
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.280]   we've mentioned it before, but if you haven't yet
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:58.240]   installed the Amazon App Store on your Android phone,
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.600]   do because as we've mentioned before,
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.920]   every day, a free app.
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:06.200]   And today the free app is one that I particularly like
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.960]   called Pixay Pro.
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:11.040]   There have been a kind of a dearth of great camera apps
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:14.680]   on the Android platform, but this is one of them.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:17.040]   It lets you put captions, modify photos.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.400]   It's really a lot of fun.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:21.680]   And it's normally, I think it's normally a couple of bucks.
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:22.880]   Yeah, four bucks.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:25.920]   It's free today on the Amazon App Store.
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.320]   And every day there's a new free app
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.320]   and some of them are pretty good.
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:33.520]   So if you don't yet have Pixay Pro,
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.360]   here's your chance to get it free.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.720]   This is one I've actually paid for some moons ago
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.320]   here, I can launch it here.
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.160]   There's a little--
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:42.000]   Can you pick please?
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:42.840]   I see you remember you.
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:43.680]   I like pick please.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.480]   That's a posting service, which would go great with Pixay Pro,
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:49.240]   because what you do is you take a picture
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:51.800]   and you do something on it, you capture it.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.680]   I'll pull up a picture here.
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:58.440]   This is my dog.
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:02.200]   And I can take it, I'll do the maximum size.
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.800]   And then I can put a caption on it.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:07.440]   I can do all sorts of special effects and so forth.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:11.000]   This is actually an amazingly deep program.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.640]   It's just not, you think Pixay Pro,
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:13.960]   well it's all about captioning,
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.840]   but all of these, these are filters.
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:18.400]   I mean, this is actually one of the most sophisticated apps
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.280]   I've seen for cameras, stickers.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.040]   I can put masks and glasses on my doggy.
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.040]   And word balloons.
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.360]   And word balloons.
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.840]   All kinds of criminal things to do to images.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.280]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:33.920]   Pixay Pro free right now on the Amazon App Store.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:37.840]   Gina Tripani is free free free at smarterwear.org.
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:40.400]   Her great blog, you must read it.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.680]   Great to be here, great show.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:42.960]   Always great to talk with Chris.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.280]   Thanks for being on today.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.680]   We're gonna make sure you come to New York late in May
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.200]   for these special Chipotle men.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.600]   Yeah, well, we're gonna talk.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.920]   I think I'm sold.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.920]   (laughing)
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.320]   At Blog World, who cares, but Chipotle?
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.680]   Yeah, no, that's what's, yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:00.520]   Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com, what would Google do?
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.880]   And soon, I can't wait, public parts will be in bookstores.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:06.400]   Thank you for being here, Jeff as always.
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:10.240]   And the great Krista Bona, long time friend,
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.160]   and the man in charge of open source projects at Google,
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.880]   code.google.com/soc to learn about the summer of code.
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:22.880]   Yeah, and he's on Twitter @CDIBONA.
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:26.080]   That's right.
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.440]   What do you tweet?
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:29.080]   I tweet things.
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:30.440]   (laughing)
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.280]   Is that your motto?
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.120]   I tweet things?
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.240]   Quips.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.080]   Quips.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:34.920]   Pons.
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.960]   Pictures of animals, that kind of thing.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.640]   No, actually, I don't tweet that much,
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.840]   so it doesn't cost a lot to be my friend on Twitter.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.680]   See, that's the new, by the way, that's the new black.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:44.520]   I never tweet.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.040]   Oh, you like follow me.
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:46.880]   Low cost.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.160]   I'm a low cost Twitter friend.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.440]   I'm a low cost person to follow.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.240]   I never say anything.
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.960]   I tweet like once a day at Monostino.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.720]   I'm kind of like that too.
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:55.560]   That's a good rate.
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:58.120]   Yeah, C.Dibona on the Twitter.
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.240]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.160]   We'll see you next time.
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:03.600]   We do the show every Wednesday
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.320]   at 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time at live.tv.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.760]   Next week, we'll be in Vegas
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:11.200]   for the National Association of Broadcasters.
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.920]   So Tom Merritt will be in filling in for me next week,
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.280]   I'm sorry to say.
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.120]   'Cause I'm--
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.120]   Broadcasters, Leo Broadcasters,
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:17.960]   what are you doing hanging out with?
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.560]   I know, you know, there's a certain irony.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.920]   I have to say to going to the NAB show,
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:25.600]   we are the official podcast partner
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:28.200]   of the National Association of Broadcasters.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.960]   I couldn't say no, I thought, that's so funny.
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.280]   I'm definitely doing it.
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:35.760]   You know what, there's a lot of cool gear there.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.480]   And believe it or not, a lot of gear
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:40.120]   that new media people will find very interesting.
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:41.600]   So we thought it'd be kind of fun.
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.040]   That's like being the official blogger
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.360]   of the calligraphy association.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:45.200]   I know.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.000]   (laughing)
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.960]   I'm using that, do you mind if I steal that?
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.000]   Well, please, please do.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.400]   Well, I'm also gonna be on a panel on Wednesday,
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:57.400]   the broadcast mind panel with Adam Corolla,
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.840]   and who's from the NBA?
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.320]   I gotta see if I can find this.
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:02.880]   It's a really cool panel.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:05.960]   Talking about using new media,
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.040]   New Tech is sponsoring this,
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.000]   the folks that do our Tri-Caster,
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.800]   the broadcast minds panel
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:15.880]   from the NBA, St. John's University, Adam Corolla,
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.960]   and I will all be on that panel to talk.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.440]   Steve Helmas, that's who it is from NBA Entertainment,
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.600]   and Mark Fredo from St. John's University.
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:23.440]   So that's gonna be fun.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.520]   We'll broadcast that live next,
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:28.320]   I think it'll be a week from today in the evening.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:31.680]   Thanks everybody, we'll see you next time on Twig.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:34.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:36.840]   (upbeat music)
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:39.420]   (upbeat music)
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.000]   (upbeat music)
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.580]   (upbeat music)
