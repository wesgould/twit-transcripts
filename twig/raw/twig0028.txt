[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.920]   and from her head in the clouds to us.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.520]   Her feet on the ground, her head in the clouds.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.800]   Gina Trapani of smarterwear.org and lifehacker.com.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.800]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.640]   Hi, good afternoon.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.320]   Great to have you.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.240]   In San Diego today, yes?
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.000]   Yes, I am cloudy San Diego.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.960]   Oh, oh, it's only 74 degrees.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.880]   We get rain to ones in a while.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.520]   No, it's kind of cloudy and rainy here.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.640]   Meanwhile, Jeff Jarvis is just dying in New York.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.400]   Is this snowing in New York right now?
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.360]   No, it's stopped now.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.400]   I should have brought a snowball into a throw at you.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.000]   That would be fun.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.600]   I love it when it snows in Manhattan.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.880]   Snarls, the taxis, it's great.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.680]   People bring out guns.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.040]   Also joining us today, I'm really pleased to have him
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.080]   from Mashable.com.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.480]   Pete Cashmore and Pending, Pete, you're in town, aren't you?
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.480]   No, I'm back in Scotland now.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.800]   Oh, you went home already?
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.640]   You got snow?
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.640]   I got snow.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.840]   I couldn't beat Gina on the weather complaints.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.520]   Yeah, we've got snow still lying.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.240]   You had a big Mashable event.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.320]   What would you just yesterday?
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.320]   Wasn't I?
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.240]   How'd you get back to Scotland so fast?
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.720]   I didn't make the Mashable event.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.320]   I was in--
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.200]   I was actually in the States last week
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.920]   I was in for the Grammys and to stop in LA.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.920]   And then I was scheduled to come back here.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.840]   I should have stayed on.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.680]   What do we know?
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.840]   It was your party, man.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.760]   Work out.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.480]   I know.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.960]   I know.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.440]   We've got another one coming up at South by Southwest.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.400]   Pete is one of the few web 2.0 entrepreneurs
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.440]   who's in Scotland.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.440]   Is that incorrect to say?
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.400]   Is that a very chauvinistic, stupid American thing to say?
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.960]   I can't think of any others.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.240]   I guess not.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.680]   I'm Scott.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.360]   My mom's maiden name is Dunlap.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.400]   So I have a tartan somewhere.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.160]   Fantastic.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.440]   Like, see you in a kill then.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.440]   Yeah, we got one of these for it.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.520]   Yeah, I do.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.720]   I've got fine manly calves.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.120]   Do you have the full dress tartan?
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.600]   I don't.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.440]   People tend to rent them.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.920]   They're actually quite expensive.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.440]   Don't wear them that often.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.240]   Always wanted to have one of those.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.480]   I think we want a Twit tartans.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.360]   Twit tartans.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.160]   We need a--
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.120]   Yes, it's swag.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.760]   We need to make a Twit plaid.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.560]   McTwit, I think it would have to be.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.400]   So the big story-- I think the big story of the week,
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.200]   but I'll let you guys weigh in on this.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.040]   But the big story for those of us who use Nexus One phones
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.720]   is Google.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.600]   And I think there's a larger story underneath this.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.200]   Google finally shiverships multi-touch in an update
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.720]   for Google Android 2.1.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.440]   It's 2.1 update one, right, Gina?
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.840]   Yeah, it's not 2.2.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.720]   It's 2.1 update one, which is kind of strange.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.920]   So I'm curious.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.880]   I thought that there was a whole patent issue with this,
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.520]   with multi-touch.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.440]   Well, therein lies, I think, the larger tale, right, Jeff?
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.800]   Yeah, I think that there is pissiness occurring
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.960]   in all quarters now.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.460]   Yes.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.440]   Because the report had been-- Leo mentioned it was that Apple
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.160]   asked Google nicely to pull back.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.120]   Apple started snarking at Google about evil and things.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.000]   And Google says, nah, nah, back to you.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.320]   Meanwhile, Microsoft has started running out of the bus.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.400]   It's turned nasty out there.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.840]   Oh, I love it.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.440]   For journalists, there's nothing better.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.320]   You're really great.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.400]   This wasn't my dolphin browser had multi-touch already
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.840]   before I got the update.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.360]   Yes.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.520]   Well, in a way, that's what fooled me,
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.640]   because I put 2.1 on it.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.760]   And I'd been using dolphin as you had Jeff, and I love it.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.480]   And then the Google's own multi-touch
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.480]   wasn't as universal, like mobile sites aren't squeezable.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.360]   There it goes.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.760]   You've just made it disappear.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.160]   Is that the maps you're zooming in on?
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.400]   There's actually a new maps application just came out, too.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.840]   I think it's 3.4 that adds some interesting layers.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.160]   It adds a search layer, which is kind of intriguing.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.640]   But I'm going to talk about that later,
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.920]   because that'll be my tool of the week.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.720]   And I'm going to show you the weird search that I got.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.040]   You lost people.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.240]   Have you used this search yet?
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.040]   Because I'm curious if it's just me.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.840]   If they're saying something about me.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.760]   I honestly haven't played around with it very much.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.560]   I heard that there's a night mode.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.960]   Is that GPS mode only?
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.760]   Or I'm looking at maps right now.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.120]   I don't know.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.440]   I love the traffic on maps.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.120]   Oh, I do, too.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.360]   And the layers are fantastic.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.920]   But save it, because there's a surprise.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.400]   OK.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.920]   OK.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.680]   There's a chewy candy center on my maps application.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.080]   I've got to say, by the way, that the--
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.400]   I used my Nexus 1 the whole time I was in Europe.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.080]   Yes, I got an email on that, by the way.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.400]   I'll talk to you in a second about that.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.920]   Go ahead.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.720]   I used my Swiss Sim and it worked very well.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.560]   Then I got home.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.240]   So I'm adjusting very well.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.280]   When I got home, getting the update over the cell wire,
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.800]   rather than having to go through iTunes,
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.800]   was kind of wonderful.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.560]   It just appears.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.160]   Big brotherish.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.640]   But boom, there you got it.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.680]   Restart, you're done.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.480]   It was very nice.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.040]   No, I think that this is a nice updated--
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.600]   it enables multi-touch in maps.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.480]   It enables multi-touch in gallery.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.400]   And as far as I can tell, it's every bit
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.720]   as smooth and easy and fast and intuitive as it is on the iPhone.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.720]   Yes?
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.680]   Yeah, it matters so much, because before it was driving me nuts,
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.760]   not having it.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.080]   It was the big miss-- well, to me, there's two missing elements.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.120]   And two others are maybe applications that they need.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.800]   But the fact that it doesn't do audible books still kills me.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.080]   And I hope it will sometime soon.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.480]   And the lack of multi-touch.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.840]   That really made it hard for me to say to Apple people,
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.760]   no, this is a better phone.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.920]   And I'm waiting for things like New York Times apps
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.800]   and Guardian apps and stuff like that.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.840]   I read isn't there.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.360]   But there are good news apps.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.160]   We mentioned that Thompson News app.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.200]   That's an extension.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.560]   Yes.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.520]   Does a nice job.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.600]   I like the widgets, which you don't get an iPhone that
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.240]   allow us to--
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.160]   I have on my screen.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.520]   I have-- I actually have a whole news page.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.160]   The last page on my phone is dedicated to news.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.840]   And I have three different news feeder widgets.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.160]   One is the Thompson Reuters.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.040]   One is a little RSS widget.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.240]   And one is, I don't know, slash dot or something.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.400]   And so it's really nice to be able to put those there
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.920]   and be able to just go to that page
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.760]   and get a quick scoop on what's going on and pick stories.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.240]   But you're right, it would be nice to have
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.600]   New York Times on there.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.080]   Now, the two things that don't have multi-touch
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.200]   are the built-in browser and the keyboard.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.720]   Right?
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.480]   The built-in browser has multi-touch.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.040]   Oh, it does have multi-touch now.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.440]   Because I was using Dolphin.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.920]   I was deceived.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.160]   Because Dolphin does it everywhere.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.120]   And the built-in browser doesn't do it on Google's home page.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.880]   It doesn't do it on mobile pages.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.160]   So a lot of the pages I saw, I was going, it won't do it.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.880]   But it does do it.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.080]   I kept going to pages.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.880]   I tweeted that.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.400]   And somebody said, no, no, it does.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.200]   You just got to go to these other pages.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:50.720]   Oh, OK.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.240]   OK.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.320]   And now, what about the keyboard?
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.440]   I heard a couple of people saying that iPhone has multi-touch
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:54.840]   keyboard.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.480]   But how does-- it's been so long since I've used an iPhone.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.160]   How does multi-touch work on the keyboard?
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.360]   What can you do that you can't do on--
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.960]   Push two keys at once, I guess?
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.840]   I mean, what situation?
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.520]   I mean, shift or key combinations.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.600]   I like you can do keyboard.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.400]   I think.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.000]   There is some combination.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.320]   You're right.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.520]   I forget what it is.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.680]   It was also true on the Nexus 1 before.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.160]   There was a keyboard case of multi-touch.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.160]   In fact, that's how somebody proved to me
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.560]   that multi-touch was enabled.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.080]   Right.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.680]   In any event, supposedly, this also enables it.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.200]   But again, yeah, if you don't use it.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.600]   Have you noticed any other shifts in them with 2.1,
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.640]   update 1, anything else that's new?
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.640]   Nothing else is--
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.160]   Is this the Nexus 1?
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.160]   Huh?
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.440]   Is this only for Nexus 1?
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.360]   Yeah, because no one else is using 2.1 yet.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.880]   And in fact, this is, I think, a big problem
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.080]   with Android in general is that it's
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.240]   as if Microsoft released Windows 7,
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.880]   but was still selling Windows 98 on.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.440]   There are people still using 1.5.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:55.940]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:56.880]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.120]   I mean, at what point do they upgrade?
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.160]   And what are the barriers?
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.720]   I don't know.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.160]   I've been hearing a lot of people
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.920]   saying who have the other phone saying.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.360]   The other phone saying, like, this is ridiculous.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.520]   What are we going to get to 1?
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.640]   You guys are getting an update.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.000]   We haven't even gotten to 1.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.960]   I'm not sure what the hold up is on that.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.720]   Peter, are we leaving you out because you're using an iPhone?
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.440]   We're leaving me out right now because my Mac just crashed.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.240]   And I just go back on.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.840]   So I miss part of that combo.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.560]   Well, all we've talked about really so far is Nexus 1,
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.960]   which is kind of pathetic.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.320]   I love the-- you know, I'm thinking of getting one.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.040]   My iPhone contract runs out next month.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.880]   So I'll be it by Southwest, deciding which phone to get.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.120]   We've even convinced Jeff, who was very skeptical.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.280]   What's your take on the internationalization?
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.480]   Because I traveled so much.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.040]   Let me read you something, Jeff.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.480]   Because when Jeff, you went to first before Davos,
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.920]   you were in Germany.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.480]   Munich, yeah.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.120]   And you had trouble, I think.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.760]   I had trouble.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.600]   I had a UK Sim from Orange.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.400]   And I could not get data going on it at all.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.440]   And I found out why, by the way.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:00.880]   Oh, good.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.080]   OK.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.280]   I read it at Swiss Sim, and I got full data.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.440]   One little trick is if you switch Sims every time you do,
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.560]   it wants you to re-authenticate your Google account.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.800]   But it doesn't really make that clear.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.120]   So things wouldn't work.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.560]   And if you think someone doesn't work,
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.400]   you can't get emails, not nothing's doing.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.560]   You go to the alerts, and you'll see that it's telling you,
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.360]   no, no, I don't know who you are again.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.480]   I got an email from Sean in Australia who says,
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.760]   as far as frequencies go, it does support
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.800]   all of the operating frequencies in Europe,
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.560]   which is HSDPA 900, 1700, 2100.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:42.920]   So the only difference is the iPhone 3GS is 850, not 900.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.000]   And 850 is for AT&T.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.440]   T-Mobile is 1,72100.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.320]   Most European carriers are 2,100.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.280]   Apparently, there are a few 900.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.720]   Australia, New Zealand is 2,100, 980, 50, depending on--
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.040]   I think the problem in this case
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.640]   was that Orange must not support data for it.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.240]   Nope.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.440]   I have a-- He explains this.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.560]   He explains this.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.760]   Jeff's issues in Germany must have been either account level
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.800]   issues with data not being activated--
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.760]   in other words, you didn't have a data account--
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.040]   or you hadn't turned on data roaming,
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.080]   because that's off by default.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.880]   I did that too.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.240]   OK.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.240]   Or I had data on my own phone.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.480]   Or roaming.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.600]   And I've seen this before.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.880]   There's one more thing.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.880]   There are APN settings.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.080]   You have to that are specific to the carrier.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.880]   And he said, it's possible that the SIM card you put in
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.760]   didn't automatically populate the APN settings.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.320]   So you'd have to go deep into your settings menu
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.920]   and change the server name that you're getting data from.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.280]   In other words, it probably was still T-Mobile.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.160]   And you needed to change it to Orange.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.880]   God help you try to call Orange and get that sort of thing.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.680]   You can-- when I unlock my G1 and put in my AT&T SIM
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.800]   for my iPhone, I had to do a similar thing.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.240]   It was really just a Google search away.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.360]   Just say, whatever Orange on.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.880]   And you'll get the-- you can search for APN.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.840]   Where is that information?
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.400]   Storage in.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.160]   Is it just in the hardware set?
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.240]   I mean, is there--
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.040]   It's in the software.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.640]   It's in the settings, in the Android settings.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.600]   So it sounds like, Pete, that this would be a phone
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.680]   that's compatible.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.920]   Who's your carrier in Scotland?
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.360]   Is it O2?
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:14.840]   Orange.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.160]   That's Orange.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.480]   So it sounds like it would work fine.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.600]   Who's the vendor that's coming-- the Nexus 1
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.200]   is coming to a vendor in the UK?
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.120]   Down at Pacific.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.480]   I know it's Vodafone.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.800]   Is it-- yeah.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.560]   I don't know if Orange or--
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.720]   Is O2 Orange is at the same--
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.040]   It's on their page.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.920]   OK.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.680]   What says--
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.480]   Vodafone, it sounds like.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.800]   It's just Vodafone, a Scottish carrier?
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.560]   It's British.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:47.920]   British.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.760]   So I know Vodafone was the first--
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.600]   Vodafone.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.480]   Spring 2010.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.200]   OK.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.440]   And Verizon, supposedly March.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.320]   Well, at Davos, Schmidt said it'll
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.960]   be on all four major US carriers by--
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.920]   I think he said March.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.360]   So here's the deal.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.120]   According to an analyst anyway, only 80,000
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.960]   of these phones have been sold.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.840]   Is that your number?
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.120]   I hope that's not your number, Jeff.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.760]   No, it's not.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.960]   I have to stay away from numbers.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.680]   No, not against.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.200]   Not fun.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.480]   Crazy.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.880]   80,000 is very-- I mean, in this time period with the iPhone,
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.600]   I think it was several hundred thousand.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.480]   Google's not a retailer, and it's not
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.680]   a retailer, but it's a very small number.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.720]   It's a very small number.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.520]   It's a very small number.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.080]   I haven't there.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.480]   Go ahead, sorry.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.480]   Well, they have.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.920]   If you flew Virgin America with a free Google Wi-Fi
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.960]   over the holidays, first page you get--
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.960]   Nexus One.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.200]   You go to google.com.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.000]   Nexus One.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.280]   I mean, they pushed it in every--
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:43.800]   YouTube as well.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.320]   YouTube.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.360]   Everyone there.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.440]   Here's get 41.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.920]   And this is another story, but I just noticed today,
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.440]   on YouTube, I'm going to be a little bit more famous.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.920]   I'm going to be a little bit more famous.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.640]   I'm not a story, but I just noticed today, on Google Apps,
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.520]   they've got a whole new dashboard and an offer of pro
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.200]   level on apps, which may be old, and I just saw it
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.160]   for the first time.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.280]   But anyway, it pushes mobile apps there.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.840]   You go to the link for iPhone, and it says,
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.520]   you might want to get really good use of Google Apps
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.320]   on an Android phone and the Nexus One.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.320]   So they're fine with it.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.640]   Well, I was going to say, Google isn't a retailer,
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.760]   but they want to be.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.200]   And I think we're going to see them push this kind of stuff.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.240]   Just with the store, selling the mobile phone,
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.680]   there's also talk of an app store for Google Apps,
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.480]   including Wave.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.840]   There's also talk about that.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:36.400]   I mean, they want to sell you stuff directly more.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.640]   But no, they're not quite a retailer yet.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.520]   The thing is that the Nexus One didn't get the marketing
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.880]   campaign that the Droid did for instance.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.440]   No weird commercials.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.080]   They want to be a retailer, but they
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.960]   don't want to lay over heads of being a retailer.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.560]   Like customer service and all those things at Google
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.560]   doesn't really affect it.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.440]   All of those inconvenient things.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.640]   Customers, we don't want to-- we don't want customers.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.040]   We just want to sell phones.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.680]   Well, is it like Microsoft, Jeff?
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.240]   Microsoft historically has a very--
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.960]   like they're slow learners, but by the time they get to version
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.040]   three and anything, they really know what they're doing.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.080]   You wrote the book, what would Google do?
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.360]   How does Google enter new markets?
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.960]   Start at a run, or does it take a while for them to ramp up?
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.520]   Well, I think it's a while, but I think these
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.360]   are wholly new skills.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.520]   It's like Google's not a-- every time Microsoft
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.960]   tried to be a content company, it failed at it.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.320]   They finally gave up.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.600]   Google does not want to be a nor should it be a content
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.000]   company.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.400]   Can it be a retailer?
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.080]   Can it be a manufacturer, a designer?
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.000]   I think that the jury is still over the horizon on those things.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.080]   Well, they're not-- I mean, the HTC is a manufacturer.
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.440]   And the HTC did a beautiful job with this, I have to say.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.880]   This is just such an elegant phone.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.320]   I couldn't be happier with it.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.400]   The only thing now I'm missing, I actually
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.640]   have the iPhone out because there's a Scrabble application.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.080]   I really wish they had.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.360]   But that's why I'm going to buy an iPad, because the iPad
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.560]   will satisfy all those really weird--
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.880]   and it'll be better for Scrabble.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.440]   And then I'll just--
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.040]   The entertainment.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.760]   Now, I have to say, right before the show began, my phone crashed.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.880]   And I think this is-- when you explain it, when people say,
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.760]   oh, no multitasking on the iPad, I have to say,
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.960]   there's some devices you don't want multitasking on.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.400]   And I think multitasking on a phone is risky,
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.640]   because it's too easy for a program running in the background
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.840]   to cause problems, to hang up the phone.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.080]   In this case, I think I put a third-party SMS application
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.240]   called Hand Sent on here, because it supposedly
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.160]   allows you to change the color of the ball, which
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.160]   is a very bad reason to put anything on a device.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.600]   Yeah, you know the little track fall down here.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.600]   It glows.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.640]   And so you can have it glow a different color.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.000]   Apparently, that capability is not built into this phone,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:52.920]   because it never did.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.840]   And I don't know, but that's the only thing
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.840]   I did the phone recently.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.760]   And I think it's probably what crashed it.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.760]   If you want your ball to change color,
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.800]   that's not the way to do it.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.360]   Sorry.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.080]   There are other bad ways, but that's another bad way.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:14.280]   So to me, multitasking, that's the risk of multitasking.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.880]   On the other hand, I sure do like the fact
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.320]   that I can have Google listen running in the background
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.120]   while I'm surfing the net or things like that.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.600]   I think that's really great.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.280]   So at one point, I don't know how I did this,
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.400]   but I installed an alternative music player
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.640]   and was listening to a playlist at the gym,
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.200]   and then wound up hitting the play button on my headphones.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.320]   And then that started the default music player.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.080]   So I had two songs playing at the same time.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.720]   I've had as many as three things playing at once.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.000]   And it took me a minute to really understand what's going on.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.200]   I was like, what is happening?
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.360]   And it's just like, yeah, that really shouldn't happen.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.800]   I mean, come on, the phone should be smart enough to know.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.560]   No, I like it that you can do that.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.320]   I had Pandora running, TuneWicki running,
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.000]   and Google listen running all three at the same time.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.160]   I think that's giving the user power,
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.760]   the power to screw the hell up out of your phone.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.880]   I think that's OK.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.880]   I already gave myself a really bad headache.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.960]   And I had the same reaction.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.160]   It's like, what is happening?
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.400]   Who is talking to you?
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:20.000]   But we have to do a Nexus One thing on this show at some point,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.400]   because obviously there's a lot to talk about.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.400]   I have a couple of tools we'll talk about.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.080]   I'll do a couple of Nexus One apps.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.600]   How about that when I--
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.200]   Well, that'd be good.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.320]   Yeah, because I have--
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.560]   I think-- I don't know, but I'm using an alternate music
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.560]   player that I really, really like.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.320]   Are you going to toss that now, or is that--
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:38.840]   No!
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.840]   Stay tuned.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.840]   Or hold him back.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.320]   And I want to talk about this shooting war,
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.960]   because I think Steve Jobs is feisty as heck.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.200]   And he's the one who said who called BS on Google's Not Evil.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.080]   And that's-- that got Google going.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.160]   And he's got Amazon going.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.600]   And he started another-- there's another war going on.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.960]   This is very interesting.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.760]   It really is getting nasty out there, yeah.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.500]   I can't wait.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.760]   We're going to talk about it in just a second.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.880]   But before we do, I want to mention our friends at Carbonite.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.280]   Carbonite is online backup.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.400]   If you don't back up off site, you're not doing it right.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.440]   Because, you know, yeah, great to have a local backup
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.360]   sitting right there next to the computer, your hard drive.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.680]   But what if there's some bad happens?
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:22.720]   Fire, or flood, and some more bad guys break into your house
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.040]   and steal your backups.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.280]   You say that couldn't happen?
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.840]   It happened to Francis Fort Coppola.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.240]   He had only one backup of his computer
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.680]   on a hard drive next to his computer.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.520]   He thought he was smart backing it up.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.240]   Thieves broke in.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:34.920]   He was in Argentina.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.800]   They stole everything.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.560]   He says, I lost 20 years of scripts.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.880]   Just tragic.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.960]   That's why I tell everybody about Carbonite.com.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.200]   It's online backup.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.720]   So what happens now, of course, for this to make sense,
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.040]   you have to have high speed internet.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.920]   This isn't going to make sense if you have dial up.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.400]   But I don't think anybody listening to this show is still--
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.240]   I hope you're not still using dial up.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.000]   But if you have enough upstream bandwidth,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.640]   this is such a great solution.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.280]   You could try it right now for free.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.360]   No credit card or anything.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.160]   You just go to Carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIG,
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:07.800]   and download it.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.000]   It immediately starts backing up the stuff
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.880]   internal to your computer.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.880]   It won't do external disks.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   It won't do network disks.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.080]   Just the stuff that's on your system
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.280]   and your personal stuff only.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.600]   But that's what you want, right?
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.240]   And it knows.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.320]   It backs up your pictures, your music,
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.880]   your financial documents, your email.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.280]   It just starts that automatically.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.480]   Does it in the background?
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.880]   It encrypts it with AES-256-bit encryption
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.040]   before it does anything.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.600]   You choose the key so it's totally private to you.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:36.000]   Then it uses SSL 128-bit in a classic case of overcompensation.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:36.880]   Double encrypted.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.960]   So it's completely private as it's going upstream.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.000]   And when it gets there, it is available to you on the net
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.200]   any time you can sign on anywhere to your Carbonite account.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.440]   So it's kind of like you've got this in the cloud storage
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.320]   at all times.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.800]   If you need to restore it, just a click of the mouse.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.600]   I love Carbonite.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.360]   I use it.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.080]   And I encourage you to try it too.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.200]   For Mac or PC, go to Carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIG,
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.800]   TWIG.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.560]   And you can try it free.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.000]   And by the way, if you use the offer code TWIG
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.520]   and decide to buy, you've got to do the trial first.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.680]   I insist, because I want you to try before you buy,
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.320]   but if you decide to buy after the offer,
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:17.040]   you get two free months with the offer code TWIG,
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.520]   Carbonite, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.160]   So did this war start when Steve Jobs at the All Hands
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.720]   meeting called BS on Google?
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.400]   Or has this been brewing for a while?
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.720]   What do you think, Pete?
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.200]   You know, I've mainly been following the Adobe angle
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.560]   on this one with the Flash stuff.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.400]   Yeah, Apple's basically pissing off everybody.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:45.440]   Yeah, the Flash thing I wrote a column for CNN last week
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:50.800]   on how that's kind of fragmenting the web a little bit,
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.680]   when we have Apple essentially saying, OK,
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.720]   we're not going to support Flash.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.240]   And then HTML5 coming up, which is really, really exciting
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.520]   for everyone, and maybe offering an alternative
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.640]   to proprietary solutions.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.200]   But I think it's interesting, kind of the higher level
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.920]   that devices like App Stores, things like the iPad having
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.440]   an App Store, things like the iPhone App Store, things
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.680]   like Google now having an App Store, Nokia's got one.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.680]   Everyone's getting and kind of fragmenting the web
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.320]   into all these little pieces.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.480]   And we kind of thought that the web would be united,
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.160]   and it would all be web-based apps.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.760]   And suddenly, everything's fragmented.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.240]   So that's really an interesting trend.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.640]   And I don't think it goes in any singular direction.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.400]   I think we're also going to head back to web apps
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.480]   when we get HTML5 coming up and letting
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.520]   us do even more tricksy things on the web.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.440]   But I think it's just an interesting trend
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.040]   with the apps that were created.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.560]   I have applauded Apple for this.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.120]   In fact, the tweet that I sent out
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.960]   was Apple does so many things that are proprietary and closed
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.320]   that you have to applaud them when they say,
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.960]   we're not going to include-- no, of course,
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.640]   they do it because for business reasons,
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.720]   because we don't want to support Adobe or whatever.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.000]   But you do have to applaud them for at least pushing forward
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.080]   HTML5, don't you?
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.840]   Yeah, but this is like the debate over Google.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.160]   They're also hurting their own device.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:12.760]   If you want to--
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.600]   That's even more admirable because they're willing to put
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.640]   their money where their mouth is.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.320]   I think they think that they've got people by the private parts.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.560]   And why not enable the whole darn web on the device?
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.040]   I think it's right.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.840]   The singularity goes away when you get special use devices.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.920]   I want the web.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.440]   Clearly, Jobs is lying when he says
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.680]   it's the best experience surfing the web because it isn't.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.240]   It isn't the whole web.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.280]   And I don't-- I'm no fan of Flash either.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.520]   I can't stand the overuse of Flash and say,
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.560]   well, I cannot stand PDFs.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.200]   They happen to both be in the same place.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.720]   But the web uses them.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.920]   People use them.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.360]   And to cut that off, I think, is a bulk.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.040]   Is an application marketization of the web?
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.880]   There are other reasons--
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.720]   I mean, look, there's a lot of reasons Apple could cite.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.040]   I think it's pretty clear that they just
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.080]   don't want to give Adobe that much power.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.000]   But they could also say that this is a very powerful scripting
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:11.520]   language.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.280]   Flash is not a multimedia player.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.600]   Flash is a platform.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.000]   You can write applications in Flash.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.720]   And it's a backdoor to applications.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:26.240]   So it may well be that their big fear is, well, first
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.280]   thing we do is it will allow Flash and Google
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.680]   will write Google Voice and Flash.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.720]   And we can't stop it.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.080]   Right.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.600]   And the Google tablet, which we had more rumors of those this
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.160]   week, because Android's open to anybody who can create a
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.760]   tablet and use Android, it will use web applications.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.880]   And so the web will--
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:50.280]   But HTML5 style, not Adobe style.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.680]   But you can still get Flash.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.840]   I can run Flash on Android, right?
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:55.840]   In fact--
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.200]   So it has some sort of Flash capability right now.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.480]   So it's already in there.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.120]   So an Android use Android on a tablet will be more powerful
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.600]   than the Apple.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.600]   However, the problem becomes, the applications still
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.840]   suck in comparison.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.360]   Right.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.920]   Let me get back to this shooting war thing.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:23.520]   It seems as if people are a little more feisty than they
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.480]   used to be.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.920]   I mean, Jobs was very feisty when he called BS on Google and
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.840]   said Adobe's platform sucks.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:36.000]   Google responds, I think, by putting multi-touch, saying,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.160]   well, all right, up yours, Apple, we're going to put
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.200]   multi-touch in there.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.600]   Come on, Sue us.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.920]   Meanwhile, Microsoft is throwing Google under the bus
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.160]   about evil.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.680]   Meanwhile, Macmillan pulls its books from Amazon.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.080]   And wins, because Amazon backs down.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:53.440]   Amazon--
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.800]   I don't think the books are up yet.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.080]   No, but Amazon has said they're going to be--
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.560]   I think they've started leaking back.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.920]   I just checked in Friday night.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.000]   I think the bits blog had up that some of them started
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.280]   coming back, although Royce's feed today says it's just the
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.720]   books that have started coming back.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.360]   So this is--
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.840]   It was with the owner of Macmillan and Davos,
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.960]   Stefan von Holzbrink, who was a really nice and smart guy.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.040]   And he was practically giggling about finally having a
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.680]   competition in the e-reader space.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.800]   So he was happy for Apple to be there just for that reason
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.280]   alone.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.000]   I think Google--
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.080]   Jeff Bezos made a rare, bad chess move on this one.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.720]   I've been very impressed by his ability to strategize and
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.800]   think several moves ahead.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.720]   I think the--
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.640]   putting the speech in the Kindle and strategically pulling
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.200]   back at the right time was very strategic.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.320]   This is not good strategy to go.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.080]   So Macmillan says, we want you to act as Apple does as an
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.560]   agent for us.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.720]   With Apple, we set the price.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   They take 30%.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.040]   Everybody's happy.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.480]   That is not Amazon's model.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.880]   Amazon sets the price and tells the publisher how much
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.080]   they're going to get.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.160]   You think Amazon can stand there and say, oh, we're the
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.160]   friend of the reader and the consumer, we're keeping
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:03.840]   prices down.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.920]   But that doesn't work in PR in this case.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.880]   Maybe we'll know that.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.840]   But here's what's worse, though.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.880]   If you pull the Macmillan books as they did, you better not
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.840]   put them back, because if you do, you have not just lost.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.920]   You've lost because every publisher now is going to say,
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.280]   oh, guess who has the upper hand here?
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.520]   And I think is it has shed some other publisher just announced,
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.400]   OK, we want the same model.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:27.840]   So you--
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.840]   The problem is going to be that--
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.840]   The problem is going to be that--
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.840]   The price is up for all of us.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:35.240]   It's the same as Fox managing to get must carry dollars out
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.840]   of Time Warner Cable and the money went straight through
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.400]   to the customer.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.280]   But do you-- now, let's face-- now, here's the question.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.000]   Does the consumer really mind paying 15 bucks for that book?
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.240]   I think we have to see where the price of the
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.680]   elasticity is here.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.960]   What will it do to the sales of Fox?
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.280]   I don't know.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:55.320]   And ultimately, we carry the way, because we just don't buy it.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.320]   You're going to charge--
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.760]   I think $9.99 was really a weird artificial price point.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.800]   I thought maybe, oh, they'll do this for a few months
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.320]   when the Kindle ships, but they've clearly
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.400]   intended to keep it that way.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.280]   And I can see why Macmillan and others said,
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.600]   wait a minute.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.960]   But Leo, I think you're right about the shooting war.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.960]   And what Pete said is important is that I fear
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.240]   we're going to get to a bunch of closed webs.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.960]   Because everybody says it has their turf.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.120]   And we go back just in a way--
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.160]   another app store, isn't it?
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.800]   It's just another closed store that controls what
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.440]   happens within that environment.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.480]   OK, I'm interested.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.040]   Because to me, on the surface, this
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.320]   seems like an anti-consumer move that is going to push prices
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.560]   up for all of us.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.080]   Is that too simplified?
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.880]   No, I mean, but on the other hand,
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.920]   you also have people who complain that us poor authors
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.840]   and writers are losing money in this world
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.600]   or becoming commodified.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.600]   I just want to post-- I haven't put up yet
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:58.600]   about deflation and that in non-physical goods,
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.320]   there is no more scarcity.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.560]   And any effort to sell scarcity and build an economy based
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.040]   on scarcity ain't going to work anymore.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:12.920]   And so the economics of media advertising, education,
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.840]   information all change radically.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.440]   So I don't think it's this-- yeah, I think on one level,
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.560]   we're going to pay more.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.360]   But if you go to the next step--
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.400]   and I think that it's going to yield other
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.760]   unintended consequences.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.920]   So Fox getting money out of a cable company for its TV
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.040]   station is fine.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.080]   When the prices go up, the FCC, I believe, will come in
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:36.200]   and will demand all of card pricing.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.480]   I think we're going to see potential anti-trust action
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.040]   book pricing here now.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.600]   We're going to see people paying more.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   I don't know.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:49.880]   I think it's the land of unintended consequences.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.920]   It seems like the launch of the iPad, though, is definitely--
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.560]   this was brewing for a while, but it
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.640]   was the launch of the iPad where everything just came to a
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.400]   head and blew up.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.720]   What gave us choice?
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.600]   Open his mouth.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.880]   And right, it gave us choice.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.720]   And this whole conversation started to happen between them.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.480]   And I think that the Apple Google thing--
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.040]   let's be honest, right?
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.840]   Apple kicks Google's ass when it comes to designing software
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.800]   that runs on your phone and on your computer.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.200]   And Google kicks Apple's ass when it comes to web apps.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.320]   And they're fighting in the mobile market.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.680]   But Apple's way ahead of Google still.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.240]   So I think everyone was playing nice for a while there.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.240]   I'm not really sure, I think, probably because of other
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.600]   partnerships that they had.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.640]   But then once the iPad launch and Jobs said what he did about
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.600]   Google and then this thing with Amazon that it all just broke
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.360]   open and now everyone's just being nasty and releasing
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.560]   multi-touch.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.120]   And making new rules.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.000]   You also see there was one story on the feed that Apple's
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.160]   going to refuse any app that uses geography in advertising
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.160]   serving.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.120]   Is Apple's going to try to hold on to that themselves?
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.720]   Oh, that's bad.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.120]   Yeah, and then they rejected that app that mentioned the word
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.920]   Android in the description.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.720]   This one, really.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.480]   This is more a shoot.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.320]   The guy--
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.360]   This all helps Android, I think, immensely.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.800]   What does Google come out of this?
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.920]   Doesn't Google come out of this as kind of pro-choice
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.000]   pro-consumer?
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.840]   You don't see them making these moves recently.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.800]   You see Apple making them.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.480]   You see Amazon, some extent, although Amazon, you could
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.440]   argue, was fighting for the consumer.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.680]   This stuff, Google is the most open, even though they have
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.920]   these app stores, they have these kind of environments they
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.680]   control.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.640]   It's a lot more open as a platform, so it's pro-consumer.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.360]   And they're including Flash and things like that.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.720]   I think so.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.160]   By the way, Gina--
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.080]   Go ahead, Jess.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.080]   Sorry.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.120]   I was going to change subject.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.000]   Go ahead.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.720]   I was going to say just quickly about Kindle Books.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.280]   I mean, now this is coming from someone who is publishing an
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.760]   e-book and really struggled with how to come up with a price
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.240]   point that people are going to pay for.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.920]   I mean, the thing is, is for someone who spends $400 or $300
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.760]   on an e-reader, do you think $15 is really going to stop
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.280]   them from buying the book at that point?
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:48.760]   No.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.680]   It's still cheaper than the hardcover.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.320]   It's still cheaper than the hardcover.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.120]   And you get it instantly.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.960]   You buy a device that buys books into your hands wherever
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.120]   you are.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.080]   I don't think people who are buying Kindle's are really
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.920]   worried about paying $15 a book.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.560]   That doesn't seem unreasonable.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.320]   Well, you're right, Gina.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.840]   And the irony here is that Google kind of gets accused.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.560]   The word isn't used, but kind of accused of dumping.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.440]   And it says they destroyed value in the directions market,
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.280]   mapping market.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.280]   And that's exactly what Amazon does with books.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.480]   And that's what Amazon does.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.680]   And so what we're really looking for here is an open market.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.240]   And we see what people are willing to pay.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.160]   Right.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.800]   Amazon's artificially maintaining a price that has nothing to
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.440]   do with demand.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.080]   And it's to promote the Kindle.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.640]   What stuns me is that Amazon is willing to throw itself on its
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.440]   sword to protect the Kindle.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.320]   Well, but well, they've sold a lot of them.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.440]   And they see that as their platform for this.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.160]   They should be more open.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.400]   The irony is that it's the greater control freak that is
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.720]   busting open the control freakiness of Amazon.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.480]   As far as we know, Apple can't go into our iPads and delete
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.480]   an application.
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.200]   I mean, maybe--
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:56.680]   Well--
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.480]   There's a kill swing.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.000]   I guess there is.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.520]   I guess there is.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.320]   But the iBookstore, we don't know.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.080]   They might be able to delete books in the iBookstore.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:02.600]   Who knows?
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.200]   But if they do that, it's a dumb thing.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.760]   I mean, Amazon did--
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.040]   That was a terrible one.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.640]   Could be the position to break this open yet more.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.120]   But the words Google and books right now--
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.720]   They're not going to go there.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.480]   Right.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.080]   Competition is good.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.200]   But you hit the nail on the head, Pete, when you said this
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:27.840]   is potentially people fencing off the prairie and eliminating
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.360]   the commons.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.080]   And that's not good at all.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.280]   Well, it's not good if one person dominates.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.480]   I mean, in iTunes, you've got one vendor dominating the
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.680]   music market.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.080]   Right now, Amazon dominates books, essentially.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:44.800]   And as you get more competition, iPad, iBookstore, as you get.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.920]   All these vendors moving into the same space, you might
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.960]   eventually crack that open.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.640]   I mean, could Google potentially get a bookstore and start
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.560]   lowering those prices?
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.320]   Probably.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.800]   Eventually.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.120]   So it could all even out.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.840]   Well, but again, on Nintendo consequences.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.880]   What happens if you have all this competition in eBooks,
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.280]   bookstores are just absolutely borked.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.880]   Well, but that's a given.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.920]   A publisher is going to maintain the upper hand to your
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.440]   Amazon lets you sell eBooks directly, don't they?
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.400]   Let you just put up your e-book and they'll be the publisher.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.680]   So how long has publishers maintained the upper hand?
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.080]   At some point, Amazon will just say, hey, you want to keep the
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.720]   lion's share of your book sales?
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.160]   We've got bigger distribution.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.520]   You know, it's really great distribution.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.080]   And right now, if you want to publish a book, you still go
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.360]   with the mainstream publishers, good to get into the book
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.160]   stores where the distribution is.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.560]   But I'm not going to use that in the last.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.360]   And Amazon comes up to come as a publisher.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.120]   So this is kind of temporary, to some extent.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.960]   Here's a-- well, let's see.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.200]   You were going to change the subject.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.880]   I don't want to move on, Jeff, unless you--
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.360]   I just wanted to give Gina props for the discussion of
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.560]   pads last week.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.800]   I was eager and overheard.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.080]   Have you all seen the MAD TV video?
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.640]   That was everywhere.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.120]   The minute Steve said iPad--
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:08.400]   I feel like I was so out of touch, I lost my feminine side
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.960]   completely.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.880]   And not to get too ridiculous here again, but because of my
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.520]   surgery, even I'm a pad customer.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:22.200]   I have to say, that conversation has kind of died off,
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:22.600]   though, right?
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.720]   We're all done with it.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.640]   Oh, OK, now, but it's so funny that I just felt completely
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.320]   blindsided with that.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.280]   I was absolutely surprised.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.360]   No, me too.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.000]   And I was blindsided, not by Gina and Heather.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.880]   I already knew because my wife and daughter both said, what
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.840]   the heck are they thinking?
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.240]   It's like the Nintendo Wii, isn't it?
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.280]   At some point, you just--
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.000]   You get used to it.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:41.920]   You start mocking the name.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.960]   And it's the Nintendo Wii's quite a good name, I think,
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:44.480]   now.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.520]   It's not too bad.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.880]   I like saying it.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.520]   Yeah, I love the way the two eyes bow on the logo.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.600]   I think that's such a clever--
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.040]   I think Wii is not such a bad name.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.680]   But maybe that's just because we got used to it.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.320]   But we thought it was going to be launched.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.120]   Right.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.600]   And everybody hated iPod.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.600]   I still hate iPod.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.720]   It's iPod makes no sense.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.240]   Pod people.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.320]   That's not the way it is with brands.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.360]   I'm a partner at day life.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.480]   I shouldn't say this out loud.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.800]   But I've always hated the brand because it sounds like a spa.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.800]   Right.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.960]   But you just get used to it.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.440]   You get used to it, and you forget it, and that's what it is.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.960]   It's like kids' names or anything else.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.200]   That's why I told my wife, you know, any name
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.600]   or whatever you want.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.880]   Well, and don't forget that iTunes now isn't really essentially
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.640]   a music store.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.200]   It's a media store.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.880]   I'm glad they came along with that.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.120]   I think that's a kind of odd thing
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.720]   that they instead of just staying with iTunes,
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.240]   they had the iBook store, which, first of all,
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.680]   is not a very felicitous name.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.800]   But also, why bifurcate your store like that?
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.400]   Amazon doesn't have the Amazon A Bookstore
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.520]   and the Amazon A shoe store.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.000]   I presume I'm going to be able to buy iBooks on my iPhone.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.360]   Oh, nobody knows.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.240]   This is a good question.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.000]   I wondered about this myself.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.800]   And are you going to be able to read your Kindle books?
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.400]   Is that Kindle app going to work on your iPad?
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.600]   That's what we're going to say.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.040]   That will work.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:02.960]   Or the US Department of Justice will have a very good case.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.680]   You can say you can't use the word Android.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.480]   That's sketch.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.480]   But you can say that.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:10.320]   But you cannot start arbitrarily blocking apps.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.360]   Remember the--
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.120]   Can you purchase Amazon MP3s on your iPhone right now?
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.160]   No.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:15.800]   No, you can't.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.600]   Why?
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.240]   Because Apple rejected the app?
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.720]   Apple rejects--
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:23.760]   Well, you know, and this might be their excuse for rejecting
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.280]   a Kindle app post facto is that they reject apps that
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.840]   duplicate the functionality of the iPhone.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.320]   Well, there you go.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.080]   Does the Kindle app duplicate the functionality of--
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:34.720]   I mean, I just--
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.960]   It doesn't currently--
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.200]   The actual exercise.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.680]   I mean, think about it.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.520]   It doesn't really--
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.040]   It's so fun and lovely.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.720]   --let you read books that you bought from Amazon.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.920]   I was going to be interesting, though,
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.920]   to see what happens with the Kindle app.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.520]   I am shocked.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.280]   I thought when the iPad came out that Amazon--
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.760]   and I think as I said it here, maybe I
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.720]   said it on another show-- that Amazon would embrace this.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.400]   That I said, Amazon's in the book business.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.480]   They're not in the Kindle business.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.320]   They're going to embrace this.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.080]   It's another platform, another way to sell books.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:58.840]   I am stunned.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:03.320]   And I think Jeff Bezos really is making stupid moves here.
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.640]   I don't understand it.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:09.560]   They're protecting a 3 million unit business over two years
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.360]   compared to a multi--
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.320]   a business that's so small it doesn't show up
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:19.560]   on their shareholder statement against a multi--
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.360]   a $9 billion a year business.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.880]   What does that make no sense?
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.080]   You know, I wonder if we'll get to the next level here.
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.960]   There's a 3D chess going on of debt neutrality.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.640]   We have the need for web neutrality and app neutrality.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.280]   We do.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.360]   But I do believe we're building these fences.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.840]   Somebody in our chat room just pointed out,
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.880]   and I think this is true.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.720]   Who else built fences?
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:42.440]   AOL.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.840]   How well did that work out for them?
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.280]   I don't think you want to start making these arbitrary lines.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.400]   It's not good for consumers.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.320]   It's not ultimately good for the company.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.120]   People want the ability.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.760]   Look, everybody knows what we want.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.920]   We want flexibility.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.840]   We want to be able to take content and put it anywhere
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.200]   and consume it any way we want.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.680]   And anybody who does anything to slow that down,
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.160]   I think ultimately loses.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.720]   But the only company that is fully positioned to benefit
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.680]   from that wherever and however it happens is Google.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:10.960]   Yes.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.520]   Or we use the web the better off Google is.
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.320]   Or we use the web.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.240]   Apple doesn't benefit unless we're using their devices.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:15.720]   Right.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.320]   Amazon doesn't benefit unless they're the one selling us the book.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.080]   Google said this.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.200]   They said, we don't care.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.000]   As long as you use the web more, we're happy.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.080]   I hope they continue to ask that.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:24.240]   I'm brilliant.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.040]   I'm glad to see Google.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.120]   Maybe not a brilliant strategy.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.120]   Maybe they're just a post modern company.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.520]   I mean, it's just maybe what the time has come for this.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:37.480]   Now, a little concern, Article and USA Today this week--
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.000]   actually, I'm sorry, Washington Post--
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.600]   that Google asked the National Security Agency
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.680]   to help attract down those cyber attackers who
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.160]   breached its databases.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.720]   I think that's such a bogus story.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.000]   Who else are they going to ask?
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.840]   Santa Claus?
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.760]   The CIA?
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.920]   Because it was ridiculous.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.840]   It was a wired story first too that just said,
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.680]   well, the National Security Agency did bad things before.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.040]   Now Google's talking to them.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:02.720]   Uh-oh.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.920]   What does that mean?
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.360]   Jack is what it means.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.400]   Well, it's because the NSA was involved in wiretapping,
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:16.000]   co-opting the phone carriers like AT&T and wiretap.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.440]   Yeah, we sold arms to South American gorillas too.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.180]   So Google's going to start selling arms,
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.080]   South American gorillas.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.880]   It's just-- I don't mean to be the fanboy defender,
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.520]   but it's rather ridiculous.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.720]   As Google has said, there was a crime perpetrated here.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.000]   It's a crime that involves national security.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.240]   They reported to the government.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.320]   The government decided, who's going to work on this?
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.400]   And what are they going to say?
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.160]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.960]   We refuse to work with the NSA.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.920]   Well, but here's the concern that they
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.640]   might, in the process of working with the NSA,
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:47.680]   give them personal information about us.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.600]   Certainly the NSA would like that.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.600]   They've shown the interest in that kind of thing before.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.200]   Well, under a different administration.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.280]   I do think that Obama's not going to walk down that same rattle.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.040]   I wouldn't count on it.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.560]   He's been defending-- he's defended them
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.000]   in the wiretapping issues his Department of Justice
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.040]   has, so I wouldn't count on that.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.080]   They seem pretty clear that Google wasn't going
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.040]   to hand over personal information.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.320]   The knee-jerk reaction has been like, ah, scary.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.000]   This is bad.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.280]   And I have to say, I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me feel
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.280]   a little icky.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.480]   But for the most part, I agree with Jeff.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.920]   I mean, who are they going to go to?
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.480]   And the terms of the agreement, it sounds like Google
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.320]   decided to work with them on their own terms
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.680]   without sharing personal, identifiable information.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.040]   I trust Google to do that.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.040]   I make the decision to trust them by using their apps all the time.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.480]   At any point, they could share my information with someone
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.880]   I don't want them to.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.560]   But I feel a little icky about it.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.480]   As the NSA points out, it's not the first time many, many
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.840]   Silicon Valley companies have come to them asking for help.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.440]   It's apparently a very common procedure.
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.960]   So--
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.120]   You guys think that makes me feel icky or is that there
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.600]   are a report of 36 companies that also got affected
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.240]   by the same story that haven't come forward?
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:56.880]   Haven't done anything.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.440]   And we don't know what the sanctity is of our data there.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:04.440]   We don't know how much they're helping the bad guys in this.
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.080]   That makes me feel like here.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.880]   It keep being the operative verb of the day, Gina.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.880]   - I'm sorry.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.040]   I didn't even sound like a 16-year-old girl.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.960]   But that's the best word I could come up with.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.360]   That we is icky.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:17.800]   You know what?
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.800]   It's icky, multi-touch.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.240]   That's icky.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.880]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:26.560]   Google has fired four patent applications for technology.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.200]   It's building into its Chrome browser
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.080]   to make the web a more powerful application.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.200]   Foundation for applications.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.600]   This is, I guess, the Google native client, a technology
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.680]   for allowing downloaded software modules
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.680]   to run directly on a processor rather than
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.880]   kind of through interpretation.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:48.760]   Gina, tell me if I'm wrong.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.800]   This sounds a lot like ActiveX.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.760]   The loads of Microsoft product that opened a million holes
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.120]   on Windows computers.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.360]   It sure does sound like that, doesn't it?
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.280]   Don't we all remember a whole thing
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.200]   about your browser being separate from your operating system?
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.040]   Sandboxing.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:06.920]   Back in the day.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.880]   And seems like since it was Microsoft,
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.160]   it was a different story.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.720]   Yeah, this sounds a lot like that.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:16.000]   Also, another thing that makes me feel a little icky.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.480]   Well, let's come up with standards, people.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.240]   HTML5, data stores that everyone agrees on
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.200]   and build that security layer.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.320]   I'm a really big fan of my browser
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.480]   being separate from my operating system
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.200]   and having this sandbox, this security layer.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.720]   But at the same time, Google's obsessed with speed.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.760]   And hey, I installed a flash plug-in.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.560]   Flash does stuff, interacts with my operating system
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.560]   at a level of the browser can't.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.240]   So I don't know, but yes, it sounds a lot like that, Leo.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.480]   It's--
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:49.320]   There's two initiatives here, the Native Client technology,
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:53.560]   which is designed to let web pages send the browser
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.200]   a binary file, which the computer will execute.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.080]   Oh, great.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.680]   Like you mean Trojan Horse?
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.920]   And then there's this O3D, which
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.400]   may be make a little bit more sense, which allows browsers
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:10.160]   running JavaScript to write directly to the GPU
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.360]   to increase speed screen updates.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.960]   Both are very dangerous.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:19.040]   Now, the patent name is method for safely executing
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:23.800]   an untrusted native code module on a computing device.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:28.280]   Method for validating an untrusted native code module.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.760]   Certificates, ActiveX.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:33.120]   Method and system for executing applications
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.160]   using native code modules and web-based graphics rendering
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:37.680]   system.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.680]   Yeah, this doesn't smell right at all.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.480]   JavaScript is enough of a security problem.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.440]   You can active X. You let them run binary.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.280]   Boy, that's terrible.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.080]   Yeah, and this is just going to be a Chrome thing.
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.160]   So this goes way beyond browser standard.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.600]   So this is going to be like, well, if you run our apps in Chrome,
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.080]   they're going to run a little bit better.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.680]   Kind of the way it is with Gears now, right?
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.200]   Like you can do things with Google Gears.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.440]   You can drag and drop files into Wave, for instance,
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:04.160]   or get some offline access that you can't get without Gears.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.920]   So they're letting the sunset on Gears.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:11.560]   It sounds like this is going to be the next step.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.520]   Yeah, I'm not thrilled.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.520]   Love the idea of faster web applications.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.880]   Don't love the idea of--
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.080]   Do you think it's possible for them to implement it safely?
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:23.400]   Or is this just really a bad idea all around?
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:29.160]   I'm going to vote for bad idea all around.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.280]   It makes me highly uncomfortable.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.360]   It's possible they can do it.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.280]   It makes me very uncomfortable.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:38.840]   And it's frankly surprising, given how they touted security
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.400]   on Chrome and the sandbox on Chrome.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.800]   I mean, it's kind of an odd direction.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.280]   I mean, if you're talking about Chrome OS,
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.920]   where there's nothing on the computer,
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:50.120]   except for the browser, then all your data--
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.320]   I mean, then, well, OK, I feel a little better about that.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.480]   It's not like it's going to be able to download some binary
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.840]   that's going to--
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.360]   I don't know.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:00.160]   I suppose it could download a binary that does key logging
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:00.880]   and that kind of thing.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:06.480]   But not if Chrome OS is so heavily sandboxed anyway.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.040]   I'm interested to see how it shakes out.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.280]   But yeah, I lean toward that idea as well.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.000]   Or Icky.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:12.440]   Icky.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.000]   I'll go with Icky.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:13.520]   Icky.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.920]   There is the title of the channel.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.560]   I think third time, we've got to make it the title now.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.280]   I mean, there's no way around it.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:19.760]   Icky this.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:20.760]   Icky Icky Icky.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.640]   I'll tell you something that might also make you feel a little
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:25.720]   bit Icky is Google Street View coming inside your home.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.880]   We'll find out in a moment.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.860]   But first, a word from our friends
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:30.880]   that go to assist.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.280]   The great folks at Citrix have done it again.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.300]   I've been using go to assist since we did it on the screen
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:38.320]   savers to help people fix people's computers remotely.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.280]   Their latest go to assist express
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:44.720]   is faster, easier, more secure, better than ever.
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:47.800]   If you're in the support business, IT or software support,
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.960]   you know that sometimes you just have
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.200]   to get into that computer.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.440]   You have to get in there and fix it.
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.440]   You don't want to make the trip.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.280]   You just go to assist.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:59.040]   It's remote access designed for support.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.560]   With go to assist express, you could provide tech support
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.600]   online to customers and clients.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.600]   Whether they're there or not, there is unattended,
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.320]   which I think is fantastic.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.640]   You could fix a problem remotely without being there.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.320]   Access files, transfer them from your computer
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.720]   to the customer's computer, which is great for installing
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:19.720]   a patch or an update, a fix, an antivirus program,
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:20.920]   malware bites.
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:24.520]   It allows you to have up to eight sessions wanting at once,
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.360]   so you run the scan on one and you move to the next,
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.800]   the next, the next, no more sitting around
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.040]   and waiting for that scan to complete.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.240]   I mean, I could just go on and on.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.880]   This is such a cool product.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.600]   They do have month by month, but also day passes.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:37.320]   But I'm gonna tell you, I use it for three to 30 days.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.640]   But I got, now I have to warn you,
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.920]   'cause I use the free trial with my mom,
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.680]   and now she won't let me stop.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.800]   In fact, I got an email from somebody who said,
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.080]   my mother's paying for go to assist express
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.160]   because she didn't want me to stop.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.560]   I haven't gotten my mom to do that yet,
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.960]   but it is a great solution.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.680]   Go to assist.com/twig, that's the website.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.320]   Go to assist.com/twig, and you can try it free
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.000]   for 30 days with that caveat.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.360]   You're gonna get hooked.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:09.880]   Go to assist.com/twig, we thank 'em so much
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.400]   for their support.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:17.400]   So search engine land has a scooplet,
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:22.040]   and actually there's a picture that goes along with it,
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:25.920]   a New York City Nut and Candy Shop, O-nuts,
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.120]   sent an email to search engine land saying,
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:34.120]   a representative from Google was in there taking pictures,
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.120]   360 degree pictures of the store
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:41.200]   for something they called Google Store Views.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:45.200]   In fact, the store sent along security camera images.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.360]   Of course, it could just be somebody with a camera,
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.360]   they don't have a big Google hat on or anything like that.
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.760]   What do you think? Does that sound like a product?
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.320]   I guess you also got this email from O-nuts.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.920]   It says matchable. - I covered it.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.960]   I was traveling that day, so I have no idea
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.200]   if we were constantly directly,
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.120]   if we picked up off search engine land.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.160]   You know, you see this story and you think,
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.400]   well, that's good, we're a joke.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.720]   And then you think about it and you see the pics
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.560]   and you read Google's non-denial, which is perfect.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:15.480]   It says, "We are always experimenting
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.840]   "with new features for Google Maps.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.840]   "We have nothing further to announce at this time,
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.880]   "which is exactly what you do say
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.120]   "when you're a spokesperson and you're working on a product,
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.160]   "because otherwise you just deny it flatly."
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.440]   I think this would be a great product.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.520]   I'd love this product. - Oh.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.760]   As long as I know, coming to my house,
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.520]   I'd let him in the Twit cartage that would be cool.
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.960]   Well, you know, your notes next.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.520]   It pretty much once one shop does it, once one store,
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:40.800]   does it, everyone else has to do it,
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.440]   because your store's indexed on Google.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.680]   It's really competitive,
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.280]   you need to get their stores indexed as well.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.400]   So it's kind of one of those things
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.800]   that will force everyone else to get their stores indexed
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:53.560]   and they've been moving in that direction for a while,
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:58.560]   because now as a business, I can get my Google listing,
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.720]   and I can give them hours and pictures and stuff,
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.520]   and that's now in a business profile that shows up
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.080]   on Google Maps. - Are we very--
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.880]   - It's free. - Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.240]   - No, Gina, you're next. - I was gonna say,
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.240]   it's free advertising.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.240]   What store wouldn't want this?
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.680]   And they took pictures of products
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.040]   and think about Google goggles, right?
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.960]   - Oh, boy. - So the camera goes in the store,
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:20.480]   it takes a picture of a bunch of products,
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.800]   goggles associates that product with that store,
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.240]   and then suddenly you search Google for, you know,
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.480]   I don't know, Swiffer,
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.240]   and you find out the target down the street has it,
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.640]   or the momma popped down the street has it,
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.040]   and this just makes sense.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.720]   I mean, Google's trying to index all the public,
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.680]   I mean, a store, the inside of a store is a public place, right?
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.840]   I mean, they're trying to index, you know,
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.200]   all public places, and with tech recognition
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.920]   and the kind of goggles stuff they have going on,
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:44.880]   it only makes sense, and as a store owner,
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.560]   I'd be like, come on in.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.400]   - I mean, the next step, the next step is to--
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.000]   - The next step is to give them your inventory data.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.160]   - Sure, what do we got?
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.520]   - Sure. - What's the price?
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.360]   - Yeah. - We're gonna find them
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.320]   locally 'cause we're moving
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.680]   to transparent marketplaces,
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.440]   so that the price is not gonna be the competition.
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:00.440]   It can be, it's gonna be the competition.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:02.960]   This beats Amazon, you know, it's just down the block,
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.920]   and we got it right now, you know, come on in and get it.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.280]   - Mm-hmm. - Try it out.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.240]   - We have somebody-- - It makes sense.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.600]   - Somebody in the chat room who claims to know says,
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.840]   Google has a secret project that will change e-commerce
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.160]   in the very near future.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.960]   That would fit in with that, right?
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.040]   Of course, Google's business is perfect information.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.640]   - Yes. - Exactly.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.400]   - And meanwhile, as you said,
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.440]   Apple is banning GPS location-aware applications,
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:30.800]   so they can't say, oh, you're next to Pizza Hut,
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.880]   would you like to come in?
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.960]   - I went out to visit Best Buy 'cause of my book,
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.800]   which I haven't plugged in a while, by the way,
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:40.880]   and I learned a tremendous amount from them.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.960]   I realized that retailers are becoming media companies.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.880]   The circular of the Best Buy puts out
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.120]   is a media property.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:52.080]   The end caps they sell in the store is media.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:56.040]   Their opportunity is to become more of a community
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.000]   where they bring together smart people who know gadgets.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.960]   Leola Port should be hanging out in the nearest Best Buy
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.520]   and answering people's questions just 'cause he cares
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.280]   the way we do Apple's. - Oh, hell no.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.640]   (laughing)
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.200]   - Hell no.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.720]   But I think that you start to see a store
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.880]   not just as a shelves and things,
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.600]   but as a media experience
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.000]   where you're gonna add more value,
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.320]   we have the people who know these products,
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.560]   you can try them here, you can play with them here,
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:24.400]   you can compare them here,
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.640]   that becomes the value of retail at some point.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.200]   Becomes a different experience.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:32.520]   - By the way, Sayon and Sian and Jen,
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.760]   just tweet, there's the book.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.080]   What would Google do? - Thank you, Chris.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.160]   - What would Google do?
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:38.040]   - Notice the video that I didn't.
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.840]   - And by the way, we index products though,
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.560]   we're gonna have unique identifiers for every product,
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.880]   if we wanna do four- - We already do.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:46.720]   - We have barcodes. - That's true actually.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:50.120]   - Yeah. - In fact, one of the very first things
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.480]   that the G1 did better than anything else
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.560]   was the ability to take a picture of a barcode
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.360]   and find out where I could get it cheaper down the block.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.680]   I think that's great.
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:02.680]   I mean, if I have shopkeeper, I ban cell phones, if I can.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.920]   - Let me go farther and farther.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.680]   What if you could find out not only the menu
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.520]   of the restaurant in New York,
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.480]   but what ingredients are in things?
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.680]   And why not?
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.480]   - Word data. - Perfect data.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.600]   - Yeah. - It is right.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.120]   - You know, I can't see a negative to this really.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.960]   I mean, I would-- - Same with hotel room.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.840]   That's a now going trial. - Hotel room!
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:26.000]   Your GPS to a hotel room, you're looking at street views.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:26.840]   Say, "Let me go inside."
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.080]   You walk through the lobby.
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.760]   - I guess if you're gonna be a cynic,
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.960]   I guess you could kind of, if you were criminal,
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.320]   you might wanna see how all the stores are laid out
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.880]   where all the most expensive stuff is,
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.360]   plan your route kind of thing.
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.640]   - True, but you do that now.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:41.960]   - I guess if you're a skeptic. - Walk around.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:44.520]   - Yeah, you can just walk in, exactly.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.280]   But it certainly saves you having to do the,
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.320]   you know, you're certainly not gonna go
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:49.640]   and scout out of a place with a bandana,
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.360]   or sorry, Balak Clover on.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.840]   You know, if you gotta go in and check out the place,
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:58.240]   kind of as yourself at some point,
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.480]   and then there's tapes and so on.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.760]   - I'm almost trying to make the devil's advocate
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.600]   argument here. - Good,
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.760]   that's what we bring you here for.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.360]   You are the devil.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:08.280]   - There's a case for you.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.600]   (laughing)
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.000]   There's a case that you could check out a place
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.400]   before you, without ever even setting fit in it.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.960]   - If the devil were to personify,
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.520]   of course he would personify as a handsome,
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:21.600]   smooth talking, web 2.0 entrepreneur.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.040]   - In a kilt. - In a kilt.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.600]   (laughing)
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:25.520]   With a sporean.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.200]   - Well, you know, but I think,
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.440]   but the word you raised here,
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.440]   this very importantly is public.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.640]   This is a debate I keep having.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.080]   You know, in Europe, the Europeans go nutty
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.800]   on privacy and publicness.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:39.080]   As I mentioned last week in my very tired,
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:41.840]   super from Domos, I've become an addict of,
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:45.240]   Saunas now.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.520]   And I'm amused by the Germans who were very, very private
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.040]   about anything, everything, except as I said,
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.480]   they're private parts.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.560]   And they're going nuts with street view.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.560]   And saying, "No, you can't take a picture of me
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.120]   "on the street going to this place."
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.600]   Well, that's the public.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.160]   And we should defend the public because the public,
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.800]   we the public own the public.
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:05.280]   We can comment on it and analyze it and see what's there.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:10.280]   So any place in public accommodation, a store, a school,
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.080]   at some level, there's issues there too.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.600]   But at some point, we have to define the definition
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.400]   of public in this new data age.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.400]   And I think we've got to defend public a little bit
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.440]   because we go nutty on this privacy side.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.800]   - I agree.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.640]   I'm with you on that.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.760]   Of course, you and I live in public
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.620]   in some strange, bizarre way.
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:32.760]   I was almost, I tell you, I was almost bit by this one.
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:37.040]   I almost fell for the Jason Calicanis style,
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:39.320]   Twitter misdirection,
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:42.800]   Cyanogen on his Twitter about 15 minutes ago,
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:45.720]   posted this, "Today I decided to stop development
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:48.160]   "on the Cyanogen mod and buy an iPhone."
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:49.880]   Sorry fans.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:52.640]   Now, Gina, before you have a heart attack.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:53.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:55.680]   - Scroll up. - I'm a TH.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.760]   - Scroll up 'cause then the next tweet,
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:00.080]   "Ha ha, my friends stole my phone.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:01.840]   "I was pwned."
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:04.520]   (laughing)
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:07.160]   He caught me entering the lock pattern.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:10.960]   So, oh, that was close.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.160]   - Yeah, I got it.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.720]   - I'm glad I didn't run with that story.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:15.400]   I almost did.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:19.240]   Then I must, you must constantly have that kind of like,
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:22.160]   you know, moment of, oh, we're glad we didn't cover
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.600]   that story, we could have, we could have a bit.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:26.120]   - Yeah, probably quite a few times a week.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.240]   What's great about blogging though is that you can--
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.080]   - You can fix it.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:31.160]   - You can put up what you have and then update,
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:33.480]   which is kind of the new way of doing things, I think.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.360]   You have to get some kind of strong signal on there,
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.880]   or you have to go and check it out somehow.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:38.040]   - You've been very good.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.120]   - You have the power to correct.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.480]   I mean, I speak to journalists all the time,
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.880]   and they say, you know, what really frustrates me is,
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.360]   is that I put out the story and the next day I learn it's wrong,
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.600]   and there's no way I can get all those papers back.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.280]   I think that's a fantastic thing about blogging
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.880]   that we can update as the story evolves.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:51.720]   - What's your policy?
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:53.520]   I'm sure this is the case.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.920]   I mean, some blogs will delete it
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.080]   and pretend it never happened.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:59.120]   I'm sure you strike through, update,
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.120]   we got it wrong, that kind of thing.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.440]   - Yeah, so what we do is we pin update right at the top,
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.800]   and then we put out a tweet and a Facebook message
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.520]   that just says, you know, update,
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.760]   and then whatever information that we've had.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:10.880]   - You don't hide what you got wrong though,
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.760]   you leave that there.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:16.200]   - No, I think you need to be really clear about that stuff.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.080]   And I think, you know, the fear is that people aren't going to trust you
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.560]   if you put up something wrong,
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.280]   but I think if you put up the wrong thing
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.360]   and then put up the right thing right above it,
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:26.480]   that actually builds trust, it says,
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:28.280]   "Hey, they get too strong sometimes, but they're correct."
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:30.840]   - Right, where you lose trust is where you hide and pretend,
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:32.440]   and say, "Oh, we didn't get that wrong."
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:34.000]   - I mean, the deleting and the age of RSS,
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.440]   you can't delete a blog post once you hit publish it's out.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.320]   - And yet there's still people who do it.
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:40.080]   - It's crazy.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.120]   To me, that means that they don't know what they're doing
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.120]   because people have copies of their RSS item
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.080]   and they're, you know, desktop feed reader.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:47.640]   - Sorry, we could prove it.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.520]   I've got Google cache.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.160]   - It turns it into a big story, doesn't it?
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:52.480]   Because people will go through the cache
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.560]   and they'll try and figure out, "Why did you delete that?"
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:57.000]   And it makes an even bigger thing when you try and hide these.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.480]   It's that, it's that whole problem of when you try
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.640]   and try and hide stuff, it makes a bigger issue.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.080]   - Tell the truth.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.440]   Here's another breaking story.
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.840]   Just came in from ZDNet in a tweet.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:11.240]   News is getting twittered now.
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:13.440]   This is how you break news.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.560]   - I love the Saturday afternoon and live on the air.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:18.560]   - Yeah, Eric Schmidt tweets, quote,
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.680]   "Can't wait to watch the Super Bowl tomorrow.
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:25.080]   Be sure to watch the ads in the third quarter."
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:28.560]   Someone said, "Hell has indeed frozen over."
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:32.080]   Sounds like Google's bought an ad on the Super Bowl.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.440]   So-- - What would that be?
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:36.400]   - So this is the question for the panel.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.320]   I love it.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.840]   What if your Google, you're spending more than,
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:41.640]   what is it, a million and a half, two million dollars
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.360]   for a Super Bowl ad?
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.640]   What will that ad be for, Pete Cashmore?
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:48.720]   - Probably, well, it's gonna be the Nexus one, isn't it?
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:51.200]   But it'll probably content focused in terms of,
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.520]   hey, this is what you can do with it
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:55.160]   rather than device focused, or to imagine.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:56.400]   - Well, will they do?
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.360]   There's an app for it.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.880]   - I'm not gonna lie on this line, I'd imagine.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.200]   - They could easily.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:04.280]   - What are the labels rather than what it is?
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:06.360]   'Cause we're all enamored by hardware,
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.080]   but really real people care about,
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:09.560]   what can you do with this device?
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:12.680]   - Jeff Jarvis, you have a two million dollar check.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.680]   You can be on the Super Bowl.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.160]   What are you, advertise?
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:18.240]   - I think there's a way to ding all these competitors.
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.920]   And Google, as we've discussed in recent weeks,
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:23.280]   at least at the media level, Google has a PR problem.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:26.040]   I think we agree that it doesn't on the customer level,
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:29.720]   but I think there's a way for Google to start to
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:31.800]   change the agenda about Google,
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:34.920]   and they're becoming more and more of a consumer brand now.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:37.920]   - They don't do a Bing style search ad, do they?
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:38.760]   - Oh God, no.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:41.040]   - I hope these ads are so horrible.
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.680]   - But I think it may be more than the Nexus one.
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:46.600]   I think there's a bigger brand issue for Google
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:48.720]   to present itself as, you know,
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.560]   in all these other people, we're trying to close down walls.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.560]   We are your real friend.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:53.960]   We give you things for free.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:55.880]   - You think so, Gina?
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.000]   What does Google spend its $2 million on?
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.360]   - Yeah, I'm thinking it's probably gonna be the Nexus one,
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.200]   although I don't know.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.120]   I kind of can imagine an ad for, like, maps or Chrome,
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.840]   or just like Google Apps in general,
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.240]   like look at all the cool stuff Google gives you.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.120]   You know, or just like maybe a walk through somebody's,
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.880]   you know, day using Google Apps, the phone, the search,
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.720]   the maps, the every, you know, it might just be,
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.120]   like shiny, rosy, Google's your friend,
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.560]   just like Jeff says.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.800]   - Isn't there a risk though, the backlash that,
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.240]   oh, Google's adding everything.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.560]   They got my-- - Yeah.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.720]   - My, they're fingers are in my pocket.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.160]   - We're up your nose.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.000]   - Yeah.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.280]   - What are the chances that Google has something brand new?
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.920]   - No, no, no, no. - No, no, no.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.560]   - We have the thing, it possibly be,
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.520]   it's like a Chrome, well, you know, Chrome ads,
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.880]   because they're really trying to push that
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.160]   on all their various platforms.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.000]   They're trying to push Chrome,
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.200]   they're trying to push the Nexus one.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.240]   - They've been having us more in the UK, I think,
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.800]   Pete, than here.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.360]   You know, we've seen two bads in the UK,
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.800]   I haven't seen anything like that for Chrome here.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.440]   - No, but I would just say those are the two devices
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.360]   that they're really trying to push
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.840]   to a mainstream consumer audience.
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.680]   I would still side with the Nexus one,
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.800]   but that's the only other possibility.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:08.880]   I don't think they do a general one
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.080]   who doesn't know what Google is right now
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.760]   and who doesn't know. - Yeah.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.920]   But most people you ask them Google is--
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.920]   - Google is search, right?
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.800]   - Google apps, Google apps.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.600]   I think people don't, yeah, yeah, that's a thing.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.520]   People know the Google search, but do they know about--
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.360]   - Well, ah!
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.120]   - They knew about Chrome, they know about Android,
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.840]   they know about maps, you know what I mean?
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.400]   - There's a business audience, right, you're right, Gina.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.680]   - And there's a case for them to advertise apps.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:33.640]   They've been pushing apps.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:37.040]   They're open up an app store for apps.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.280]   - So you're on your apps dashboard lately,
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.720]   and to me this is brand new today.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.320]   If you go to the Google apps dashboard you have,
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:49.320]   it now pushes a $50 a year higher level use of them
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.160]   for enterprises and such.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.720]   And go to your, let me see here, you know.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.920]   - I'm just looking at it right now.
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.600]   I'm in my documents, Google docs.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.560]   Oh, you mean apps, I should go to apps.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:06.560]   - But it go to apps and then go to manage this domain.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.120]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.440]   That's the pro version. - That's it?
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.680]   - No, they've done that for a while.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:11.680]   They've been pushing that for a while.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:14.320]   - The look was all different to me today.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:18.480]   Try the premier edition free, create new users and so on,
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.520]   and they're just trying to push a slightly different,
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.040]   I think enterprise view,
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.680]   they're trying to get more enterprises to use it.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.960]   So I guess there's an off chance they could use the money
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.600]   for business now. - They've been buying
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.840]   billboards here in Silicon Valley for at Google apps,
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:36.000]   saying, ask your boss, tell him, you know,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.800]   saying go to the higher ups and say you want Google apps.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.400]   They've been trying to do this grassroots thing.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.120]   - Yeah, it could be the enterprise, right?
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.040]   Because that's not unusual for during the Super Bowl, right?
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.320]   CEOs, why is it possible?
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.760]   - Is the hell frozen over comment merely
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.600]   that Google's buying an ad?
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.440]   - I think so.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.280]   - Yes.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:58.080]   - How about, okay, what if it's a Google Wave ad?
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.480]   - It's definitely not gonna be like--
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.640]   (laughing)
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:02.720]   - It is not gonna be a way--
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.280]   - I've inadvertently converted this to a comedy hour.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.520]   Okay, you're having a guess.
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.840]   - Be on the future and you don't understand it.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.160]   Only Gina does.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.520]   - Maybe it's an ad for Gina Trapani.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.880]   Look, we know you don't like Wave,
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.040]   we don't understand Wave's.
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.520]   Read Gina's book, then it'll all make sense.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.360]   - Well, those of you who--
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.240]   - It'll be like an ad for Photoshop.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.240]   - I told you that I talked to Nick Denton
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:25.640]   and told him that he had to talk to Gina about Wave
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.240]   and understand how important it was.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.440]   And Gina said that you talked to him.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:34.560]   - Yeah, I mentioned that Adam and I wrote the book on Wave
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.120]   and he looked at me.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.360]   (laughing)
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:41.200]   - Not fun, plus with the blank look, a blank stare.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.440]   - Yeah, and then I continued.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.160]   I was making another point about publishing
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.600]   in the Wiki format versus the Glog format.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:49.840]   We were having the old reverse chronological order,
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.120]   the bad parts of that and the good parts of that
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.480]   conversation and I was saying,
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.400]   well, if you want the early document,
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.600]   an evolving product, when it comes to software,
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.920]   you wanna do it in a format that's more like
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.360]   Wikipedia versus the reverse crime.
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.280]   - Okay, but wait a minute.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.040]   What if they tell everybody watching the Super Bowl
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.720]   to do the Wave?
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.800]   (laughing)
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.400]   - That counts, that counts.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.680]   - That might work.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.120]   - The whole line is off its axis.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.360]   - All right, sports fans.
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.520]   We're gonna take a moment in between plays
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:22.080]   to do the Google Wave, everybody now.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.120]   - No, I don't think that'll work.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:27.000]   More than two million businesses were in Google Apps.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.760]   That was more, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.520]   So they're trying to make money on this.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.040]   They sell at 50 bucks a seat.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:38.320]   - And they're talking about opening an app store for apps.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:42.680]   So developers can make app specifics.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.160]   So they're basically gonna make a store
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.160]   that runs on our web application.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.560]   - This is kind of a different, this is different.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.960]   No one has done this before, right?
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:48.880]   - I think we've hit on it.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.680]   I think this is what it's for.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.520]   - Yeah, so--
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.360]   - That's the only thing I could think of
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.640]   that they'd wanna spend that much money on.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.080]   - Except for besides the Nexus One.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.080]   - I can't imagine them.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.600]   I think they realized the Nexus One is a loss leader
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.840]   and it's really more of a reference platform
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.600]   than the future of Android.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.200]   - It does seem late for them to be doing this
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.400]   than Nexus One at this point.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.240]   - Well, this is gonna be this point.
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.400]   I'm looking up here.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:14.640]   Forbes says that Google's doing something with Kia
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.800]   for its Super Bowl ad.
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:16.720]   - Oh.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.560]   How's it?
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.400]   - Kia.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.240]   - Kia.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.240]   - It's a couple of ways where you have mostly with Kia
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.520]   and all the Super Bowl sponsors,
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.880]   Alfred and Exposure Beyond TV.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.840]   The marketers that are paying 2.8 million.
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.440]   - Now Kia has done an interesting thing.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:33.800]   They are the second company to introduce Microsoft Auto,
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.960]   this software behind Ford Sync.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.520]   They're doing a very similar product to Sync
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.080]   using Microsoft Auto.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.120]   Wouldn't it be interesting if Google had won 'em over
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.720]   and got 'em to use Android instead?
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.560]   Android Mobile?
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.400]   - Oh.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.360]   - That would be a very interesting product.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.320]   - Well, you know, I was gonna ask you about this, Leo,
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:06:00.000]   'cause my, we have one Prius in the house
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.200]   and the brake problem is evidently a software problem.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:07.280]   If you had a truly networked car,
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.080]   we should be able to get a download to that car
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.040]   like I can to my Android phone, shouldn't I?
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:11.880]   - Yeah.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.560]   - Yeah.
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.320]   - Clicked by Rod indeed.
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.320]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.960]   - So you think they would announce a product like that
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.360]   during a Super Bowl commercial, I suppose?
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.200]   - No, no.
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.640]   - That seems like that would have happened in CES, right?
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.040]   - Well, I don't know.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.040]   - Oh, John Battelle says it's a brand, hang on.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.920]   - Yeah, we're all searching this over.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:37.920]   - And John Battelle says it's a brand campaign.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.960]   It's not selling anything here other than its own brand.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.800]   - Huh?
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:44.760]   - So we're gonna be just Google.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:45.600]   - It's Google.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:46.840]   - It's more than search.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.520]   Google is 10,000 people working hard to make.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.680]   - This even in that, if you go to
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.840]   John Battelle's search blog at tellmedia.com,
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:57.520]   he says it's gonna be this ad which is called
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.440]   Parisian Love.
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.280]   - Oh.
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.120]   - It's just a brand ad.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.320]   - He spoiled it for us all.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.160]   - Well, he's got it.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.440]   - Well, he does have good sources at Google though,
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.280]   I believe in them.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.520]   - Wow.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:09.280]   All right, here it is, it's on YouTube.
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.960]   - Now this looks kind of interesting.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.520]   - So it is a search ad.
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.800]   - Apparently it's a search ad,
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.800]   which you would think Google doesn't need to do.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.800]   Here we go, this is--
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.800]   - Do you mean Louvre?
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:25.440]   - Study abroad, Paris, France, click.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.880]   Cafes near, boom.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.400]   - I think it's funny that they're doing French
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.720]   since the French can't stand up.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.680]   - Translate to a trimminon.
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:38.040]   You're very cute, impressive French girl.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.160]   - I think that chocolate shops Paris.
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.160]   - They can't--
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.080]   - What are you really gonna run that during the Super Bowl?
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.840]   - I hope not, who is Truffog?
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.200]   - That's not exactly very touched on--
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.840]   - Beefy, there's hate France.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:51.680]   - Yeah.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.440]   - This is just gonna piss people off.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.800]   It's a Google, if you like France, you'll love Google.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.600]   No, that's wrong, that's just wrong.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.160]   Churches in Paris.
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.520]   - Jeez, he needs to wreck her monkeys.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.960]   - How to assemble a crib.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.800]   Ah.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.480]   - Oh, this is so-- - It's a cute ad,
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.560]   but I can't, that's not the--
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:12.400]   - That's it.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.080]   - It's cute ad, that's interesting.
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.880]   Yeah, I mean, it does feature a lot of things
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:18.640]   about the circus that a lot of people don't know how to do.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.280]   - All American thing.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.640]   - The last thing they're gonna do is,
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:24.160]   now, so there's other ones in this series,
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.120]   so I'm not sure this is the one called Newbie.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:29.240]   - What's interesting is that John wrote this before.
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:30.080]   - Yeah, right.
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.360]   - These are some other ads,
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.000]   and notice the dates on these searches are like 2008.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.760]   This is an old ad campaign.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.320]   - We got this part of the natural.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:41.920]   - Boy, France would be a huge mistake.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.880]   - Don't do sissy French stuff on some of them all,
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.000]   I'm sorry, you just don't.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.560]   - This one's also a little more lively
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.400]   in terms of the music.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:49.400]   This one is all social media,
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.800]   tips for going viral, they search Facebook.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.520]   - The tell's practically trying to take credit
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.960]   for Schmidt's tweet, which I think is probably a little much.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:58.960]   - These are old ads.
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.560]   Apparently, I'm told by the chatroom,
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.920]   which knows all these are,
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.400]   have been on Hulu before.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:09.760]   So nothing there, it's all smoke.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.600]   - So we all think Nexus One or apps?
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.880]   - I think we're in agreement apps.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.720]   - Okay.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.840]   - Apps, show of hands.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:19.680]   Pete, Pete, Pete's not good.
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.840]   - I see the point on apps like...
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.320]   - How about Nexus One's got a bit more broad reach,
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:27.440]   but I guess Apple's got to pass off the cost for you.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:28.400]   - Tell you boss.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.600]   - How about the machines became aware?
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.960]   February 7th, 2010.
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:38.600]   Skynet, new from Google.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.440]   - What do you think?
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.640]   - He could do, he could do to Steve Jobs,
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.120]   what Steve Jobs did to Bill Gates
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.940]   and do a new big brother commercial.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:51.760]   - Apple was the new big brother,
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:52.600]   controlling everything.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.920]   - Oh man, then then, oh my God.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.720]   I mean, then shooting war,
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:59.160]   then nuke, we go nuke, that's the nuclear option.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:02.120]   That's mutually assured destruction.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.440]   - I love it.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.280]   - I love it.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.120]   - I want it, I want it.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.920]   - I don't think people never mentions their competitors,
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.640]   though, I don't imagine them doing an ad
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.600]   that addresses their competitors.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:12.960]   I don't know, I'd be surprised.
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.760]   - I love the idea of it.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.080]   - Oh yeah, why Bing sucks and Apple is...
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.840]   - Well, why Apple is the new big brother?
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:21.680]   - Yeah.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:22.920]   - They're the control freaks we're not.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.960]   - What if they did, oh, what if they did a 1984 commercial?
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.800]   - That's what I'm saying.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.240]   - Oh, you mean like the...
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.080]   - Yeah.
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:30.400]   - And it's Steve Jobs up there.
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.240]   - Yeah.
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.500]   (laughing)
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:36.020]   - Oh, they better do that.
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:37.900]   - Oh, this has happened before,
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.180]   and all this will happen again.
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:40.100]   - Up here.
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:42.260]   - That would be, you know what?
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:44.540]   They would win a lot of fans if they could.
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:45.820]   - It goes back to what we're saying before,
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:48.220]   Apple has become the new control freak company.
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:49.780]   - Have Steve Jobs going...
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:50.620]   - On Microsoft.
[01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:53.740]   - And then somebody with a Google shirt comes
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:55.820]   and throws a hammer through it.
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:57.220]   - Oh, it looks like Bear.
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.700]   - I'm getting chills, yeah.
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:10:59.820]   Bear, our sysadmin.
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:02.900]   What would just have to list all the apps
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:03.980]   that have been rejected?
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:05.100]   - There you go.
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:05.940]   - There you go.
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.100]   - Things you can't do elsewhere.
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.980]   - These apps will never be heard on the iPhone.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:13.460]   They're not apps for you to you.
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:16.580]   - Never speak the word and drive.
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:20.980]   - On 19, that would be awesome.
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.260]   - That would be kind of awesome.
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:24.260]   - I would be so.
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:25.860]   - Why 2010 won't be--
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:27.700]   - I might just watch this the third quarter
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:28.540]   of the Super Bowl now.
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.900]   - 1984, we're not gonna have anybody watching Twitter tomorrow.
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:32.700]   They're all gonna be watching that.
[01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:35.220]   - All right, let's see.
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:40.820]   I think we've done enough damage for the day.
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:42.980]   Let's get to our--
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:44.460]   - Totally all wanna plug one thing.
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.180]   - Plug some plug away, Mr. J.
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:47.500]   - Mr. J.
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.620]   - When I was in Davos at the Google party,
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:53.980]   I did the flip camera dance with none less than Tim Berners Lee.
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:55.260]   - Oh, wow.
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:58.340]   - And so we were both doing our flips at each other.
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:11:59.180]   - Oh, that's great.
[01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:01.540]   - Kinda wacky, but to do that with him of all people,
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:03.780]   just it was my celebrity moment.
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:05.300]   - The inventor of the World Wide Web.
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:06.140]   Where is that?
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:06.980]   - I'm very careful to say, yes,
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:07.940]   he's inventor of the World Wide Web,
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:09.340]   not the creator of the internet,
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:12.180]   or of the web, the inventor of the web.
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:17.260]   - The inventor of the HTML and World Wide Web protocols.
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:19.540]   Actually, I don't even know if you can give HTML credit.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:20.940]   Inventor of HTTP.
[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:23.020]   So is that video on your blog?
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:24.980]   - I put it up on the delicious.
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:26.060]   And the other while I'm plugging,
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:27.340]   the other thing I wanna plug is today
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.780]   is Sun Jake Jarvis's 18th birthday.
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:30.780]   - Happy birthday, Jake.
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.620]   - Jake.
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:32.460]   - Jake.
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:33.900]   - Yay, Jake.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:34.740]   - Yay.
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:35.500]   - Yay.
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:36.820]   - We were talking about him the other day,
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:39.380]   we were trying to think of who.
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:41.700]   We were thinking of doing a Facebook show,
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:43.700]   kind of like we do a Google show.
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:46.220]   And we thought, well, who do we have represent app developers?
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:48.460]   And I said, well, Jake, of course.
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:49.300]   - Yeah.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:50.140]   - Be good.
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:51.540]   Be the first father-son team.
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:56.300]   And by the way, there is a daring fireball
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:59.380]   with comments.net that has daring fireball with comments.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:00.220]   - I still have that.
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:05.220]   - That was a good
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:07.260]   - Nothing safe on the web, nothing sacred.
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:11.940]   Tip of the week, Ms. Tripani.
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:13.780]   - Yes, this is a really simple one.
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:16.660]   And it's for people who have filled out their Google profile
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:18.980]   and search Google when they're signed in,
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:21.940]   scroll to the bottom of your search results.
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:24.340]   There's a new module, which it's new to me.
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:25.660]   I don't know, actually, Pete probably knows
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:26.740]   when it rolled out more specifically.
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:27.860]   - No, it was new to me as well.
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:29.380]   I saw it yesterday, popped up.
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:32.540]   - Yeah, it's the header is results from people
[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:34.260]   in your social circle, right?
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:37.220]   So today I did a search for Caprica.
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:38.740]   And if I scroll to the bottom of the page,
[01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:41.380]   I see tweets from people I follow.
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:44.580]   And Google knows this because I've entered my Twitter feed
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:49.460]   on my Google profile blog posts from contacts, Google contacts,
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:51.580]   about Caprica in the list.
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:54.300]   And the results are okay, but it's pretty interesting.
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.340]   I mean, it really feels like, whoa,
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:57.900]   how does Google know that I know these people?
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.100]   But they're connecting.
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:00.940]   I mean, Google has indexed all the people
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.260]   that you follow on Twitter.
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:03.660]   - But it starts with your friends.
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:04.540]   - It starts with your profile.
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.380]   You have to have a Google profile to start.
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.020]   - You have to have a Google profile filled out.
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:10.420]   And the more information you have there,
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:11.260]   obviously the better.
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.660]   If you list your blog, you list your Twitter,
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:16.140]   that kind of thing, Google will figure out
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:19.180]   who your contacts are on those other services.
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:21.220]   So-- - This is really cool.
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:22.340]   - Scroll to the bottom of your page,
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:24.140]   results from people in your social circle.
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:25.620]   It's in beta.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:27.180]   And there's a couple other smaller links,
[01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:28.780]   my social circle and my social.
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.180]   So you can see what people at Google know
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.700]   as you're connected with.
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:34.540]   - Dave Weiner wrote a blog post about this,
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:37.780]   called it the two-way web, the two-way search.
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:42.060]   And Heath seems to think that this--
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:43.380]   - It's very positive. - Yeah.
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:44.740]   This is a huge step forward.
[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:48.180]   Others, in the comments, say,
[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:49.980]   "I don't know."
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:51.820]   I mean, that's kind of intrusive, isn't it?
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:55.020]   But, I mean, this is what--
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.060]   - Well, this is the way the web's going.
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:57.300]   I mean, what's Google supposed to do
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:59.500]   if social search is the next big thing,
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.220]   if everyone else is looking for recommendations
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:05.220]   on Facebook or Twitter for everything.
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.580]   Google's got to get into this space.
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:08.820]   I find it interesting that they're doing it
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:12.180]   by adding more and more stuff to search.
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:14.100]   And I wonder if there might be a smarter interface
[01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:16.100]   that can kind of innovate around instead of just keep
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:18.660]   adding more and more stuff into my search interface.
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:20.140]   - Well, at least it keeps us.
[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:21.620]   - I've got real-time streaming tweets,
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:23.540]   and I've got images, videos,
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:24.540]   and then I've got at the bottom here,
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:25.460]   I've got social search.
[01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:28.820]   It's just like all these extra pieces I want different views.
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:30.300]   - But I think at some point they play with them
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:32.140]   and see what they do, and then they'll come in together.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:33.820]   Like, Google News was around for a long time
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:35.660]   over the added it to universal search.
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:38.500]   I think you're right, Pete,
[01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:40.420]   but I think at some point they just want to play with it
[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:42.460]   in isolation, and then they'll start to bring the scene.
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:44.460]   And I'll already, together, in which case,
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:46.660]   there's no universal search anymore.
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:48.220]   Your search is different from my search.
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:50.460]   - Dave's, that's an interesting point too.
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:51.300]   Dave points that out.
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:52.540]   - It's been that way for a while though, hasn't it?
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:54.180]   I mean, even if you log out of Google,
[01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:57.700]   they still look at your IP and customize your search.
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:59.020]   You can't actually get away from it,
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.300]   'cause I would love to see what,
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.660]   you know, that was a great way of checking your search results
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:05.540]   before we log out of Google, see whatever analysis is seeing.
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.900]   It's becoming harder and harder to do that.
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:10.220]   - Why not just-- - I've gotta go ahead.
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:11.860]   I've got a question for you, Gina.
[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:14.260]   - Yes. - So I use two Google accounts.
[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:17.700]   I use iMap of my Buzz Machine Address,
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:18.980]   and I use Gmail.
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:20.420]   That's the main one I use.
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:22.660]   So my Google address there is my Gmail,
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:24.540]   is my Buzz Machine Address,
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:27.100]   and then I use another one for my university stuff.
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.020]   So Google keeps on thinking that my account,
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:31.100]   my Google account is my university address,
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:34.020]   but in fact, my main one is my apps address.
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.140]   - Uh-huh. - How do I get my app,
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:36.660]   Google to understand that my apps address
[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:38.380]   is my Google account?
[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:40.620]   - In what context, in the Gmail application?
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:41.820]   - I'm just getting this context, and profiles
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:42.660]   and other things.
[01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:43.740]   I can't sign in. - Isn't it just
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:44.700]   whatever you're logged in?
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:45.940]   Oh, you can't sign into that account.
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:47.900]   - I can't sign in using my--
[01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:48.900]   - Oh, I see.
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:49.940]   Yeah, your apps account,
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:51.500]   you can't sign in with your apps account
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.420]   every Google service.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:54.900]   And it's really annoying.
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:57.140]   And it's actually a problem that I have as well.
[01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:59.900]   I have an apps account and then a vanilla Gmail account.
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:02.260]   And in fact, Google Voice doesn't work with apps,
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:04.740]   so I actually have to maintain my contacts list
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:06.820]   on my vanilla Gmail account.
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:09.460]   Yeah, it's not-- - That's dumb.
[01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:11.140]   - It's not a-- it's dumb.
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:15.180]   It's dumb, and they really need to give full support
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:17.100]   to apps users.
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:18.500]   So yeah, I mean, the way I solve the problem
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:19.420]   is probably the worst.
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:20.420]   It's the worst solution ever,
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.100]   as I just maintain my--
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:24.540]   I maintain a separate contacts list of my Gmail account,
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:28.020]   my regular Gmail account, anyway, just to use voice.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.700]   And so my social--
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:32.140]   you know, if you click on your social circle,
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:33.420]   mine is very well filled in
[01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:34.700]   because I keep that list updated.
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:36.020]   But yeah, no, it sucks.
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.540]   For people who are just app users,
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:40.700]   you really have to maintain like a regular Gmail account,
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:43.740]   which is not gonna get people to move to apps.
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:44.900]   - Move apps, no. - Google is not a fake--
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:45.580]   - No, it's a problem for my--
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:46.380]   - Even-- even--
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:48.140]   hooking up my Nexus One.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:49.180]   - Yeah. - You know,
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:50.660]   I wanna use my apps account,
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:53.220]   but I had to use my other Gmail account.
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:55.140]   - Well, you can sign into the Nexus One.
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:56.460]   You can sign into Android,
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:57.580]   like the initial sign in,
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:58.420]   when you set up the phone,
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:17:59.260]   or you can't just-- - Yeah, it's fine,
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.100]   they got that. - Yeah,
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:01.580]   that you can sign initially,
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:05.900]   but for other things like gallery and voice,
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:08.500]   you have to sign in with your regular Gmail account.
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:11.740]   - Can you not merge them by adding the apps somehow
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:12.900]   to your main account?
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:14.700]   I mean, it seems like you could merge.
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:16.900]   - Well, I mean, some things just don't exist on the app side.
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:19.100]   Like Picasso Web, as far as I understand,
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:20.740]   Picasso Web albums,
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:22.980]   that isn't available for your apps account.
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:24.220]   Like your Google account-- - But can't you merge
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:27.060]   your apps account into your Google account somehow?
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:27.900]   Somehow indicate-- - Yeah, I mean,
[01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:31.260]   I took my contacts and I exported them out of my apps account
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:33.180]   and imported them into my Gmail account,
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:34.140]   which had gotten out of date.
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:36.940]   So yeah, you can, but there's this constant like,
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:38.540]   you know, all I have to use-- - It's the opposite, you know.
[01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:40.620]   My apps account is my main account.
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:42.460]   - Yeah. - I'd rather merge my Gmail
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:45.380]   into my Google account into my apps account.
[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:48.620]   I'm just thinking that if you made your apps email address
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:51.500]   be one of your official addresses on Google,
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.100]   on your Google account,
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:57.940]   wouldn't that do the job of merging the data?
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:01.500]   - But if I wanna sign in with a Google account,
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.420]   I can't use my apps address to do so.
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:05.140]   - So I guess that's the question is,
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:08.300]   why doesn't Google, knowing that you have this account,
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.140]   this account, this account,
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:11.380]   all associated with one Google account,
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:13.620]   why doesn't Google take that social graph
[01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:15.060]   from all those accounts?
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:16.500]   - Right. - Or maybe it does, though.
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:17.980]   Do we know that it doesn't?
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:20.260]   - Sometimes you can sign in with your Google apps
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:21.820]   full email and domain,
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:24.660]   and sometimes it says, what is your username at Gmail?
[01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:26.020]   So you have to use your Gmail account.
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.460]   It depends on the context.
[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:28.300]   It's a problem.
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:29.140]   It's a problem.
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:30.060]   - Do you really have knowledge
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:33.140]   that we all have multiple Google accounts?
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:35.540]   - Well, I mean, they just recently on Android did, right?
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:38.580]   Like there's, just recently there's multiple account support
[01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:39.420]   in Android. - Wow.
[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:40.460]   - It used to be that it was just, you know,
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:42.180]   that it was just a single,
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:43.820]   meaning that you can get like your Gmail
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:47.100]   from different accounts, you know, in the Gmail app.
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:48.820]   So yeah, you can do that.
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.660]   If in the Gmail app, if you just go into settings,
[01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:52.340]   you can sign in with a couple of different Gmail accounts,
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:53.340]   which is handy.
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:55.580]   So I have my Gmail account and my apps account.
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:57.140]   - But I didn't mean to derail this,
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:58.480]   but I needed to make you-- - No, this is something
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:00.380]   a lot of people are actually-- - That's really awesome, yeah.
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:01.220]   - Thinking about.
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:03.220]   So I think it's a good subject.
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:05.780]   I just don't, see, I have all my email addresses
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:09.580]   are verified with my main Google account.
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:11.820]   - Sure. - But like, so, but,
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.580]   Leah, you have like a Gmail account,
[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:14.900]   like a Google account that you sign in,
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:16.780]   that's your like, Leo a Gmail,
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:18.620]   and then you associate your other addresses with it.
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:19.460]   - Yes.
[01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:20.860]   - But that's, but all the data associated
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:23.460]   with that Google account, your contacts and all that,
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:26.060]   that's in that Google account, you know what I mean?
[01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:27.740]   So when we sign in with our Google apps account,
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:28.820]   that's a separate Google account.
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:31.300]   - And it doesn't, so it doesn't, okay.
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:32.380]   So you want-- - Yeah.
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:35.140]   - So the question is, do you want them to all have merged,
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:36.620]   or do you want the granularity of saying,
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:38.100]   I'm gonna be on the Google apps account today,
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:39.700]   I'm gonna be on the other account today,
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:41.620]   the Gmail account today.
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:43.900]   - Well for me, I just want to sign in with my Google apps account.
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:45.020]   - I have to know everything.
[01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:46.860]   - And I want gallery, I want voice,
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.340]   I want everything, but not every app
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:49.660]   supports Google apps account.
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:52.340]   So like, cost of web outlets and voice,
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:54.540]   don't, you can't sign in with your apps account.
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:56.140]   - They run, they want a Gmail account.
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:58.060]   - They, you have to have a Gmail account to use those.
[01:20:58.060 --> 01:20:59.020]   - You have to have a Gmail address, yeah.
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.500]   - I didn't know that, okay.
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.780]   Well, yeah, that's bad.
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:03.500]   - Thank you. - Yeah, unless I'm wrong,
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.540]   but I've poked around, I've heard from people email me
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:07.980]   and say, you know, apps is great,
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:09.820]   but I have this problem,
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:11.660]   just like the problem that Jeff brought up.
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:14.860]   So yeah, I maintain basically two accounts.
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:16.620]   - Yeah, I mean, I have multiple Gmail accounts.
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:18.660]   I don't have an apps account.
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:19.740]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:20.980]   - You should try the apps account.
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:21.820]   - I will. - I should.
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:22.660]   - I do.
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:24.340]   - Especially as they're doing all this new stuff.
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:25.180]   I think you're gonna wanna know.
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.980]   - Bear, my, my Sis admin Bear tells me
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:28.060]   I have an apps account.
[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:30.020]   (laughing)
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:30.860]   Who knew?
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:34.620]   Well, I'll just have to try logging into it.
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:38.900]   Tip, so was that your tip?
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:40.500]   - So the tip was, yeah, scroll down and check out
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.580]   the results from your social circle.
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:43.340]   - That's right, oh God, we got so derailed.
[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:44.700]   Okay, yeah.
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:45.580]   I remember that now.
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:48.020]   Your social graph is now part of Google search results.
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:49.380]   - Yeah, and if you get freaked out,
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:51.580]   like how does Google know that I know these people,
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:54.780]   click on the my social circle link and it will say,
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.340]   like we know this person through your Google contacts,
[01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:58.900]   we know you know this person through friend feed,
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:00.180]   we know you know this person through Twitter.
[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:03.500]   Like it's pretty open about how it has associated
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:04.820]   the connection, so you don't have to feel like--
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:06.340]   - Facebook is there too?
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:09.860]   Just friend feed and Twitter from what I can see.
[01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:11.460]   - Let me ask you this, Gina, 'cause you know,
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.220]   on my Google profile it says,
[01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:14.980]   add an alternate email address to your account.
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:16.700]   You can use alternate email addresses
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:18.860]   to sign into your Google account.
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:21.500]   And so I have all of these addresses verified
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:25.580]   and I can sign into the same Google account with all of them.
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:27.780]   That can't be your apps.
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:29.300]   - Oh, I see.
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:30.980]   So when you sign in your Google account,
[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:35.140]   you can use a non-gmail address?
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:35.980]   - Yeah.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:38.300]   - So this is, alternate email addresses
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:40.380]   can only be associated with one Google account at a time.
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:43.700]   So my main Google account has, you know,
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:46.540]   is LaportaGmail.com, but then all of these other addresses
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.940]   that I use are associated with it.
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:49.780]   - Right, right.
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:51.340]   - Where do you get that, Leo?
[01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:55.460]   - That's just in your user account settings.
[01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:56.380]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:57.980]   - But I don't know if that gives you the result you want.
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:22:59.060]   I'm just not, that's--
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:00.780]   - I'm not sure it does, like it's gonna reverse.
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:02.180]   We'll try it next week.
[01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:03.380]   - Give it a shot.
[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:05.020]   - Yeah, I'm gonna look into this little more,
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:06.260]   'cause I've been hearing from listeners
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:08.460]   about this asking about this as well.
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:11.780]   So yeah, I'll see if there's a solution
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:13.100]   or if you can do that.
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:15.060]   But if you associate your Google Apps account
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:15.980]   with your Gmail account,
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:17.420]   you kind of have some recursion going on.
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:18.260]   Like I don't know if--
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:19.100]   - Well, I wonder, are they smart enough?
[01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:22.620]   - They might say like, hey, this is a Google account already.
[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:23.900]   I'll check it out, I'll look into it.
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:27.500]   - So what's my apps account address?
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:28.980]   - Do you know?
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:30.620]   How do you know about my apps account?
[01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:32.460]   - We created one as a test
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:33.940]   and ran into all these problems also,
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:35.780]   so we haven't exposed it to you.
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:38.180]   - I suppose for now it's useless for you.
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:39.020]   - So there you go.
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:40.820]   So you're confirming what we're saying,
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:41.740]   which is it doesn't work.
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:44.260]   - And the problem is it's a Google Apps
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:46.620]   is in a different authority domain
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:48.140]   inside the Google system.
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:48.980]   - I see.
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:49.820]   - And they don't cross over.
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:50.660]   - There's your problem.
[01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:51.500]   - Right.
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:52.340]   - So there's a fire in the Chinese line.
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:53.420]   - They have a signal for people who use apps regularly,
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:55.460]   but not for the consumer Gmail.
[01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:57.580]   - Okay, you're confirming then what we've said.
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:59.460]   - I like that you have your own nurse ratchet there.
[01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:00.300]   - I know.
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:02.500]   - He just sits here all the time.
[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:03.340]   - Ready for this, Leo.
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:04.180]   - Anytime I need him.
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:06.700]   - He's shielding you from the difficulties.
[01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:07.820]   - We decided not to inform you.
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:09.340]   - This is how it does that.
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:10.500]   (laughing)
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:11.380]   - We created an account,
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.820]   but we decided not to inform you.
[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:16.180]   We'll let you know when it's safe for you to use.
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:18.580]   This is the kind of service you get
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:19.620]   when you're present under the internet.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:20.700]   I just want you to know.
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:23.140]   (laughing)
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:25.060]   Jeff, your number of the weeks.
[01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:26.860]   - Number of the week is simple,
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:29.860]   but Google is awarding $5.7 million
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:31.820]   in Google-focused research awards.
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:34.540]   They've had more than 150 fellowship awards out there,
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:36.660]   but this is, they've seen a bigger deal
[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:38.900]   and they've put them out in four areas,
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:42.300]   machine learning, one, two, use of mobile phones
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:44.020]   as data collection devices for public health
[01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:45.940]   and environment monitoring,
[01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:48.220]   three energy efficiency of computing,
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:49.340]   none of these terribly surprising.
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:51.740]   Before I was amused by this is privacy.
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:54.380]   - Good.
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:56.860]   They should put money into that.
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:00.900]   - I also like that it's kind of the Bell Labs of the future.
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:04.660]   It's a virtual Bell Labs, huh?
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:06.020]   - Not quite pure research.
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:07.780]   In this case, it is focused on things that help Google,
[01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:09.660]   but more research is good.
[01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:12.340]   And I think Google is gonna end up supporting Google
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:13.780]   and companies like that are gonna support research
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:16.780]   as much as universities going forward.
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:17.620]   - Yes.
[01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:22.900]   So I had a lot of different possible applications for me,
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:24.580]   but I think since we started talking about it,
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:26.420]   I will focus on this one.
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:30.540]   Let me change cameras here so that you can see what I'm about
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:31.500]   to show you.
[01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:35.820]   Sign that to there.
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:36.660]   Okay.
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:37.500]   - So this is my,
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:40.340]   and I'm not gonna do what Cyanogen did
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.300]   and show you my pattern.
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:43.620]   Okay, now we got it.
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:46.460]   So a couple of different things on the phone.
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:48.740]   Of course, there's a new Maps application.
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:52.660]   And I think they updated it today to a 3.4
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:56.180]   and it has some new layers that you can put on there.
[01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:58.660]   I went to Labs to turn on some of these buttons.
[01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:00.180]   There's a Labs layer.
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:03.820]   But there is a search layer on there.
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:07.500]   So apparently this is from common searches in this area.
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:10.420]   I was kind of shocked when I saw that the search layer
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:13.340]   on mine is for the term mature sex.
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:16.580]   And I have to tell you,
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:18.740]   this is not something I ever searched for.
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.700]   And apparently I'm finding St. Paul's Episcopal Church.
[01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:24.260]   That's one of the results.
[01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:26.620]   So I don't know what happened here,
[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:28.740]   but seriously, this is nothing I did,
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:30.700]   but it's just a new feature.
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:32.060]   Really, honey?
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:34.580]   I want you guys, would you get the new map and tell me
[01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:36.940]   if this is the personalized search?
[01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:41.380]   It's apparently common searches in your area.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:43.100]   And I'm just curious what you're getting,
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:45.380]   'cause I've taken this a little bit personal.
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:48.100]   And there's also a terrain and a traffic.
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:50.660]   And you said, Gina, you really like the new traffic layer.
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:52.060]   That's just really handy to be able to see.
[01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:54.020]   I'm not getting trained or those kinds of things.
[01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:56.020]   Ah, you have to turn that on in the Labs.
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:56.860]   Ah, thank you.
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:58.180]   Yes.
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:00.380]   But so the new maps has some very nice features
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:01.300]   you might want to take a look at.
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:04.940]   And the Labs stuff is available somewhere in the settings.
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:07.820]   - More under the more menu.
[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:09.500]   - Under the more, of course, under the more menu.
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.380]   - A whole new world, Easter egg.
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:14.180]   - Yep, scale bar, which is nice.
[01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:18.940]   Terrain layer, which shows you topography, vegetation,
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:22.820]   elevation, popular categories, the layer button,
[01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:25.820]   a compass arrow to show you which way you're headed.
[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:27.440]   Traffic with labels.
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.520]   - Turn them all on.
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:32.240]   - Bubble buttons is great because if you click on a business,
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.440]   you can actually get directions and a phone number
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.560]   right from the map.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.720]   Distance and heading, it's got a little measure tool.
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:41.520]   But the search layer, I think, is turned on
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.360]   just automatically.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.360]   I think that's part of the new thing.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.040]   And then Gina, you mentioned a new music application.
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.880]   I don't know if this is the one you were thinking of,
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:49.840]   but this is one I've been using.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.240]   It's called TuneWicky.
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:53.000]   - Ah.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:53.840]   - I love TuneWicky.
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.320]   So first of all, it has a great little widget,
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.640]   but one of the things that's cool about TuneWicky
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.760]   is it looks up information about the song
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.880]   as you're playing it, including lyrics,
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:04.720]   which it will play in many cases,
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:07.520]   in synchronous with the music.
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.360]   - That's sweet.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:12.520]   - It's a really cool user-generated information.
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:15.560]   It is, I guess, on the web as a wiki.
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:18.520]   And it's a player, it plays video, it plays music.
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:22.120]   If your list has radio internet radio stations,
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:26.640]   Shout Cast, Last FM, and if you are listening to a song,
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:28.120]   you can press the music button,
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.600]   or rather the video button,
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:32.400]   and it will find a video of it on YouTube as well.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:33.640]   So a lot of nice features.
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:35.880]   This is a really cool little player.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:39.720]   And this is why I really enjoy the openness
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:41.160]   of the Android platform,
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:42.560]   because you can get some really interesting.
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:43.840]   You know, Apple would never let this on,
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.920]   'cause it supposedly duplicates a function
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:50.200]   of Apple's own making,
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:53.040]   but the iPod player doesn't do anything like this.
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.240]   So here I'm watching,
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.600]   I'm listening to a Joni Mitchell song,
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:58.400]   and it's playing the lyrics as I listen to it,
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.320]   which is really cool.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.160]   So that's-
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:02.000]   - Yeah, that's sweet.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.320]   - Free, tune wiki, got a little ads in it.
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.680]   That's, I guess, why it's free.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:08.680]   - Is there any way, Gina, to get a feed
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:12.200]   of the apps that you and Leo have in a easy way?
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:14.360]   - No, if it had a screenshot.
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.560]   I just want a feed.
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.480]   It's just that darn screenshot.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:20.000]   I could take pictures of it.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.760]   Is there any way we can get a list out?
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:26.400]   - You know, not unless we publish one.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.120]   I've always felt like there needs to be,
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:30.040]   or there has to be a site where you could just be like,
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:33.840]   I use this kind of like GGT, you know, but for software.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.360]   Like these are the things I'm currently using.
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:36.360]   - Well, there is, I use this,
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.800]   and there is an iPhone such a thing,
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.960]   but maybe somebody needs to create one for Android.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:43.280]   And if you know of one, email me.
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:46.440]   - Is it, I use this.com or?
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:50.920]   - Yeah, they may have an Android section on it.
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:53.240]   - That might be a good way to say, you know.
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.640]   - Somebody's made a liar of me,
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:56.320]   they say, "Tune Wiki is on the iPhone."
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.920]   I don't think that's possible.
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:59.760]   It's in the App Store.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.720]   Oh, well, there you go.
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:04.920]   Little did I know, so that's, there's a double tip there.
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:06.000]   You can get a little fun.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.680]   And you've seen the Layer browser, of course.
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:10.280]   You know, I was really surprised.
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:13.840]   I think it was a Davos that Marissa Meyer
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.040]   was talking about, Layer, and Eric Schmidt
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:16.160]   had never heard of it.
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.640]   - That's what I was telling was in my eyes,
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:18.480]   when I was there, yeah.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.760]   - I was shocked.
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:21.080]   So. - The other moment was,
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:23.720]   Eric Mar my phone that he made me download
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:26.520]   the Skymap thing so he could demonstrate it on my phone.
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:27.920]   - 'Cause he didn't have it?
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:28.760]   - Yeah.
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:29.960]   - Skymap's awesome, that's free.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:33.560]   As is Layer, Layer is a augmented reality browser.
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.400]   You know.
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:36.040]   - And imagine that would be a fantastic acquisition
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.480]   for Google to put over.
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:38.760]   - Oh yeah.
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:41.680]   - Google Maps, Google Street View, all that stuff.
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.080]   - Well, if Eric Schmidt knew about it,
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.440]   maybe they could buy it.
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:45.960]   - Well, he does now.
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:47.640]   (laughing)
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:48.480]   - He does now.
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:49.320]   No, that's fantastic.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:51.160]   And that's almost futuristic, that stuff.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:53.760]   It's like, how is this here already?
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:54.600]   - Right.
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:55.760]   It's so cool.
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:58.080]   So I use this, does have Windows, Mac, and iPhone,
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:59.240]   but they don't have an Android page,
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.040]   so maybe we should talk to them.
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.520]   And Gina, you and I should make a list of apps,
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:05.200]   'cause there's new stuff all the time.
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:08.040]   There's some great games on there.
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:11.360]   There's just some great, you know,
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.840]   great, great applications.
[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:15.280]   The new Twitter client I'm using just came out
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:17.720]   from Handmark I really like is called Tweetcaster.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:20.640]   - Oh yeah, I saw something about that.
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:21.680]   I haven't tried it.
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:23.440]   - It's quite pretty.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:24.280]   - Yeah.
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:27.040]   - And it does seem to have all the functionality
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:30.600]   that the more mature apps on the iPhone side have.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:33.440]   So it's very, and it does what I think is really important,
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:34.640]   which it does notifications,
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:36.880]   and you can say just notify me for direct messages
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:39.160]   or notify me for all mentions,
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.360]   or notify me for all tweets.
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.880]   - Have you switched from Twidroid Pro?
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:47.640]   - Yeah, well I switched from Twidroid Pro to Seismic Briefly,
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:48.920]   and now Seismic's been updated,
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.680]   so I have to try Seismic again.
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:53.560]   And then Handmark said, take a look at Tweetcaster,
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.760]   and I like this a lot.
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.240]   Jeff, you need to go?
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:58.080]   - I think you caught the answer, well yes,
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.720]   I was just-- - Pizza time.
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:02.640]   Pizza time, enough tools, enough tips, enough numbers.
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:05.120]   Pete Cashmore, so glad you could have joined us today.
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:05.960]   We'd love having you on.
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:06.800]   Come back. - That's coming back.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:09.240]   - Yep, Cashmore is of course the creator of Mashable.
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:12.040]   Everybody must, must read Mashable daily.
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:13.080]   - Wonderful, wonderful.
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:14.480]   - You really-- - Mashable.com.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:17.320]   - Yep, of course. - And @mashable on Twitter,
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:19.960]   and facebook.com/mashable.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:23.040]   - Excellent, thank you, Pete, great to see you again.
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:24.400]   - Good to see you. - Yeah.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:28.360]   Jeff Jarvis is the creator of the wonderful Buzz Machine blog
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:29.560]   at buzzmachine.com.
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:32.280]   You can also hear his letter from the states
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.040]   on times, is it times or guardian?
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:36.920]   It's guardian.co.uk.
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:38.480]   - Media.MediaTalkUSA.
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:39.840]   - MediaTalkUSA.
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:42.440]   I always think of Alistair Cook's letter from America.
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.480]   - That's right.
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:44.640]   - That's what I kind of think of you is.
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:45.760]   - A letter from New Jersey.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:49.320]   - Yes, the Alistair Cook of the Guardian.
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:52.160]   Gina Trapani's book is the complete guide
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:55.840]   to Google Wave at completewaveguide.com.
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:57.760]   - But don't buy it right now,
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:00.560]   because I have a new edition coming out in a month.
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.440]   - Watch for the Super Bowl ad.
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.000]   - You're never gonna hear an author say this,
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000]   but I'm gonna be free to offer it.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:05.840]   - No, you're not, that's amazing.
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:06.680]   - You don't find my book right now.
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:07.680]   - Hell has come. - I'm coming out
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:09.000]   with a new edition in just a few weeks.
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.160]   - The next Fugee, now I'm buying it now.
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.760]   Buy it twice, it's five frickin' bucks.
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:15.120]   - Yeah. - Well, yeah, it's six bucks.
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:16.440]   So, you can buy it now. - Six bucks.
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:17.280]   - I'd appreciate it.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.240]   You can buy me a cup of coffee,
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:20.080]   but if you want the newest stuff,
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:21.920]   just wait till March, South by Southwest,
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:23.960]   I'm gonna have brand new and they'll be in print.
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:27.120]   And the two new chapters, chapters nine and 10, are online.
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.520]   You can check them out right now,
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.720]   so you can tell me what I got wrong.
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:33.400]   So please do that, completewaveguide.com.
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.400]   - It's really a must-have.
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:37.000]   You think Wave's gonna take off,
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.920]   or is it kind of all over for Wave?
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:41.640]   - I do think, I wouldn't have written the book
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:43.160]   if I weren't really bullish about it.
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:44.480]   I think that it's gonna get adopted.
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:45.320]   I think it's gonna be,
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:48.120]   I think it's a power tool for power users.
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:50.520]   But yes, I do think it's gonna get adopted
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:53.760]   weighing more mainstream than it is.
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:57.240]   Still, putting her word processor where her mouth is.
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:00.120]   A new edition out soon, but buy the book now,
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:02.120]   and again later.
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:03.240]   So you don't get free updates. - You're a free store.
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:05.520]   - If I buy it now, I don't get updates.
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.880]   - You know, we're looking in a ways that we can do that.
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:10.320]   I'd love to be able to stream updates
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:13.720]   or do upgrade pricing or figure out a way to do that
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.880]   that it doesn't manual.
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:18.200]   So we're kind of trying to work on a workflow
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:19.720]   to do like a software upgrade type thing
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:22.160]   versus a new edition of the book.
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:23.520]   So right now it's kind of up in the air.
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:26.800]   My official public line is, no, you gotta buy the new edition
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.960]   in full, but we're trying to figure out
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:30.920]   if we can work out a deal.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:31.760]   So we'll see.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.080]   That's why I said don't buy it now.
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:34.360]   - It's a technical issue.
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:35.200]   - It's a technical issue.
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:36.040]   We're gonna see how we can do it.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:39.320]   - And this blog is smartawear.org.
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:42.120]   And when do you, can I say where you're starting next?
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:44.160]   - Yes. - When do you start
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.760]   on Fast Company?
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:47.760]   - I started video blogging and--
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:48.800]   - Oh! - Textbook blogging.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:49.640]   - On Fast Company.
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:51.040]   Yeah, there's a little video up.
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:51.880]   It's really cool.
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.000]   It's got this kind of neat animation.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.680]   I talk about managing your email inbox.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:35:00.680]   I believe it's at fastcompany.com/worksmarts, I want to say.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.880]   - Excellent.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.480]   I hope that that's it, 'cause I just said it.
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.320]   - I'm sure it is.
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:10.240]   - Yes, it is.
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:13.280]   Fast Company.com/smartspart.
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:14.320]   Thanks Leo.
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:15.160]   Leo's the man.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:16.840]   He's helping to plug myself.
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:19.280]   - Oh yeah, I'm the king of plug-in.
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.520]   Thanks everybody for joining us.

[01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:39.320]   (upbeat music)
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:41.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:44.480]   (upbeat music)
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:46.480]   You
