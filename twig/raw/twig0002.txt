[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.400]   We couldn't do to it without it.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.640]   It's time for this week in Google
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.920]   to show the covers all things cloud and Google based.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.360]   Once again, we bring together a great panel
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.480]   starting with Gina Tripani of smarterware.org,
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.360]   the creator of Life Hacker and a hacker on her own, right?
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.480]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.000]   Hey, Leo.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.720]   Good afternoon.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.000]   Great to have you back.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.500]   Yep.
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.640]   Great to be here.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.720]   Show was number one this week.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.560]   I'm proud to say.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.120]   And iTunes also here, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.280]   the author of what would Google do for journalists
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.480]   and blogger at buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.480]   What is that shirt that you're showing us, Jeff?
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.840]   It's bought at a Google T-shirt.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.000]   You bought a Google T-shirt.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.200]   So we now have team uniforms, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.480]   for the show.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.760]   I'm happy to hear that.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.000]   That's wonderful.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.120]   We really thank you all for listening.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.080]   It was a great response to our first episode.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.240]   In fact, as I said, number one on the iTunes Store briefly.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.600]   And I think we're number three as of this recording.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.160]   So that's just a nice feeling when a show is so
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.080]   rapidly embraced.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.880]   So we appreciate it.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.120]   We hope we will live up to your expectations.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.680]   There's a lot to talk about this week.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.760]   And I don't know.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.240]   Are you guys up for what we talked about last week?
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.800]   Jeff, you do a--
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.760]   Jeff's stat of the week?
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.120]   Sure.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.920]   A number of the week.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.680]   And Gina's tip of the week?
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.200]   Absolutely.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.920]   I am prepared.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.600]   And I'll be a tool.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.000]   I'll highlight a Google tool every week.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.520]   So we'll do that towards the end of the show.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:32.160]   But let's start by talking about the Twitter/livejournal/facebook/google
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.560]   DDoS that started on Thursday.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.400]   And actually, for Twitter, as for all I know,
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.160]   is still going on.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.120]   Twitter, for some reason, suffering more than all the rest.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.320]   I thought it'd be good to get somebody who's
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.120]   been covering this on the show.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.320]   In fact, we're going to call in Eleanor Mills right now.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.200]   He's been covering this for news.com.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.720]   Hi, Eleanor.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.440]   It's Leo with Jeff Jarvis and Gina Trapani.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.200]   Hello.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.520]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.080]   Well, thank you for having me.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.960]   So you've been covering this DDoS since it started.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.840]   What time did it start?
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.320]   It started-- let's see.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.760]   I think it was Thursday night.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.480]   Thursday night?
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.680]   OK.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.840]   Actually, Thursday during the morning.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.600]   Morning.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.040]   But it went on through much of the day.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.640]   And in fact, if you went to Twitter's blog,
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.680]   even as late as last night, Friday night,
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.720]   they still said, well, we're still being attacked.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.840]   They're still dealing with it.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.720]   That's true.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.760]   Are they dealing with it now?
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.480]   We're recording Saturday afternoon.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.960]   Is it still?
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.360]   No, when I checked earlier, the site was up.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.520]   OK.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.920]   But again, it depends what geography you're in.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.920]   OK.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.800]   So what happened?
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.600]   Well, it was a distributed denial of service attack.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.160]   And it took Twitter down for hours
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.320]   so that none of its users could get to the site.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.440]   And it was confusing.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.800]   They've had their reliability issues in the past.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.360]   But then Facebook reported they were having some issues,
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.520]   not the entire site down for everyone,
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.360]   but just not accessible to certain people at certain times.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.560]   But they they fended it off pretty quickly.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.240]   Then it turned out that it was an attack that
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.600]   was targeting those sites as well as Google's blogger
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.800]   and Google Sites and Live Journal, which is a blogging site.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.560]   And the companies behind the scenes
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.040]   were getting together and cooperating trying to figure out
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.640]   what's happening.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.280]   It turned out that there was one common thread
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.160]   to all of the sites.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.920]   And it was a user who had accounts on all of those sites.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.120]   And that user's page and pages were being attacked.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.600]   So it wasn't a general DDoS against these sites.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.120]   It was an attack on this guy.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.520]   They were trying to--
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.640]   whoever was doing it was trying to take that person's
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.480]   site down.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.680]   Why?
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.680]   Because well, that's a good question.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.760]   I mean, the guy is a blogger in Georgia.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.560]   Not Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.080]   Yeah, no.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.480]   The former Soviet Republic of Georgia.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.080]   Exactly.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.580]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.000]   And he has been pre-vocal in his writings
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.880]   about pro-Georgian anti-Russian or complaining
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.680]   about the Russian military and the way
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.120]   they've been dealing with things in the Caucasus region.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.600]   And so the speculation is that he
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.120]   was targeted for his political stance and for his writings.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.120]   By the Russians?
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.320]   He's not actually said that he thinks it's Russia.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.080]   By the Russians, by the Russian government.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.360]   Was it a botnet that was doing the DDoSing?
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.920]   Probably.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.680]   Yeah, that's typically how they're done.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.240]   That's the way that you can really take a site down
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.560]   is you have to get tens of thousands or hundreds
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.600]   of thousands, even millions of computers
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.200]   that have been compromised.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.120]   And an interesting side note to this--
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.600]   correct me if I'm wrong, but I had
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.880]   read that after the botnet attacked these sites,
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.840]   that spam was going out with links
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.600]   to this guy's various sites in YouTube and Live
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.360]   Journal and Twitter and Facebook.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.800]   And people who are clicking the links in spam
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.600]   were further attacking on wittingly attacking these sites.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.440]   Actually, yes.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.560]   It was a too-pronged attack, probably by the same people.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.240]   And I think it may have started out first with the spam.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.600]   That spam emails were sent that looked
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.000]   like they came from this person's email account.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.760]   But they weren't.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.040]   He claims that they were spoofed.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.960]   He didn't send them out.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.560]   Oh, so they didn't say, oh, these are pictures of Lady Gaga.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.880]   They said, how do you pronounce it?
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.800]   She knew you.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.400]   She knew you.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.400]   Something like that, yeah.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.000]   They said, hi, she knew you here.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.040]   Please, click my link.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.720]   Click my link.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.720]   Go to my YouTube page.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.240]   Go to my Twitter page.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.920]   And the links went to his Twitter and YouTube
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.120]   and Blogger page.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.440]   But that was not enough to cause denial of service.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.800]   So was all the traffic just plain old HTTP traffic?
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.600]   It wasn't a sin flood or anything like that?
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.680]   No, we're not sure.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.160]   And they're not the companies that were--
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.000]   They don't want to say anything.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.680]   They're not saying exactly.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.640]   They're not saying-- and they're not
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.040]   saying what they did to stop it.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.960]   But they worked together in concert to stop it.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.640]   They sure did.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.360]   Interesting that Twitter suffered the brunt of it,
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.800]   probably because its infrastructure wasn't so strong.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.480]   Right.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.800]   Well, there-- yeah.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.160]   I mean, Google's built to handle searches and all sorts
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.760]   of millions and millions of searches per second and whatnot.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.200]   And they've got a huge infrastructure.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.560]   Lots of data centers, bad and wet, up the wazoo.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.360]   Their fine live journal was taken down,
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.760]   but they're a smaller company.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.080]   And Twitter has grown so fast that they're struggling
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.400]   to keep up with just regular growth, let alone
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.160]   a huge concerted attack like this.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.640]   They can't keep up with Oprah, let alone shes--
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.120]   Exactly.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.520]   Facebook, though, came out pretty well.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.160]   I mean, his-- I know his page was down
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.720]   and some-- there was some slowness,
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.880]   but they seem to come out.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.360]   Yeah, what they did to handle it is they cut off access
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.920]   to his page from everyone outside of his geographical region.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.720]   So they kept-- they allowed people in his--
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.320]   in that region of Eastern Europe
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.160]   to be able to get to his page.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160]   That's counterintuitive because I thought the attacks were
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.200]   coming from Eastern Europe.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.360]   They were, but they were able to sort of load balance
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.680]   and say, OK, well, let's allow people who really need
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.200]   to get to a site to get to it.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.960]   Whereas I was in San Francisco trying to get to it yesterday
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.520]   and I couldn't.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.000]   So they figured for right now to deal with the attack,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.480]   let's sort of control it that way.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.080]   This, by the way, the guy's name is a 34-year-old economics
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.480]   professor named Georgie.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.400]   He doesn't say his real name.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.840]   He's a refugee from Georgia.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.880]   And he supposedly lives into believing now.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.480]   That's what he's told several journalists over there.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.840]   Well, I can't think of a single case of this kind of thing
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.320]   happening.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.520]   This is the first where that I know--
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.480]   I've been covering internet and technology stuff for since '94.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.200]   And this is the first time I've heard of an individual's
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.800]   account being targeted like this by a denial of service
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.040]   attack that took a whole site down.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.360]   Usually it's a site getting targeted, a blog site or a company
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.320]   because of whatever reason.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.920]   A lot of it's usually political, too.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.360]   Well, Eleanor, I want to thank you for giving us an update
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.160]   on the inside story on this.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.280]   It must have been a very interesting story to cover.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.360]   Oh, it was fascinating.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.640]   And when details were emerging, it was very exciting.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.880]   And when we found this piece of information out,
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.360]   it was like, whoa, one person being attacked.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.840]   How intense?
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.960]   Yeah, I have never seen that happen.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.200]   Before.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.680]   Well, the irony is they wanted to shut him down,
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.560]   and they wanted to silence him as a Facebook CFO,
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.160]   with Chief Security Officer, was pointing out.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.840]   But yet now he's bigger and higher profile than ever.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.800]   The Streisand effect, once again.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.160]   Eleanor's column is called Insecurity Complex.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.120]   It's at cnetsnews.cnet.com.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.680]   Yes.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.720]   And I read it all the time.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.400]   Really useful blog about the security issues
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.760]   and stories like this.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.600]   Thank you, Eleanor.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.160]   Well, thank you.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.000]   Really appreciate it.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.520]   OK.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.040]   So what do you think, Gina and Jeff?
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.400]   I wanted to get the facts out before we talk discussed about it.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   I think a couple of issues that come up, in my mind,
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.440]   one is we were seeing howls of pain from Twitter users,
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.240]   but not just regular Twitter users.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.480]   There was one company that was doing a product launch on Thursday
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.640]   and planned to use Twitter as their primary way
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.480]   of launching this product.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.680]   Welcome to the internet.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.640]   The cloud is not as reliable as they might have thought.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.000]   Well, you know, one thing that occurred to me in the story
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.840]   is how much these tools aren't just playthings.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.680]   They are political.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.560]   In Iran, I saw a story late today
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.280]   that one of the indictments in the so-called trials in Iran
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.320]   specifically lists Facebook and Twitter and Google language
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.120]   tools as co-conspirators.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:52.640]   Wow.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.520]   And so the fear is that you have political entities
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.360]   that are going to go after these things that are just
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.920]   part of our lives, and we look at it very differently.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:06.840]   Google survived this pretty well, which is--
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.560]   I don't know if it's because they were attacked
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.560]   less or because they have more bandwidth than God,
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.120]   probably the latter, more than the former.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.480]   Facebook, which also has a lot of bandwidth,
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.600]   responded very quickly.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.120]   Twitter kind of showed its weakness here.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.240]   Yeah, well, I mean, well, we're all kind of used to Twitter
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.560]   being down, right?
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.560]   I guess so.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.720]   I mean, the thing that struck me about this story,
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.320]   just because I'm a whatever, kumbaya, singing hippie,
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.960]   is that I just love that all these companies got together
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.120]   and worked together to figure this out.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.720]   It made me feel like, oh, hey, there
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.080]   should be a federation of big internet companies
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.520]   that have some sort of established infrastructure.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.400]   So when these things do come up, and they will come up again
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.000]   that they can help on another out,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.280]   that totally unrelated to this DDoS,
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.840]   Gawker Media's sites got attacked this week as well,
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.600]   which publishes Life Hacker.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.040]   And it was somebody going after consumerist.com,
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.160]   which is a site that does reviews and outs companies
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.480]   for bad things that they do.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.600]   Anyway, I felt so bad for our tech team.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.720]   And then they were just desperate and up all night
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.080]   and just analyzing gigabytes and gigabytes of logs,
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.440]   trying to figure out what was going on.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.040]   And I mean, obviously, this was a specific to Gawker,
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.480]   but it would have been nice for them
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.000]   to have, if it had been happening across sites,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.600]   to have that sort of support and cooperation.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.560]   So I really like that that the companies got together
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.760]   and try to figure out what was up.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.520]   - People don't realize how painful this is
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.760]   when this happens to a company.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.640]   I mean, it is a nightmare.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.200]   - I mean, you're just offline.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.280]   And when your business is being online,
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.040]   to be offline is--
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:38.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.400]   And you just feel like you're bleeding, you know,
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.480]   thousands of dollars every second that ticks by.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.160]   It's just horrible for everyone, you know?
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.280]   And the poor sys admins talk about a thankless job.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.760]   I mean, you never know you have sys admins
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.080]   until something goes wrong, right?
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.920]   - Right.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.760]   (laughs)
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.760]   - When we're down, I know I thank my sys admins.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.840]   And I scream, I holler, I say, "Bear, we're down!"
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.800]   I mean, it's like that old video,
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.680]   the, what is it, the website is down?
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.240]   Or it just, it's just panic time.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.720]   It's just panic time.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.800]   Is there any lesson to be learned?
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.720]   Is this gonna happen?
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.640]   I suspect it is gonna happen more?
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.400]   Is it something that means people should be less
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.360]   trusting of cloud computing, Gina?
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.640]   - You know, I think these are growing pains.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.160]   I do think that people should have sort of
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.480]   healthy skepticism and a about cloud computing in general
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.880]   and should know what things are possible,
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.040]   what terrible things can go wrong, what things are possible.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.160]   But, you know, these are growing pains.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.320]   I mean, I think that these things will happen less
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.800]   and that, you know, it's an arms race, right?
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.840]   Things go wrong, companies figure out how to fix them
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.800]   and we go forward.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.080]   I mean, there are gonna be some bad days.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.440]   The internet, you know, isn't always gonna work
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.280]   the way you expect if you're gonna launch your product.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.800]   And it's good to have, you know, plan Bs.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.320]   I don't think that we should all get off the internet
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.160]   because we think that--
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160]   - Yeah, let's all get off the internet.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.000]   - It's over, it's over, I think.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.120]   - We're already at. - Yep, I'm going home.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.640]   I'm gonna take my podcast and I'm going home.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.880]   - You know, I remember in the early days of blogging
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.440]   or what we thought were the early days, Glen Reynolds
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.040]   at Instapun, it had a ready made backup site always
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.360]   at the ready because the internet, you know,
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.640]   things crashed all the time then.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.200]   - We should still do that.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.760]   - Yeah, we actually should.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.080]   - It's not a bad idea.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.360]   - It's really smart, yeah.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.640]   - That's really what happened to Twitter
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.080]   is that they had a single point of failure.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.400]   They didn't have all these data centers.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.520]   - Yeah, the single point of failure was the web.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.560]   But because Twitter is at API and you can get to Twitter
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.480]   through else, that should be its strength, right?
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.040]   It's a strength against Iranian censors is that
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.920]   I can get to Twitter without calling on Twitter.com.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.760]   - Right.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.720]   - So somehow that should become their strength
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.040]   and the irony is it was their weakness
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.800]   because of course nothing could call their servers
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.240]   because they were all calling Twitter.com.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.640]   - Well, it was almost a packet storm
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.080]   because when Twitter.com went down
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.040]   and the API started failing
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.920]   and then people like Friend Feed and I know Identica,
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.760]   I know Evan Perdromo at Dedenica said,
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.320]   "We're actually making it worse by hitting them again
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.680]   "and again trying to get our feeds over there.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.840]   "We're just gonna turn it off until this goes away."
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.520]   I mean, it creates its own problem.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.920]   - Yeah, it does.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.440]   It makes me kind of dream of a time
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.200]   when maybe the cloud will be more distributed
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.200]   where people will run, and this will segue easily
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.880]   into the next thing we're gonna talk about.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.120]   There'll be hubs that take Twitter data and store it
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.840]   and also conserve API calls and requests
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.000]   where like if Twitter.com proper is down
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.960]   that there's some sort of mechanism,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.080]   sort of like BitTorrent, like peer to peer,
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.880]   spreading the cloud across different domains
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.640]   and different servers.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.520]   I mean, I think that's, I mean, we're a long way from that,
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.280]   but that's something I would love to see
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.760]   five, 10 years down the road.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.240]   - Gee, now I think it goes even more
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.400]   toward the architecture of content in the future
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.240]   is you're not gonna go to the notion
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.240]   of a destination site as much.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.760]   The content itself is gonna be distributed all over,
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.000]   it's aggregated and displayed in different ways
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.160]   through APIs, and so you may not even know
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.320]   what site you're going to, you're not going to a site anymore.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.600]   The notion of doing that means you get must traffic.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.880]   - Well, in a way we're already there.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.640]   I mean, it started with RSS, but I mean, that's half
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.200]   or less of Twitter's traffic is on the webpage.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.720]   Most of it's through, you know, TweetDeck and Tweety
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.400]   and other API-based clients, right?
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.840]   Shouldn't they have some reliable side door to the data then?
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.880]   - That seems like it, but Twitter for some reason
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.760]   has had such trouble with their engineering.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.240]   I don't wanna make this a bad, you know,
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.760]   bash Twitter episode, but it's not surprising that--
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.040]   - This week can fail well.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.880]   - Yeah.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.720]   (laughing)
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.880]   I mean, really, come on.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:36.200]   A lot of people are now really relying on Twitter.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.040]   The pain people were feeling on Thursday
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.800]   was really kind of fascinating.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.600]   - But you know, imagine a TweetDeck
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.080]   that gets all your friends' updates
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.920]   and stores them locally and pushes your updates out.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.520]   And so, you know, you're in TweetDeck, Twitter now is down,
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.640]   but you post an update and TweetDeck says,
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.880]   oh, hey, you know, or whatever client using,
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.920]   hey, Twitter.com is down, but I know who your followers are.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.120]   I know your friends are, so I'm gonna push your updates
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.040]   out to them and then I'll just queue things up, right?
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.000]   And when Twitter's back up, we'll push it
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.360]   to the central hub, but my friends,
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.800]   so a distributed situation where like,
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.520]   my friends can get my updates and my followers can get mine
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.080]   and you know, Twitter.com, it doesn't necessarily have
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.160]   to be up at that moment.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.760]   And when it does come up, it sinks,
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.960]   sort of like, you know, offline email, essentially.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.840]   You know, what-- - Isn't that what Dave Weiner
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.320]   has been talking about in trying to get off
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.120]   the notion of Twitter on company-- - Yes.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.480]   - That if TweetDeck and TweetDeck had a federation
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.040]   that they shared at that moment and they grew,
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.320]   you've just seen the start of the architecture of the cloud.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.320]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.240]   - That's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.480]   I think Weiner is straight, is right on with that.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.920]   I really love the idea of being able to, you know,
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.040]   be less dependent on Twitter.com proper
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.120]   and being able to, you know, for a few different Twitters
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.720]   to all sync back to, you know, I'm not trying
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.680]   to take their business, but sync back to Twitter
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.520]   in a cloud and not be dependent on the servers
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.160]   actually being out, but it would make DDoS attacks
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.160]   like that much less possible.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.920]   - Federation. - Yep.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.960]   - Isn't that what Wave does?
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.520]   That's kind of the whole idea behind Wave.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.800]   Is that anybody can run a Wave server,
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.560]   the servers are federated.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.140]   Is Wave completely decentralized?
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.880]   - From what I understand it is,
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.280]   so anybody can install a server
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.800]   and the servers talk to one another.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.600]   - So, and that's one of the great things about Wave.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.240]   Is that it is federated and distributed
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.920]   and that it's not dependent on one, on Google being up.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.680]   - Let's talk about Wave a little bit.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.400]   I presume that's the story that you were talking about,
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.520]   Gina, our story number. - Yes.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.600]   - Story number two.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.640]   And I've asked Anil Dash to come on the show,
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.800]   maybe he'll be on next week if his schedule allows.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.040]   This is the second week in the row,
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.520]   we've talked about an article from Anil,
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.520]   so I think we have to bring him on.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.400]   Last week we talked about his push button web,
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.760]   the pub sub hub, bub.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.960]   And in fact, a little later on,
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.360]   we'll talk about the fact that Google Reader has now adopted,
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.280]   it made it a little bit easier to do push button web.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.160]   This week he published an article
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.760]   that I thought was fairly challenging and controversial.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.680]   I'd love to get your opinions on it.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.680]   It's titled, "What Works The Web Way Versus The Wave Way."
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.560]   And he's really saying that,
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.840]   there's a lot of hype obviously for Wave.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.520]   This is gonna replace email.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.520]   But he says that Wave really is not gonna succeed
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.600]   because the Wave wave does it is incompatible
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.720]   with the things that have made the worldwide web successful.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.800]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.360]   - You know, it does make sense to me
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.480]   'cause let's talk about how do we all learn
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.680]   how to build websites, right?
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.800]   First we learned a little HTML and that worked, cool, okay.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.840]   And then we figured out, oh, this robot.txt file
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.120]   tells search engines how to work.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.360]   Okay, that we can do.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.200]   - Great.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.120]   - It's all incremental stuff.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.840]   - All incremental, all these little things.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.600]   We just look at, oh, here's an RSS feed
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.360]   and that shows up in this reader, cool.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.320]   All incremental, very easily hackable.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.840]   - It's true, I'm thinking about when I got into podcasting,
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.280]   I was already offering for download audio
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.920]   and somebody said, well, if you create an RSS feed,
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.880]   it'll be this thing called a podcast
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.440]   and I was able to do that in a day or two.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.120]   He says, you gotta be able to do it.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.880]   It has to be a weekend sized problem
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.760]   if it's gonna succeed.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.240]   It's something you could do in a weekend.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.240]   - Yes, exactly, exactly.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.920]   And that's very true, right?
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.240]   So I think--
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.400]   - But doesn't that make it trivial?
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.960]   It means we can only do trivial things.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.200]   If it can only be incremental,
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.200]   it can only be done in a weekend?
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.800]   - Well, it does, it does.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.040]   It's a little trivial and that things happen slowly
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.640]   and like little bit by bit.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.640]   But his argument is that these are the ways
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.920]   that things get deployed across the web,
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.400]   you know, a widespread deployment across the web.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.160]   Because look, wave is gonna be awesome.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.000]   It's gonna come out.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.360]   We're probably gonna use it for the show.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.400]   We're all gonna use it.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.240]   And--
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.520]   - But it's gonna be hard to use.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.240]   - Well, for people who can't install their own server,
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.360]   I mean, you have to have people who can install the server
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.520]   and get that running or get access to a wave server.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.360]   And that's fine.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.120]   I mean, the people setting up a server
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.160]   isn't that big a deal.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.600]   But, you know, companies are gonna want wave functionality
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.640]   on their sites without getting Google involved, necessarily.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.480]   Right?
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.400]   I mean, I think that that's a reasonable thing.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.680]   They're gonna say, we want real time,
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.640]   you know, real time technologies on our site.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.840]   We don't necessarily wanna do it the way that Wave does it.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.080]   We don't wanna drop this JavaScript
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.920]   from the Wave server on to our, you know,
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.840]   we wanna do it our way.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.760]   We wanna do it the web way.
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.280]   We wanna host this stuff on our servers.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.240]   I think that that's a reasonable thing to want.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.600]   - I think that's the whole truth, Gina,
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.680]   but isn't it also true that certain things
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.320]   when they're fundamental to the web
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.600]   are necessarily more complicated, right?
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.960]   Apache, Linux, the browser itself,
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.760]   were not weekend projects.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.960]   They were important--
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.760]   - But they were incremental.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.600]   - Yes.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.520]   - No, I would disagree to this extent.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.880]   You didn't have a little, little, little tiny bit
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.480]   of a web server and tried one little thing
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.640]   and then it grew and grew and grew.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.320]   - But Apache, in fact, even means Apache come,
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.680]   the name Apache comes from Apache web server.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.920]   It was patched and patched and patched again
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.800]   and patched again.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.640]   It was--
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.120]   - But who says Wave couldn't be that?
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.640]   - Well, the question that what Neil's saying is that,
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.000]   and I don't disagree with him,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.640]   the best way for Wave to spread
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.760]   is if it were a weekend project.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.880]   However, maybe it just isn't in the first blush.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.240]   Maybe to get this fundamental cinder block layer
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.760]   and there is gonna be hard
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.720]   and then it becomes incremental on top of that.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.560]   - Well, he also raises the issue of what I would call
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.400]   the network effect.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.200]   He talks about Metcalf's law.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.200]   He says there has to be value before everybody has upgraded.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.280]   In other words, people aren't going to move to the--
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.200]   You said that last week, Gina, Wave's cool,
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.680]   but if nobody you know is using it,
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.920]   it's completely silly.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.160]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.600]   - Unless you use it to publish web content,
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.520]   which you can do, you could have a small group,
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.080]   let's say a newspaper newsroom,
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.000]   could use Wave to publish--
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.200]   - Instant group. - Or a group.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.040]   - Instant group.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.480]   - An instant group could use Wave to collaborate
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.880]   in a set group and in 10 people
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.320]   and then use that to publish to the web.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.400]   That becomes a demonstration project for the value of Wave.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.720]   - Yeah.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.720]   - Am I wrong, Gina?
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.960]   I mean, you know more about this than I do by miles.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.640]   You know, from the way that it works now,
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.520]   at least with the sandbox,
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.480]   and I don't know if this is going to work,
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.720]   you know, always work this way,
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.560]   but what you can do is you can drop a little wavelet
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.080]   onto a webpage so people can have a real-time conversation
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.200]   on an existing webpage.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.880]   So say I'm not using Wave
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.480]   and I happen upon a webpage, it's using a wavelet.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.560]   The message right now, or at least when I saw it,
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.960]   was like you need to be logged into Wave to do this, right?
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.920]   So then suddenly, you know, it's incumbent on you
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.960]   to create an account or have a Wave account.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.480]   - Well, I mean, you know, it might be a problem,
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.920]   but it's also a good way to get people to--
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.040]   you know, to adopt this new protocol.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.920]   And Wave isn't just a product, right?
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.760]   It's a server, it's a protocol
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.520]   and it's an open source product.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.280]   And anybody could build, you know,
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.800]   another Wave server product or client product
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.560]   to the protocol, but Aneel is arguing
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.840]   that that's a really, you know,
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.680]   - Two more.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.960]   - It's too hard, it's too hard to take on.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.800]   - Well, you press on--
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.800]   - As a voice is--
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.400]   - I saw a blog from Garrett Rogers
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.640]   who disagreed with Aneel and it's on our wiki list,
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.800]   saying it's too soon to make these judgments
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.640]   and that there's still something bigger there.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.920]   - Well, that's about what I was about to say is Aneel
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.320]   and well, really none of us have really installed
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.560]   a Wave server or looked at what would involve
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.680]   installing a Wave server.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.560]   In fact, very few of us even have any experience
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.760]   with Wave aside from the kind of a little bit of,
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.600]   you know, here and there,
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.240]   I've tried it with somebody else.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.480]   So we don't know really,
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.120]   part of this is we just don't know yet.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.320]   But he does, I'm glad he wrote the articles
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.120]   'cause I think it's important to point out
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.720]   that the things that have succeeded on the web
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.360]   have been for the most part,
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.160]   maybe you've take LAMP stack out,
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.160]   but for the most part,
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.480]   small incremental easy to implement things
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.680]   that can be accreted to make something extremely powerful.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.560]   But Wavelets might make that possible.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.900]   If I could embed a little thing on iGoogle,
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.600]   of course, I have to save my experience
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.680]   with things like latitude.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.800]   Don't give me a lot of confidence in Google's ability
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.840]   to execute something that really is that simple.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.680]   I don't know about you,
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.000]   but you know, I've had too many weird people email me.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.400]   I don't like to broadcast my location,
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.560]   so I've actually never tried.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.720]   (laughing)
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.640]   Yeah, I've had too many weird people email me
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.080]   to watch my podcast by location at any point.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.400]   But yesterday I bright-cited-
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.560]   Why do you keep the bike behind you
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.480]   so you can get away fast?
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.320]   That's why I can't wait fast.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.920]   She's ready to run.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:15.800]   Yesterday I bright-cited my actual address,
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.400]   by accident, stupid,
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.560]   and but you know,
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.400]   that's part of the problem with these technologies.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.920]   You're probably right not to install it.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.760]   But when I latitude to use,
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.680]   it's very weird.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.840]   I hope that this isn't something
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.080]   that Google's gonna do more.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.080]   To use latitude,
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.000]   you need to embed it as an iGoogle gadget.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.840]   I mean, you can use it on your phone,
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.200]   but if you use it on the web,
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.760]   you embed it as an iGoogle gadget,
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.800]   and it's within the gadget that you add friends and all that.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.480]   And it, you know,
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.560]   for the first 20 times I tried to add people,
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.920]   it didn't even load the page.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.080]   So there are some execution issues.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.400]   Now, the Rasmussen seem like they know what they're doing,
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.360]   so maybe that won't happen to Google Wave.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.880]   You know, I guess it's all speculative.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.120]   We should probably just wait and see when Wave comes out.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:58.960]   - It is, but you know,
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.600]   Aneel has been, you know,
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.840]   sort of the head of the blogging revolution
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.000]   and the kind of acquisition of,
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.960]   you know, the deployment of all the technologies
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.680]   around blogging for years now, you know, since 2000.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.480]   So he's seen people, you know,
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.720]   take on publishing technologies and take on feeds.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.200]   I mean, we went out to a point where, you know,
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.520]   pretty much anyone who has any kind of savvy
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.400]   and knows what a feed is.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.240]   That's kind of a big deal.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.320]   I remember conversations years ago where people were just like,
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.160]   feeds are too hard, maximalists too hard.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.520]   But now, I mean, look at, you know, everyone's,
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.840]   not everyone, but a large percentage
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.480]   of the mainstream population knows what feeds are,
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.560]   which is impressive.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.240]   So I don't know, I am the student in the School of Aneel Dash.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.520]   I will admit.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.840]   - Well, okay, but I will point out that he also,
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.120]   as, you know, somebody who's tied to the blogging platform,
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.640]   maybe it may, I love Aneel.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.160]   Maybe we'll get him on and he could defend himself.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.240]   But maybe he's also, as I have been in the past,
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.320]   somebody who is tied to an older technology
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.160]   that maybe doesn't, isn't really fully in the, you know,
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.520]   the corner of a new technology.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.640]   It's not unusual that that happens also.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.560]   - Mm-hmm, fair enough.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.560]   - But he makes excellent points.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.800]   Do read the blog post, we'll get Aneel on
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.960]   and he can talk about and defend himself.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.880]   Some news in the pub, sub hub, bub.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.920]   You talked last week about adding push button web
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.760]   to your blog, right, Gina?
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.960]   - Yes, I did.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.800]   So last week I was talking about pub sub hub hub
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.400]   and let's just all say, I love those guys who are building it
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.000]   but that is the worst name.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.760]   - Can you explain what it is?
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.600]   - Hey.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.840]   - What does it mean?
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.440]   - Pub sub hub hub is, puts a hub between publishers
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.280]   and subscribers.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.000]   So it lets a publisher notify, essentially a middle man,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.280]   a middle server that say, hey, I have new content.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.080]   And then that hub goes out to subscribers
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.240]   and on a notification basis, not a polling basis,
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.720]   says, hey, here's new content.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.920]   It pushes new content across the web real time
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.440]   without polling, without asking over and over again.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.680]   Does your feed have new content?
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.000]   Does your feed have new content?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.880]   So the publisher saves bandwidth.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.040]   The subscribers get the new content more quickly,
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.200]   practically real time.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.000]   And in fact, during the crunch up demo
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.760]   that Brad Fitzpatrick and Brett Slackin did,
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.080]   they said that at one point while they were testing,
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.320]   they wound up chatting with one another through the hub.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.840]   They didn't mean to but they--
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.400]   - 'Cause it was so real time.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.320]   - It was so fast, yeah.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.880]   - You said no latency.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.480]   - Yeah, there's no latency.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.080]   So the first tiny deployment of Pub sub hub hub
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.920]   went out this week.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.160]   And these are Google guys who are building Pub sub hub hub
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.520]   but this is something that's completely independent
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.360]   of Google products.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.120]   This is like an open, open protocol that uses
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.360]   very simple technologies that we all know, XML, HTTP.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.240]   They got together with the Google Reader guys.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.440]   This is, I guess, the advantage of working at Google
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.640]   is that you can just kind of call up the team
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.880]   that does a product.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:49.120]   And said, when Google Reader users share items,
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:53.280]   notify Friend Feed, they basically hooked up Pub sub access,
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.120]   Pub sub hub up access between Google Reader and Friend Feed.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.040]   And Friend Feed is built by former Google folks.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.800]   Right, so right now in Google Reader, if you share an item,
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.040]   it shows up in your Friend Feed page immediately.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:06.880]   And you can try it.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.080]   I did browser window side by side.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:13.240]   It shows up as fast as an instant message.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.440]   So normally, for instance, if you tweet
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.640]   and your tweets are sent to Friend Feed,
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.440]   Friend Feed polls Twitter on a schedule.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.640]   They're limited by the API as to how many times they can poll
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.760]   and by how much, I presume by how much they can pull.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.800]   So there's a delay.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.200]   And in fact, there can be quite a long delay
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.840]   between you tweeting and it's showing up on Friend Feed.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.920]   This isn't poll.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.880]   This is notification.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.720]   This is push.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.320]   Is it essentially a ping that Google Reader sends to Friend Feed
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.800]   saying, I've got new data for you?
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.200]   It pings a server of the hub between Google Reader and Friend Feed.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.400]   Oh, there's an intermediary.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.600]   There's an intermediary, right?
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.120]   And that's the magic, right?
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.400]   The hub is the intermediary.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.560]   And on a given feed, right now the intermediary
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:00.000]   happens to be an open Google hosted hub.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.760]   But in the future, when there are more hubs,
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.840]   a given feed can ping several different hubs.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.000]   So if a hub goes down, other hubs will get the information.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.560]   So the publisher notifies the hub
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.760]   and then the hub notifies a subscriber, which in this case
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.040]   happens to be Friend Feed.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.600]   But this is something I would love to see.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:19.720]   I use Twitter Feed to push out my blog headlines to Twitter.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.880]   And they poll right now.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.440]   So I would love to see Twitter Feed use this.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.680]   Because then you publish a blog post
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.040]   and it would be out on Twitter immediately.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.040]   And it would save on Twitter API calls, which
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   are way expensive right now.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:30.560]   Right.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.640]   Expensive in computing power, not price.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.640]   Right.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.400]   Expensive in that you only get 150 per hour.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.640]   Twitter's off and down.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.640]   All that stuff.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.640]   All right.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.880]   So later in the show, you're going to explain to us
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.440]   how we can do this ourselves.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.560]   Yeah, because Feedburner has built in support for this.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.800]   So I'm going to tell you how to turn on your feed burger.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.160]   So easy.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.480]   She could describe it in a podcast.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.600]   That's how easy it is.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.160]   But then we'll also send you to her post.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.800]   And then you can read all the details.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.600]   Sure.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.080]   David Poe wrote in the New York Times recently
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:08.400]   that Google's response to Apple pulling the Google Voice
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.800]   app or blocking the Google Voice app from the iPhone store
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.680]   is to write it as a web application, to use HTML5.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.200]   Now that that's so well supported by Safari on the iPhone.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:24.040]   And I don't think there's any way that Apple can stop it.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.240]   That's an interesting--
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.040]   Not a phone.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.520]   It's what we said last week.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.720]   This is what this is really about.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.120]   It's the web.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.000]   And I still think that maybe it may be naive of me,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.880]   but I think this is the real net neutrality debate,
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.880]   is that if you try to keep an app off, well screw you.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.200]   We're going to go right around you.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.680]   And this is exactly why AT&T doesn't want that neutrality.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.320]   Yeah, that's why we don't want it.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.680]   That's why we do want it.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.360]   There in lies the very clear battle.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.280]   And I think we have a very clear case now,
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.960]   is that when you can cut off an application,
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.560]   it really affects the value of the device you're
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.360]   holding and the connection you have.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.640]   And it's the freedom of the web that adds value.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.920]   According to POGS sources, he says,
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:08.360]   Google says they will have exactly the same features
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.760]   as this rejected application.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.320]   They're not going to lose anything.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.360]   It'll behave exactly the same as the app would.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.920]   You can even have the icon on the home screen.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.640]   Three cheers for HTML5.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.560]   Yay.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.520]   Hip hip, hooray.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.440]   Let's see it.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.120]   Let's see it.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.160]   And before Google releases the new web app,
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:30.560]   an independent developer at ironicsands.com wrote a little script
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.720]   that creates book marklets for each one of your contacts
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.640]   on the iPhone right now.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.040]   Book marklets that you could paste on your home screen
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.200]   that will quickly dial.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.040]   So if you call-- I know isn't this great.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.280]   I love this.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.160]   Of course, the independent developer came out with it.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.000]   So yeah, you could quickly--
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.440]   You press so you could just tap that button
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.600]   and it would dial that number.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.800]   And it makes the Google Voice call, which is fantastic.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   Or if it's overseas for pennies.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.960]   Right, right.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.120]   I'm not sure how it works for SMS messages.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:57.920]   The calls aren't free.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.280]   I mean, you're actually-- you're calling a Google Voice number.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.840]   So you're using minutes.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.320]   You're so big.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.160]   But the SMS-- this text messages are indeed free.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.160]   And I don't have an iPhone anymore.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.800]   So I actually didn't try these book marklets.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.480]   But I feel like this is the way.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.760]   Isn't it funny how we're kind of taking a step back?
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.360]   I mean, remember when the iPhone was first released,
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.360]   Apple was like, well, all you need is the browser.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:16.880]   Right.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.120]   And then they-- you know, the application platform.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.040]   And then they rejected an app.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.880]   And now we're going back to the web browser.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.760]   But hey.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.560]   That's-- well, and in fact, that's what Christmas
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.960]   Zina wrote in his tongue-in-cheek blog post,
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.440]   Steve Jobs hates the App Store.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.600]   His secret plan all along was to make apps be so broken.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.920]   And the App Store process is so broken that everybody
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.680]   go back to what he really wanted you all to do
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.800]   in the first place was to write web apps.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.840]   But nobody wanted to.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:44.320]   Let me ask you about HTML5.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.320]   This is WebKit, which is the base for Safari on both the iPhone
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.480]   and the Mac, is really up to their support for HTML.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.680]   How much of HTML5 is supported now on the iPhone?
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.560]   Do you know?
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.600]   I'm not sure.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.800]   I've been a bad web developer and haven't kept on top
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.720]   of the HTML5 feature set.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.320]   And what's out what?
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.280]   But I mean, it seems like every time there's a browser
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.320]   upgrade in fact, Chrome just released a new beta, right?
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.880]   And saying that they had more HTML5 support,
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.560]   that it's happening incrementally, interestingly.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:11.280]   Yep.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.040]   There you go.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.440]   Hard to implement maybe, but not one step at a time.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.280]   Easy to implement, you know, because you just--
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.000]   one tag at a time, you just do.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.040]   So the whole idea-- what is the idea of HTML5?
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.800]   Well, it lets you create much more dynamic web pages
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.800]   and do things like video and audio
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.080]   without requiring plug-ins, like the stupid flash plug-in
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.160]   or that kind of thing.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.440]   The things that crash browsers.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.600]   And that's the extent of my--
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.080]   like I told you, I've been a bad web developer.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.240]   That's the extent of my grasp of HTML5 right now.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.760]   There are a few tags that are really critical.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:50.040]   Canvas is one so that you can draw arbitrarily on the screen.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.000]   So there are a few tags that they're
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.240]   adding to make it more-- as you say,
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.880]   more possible to create an application.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.840]   There's a missing piece to the puzzle,
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.000]   though.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.720]   There's no defined codec for video.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.560]   And there's some have speculated some that--
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.280]   well, I guess it's an independent process creating HTML5.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:15.560]   So no one company could force a proprietary codec on there.
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.480]   Maybe it'll be Og Theora or something, some open codec.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:23.520]   But as we get closer and closer to that, SVG, for instance,
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.800]   will replace Flash.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.000]   So all these proprietary technologies
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.120]   are squeezed out of the spec so that it's--
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.480]   in theory, it's fully open.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.760]   And then you really do have net neutrality.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.720]   As long as your browser supports all of these tags,
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.120]   anybody can really do anything they want.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.680]   How could you-- so just theoretically, how could Apple
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.640]   stop the Google Voice web app?
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.000]   They could do what Microsoft has done with IE, which
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.640]   is not include certain key tags.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.880]   But it's too late because it's already in there, I guess.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.840]   I guess Google believes that they have enough of HTML5
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.640]   in there to do what they want to do.
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:07.200]   But you could release a Safari that was dumber.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.480]   If they wanted to be really evil,
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.920]   they could probably block calls to and from the Google Voice
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:17.360]   numbers because Google Voice just uses a set of intermediary
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:17.840]   numbers.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.400]   They're 406, area code 406 numbers.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.040]   And so I got-- I mean, this is--
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.560]   I don't even want to say this.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.880]   But as a phone provider, I can't imagine the FCC
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.800]   would let you get away with that.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.800]   Because what are they going to do?
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.600]   They're going to block calls to the 212 area code
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.880]   because you don't like New York?
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.240]   I mean, that seems--
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.240]   That's the best phone network.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:36.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.840]   That seems really unlikely.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.520]   So yeah.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.520]   Let's hope that not works.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.760]   It would have to be kind of a very aggressive, concerted
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.320]   assault on net neutrality to do it.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:53.760]   They'd have to really be ballsy and say, OK, screw you.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.360]   I don't know why anybody would ever say that.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.240]   But they could say that.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.680]   And you're right.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:03.280]   That's going to open them to some real risks
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.640]   on Capitol Hill if nowhere else.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.000]   Now, Akamai has a very interesting demo.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.960]   I don't know if you've seen this.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.800]   And I didn't put it in.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.880]   I wish I had in the show notes.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.720]   It's an iPhone.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.480]   If you go to iphone.akamai.com, they
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.600]   have a HTTP streaming video for the iPhone.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.120]   So once again, further leaving Apple out in the cold.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.360]   I mean, this is the risk of making--
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.680]   of being too draconian is you've got a lot of smart people
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:35.840]   out there who love their iPhones who say, all right,
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.800]   we'll do it without you.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.280]   I mean, if you can do--
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.880]   We got them where we want them.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.240]   You know, I think that's the beautiful thing
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:47.440]   of what's happened with this is that maybe that Steve Jobs is
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:51.080]   smarter than we think and sets this up so that he has cover.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.480]   Yeah, maybe Christmas scene is right.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.320]   Maybe this was the play--
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.120]   And all along.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.640]   Maybe.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.720]   Stranger things have happened at Apple.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.760]   Yeah, I actually wouldn't put it past Steve.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.640]   He's a chess player.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:06.280]   He thinks more moves ahead than most of us do.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.920]   We have a new head of the FCC.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.200]   We have a new attitude about this.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.840]   And I think these test cases can be very valuable.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.600]   Now's the time.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:21.280]   Google, by the way, bought on two, which is a video codec
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.720]   company.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.960]   They've also bought the company that
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.920]   made it the Og Theora codec.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:32.040]   So Google may be up to something there.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:38.320]   They may want to own the codec that
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.240]   ends up being an HTML5.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.680]   The question is, how evil is Google?
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.200]   Would they own it with the idea of keeping it proprietary
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.920]   to themselves or more likely own it
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.960]   so that others couldn't make it proprietary?
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.600]   What would Google do, Jeff?
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.240]   Yeah, what would Google--
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.280]   I have no idea.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:57.800]   But I've got to--
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.560]   You wrote the book.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.560]   Come on.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.560]   Well, what does it say?
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.000]   I had to vote for the latter.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.160]   Thanks for the plug.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.200]   They're not going to do the evil thing.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.840]   How are the-- what's the real business interest there?
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.840]   There's various business interests they have here
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.040]   that would be in open.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.760]   There's also interests in making YouTube more efficient.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.960]   At this point, incremental savings
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.960]   of bandwidth can make a big difference to get YouTube
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.400]   toward profitability.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.320]   So I think they have some interest in openness,
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:26.440]   but I don't know enough.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.120]   Hey, supporting your theory, Jeff,
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.560]   that Steve Jobs planned this all along,
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.560]   I didn't realize this.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.280]   The Akamai streaming site, HTTP/TV streaming,
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.160]   is sponsored by Apple.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.880]   So there you go.
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.240]   That just proves the point.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.960]   Let's see here.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.760]   Let me take a break.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.520]   This would be a good time to take a break before we go on,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.400]   because we actually have a sponsor on the show.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.280]   And I think I owe you, Jeff, for this one.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.320]   Our sponsor is audible.com, and they
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.960]   said we would love to support the show as long as you plug
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.160]   Jeff's book.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.520]   So we are going to--
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.400]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.080]   There it is.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:07.720]   There it is.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.960]   There is Jeff's book.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.320]   And what would Google do?
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   It is on audible.com.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.560]   Did you read it?
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.200]   Yeah, I did.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.440]   And you can hear how fast I talked.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.040]   It was really hard for them in engineering.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.760]   Because then until the all time slow down, damn it, slow down.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:29.880]   So the URL is audiblepodcast.com/twig, T-W-I-G.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.880]   We invite you to go there.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:36.280]   And sign up for the gold account that gives you one free book.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.080]   And audible's not going to tell you this.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.640]   Jeff's not going to tell you this.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.520]   But it doesn't have to be.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.720]   What would Google do?
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.760]   There.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.360]   But why not?
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:47.720]   Why not?
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.240]   Well, take a free book, then pay for mine.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.560]   That's fine.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.160]   OK, either way.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.120]   I think you get paid, even if they take the free book.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:55.920]   Jeff narrates it.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.880]   What would Google do?
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.600]   Tell us a little bit about the book, Jeff.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.720]   What's in here?
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.800]   Presumably anybody who listens to a podcast about Google
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.800]   is going to be interested in a book called What Would Google
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.680]   Do?
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.160]   Well, no, I'll go against that.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.840]   It's not really a book about Google.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.840]   It's a book about the changes in our world.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.840]   And I figured the one company that has this figured out
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.000]   is Google.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.760]   And the world has changed more than we even know yet.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.560]   So Google is kind of the template for the future.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.080]   Right.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.720]   And I think we can learn a lot of lessons from that.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.680]   And then I have fun trying to apply those lessons
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.240]   to figure out what is a Googly restaurant or airline
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.200]   or universe.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.640]   I love it.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.000]   I've already screwed it up.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.240]   The URL is audiblepodcast.com/google.
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.880]   They throw me every time with these URLs.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.160]   They change them every time.
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.120]   Sneaky.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.440]   Audiblepodcast.com/google.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.360]   What would Google do?
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.720]   Could be your first book.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.040]   Highly recommend it.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:50.800]   It really is good.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.640]   Gina and I are both reading it right now.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.960]   I'm going to listen to it.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:56.840]   I'm going to let Jeff read it to me.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:57.920]   Yeah, I'm tempted.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.120]   Yeah, absolutely free.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.360]   I'll switch to the audible version.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.280]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.280]   Oh, my Kindle.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.000]   Just imagine how hard that editor had to work to get me
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.640]   to sound--
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.480]   Yeah, on your Kindle, on your iPod, on your iPhone,
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.880]   it works-- I think it works on your G1, doesn't it?
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.040]   Do you know?
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.360]   The--
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.040]   Yes, I think we have--
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:17.520]   I think so.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.440]   I have to look on the device center.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.280]   If you go to the audible site, they have a device center.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.640]   Let me just see off the top of--
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.200]   I don't know.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.560]   Maybe not.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:25.960]   Maybe not.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.760]   But it does work on a variety of devices.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:32.320]   And of course, having a book like Jeff's book along with you
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.480]   wherever you go is really nice.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.000]   Great way to get through the commute,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.520]   get through the gym, audiblepodcast.com/google.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.520]   Give it a listen.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.800]   And we thank them for their support.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.480]   We thank Jeff for his book.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.120]   Thank you.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.920]   Yeah, it's nice to have Audible on board.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.040]   That just shows you.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.280]   Yeah, I'm actually just going to ask you--
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.680]   this isn't really a Google story.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:55.880]   It's a journalism story, Jeff.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:59.040]   But I know it's really your beat.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.200]   Rupert Murdoch says he likes the paywall.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:06.000]   And all of his sites are going to start charging for news.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.160]   Is he nuts?
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.760]   I think it's more that he's suicidal.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.160]   OK.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.880]   Because if you look at the London papers, for example,
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.480]   so fine, put the times behind the wall.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.800]   You have the Guardian for whom I write, the Telegraph,
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.440]   the independent, all these other papers.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.280]   And somebody's going to ruin it for them,
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.480]   including, by the way, the BBC, which is never
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.600]   going to go behind the paywall.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:26.600]   It can't.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:27.600]   It can't.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.040]   In a way, it's behind a paywall because you
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.840]   have to pay a license fees for the BBC, right?
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.960]   Right.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.440]   In the US, so the New York Post goes behind a wall.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.840]   Well, there's always TMZ.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.240]   There's always someplace else to tell you
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.720]   that Michael Jackson is strange or not dead.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.400]   And so I don't think the paywall is going to work.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.320]   The problem is that we have an industry that
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:50.040]   refused to update over 15 years since the browser came out
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:54.320]   commercially and is now in a last minute desperation move,
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.920]   trying to fix it all by just saying, well, damn you, people
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.440]   you used to pay, so you should still pay.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.360]   But it ignores the architecture of the web.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.440]   It ignores the notion that you can-- especially
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.680]   you should specialize now that you do what you do best
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.200]   and link to the rest, that you save money that way,
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.280]   and that you lose audience.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.000]   You lose advertising when you create a wall.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.200]   And most of all, you lose Google juice when you create a wall.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:20.120]   And I think that it really is truly suicidal.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.360]   And startup companies are going to come along and say,
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.640]   good, please build the wall, and we're
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.320]   going to grab the audience from you.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.400]   Newscorps, revenues are down almost 50%.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.920]   Murdoch says-- and I can't argue with him--
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:36.600]   quality journalism is not cheap.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.640]   And an industry that gives away its content
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.400]   is simply cannibalizing its ability
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.920]   to produce good reporting.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.400]   But as one blogger said this week,
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.160]   and I wish I could give credit where it was due,
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.560]   in what industry do you approach the economics by saying,
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.640]   well, this is what it cost us to make.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:52.960]   Not my problem.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.840]   Not the issue.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.400]   By these economics, GM should have just raised their prices
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.400]   and everything can be OK.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:44:59.920]   Right.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.520]   Clearly not.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.560]   No, that's a very good point.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.320]   You don't sell a house based on what it costs you
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.360]   or how much you put into it.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.600]   It's just what it's worth.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:09.480]   Welcome to capitalism, Murdoch.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.080]   Now, but he does have one bright shining star,
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.600]   the Wall Street Journal, which is behind a paywall
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.320]   and is doing very well.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.200]   Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, both,
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.680]   because A, you make money for them,
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.560]   and B, you can charge the fee to your employer.
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.080]   And--
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.760]   So they're outliers.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.680]   Yeah, and also Bloomberg, too, I think,
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.320]   is the best example of that, actually,
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.280]   because the time matters.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.760]   But in the rest of it, news is mainly a commodity.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.360]   It's not like selling a song or a movie
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.960]   because you don't want to listen to it 10 times.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.240]   Information becomes a commodity once it's known.
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.880]   Once you know Michael Jackson is dead, he's just dead.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.160]   Not to pick on Michael Jackson.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.640]   Too late.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.040]   And you're not alone.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.680]   That's a good news.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:57.000]   Google spent $106 million on two technologies,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.480]   a video compression company.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.520]   People think that this means that Google
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.960]   would be interested in gaming.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.120]   But given our conversation about HTML5,
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:13.560]   I wonder if this has something more to do with HTML5
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:18.000]   and streaming of video or for YouTube.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.600]   Any thoughts on the on-two acquisition?
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:23.840]   Gina, do you have any thoughts about it?
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:26.160]   Yeah, I mean, YouTube would be my first thought.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:29.320]   But yeah, this business stuff, I don't know.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.160]   Well, they'd like to get--
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.960]   I mean, I think everybody would like to get out
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.280]   from under Adobe's thumb.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.680]   Flash is so successful.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.240]   Adobe completely controls that platform.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:42.120]   If you took these codecs and open sourced them,
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.080]   it'd be the only way you could really overtake flash
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:44.880]   right now on the web.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.480]   And I think it's in everybody's interest
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.560]   that there be an alternative to flash.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.160]   Do you agree?
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.120]   Yes, definitely, definitely.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.840]   Every time my browser crashes, I agree even more.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.440]   And of course, Steve Jobs is Mr. Anti-Flash.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:01.080]   But I think in general, Flash doesn't work well on phones.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.000]   It's very resource heavy.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.960]   I mean, everything we do is on Flash.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:07.520]   Everything on YouTube is on Flash, except for the stuff.
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:11.960]   But also, these designers are trying to overdo things.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.080]   And that's a problem.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.760]   I think simplicity in standards is going
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.160]   to be far better than what you can do
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.360]   with something like Flash.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.400]   On to stuff works with mobile phones specifically,
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:26.120]   as well as lower powered devices like set top boxes,
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:29.360]   internet devices, DVD players.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.880]   Sony, Samsung both use O2 codecs.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:36.880]   Nokia uses O2 codecs.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.080]   It seems like actually a very good acquisition for Google,
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.520]   if they-- for a lot of different reasons.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:49.880]   Did you look at the new G2 handsets, Gina, that just came out?
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:50.960]   What do you think of those?
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:51.760]   Oh, I haven't.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.160]   But I'm lusting from afar.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.480]   I haven't gotten my hands on one, but they look really neat.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.880]   Although, I did see--
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.040]   I really love the physical keyboard on the G1.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:00.840]   And I just see--
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:01.240]   You lose that.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:01.740]   Yeah.
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:02.480]   Yeah, you do.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.640]   And someone who is much better at design and usability
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.360]   than I did did this great breakdown of--
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.280]   and I forget, I should look up the name--
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.200]   did this great breakdown of the iPhone virtual keyboard
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.360]   versus the Android virtual keyboard?
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.240]   And kind of said that Android just misses the mark
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:21.160]   in lots of thousand little ways and makes it a lot less
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:21.640]   usable.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.680]   And I have to say, I don't use the virtual keyboard
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:25.880]   in Android at all.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.160]   I always go for the physical keyboard.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.520]   So I'm not sure if the new handsets would do it for me.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.680]   I'm hoping that they can get the virtual keyboard a little
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:37.600]   bigger, a little more usable, as usable as the iPhone keyboard.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:38.760]   So we'll see.
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.840]   But yeah, I'm thinking about upgrading my hands out to something.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:42.720]   Do you love Android?
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.000]   I mean, you really think Android is great?
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:45.520]   I do.
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:45.840]   I do.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.480]   I love Android.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.480]   Listen.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.760]   I know you support it for political reasons.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:51.080]   It's open.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:51.800]   I do.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:52.320]   Yes.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.520]   But let's say everything is open.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.480]   Is Android still something you love?
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.360]   Yes.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:58.560]   Yes.
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:59.760]   Why?
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:03.440]   Mostly because of the Gmail client is excellent.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:07.640]   The fact that developers can create apps,
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:08.800]   and then they just show up.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.480]   So the App Store issue.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.280]   Also, there are things about Android, which are really good.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.440]   I really like the window shade, which
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.800]   is the bit in Android where you can pull down
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:21.640]   and get notifications, informative notifications,
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.560]   versus the iPhone's kind of modal pop-up.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.000]   I like that it can run processes in the background
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.360]   and give me push notifications.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.400]   That kind of thing.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.040]   Now, let me just qualify this by saying,
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.880]   I was never a full-time Windows mobile user or a Palm user.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.680]   So my kind of limited view was like I had an iPhone,
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.440]   and I was running Symbian on my Nokia,
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.040]   then I had the iPhone, and now I have the G1.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:46.920]   So I do really like Android very much.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.960]   I was talking to Sun Jake today, who just got back
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.160]   from Carnegie Mellon.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.600]   And we were lusting after the idea of a phone of the month
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.480]   club.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.320]   Yes.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:58.240]   That's what I want.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.840]   I visited Best Buy a few weeks ago,
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:03.360]   and I said, imagine if you could take the fools like me,
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.760]   who are, would we really just spend more money, but not--
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.080]   Just send me a new one every month.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.680]   We'd let's pass around.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.840]   We could do our own little twin thing.
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:12.000]   We could do it.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:12.760]   One of the month clubs.
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.880]   Like, pass it around.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:14.400]   Deal.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.600]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:16.120]   OK.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.800]   You get up first, because then we can take your teletypewood.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.240]   It only works with Sims, though.
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.480]   You have to use either T-Mobile or AT&T,
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.880]   because you've got to be able to pop the Sim out
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.640]   so I can pass it around, right?
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:26.160]   Right.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:26.680]   That's it.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.200]   That's it.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.720]   Have you gotten the new handset?
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:29.320]   Leo's you.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.240]   No, I'll get it.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.800]   And I'll send it to you.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.040]   That would be great.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.000]   I'm all over that.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.240]   I'll get it, and I'll send it to you.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.760]   You know, Motorola's got low cost Android headsets coming out.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.280]   I mean, I--
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.000]   What if they come out, you know?
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:42.840]   I don't know.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.160]   This G2 just came out.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.400]   I think you can get it now.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:48.280]   Yeah, like last week, right?
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:49.360]   This past--
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:49.760]   Right.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.280]   But I don't-- the Motorola is there just talking about it.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.880]   Is anyone going to come out with unlock was--
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:55.600]   there was a manufacturer in Australia
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:57.440]   that had a great looking one.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.200]   But at the last minute, they had to cancel it,
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.360]   because they had the wrong screen resolution.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.040]   But it was a decent price, and it was unlocked.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:07.880]   And if there were a market for Android phones,
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:11.080]   unlocked, full price, I'd go buy two or three.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.120]   I really would.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.120]   That's what I did with the G1.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.200]   I mean, I didn't unlock it legitimately.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.160]   But just send me an email.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.160]   I'll send you the site where you pay them $20 and get
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.160]   an account on a lot code.
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.040]   I'm actually running--
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.960]   I've got my AT&T card in my G1.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.520]   I'm still on my AT&T contract.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.560]   Oh, interesting.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.640]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:28.960]   I probably shouldn't be admitting this.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.600]   No, I think it's legal to--
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.280]   I think it's fully legal to unlock a phone, isn't it?
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.280]   It is.
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:34.960]   OK.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:35.880]   I believe so.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:39.720]   Maybe it's only in France, but it's legal somewhere.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.440]   But you only play a lawyer on TV like that.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.680]   Don't ask me.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:47.560]   But no, I believe that the FCC ruled it is legal.
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:51.120]   Now remember, the EFF is trying to get the copyright board
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.840]   to rule that it's legal to jailbreak.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:58.000]   And Apple is the one who sent a brief to the copyright board
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.520]   saying, "Jare like your iPhone terrorists, when?"
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:05.640]   It sounds like I'm kidding, but they actually said that.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:06.560]   That was insane.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.320]   That was just insane.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:10.680]   So can you imagine having a phone where AT&T service
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:11.520]   isn't working for you?
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.880]   I mean, that's never happened to anybody.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.280]   Shocking.
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.320]   So here's a-- this is interesting.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.840]   Ben just sent me this in our chat room.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:26.120]   This is-- go to youtube.com/html5.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:36.480]   This is a flash-free demo of video, high-def video on YouTube.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.840]   Rendered something with something called O3D,
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:43.040]   and it looks fantastic, and there is no flash.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.920]   So that's very YouTube.com.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:46.400]   It's--
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.920]   Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.840]   I guess we're closer than I thought.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:53.800]   Yeah, that's fabulous.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.560]   Three cheers.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:57.200]   Actually, it's quoted in JavaScript and HTML.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.520]   Now, I don't know if this is video of it,
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.680]   or if this is actually--
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:04.440]   maybe this is video.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.440]   Is this flash video?
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.560]   It would have to be, right?
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.760]   I'm looking.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:12.240]   O3D?
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.760]   Is this flash video of a rendered O3D,
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.840]   or is this, in fact, using no flash?
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.240]   I don't think-- if I right-click it
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:23.840]   and I don't get any flash stuff, there's no flash--
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:27.880]   There's no flash on this page.
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:29.320]   That's very interesting.
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:32.520]   Boy, that changes everything, huh?
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:35.680]   And that's in the Safari, which has a lot of HTML5.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.360]   I imagine Chrome it would run even better.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:40.600]   What do you think of the new Chrome?
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:43.120]   Faster, better, I'm liking it.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:43.720]   I'm liking it.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:47.040]   I'm sad that Firefox-- I mean, the one thing that makes
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.480]   Firefox great is that it's extensible is the one thing
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:52.880]   that makes it so damn slow and is creating this market
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.840]   for faster, better browsers.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:55.600]   I did Chrome.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.240]   I like it a lot.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.880]   I'm actually really interested to see what happens
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.960]   when it becomes as extensible as Firefox.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.760]   Somebody said Firefox is the new IE.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.760]   No.
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:06.720]   That hurts me because I love Firefox, so--
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.960]   Me too, but I think they might be right.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.640]   Oh, god.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:10.800]   I feel like they're just a general--
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.920]   That's like Fred John Kennedy did bad things.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.840]   Oh, no, no.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:16.080]   Gina doesn't remember him.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.400]   He was a president long before you were born.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.200]   Camelot.
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.720]   Camelot.
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.320]   A couple more stories real quickly before we wrap this up.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:27.080]   According to TechCrunch, actually TechCrunch,
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:34.960]   quoting a consultant, Google is worth 100--
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.120]   the Google brand, not Google the company,
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:40.360]   but the Google brand is worth--
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.440]   maybe this is your stat.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.400]   I won't steal it from you.
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.240]   Is this your stat?
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:44.000]   No, it's not.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.560]   You can get a bonus stat.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.480]   This is a bonus stat.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:49.920]   Microsoft-- last year--
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.680]   no, Microsoft came in second.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.600]   It's brand worth $76 billion.
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:59.240]   They say the Google brand worth $100 billion
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.760]   up from $86 billion last year.
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:04.000]   I don't know how you determine what a brand is worth,
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.160]   but that's what this company does.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:09.080]   It's the brand Z top 100.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.160]   Wow.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.520]   Yeah, wow.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.440]   $100 billion.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.040]   All right, time for--
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.640]   let's start with-- since I just did a stat,
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.880]   we'll let your brain calm down a cool off a little bit.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.160]   Gina, would you start by giving us your tip of the week?
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.040]   Yes, I will.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:29.880]   This tip is for anyone who runs a blog that has a feed on it,
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.800]   and it will enable Pub/Sub/Hub/Hub/Support
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:35.160]   in your feed, which means that it will--
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:38.480]   updates to it will show up immediately in friend feed,
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:42.240]   at least, and no doubt going forward in other products.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.520]   And Google Reader, I imagine, very soon.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.200]   So it's a good idea to enable it now.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:50.200]   And then when support comes in your updates will go out
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.000]   immediately.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.320]   You have to be using FeedBurner, which is really great
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.320]   service for managing your RSS feeds.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.140]   Lots of bloggers already use it.
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:01.440]   If you log into your FeedBurner console, this option isn't
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.960]   enabled by default, but it's super simple to enable.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:08.080]   When you're looking at your My Feeds list, click on the
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:11.540]   feed that you want to pub-sub-hub-ub-enable.
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:16.040]   And under the Publy Size tab, there's a list of services
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.280]   on the left side.
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.520]   You want to click on Ping Shot.
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.480]   And I'm not sure why it's called Ping Shot.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.840]   There's no mention of Pub/Sub/Hub-ub here.
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:25.640]   Maybe FeedBurner hates the name as well.
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:27.000]   I don't know.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   But if you click on Ping Shot, you can activate that service.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.160]   And what that means is that as more services support Pub/Sub/Hub-ub
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.680]   when updates to your feed happen, they will show up in
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.040]   those services immediately.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.080]   So it's just a matter of literally clicking a button
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.920]   that says activate there in FeedBurner.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.040]   And if you do that and re-publish your feed, hit up
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.680]   Friend Feed, post next time you do a new post to your blog,
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.320]   and it will show up instantaneously.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.160]   Very cool.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:01.240]   And besides Friend Feed, does anybody else support this yet?
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.080]   Not yet.
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.800]   At the CrunchUp demo, they had a beta version of Google
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.960]   Reader, which did support it, which is not
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.000]   publicly available yet.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.200]   But they tell me that they're just making sure that Google
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:11.240]   Reader can handle the load.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.760]   So I imagine that that will roll out soon.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:15.240]   It's certainly in testing.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:18.480]   And then presumably, as more and more people do this, other
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.520]   sites will support it.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:22.360]   It's an easy thing for, I think, for the other end of
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:23.040]   support, right?
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.160]   They just check the--
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:29.560]   You have to set up web hooks on the subscriber side.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:30.600]   Yeah, on the subscriber side.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.440]   So superfeeder.com, which is a service I don't use yet.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:36.040]   But I know that it does have Pub/Sub/Hub-ub support.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:38.160]   And I'm actually going to start hassling the Twitter feed
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:41.280]   people to maybe get this hooked up as well, because
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.400]   that would be fantastic.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.000]   And this is--
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.920]   I'm going to give you two tools, because I just realized one
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:47.640]   of the tools--
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:50.080]   what we were talking about Dave Weiner earlier, has a great
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.360]   way for adding somebody's Twitter feed to your Google
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.360]   Reader.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:56.560]   Have you seen that?
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.320]   Did you play with that?
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:58.320]   I love this.
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:57:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:02.400]   He generates an OPML file while your friends, right?
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.440]   Which is genius.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:05.560]   I mean, it makes the utter total sense, right?
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.640]   Because every single one of your friends essentially is an
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:08.680]   RSS feed.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:11.120]   An OPML, which is a little less known than RSS, is just a
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.760]   list of subscriptions.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:15.400]   So you can create this OPML file and suck it into your
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:16.280]   news reader.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:19.480]   And suddenly you're following everyone within your RSS
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:21.040]   reader versus Twitter itself.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.480]   It's genius.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:23.560]   I'm trying to find his post.
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:29.120]   If you go to his blog, it's probably there somewhere very
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:31.000]   easily found.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:31.840]   What is the name of it?
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.240]   The service that he wrote that he's using this with this?
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.440]   I've forgotten the name of that, too.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:38.520]   I'm so bad.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.960]   Getting old.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.560]   Anyway, I set it up for--
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:46.120]   he uses an example, Jason Cocky's Twitter feed.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.120]   I added it to my Google reader.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:47.800]   And it's very cool.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:52.120]   You could do this with anybody's follows and see what they
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:55.320]   see and put it in your reader, which makes a lot of sense.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.240]   I'm just scanning through his posts to see if I can find
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:58.240]   it, but I can't.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:04.520]   It's editor.opml.org/TwitterCalendartool.html.
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:09.680]   And this will show you the tool that will do it for you.
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:10.840]   Thank you, Gina.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:11.680]   Sure.
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:14.200]   I was going to mention a Google tool.
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.920]   And I hope I can do this every week.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.920]   I think there are enough tools I probably won't run out of
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:18.880]   tools.
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.840]   I don't know if you guys-- have you set up your Google
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:23.880]   profiles yet?
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:24.640]   Oh, yes.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:25.560]   You have.
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:26.080]   I have.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:26.800]   I love this.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:30.440]   And now I think that the time will come at some point.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:33.080]   This will make sense to do when Google starts surfacing
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:34.200]   these in search results.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:35.480]   Right now they show up at the bottom.
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:38.200]   If you search for Gina Trapani at the bottom of the page,
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:41.280]   you'll see her Google profile.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.920]   I think it should show up at the top.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:45.080]   And I'm lobbying Google to do this.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:45.600]   I agree.
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.160]   Because what it does is it gives you control over your
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.400]   Google search results.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:52.200]   You could say, these are the canonical search results.
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:56.000]   The ones I, as the controller of the name Leo LaPorte or
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.880]   Gina Trapani, believe you would want to find if you were
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:00.880]   searching for my name.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.200]   Have you done this, Jeff?
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:02.920]   No, I haven't yet.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.560]   What happens that another Jeff Jarvis, who's a jazz
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.840]   musician, he has the actual talent.
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.240]   And another one who runs Segway tours in Thailand, who has
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.640]   more fun than I do.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.920]   How do you determine which one of us gets it?
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.600]   All of them show up.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.520]   Yeah, and it's cool.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.800]   And then it includes in the search results kind of like
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.560]   details, like it'll say Jeff Jarvis, New York City,
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.600]   journalists, and versus--
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.000]   so in the search results, people can determine pretty
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.600]   quickly which Jeff they're looking for.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.480]   It's kind of like a wiki disambiguation.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.440]   You can choose which one you want.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.280]   This is my profile page.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.520]   If you go to google.com/profiles/loport, it
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.960]   uses by default, but doesn't have to.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.000]   Your Google email, your Gmail address, you can't have it
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.160]   use something that's a little more obscure, a very long
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.520]   string of letters and numbers instead, if you want to be
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.520]   more private.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.480]   And there's some nice features.
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.400]   You can edit the profile to include an about me page,
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.600]   some contact info.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.840]   You could say who could see the contact info based on your
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:02.320]   groups in your Google Calendar, or rather your Google Voice
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.840]   contacts, or your Gmail contacts.
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.680]   You can add companies you've worked for, places you've
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.960]   lived, it puts a little map on the page, it shows all of
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.080]   those.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.440]   It shows verified domains, which is great.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.560]   Google does that anyway.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:18.480]   I think if you have a Google account, you might have
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.720]   verified some of your email domains.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.200]   By adding these verified domains, people know these are
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.600]   really yours.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.960]   It asks about your superpower.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.040]   What's your superpower, Gina?
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.280]   Did you have one?
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.960]   It's hyperlinking at the speed of light.
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.000]   I love that.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.760]   I say leaps old media empires with a single bound.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.760]   There you go.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.440]   It's a little grandiose.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.480]   But anyway, you can have all your links in there and you can
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.080]   order them.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.920]   So I put my Wikipedia article, for instance, up top, then my
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.920]   official bio, then the netcast, and so forth.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.560]   So this gives you a page that people can go to.
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.880]   I don't know why it has Flickr photos in there, but it even
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.760]   lets you add your Flickr photo stream to it.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:59.360]   If you want your Google latitude, we'll show up in there.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.880]   That's because I have that tied to my status message.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.520]   But it's only visible to people who have my chat
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.080]   buddies.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:08.160]   And it has a name verification feature, which I think is great.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.320]   You can either use a credit card or a phone number.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.600]   If your phone number is listed, which mine is not, you just
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.640]   enter your phone number to look it up and say, oh, yeah, that's
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.440]   you.
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.120]   Otherwise, you provide it with a credit card.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.520]   I've already done that for Google checkout.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.800]   So it was able to verify that that's me.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.040]   And that's very handy because now when people search for my
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.960]   name and they find my name in the Google profiles, they can be
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.320]   sure that this is actually the actual Leo report or somebody
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.520]   actually named Leo report.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.360]   In the case of Jeff, it would be one of the several people who
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.120]   have your name and then shows verified email.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.280]   And this I really like.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:45.360]   I don't like giving out my email address, but you can send a
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.000]   message from here and it will end up in my Gmail box.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.640]   So it's kind of and it shows up as from the Google profile, which
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.240]   I think is really, really nice.
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.240]   I think this is a tool I would like to see more people use.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.400]   And then I would like to see Google surfaces in the Google
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.480]   results.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.840]   So it's easy to create one, either search for your name and
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:06.320]   at the bot.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.280]   I think that's what I did is I searched for my name and at
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:08.720]   the bottom.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:11.600]   It says your Google profile and you can create it and edit it
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.400]   and do more.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.320]   Or if you've already got a Gmail account, I think it may
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.520]   show up there.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.520]   Where else does it show up?
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.600]   Oh, I know.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.280]   It was the Google groups.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:26.480]   Gina, what do they call that?
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.040]   It showed up.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.120]   Kevin Marks showed me how to do it.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.240]   He was one of the guys behind this.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:34.040]   Worth looking into your Google profile, google.com/profiles
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:34.480]   to find out.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.720]   In fact, Dave Weiner, he suggested too that the more you
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.240]   could feed that kind of data to search, the more you get
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.760]   personalized search back, then you should be able to tell
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.440]   the search, here's who I am.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:43.640]   Yes.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.520]   And there you are.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.920]   Yes.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:49.200]   It's a way of controlling, somewhat controlling what
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.080]   people see about you.
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.240]   Doesn't eliminate the other results, but it gives them
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.080]   some approved--
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.760]   you want to find my sites.
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.560]   These are my sites.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.680]   I used to use a service called claim ID to do this, but
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.240]   nobody ever heard of claim ID.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.920]   This is kind of from Google, so it's a little bit more
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.120]   robust, I think.
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:09.400]   So that's my tool of the week, Google profiles.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.640]   And now it's up to you, Jeff, to make this show actually
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.040]   work with your tip of the week.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.040]   I'll do a non-Google stat here.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.640]   Your stat of the week, I should say yes.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.840]   Which is from Martin Langvald's Neiman Journalism Lab.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:23.040]   He looked at the stats from the National Association of
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.640]   Newspapers and Nielsen on newspaper usage.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.680]   And that sounds wonderful.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:30.400]   70.3 million unique visitors in June.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.040]   3.5 billion page views, 2.7 billion.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.160]   That all sounds great, right?
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.440]   But Martin then did some stats figuring it out in the
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.280]   zone and came out in the figure that all of that
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:46.520]   amounted to only 0.56%, a half a percent of online usage
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.040]   went to newspaper sites.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.120]   Say that again.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:53.680]   0.5% of time spent online--
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.720]   Holy cow.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.680]   --is spent newspaper sites.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:58.440]   Does that include readers, aggregators, RSS readers,
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:04:59.000]   that kind of thing?
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.320]   Everything according to Nielsen.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:05.800]   And it also means that any of the top eight traffic sites on
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.920]   the web-- Google, Yahoo, MSN, and all of its various names,
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:14.240]   Facebook, Fox Interactive-- all have more traffic than all
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:14.880]   newspapers.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.680]   Each one of them has more traffic than all
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.400]   newspapers combined.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.280]   Now, why the hell does this have to do with Google?
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:23.120]   I think it goes back to what Gina was saying earlier about
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.760]   a cloud architecture.
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.680]   And the notion that people have to come to your site all the
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.600]   time is just over.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.480]   And it's why, by the way, Mr. Murdoch charging isn't
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.520]   going to work because you're too small.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.880]   And the only way you're going to succeed in a competitive
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.240]   world of advertising is by getting bigger.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.440]   And the only way you've got to get bigger is by distributing
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:44.320]   yourself and making yourself embeddable on other people's
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.280]   sites.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:48.120]   And we'll see whether any newspapers actually do that.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.760]   But if they thought like Google that wasn't a plug, they
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:53.600]   would try to figure out how to get themselves out there more
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.000]   because this just shows how tiny they really are.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.080]   Wow.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.640]   No kidding.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.520]   And put up a paywall?
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:02.320]   Are you going to grow?
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.960]   Or are you going to shrink?
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.480]   Exactly.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.880]   0.5 to 0.05 to nothing.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.800]   You milk the cow until she dies.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.560]   It won't take long at this rate.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.040]   What would Google do is Jeff's book?
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.200]   You can find it in bookstores or get it on Audible.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.000]   Get it on Audible, podcast.com/google.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   And get it for free when you sign up for the gold account,
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.120]   Audible, podcast.com/google.
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.880]   Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.560]   Or just look for a profile, Google profiles.
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:33.200]   It's profiles.google.com/gina Trapani.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.400]   And you and your sister are so cute.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.560]   Just look at your pictures now.
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.320]   This is so much fun.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.320]   Thanks.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.000]   Yeah, it's really--
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:41.960]   Just a little tip.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.800]   The Flickr integration is great.
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:46.120]   But you can actually create a feed of just pictures of
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.240]   yourself, head shots.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.280]   Oh, you can?
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:48.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.960]   And then you can tell your Google profile, just pull
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.160]   pictures from this set that I approve.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.480]   So you can pretty--
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.720]   So you're doing kind of head shots, because mine have a lot
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:57.520]   of tourist shots.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.720]   So this is all pictures of Gina, which is actually--
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.160]   you're right.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.560]   That's what it should be.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.080]   Right, right.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:06.320]   So that you could have your head shots there and stuff.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:06.760]   Very cool.
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.040]   But you haven't verified your name, Gina.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:09.560]   I have it.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.600]   I was a little leery about the whole credit card situation.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.160]   I'm not hooked up with Google checkout yet.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.800]   But I should do the phone number thing.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.480]   You trust Google, don't you?
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.040]   I do.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:17.760]   I do trust them.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.440]   I just thought that the whole--
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.680]   honestly, when I set up my profile, I didn't see the
[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:22.800]   option to verify my name.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.680]   And then I saw that cool little green banner on yours and
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:26.880]   another reader of mine.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.080]   And I said, hey, how'd you do that?
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.800]   And then it's some roundabout process.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.040]   You have to go through Google, NAL.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:32.400]   You have to--
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.280]   That's what it is.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.040]   You're not groups.
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.560]   NAL, you have to have a NAL account.
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:36.160]   That's it.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.440]   And who has a NAL account?
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:37.960]   I love Google.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.680]   I didn't have a NAL account.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:43.240]   This NAL was Google's attempt to create a Wikipedia or a
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.280]   Mahalo or something.
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.880]   And it's just a crazy idea.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.320]   So I created a NAL account.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:50.120]   And then as soon as you create an account, it says, oh, you
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.760]   want to verify your name?
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.400]   Yeah, they need to streamline the name verification process
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.240]   a little more on Google Profiles, I think.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:01.600]   The whole thing, as with many Google projects, feels like
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.640]   kind of a redheaded stepchild that's so close to being
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:09.000]   something really, really useful if they would just give it
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.240]   some attention.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.080]   That's 20% time, man.
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.240]   It probably is a 20% project, isn't it?
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.680]   It probably is.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.880]   Well, hey, once again, another fantastic show.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.840]   Really fun to talk to you both.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.080]   smarterware.org for Gina.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.080]   Buzzmachine.com for Jeff.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.040]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.880]   I think you could probably figure out where to find me.
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:30.720]   Just Google me.
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.320]   And Google Twit.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:35.080]   That still works for the time being, anyway.
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.240]   And we'll see you next time.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.080]   Don't forget you could subscribe to this show by going
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:42.080]   to iTunes and searching in the iTunes store for Twig this
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.120]   week in Google.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.560]   Or just go to our Twit TV page, which is in the podcast
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.000]   providers section on the left there.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.640]   Also in the Zoom store and everything, we have it at
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:50.680]   Twit.tv.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:51.680]   Thanks, everybody, for being here.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.040]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google to the
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:55.960]   classical music.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:59.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:02.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.340]   (upbeat music)
