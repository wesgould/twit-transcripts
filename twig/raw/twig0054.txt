[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.720]   This week in Google, Episode 54 for August 4,
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.120]   2010.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.120]   Wave by by.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.120]   It's time for Twig.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.560]   This week in Google to show the covers, Google, the cloud,
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.800]   the Googleverse, and really pretty much anything
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.480]   on the internet we deem interesting.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.800]   Joining me right now, Jeff Jarvis, who is home writing today.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.600]   Great to see you once again.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.240]   Always wonderful.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.400]   Like blogging@buzzmachine.com, the author of What
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.160]   Would Google Do?
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.280]   He is writing his new book, Public Parts, which
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.080]   will be hit the public sometime this year, you think?
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.640]   Next year.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.600]   Next year.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.880]   Books take so long.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.360]   Thank you.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.920]   Stephen Levy calls himself a slow journalist.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.760]   He does slow journalism.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.120]   Gina Trapani is also here.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.440]   Gina is the author of the Complete Guide to Google Wave,
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.640]   a complete wave guide.com, and also a blogger, one
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.160]   of the founders of Life Hacker.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.120]   She's now blogging at smarterware.org and points west.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.560]   Good to see you.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.280]   Welcome back, Gina.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.720]   We missed you last week.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.160]   Thanks.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.760]   Great to be here.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.480]   I missed you guys too.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.920]   I didn't have my regular session.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.920]   My whole week was thrown off.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.120]   Our Google fix.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.840]   Our Google fix.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.360]   Speaking of fixes, I asked you, and you recommend,
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.200]   and I think it's probably the right thing to do.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.840]   I've been having my Droid X, which I love.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.280]   I still love this phone, but it's been hanging a lot.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.880]   It's been like--
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.640]   I launch mostly text messaging, and it goes--
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.400]   and I just have to wait forever, and then I get the--
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.800]   would you like to force close or wait message?
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.240]   That is the application dialogue of death.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.400]   As soon as that happens, I'm just like, ugh.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.240]   Well, I actually like it when that happens.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.400]   Online, because that's what I screwed it up.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.280]   I screwed it up, and it comes right back.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.840]   Well, I have screwed it up in some way.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.120]   Yeah, next is when I didn't have the problem.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.360]   And I think 2.2 is a lot better than 2.1,
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.960]   even though which is running on the Droid X.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.480]   But I just did a complete reset.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.720]   So we'll see if that fixes it or not.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.880]   So I saw that, I guess, Froyo came to the Evo,
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.880]   but it's not giving everybody all the functions.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.840]   Oh, really?
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.360]   I didn't see that.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.200]   So the Evo on the Droid.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.280]   They were going to get the keyboard and something else.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.400]   It's coming to the Droid today.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.600]   It came to the Evo a couple of days ago.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.080]   It's really-- 2.2 is coming out now pretty rapidly
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.440]   to a lot of the devices.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.520]   Which is so great, because I was so tired of hearing people
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.440]   crow about the fact that the Nexus 1 was the only phone that
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.120]   had 2.2, and I think it was Gruber that was saying.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.120]   Number of phones besides the Nexus 1 that have 2.2.0.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.560]   And I was like, ah.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.040]   So now it's great that it's kind of out in other places.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   So how are they handling it?
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.760]   Like on the Droid and the Evo, the Hot Spot,
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.320]   the portable Hot Spot and those things,
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.040]   are those things disabled?
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.040]   Does it depend on the carrier?
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.520]   Are they customizing the settings?
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.440]   Depends on the carrier.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.600]   Depends on the carrier.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.480]   Yeah, I forget what I saw this.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.720]   But yeah, that's the problem.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.760]   Well, and I think the other problem
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.920]   is that they couldn't really do anything until 2.2
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.200]   was open sourced, because with between HTC Sense,
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.480]   Motorola, Blur, and whatever Samsung calls there,
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.440]   I wish they would just throw all this stuff out.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.520]   I think one of the reasons I have trouble with the Droid X
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.720]   is it's Motorola's cruddy SMS seems to be the problem.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.200]   And if I--
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.760]   Well, it's just kidding.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.720]   It's the same problem with Bloatware of the old days.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.560]   They should give you the opportunity to just run Android.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.860]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.600]   It is kind of like all the install
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.080]   where that would come when you got a new PC.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.960]   The more I use it, the more I really feel like we
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.160]   are back to the days of Windows and Mac.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.640]   Android and iPhone, iOS.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.920]   It really feels very much like those days.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.120]   And a lot of the benefits and negatives of Windows
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.200]   are appearing on Android.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.920]   It's a very open, free choice marketplace.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.440]   And as a result, there's lots of crap where
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.280]   there's lots of dangerous stuff.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.680]   Most recently, you probably saw this story,
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:56.000]   a Chinese free wallpaper application, which gave--
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.480]   it was on the Android marketplace.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.080]   It's not anymore.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.600]   It was on the Android marketplace.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.120]   They say now over a million people downloaded it.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.680]   And it sent passwords, phone numbers, text messages,
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.200]   a bunch of stuff via email to the originating site.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.160]   It was more-- worse than spyware,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.520]   it was essentially a Trojan.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.360]   Of course, the same thing now coming up on the iPhone.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.960]   You probably saw jailbreakme.com allows you to do in the iPhone
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.480]   4 or any iOS 4 device in the iPads, or any iOS 3.1 device
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.520]   as well.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.240]   Go to a website, jailbreakme.com.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.240]   And it puts up a little slider that you slide in jail breaks.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.320]   And the reason you can do that is it
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.040]   course violates Apple's security.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.640]   The reason you can do that is it takes advantage of now
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.760]   a well-known hole in Safari with PDF and font rendering
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.840]   that allows any site to run arbitrary code on any iPhone
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.720]   or iPad.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.840]   In this case, it's been mine.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.400]   It's a jailbreak.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.280]   In fact, it's really been mine because the jailbreak then
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.200]   allows you to go to the Sidia marketplace where
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.600]   Soric has kindly put a fix for the hole that
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.480]   allowed the jailbreak in the first place.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.680]   That is the best story ever.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.680]   Is that meta?
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.960]   Yeah, right.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.760]   You want to fix your phone?
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.320]   You want to be secure?
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.280]   Well, Apple doesn't have a fix yet.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.080]   But if you jailbreak it, you can then fix it.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.880]   Exploit the vulnerability to fix the vulnerability.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.160]   Now, according to Android TAP--
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160]   and I think the chat room for passing this along--
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.560]   now, there's supposedly--
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.280]   this story of wallpaper has been debunked.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.040]   I don't really know.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.360]   Venturebeat had the original article
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.880]   that the wallpaper, created by Jackie,
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.060]   was sending information to China, Chinese website,
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.000]   iamnet.us.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.320]   Wall Street Journal repeated it, "See net fast company,
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.600]   fortune, PC world, computer world, gizmodo, Apple insider,
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:59.400]   and Leo Laport all jumped on the gun reporting the issue.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.840]   But the developer has a response.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.440]   And he denies it.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.960]   The look out, which is a program I have run on my Android phone,
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.040]   it's an anti-malware application, was the one that
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.200]   caught this program.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:25.680]   I guess I'm going to just say, I don't know.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.680]   But it does remain--
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.680]   This could happen.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.160]   That's right.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.040]   The fact remains that even if this didn't,
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.960]   it could easily happen.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.160]   Right.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.200]   That could happen, right?
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.000]   And this is my top wish list for Android security,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.560]   is that when you install an app and it says, hey,
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.800]   I need access to your network location, your contacts,
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.040]   your network activity.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.840]   I wish that there was a way that the app could briefly,
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.560]   very succinctly, just explain why.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.640]   You install the Pandora app and it says,
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.000]   I need access to your contacts list.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.680]   Well, why?
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.960]   Why would you need that?
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.440]   Just a little sentence that says,
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.640]   we want it to be easy for you to share a playlist
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.040]   with your friends via email.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.320]   That's why we need your contacts list.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.720]   It's like, OK, that seems reasonable.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.680]   I don't know if that would fix the problem.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.160]   But if you've found a whole wallpaper,
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.680]   you know, are you going to--
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.640]   You wouldn't give it network resources.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.600]   You wouldn't say, oh, well, you're going to send email?
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.160]   Right.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.720]   I mean, it doesn't fix it in the sense
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.880]   that it could ask for these permissions.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.960]   Most people ignore it.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.840]   And maybe it has a seemingly legitimate reason
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.440]   to ask for those permissions.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.920]   And you would say, OK.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.600]   Right, you can always fake the reason, right?
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.920]   But I mean, as someone who is kind of aware and very paranoid,
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.160]   I like to think healthily so.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.480]   But I OK through those permissions
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.040]   and think, why does this app need this?
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.320]   And I wish I didn't have to dig around to kind of figure
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.080]   figure that out.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.960]   Still, this could happen.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.960]   The wallpaper thing could happen.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.520]   It could happen on the iPhone as well.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.760]   It has happened on the iPhone.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.960]   I mean, in a way, that's what this jailbreak is.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.480]   And there was a case a couple of weeks ago on the iPhone
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.640]   where somebody was sending iTunes passwords out
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.320]   and was collecting iTunes passwords.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.440]   Here's the thing.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.640]   I think we've been app happy, haven't we?
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.720]   Let's play them ourselves.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.520]   We've been app happy.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.600]   We've installed anything we want, like crazy, hundreds of apps.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.080]   I've got close to 100 apps on my Android phone,
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.920]   according to AppBrain.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.720]   And many of them are free.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.200]   And so maybe we can't be so app happy now.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.440]   We have to be a little bit judicious.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:18.800]   I think--
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.280]   Maybe you go to the Jonathan Zitren view,
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.880]   which is that you need a safe spot and then a sandbox.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.080]   Well, and we talked about this on the security show today.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.560]   And the point was made that, well, the problem
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.800]   is it's a false sense of security,
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.480]   because even with Apple's draconian protection,
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.440]   stuff got through.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.840]   So there's no way unless you have source code echo.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.040]   You spend a lot of time with it, and you're really
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.760]   a security whiz that you can vet software.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.680]   So it is a false sense of security
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.640]   that we have this closed store.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.120]   They can check it, but there's absolutely no case where
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.800]   they can say they can give you a guarantee.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.400]   It's safe.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.800]   They can't and won't, you notice.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.640]   This is our new world.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.560]   It's true with news.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.480]   It's true with information.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.200]   It's true with everything else.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.600]   We had a false sense of security in the past
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.960]   that you could buy a Toyota and it was safe,
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.800]   or you'd read the New York Times and it was all true,
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.200]   or the Apple store is all safe.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.880]   Yeah, we're caveat life.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.440]   But Jean, I think your point earlier
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.120]   is important too, not just for software,
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.160]   but the Wall Street Journal had this, I think, absolutely
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.440]   ridiculous story this week.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.920]   I was saying, oh my god, there's cookies.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.520]   But you're kidding.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.480]   Later, they discovered cookies.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.680]   Fickens and tracking things and horrible things.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.920]   And it was just absolutely awful.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.880]   We wrote that.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.400]   It's the me for madness.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.040]   Oh, yeah, it's exactly.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.280]   And the cynical me, though, I don't really
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.040]   believe in conspiracy theories, the cynical me
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.120]   wants to say that just as Murdoch is
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.640]   behind a paint wall, a paint wall,
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.680]   and abandoning advertising, he's now
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.520]   trying to ruin everybody else's advertising business
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.160]   by making everybody, including the federal trade
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.760]   commission, freaked about cookies.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.120]   But anyway, we do need more transparency in the ad business.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.120]   And any site out there should put up an app that says,
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.440]   here are the cookies I have on you.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.480]   Here's the kind of advertising I give you as a result.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.560]   Here's why I do it.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.280]   And that should become our new standard of disclosure,
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.120]   whether you're making an app or making software
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.800]   or have a website.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.600]   That should be the proper thing to do.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.960]   You hear my droid noise? That means my droid just rebooted.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.280]   I did what is kind of the response to this app overload,
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.040]   which is to take everything off, start over, start fresh,
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.200]   and see if the reliability comes back,
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.520]   and then very judiciously, slowly re-add stuff.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.480]   One nice thing about this.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.800]   Yeah, I mean, this is the equivalent to, like, you know,
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.560]   killing, you know, wiping your hard drive
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.880]   and reinstalling windows, right?
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.880]   Welcome to Windows.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.880]   Yeah, welcome to Windows.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.720]   Yeah, welcome to Windows.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.280]   This is back to the Windows W.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.280]   Was that bad?
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.280]   It was unusably bad.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.120]   Yeah, it would just hang, hang, hang.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.440]   And I couldn't, well, I showed Gina before the show began
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.280]   while you were rebooting.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.280]   And yeah, it was unusable.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.960]   And it was to the point where I'm about to go on a week-long trip
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.880]   and I packed my Nexus One and my iPhone
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.160]   because I want to make sure I had something that worked.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.400]   Thank God for Google Voice.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.560]   One number calls all three of them.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.840]   So I don't really need any particular phone.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.640]   I think this is, you know, this is, okay,
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.480]   I'm going to pull an Apple here and say,
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.480]   hey, it's the same for everybody.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.360]   You know, we got problems with our antenna.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.720]   They got problems with our antenna.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.000]   We got application problems.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.160]   They got application problems.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.080]   It's, we're in an app happy environment.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.720]   We got it back down and slow down.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.480]   And because it's just like the PC,
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.200]   these are computers for crying out loud.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.680]   That's what's really happened.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.480]   These are computers and they're a prime target for bad guys
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.200]   because they're always connected.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.160]   There's lots of ways to make money on a cell phone,
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.480]   all sorts of sneaky things you can do.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.120]   It makes sense.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.920]   Is there a market demand for a,
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.240]   what the heck was the name of the company
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.480]   that used to check all our appliances?
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.800]   Huh?
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.400]   Remember Uncle Leo, you know,
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.280]   just do it. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.440]   Underwriters lab.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.520]   Underwriters laboratories.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.760]   We need an underwriters lab for apps.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.760]   That's a great idea.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.960]   Yeah, and who pays for it is the app maker.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.240]   I want my app certified with the UL cert.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.880]   - That's a really good idea. - Interesting.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.200]   Not a bad business either.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:29.160]   Scales, well, and again, Leo, you're right.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.200]   You're gonna, things will get through,
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:36.000]   but you'll be in a position where you can find out immediately
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.360]   when that happens and deal with it.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.200]   - Right.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.960]   - Of course, there's gonna be a very,
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.680]   and this we're gonna have to deal with as well,
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.120]   a very small subset of apps that are approved
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.680]   because you just can't approve them all.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.040]   And it's gonna take some serious expense.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.680]   How much would you pay for a service like that?
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.920]   Would you pay five or $10 a month for a service like that?
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.200]   - Well, no, actually that's not who pays.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.760]   I think the app creator pays.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.320]   - Oh.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.160]   Yeah, but there's so many free apps on Android.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.320]   That's not gonna work. - That's the problem.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.840]   Well, but at some point-- - So you will pay.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.680]   You know what?
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.520]   You will pay.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.600]   You'll be paying for every app instead of--
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.200]   - It will. - All the freebies.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.600]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.360]   But if you get a million downloads of an app divided
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.520]   by what would it cost?
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.960]   I mean, I don't know what this task would be.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.200]   How would you underwrite an app?
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.440]   - I think what you would have extensive testing,
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.200]   which means that you would have all the phones
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.120]   and you have a lot of testers who would put every app
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.440]   on the phone, you'd do wire shark to make sure
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.320]   that the app wasn't sending data.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.920]   So you'd have to have monitor the network activities.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.720]   You'd probably have to have lots of debugging.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.040]   Gina, you're probably more adept at this than I am,
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.960]   but there's debuggers that you can run on the phone, right?
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.160]   Can you watch a compiled app run?
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.720]   - You can watch a log.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.760]   There's an Android log that you can watch
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.880]   on a compiled app.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.080]   Actually, that's a good question.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.200]   I'm not sure if a final release build app run.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.040]   - You know what you could do?
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.760]   You could demand source code.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.280]   You could say, "Look, you wanna be certified
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.480]   by us for the app?" - Yeah, just for the app.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.920]   - We will protect your source code.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.800]   We're not gonna let it go, but you need to give it to us
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.320]   so we can vet it.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.080]   - I would love to just have a wire shark.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.240]   I would just love to know,
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.800]   when is this app hitting a URL and what is that URL?
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.760]   What is, you know, what IP addresses in URLs
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.960]   is this app requesting and sending information to?
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.760]   - And some of that could run on the phone.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.400]   I mean, I don't know what lookout does
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.360]   and I'll have to look into this
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.040]   'cause I have looked out every time you download an app,
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.400]   it scans it.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.600]   But I don't know what it's doing.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.160]   Is it scanning for a virus signature?
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.360]   Well, that's not very effective.
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.840]   What you'd want is something that had some heuristics
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.840]   that was watching what was going on in the phone.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.000]   And you could, I don't see any reason why you couldn't do this
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.440]   on an Android device.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.680]   You can't do it on an Apple device,
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.320]   but you could do it on an Android device
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.840]   where the things aren't so sandboxed
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.600]   and you could watch every bit of activity
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.080]   and say, "Whoa, that's something I don't want to have happen."
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.920]   Can't you? - Right.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.040]   - Or stuff, two sandboxed to do that.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.760]   - I feel like that should be possible
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.960]   to just monitor network firewall essentially.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.600]   You know, there's connection requests going out,
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.720]   you know, approved and I.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.960]   - Oh, I like that.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.160]   - You know, so I love it if I installed an app
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.280]   and it said, you know what, when you,
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.880]   Pandora.com is gonna make request to Pandora.com.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.360]   And also, I'm gonna steal your stuff.com.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.920]   Like, I can disallow.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.440]   - You know, we've just invented Gina?
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.440]   You use your access control, you AC.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.160]   - Well, yeah, right.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.600]   - That's why Windows has it.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.160]   It says, "Wait a minute, you got a strong firewall.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160]   You have the operating system saying,
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.760]   somebody's trying to modify some operating system stuff.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.760]   You sure you want to allow that?"
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.440]   And that's how you protect yourself.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.920]   - And wouldn't that work better too,
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.920]   that if that morning system were networked up
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.040]   so that on the day when somebody puts out a new app
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.160]   and suddenly, you know, a thousand people downloaded it,
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.800]   there's an uh-oh sign that goes out.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.640]   - Yes.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.520]   - Well, okay, we've solved it.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.880]   (laughing)
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.720]   We've solved it.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.160]   Yeah, Underwriters Lab could get a lot of,
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.640]   or this phone Underwriters Lab could get a lot
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.880]   of very great free publicity by not only protecting
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.160]   its subscribers, but by allowing, you know,
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.800]   and announcing this stuff to the world as it should.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.160]   - Right.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.440]   - And it looks like someone on Twitter
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.720]   just told me there's an app called aSpotCat,
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.560]   which lists your apps by permission.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.920]   So there's some of this going on now.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.800]   People are writing apps to manage your apps
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.800]   and tell you which apps cost you money.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.600]   In fact, I got a really sad email from a Twig listener
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.480]   who told me that he had listened set up
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.040]   on his mobile device, he's in Ireland,
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.320]   and it was set to download even when he was just not
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.040]   on wifi and he had a $40 sell bill
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.280]   because it downloaded an episode of the show.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.040]   - Oh, that's pretty bad.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.360]   - He said, "I could have bought so many copies
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.440]   of your book with that money."
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.280]   And I said, "Yeah."
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.560]   - Oh, I'll set you $40, Gina.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.560]   (laughing)
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.240]   - Not like we made extra money, but I'll set you $40.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.720]   So by the way, that was a Wall Street Journal article
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.440]   by Julia Angwin that you were talking about, Jeff.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.280]   You actually have a good blog post.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.480]   - Yeah, it was just filled with scare language.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.840]   I don't know the blog post right in the front.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.000]   - "Hidden inside Ashley Hayes BD's computer,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.720]   a tiny file helps gather personal details about her
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.760]   to be put up for sale for a tenth of a penny,
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.760]   the file consists of a single code for C812DB9227."
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.600]   Da-da-da-da.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.160]   That secretly identifies her as a 26 year old female
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.040]   in Nashville, Tennessee.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.280]   It's a cookie!
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.280]   - Hide the children!
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.120]   - Oh!
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.600]   (laughing)
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.240]   The cookie, that ate Ashley.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.120]   - It uses all kinds of language like, you know,
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.120]   the Wall Street Journal has discovered,
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.840]   surveillance technology, tracking technology, intrusive,
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.840]   no warning, surreptitiously respawn rich databases.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.800]   So powerful and ubiquitous.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.280]   And my favorite is targeted ads can get personal.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.280]   Well, yeah.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.360]   - Da-da.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.400]   Have you ever heard of this thing called Facebook?
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.720]   The nose, far more about you than any tracking cookie.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.040]   - And you know, the discussion that gets,
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.640]   that then gets on is the memes that you can hear back
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.760]   are the tropes you can hear back are,
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.200]   well, no one knows they're being tracked.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   - Huh?
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.040]   - That's stupid.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:00.880]   - Huh?
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.880]   - You know, and just everything should be private.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.320]   Well, like what?
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.120]   It's one of the journal letters went after me and said,
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.640]   well, I guess you want everybody to live in your class house.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.160]   No, I don't.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.440]   But I do want the web to be supported, financially.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.480]   And if the FTC came along and the EU came along
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.520]   and outlawed all tracking,
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.520]   you would have nothing but dancing monkey ads on sites.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.360]   - Right.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.920]   - And the CPM would be about two cents.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.360]   And then you really couldn't afford to do content online.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.600]   - I do have to say that some of what they're saying here
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.440]   is perhaps a little alarming.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.960]   The study found that the nation's 50 top websites on average
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.480]   installed 64 pieces of tracking technology,
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.480]   probably mostly tracking cookies, I would think,
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.120]   out of the computers or visitors, usually with no warning.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.040]   - Not most of them, but I got a lot of response from people
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.040]   who said that some of that doesn't have anything
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.280]   to do with third party, doesn't have anything to do
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.120]   with advertising.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.600]   It's tracking your site.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.440]   - Right.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.280]   It's preferences.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.120]   Where you stop reading.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.120]   - There's a story to be done about how stuff goes
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.480]   off the wrong way and how it can go to third parties
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.960]   and how it can be used badly.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.520]   But the irony here is that none of those sites
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.400]   they write about has personally identifiable information.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.680]   The one site that does the Wall Street Journal.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.520]   - Yeah, isn't that funny?
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.320]   - It has, my credit card, my name,
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.800]   my address, my phone number.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.640]   - Right.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:27.000]   - And it sells advertising based on household income
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.360]   and tracking.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.080]   It offers all kinds of things.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:30.920]   - Whoopsie.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.240]   - It does combine PII with other data.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.680]   I don't mean to be a conspiracy theorist here,
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.080]   but I really think that it's suspect the way they're doing
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.520]   this, oh my God, treatment, just as Murdoch was in Australia
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.840]   saying that he's discovered the new business model
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.600]   for the web and it's payables.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.640]   - Oh, so you think this is, oh, I hope that's not the case.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.600]   - I hope not too, but it just, it's just so,
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.320]   it's so wing nutty and strange.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.400]   And meanwhile, the Journal did another story about how,
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.720]   in the IE, there was a huge debate
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.320]   and the developers wanted to put IE out with a default
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.760]   of absolutely no tracking and the business side
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.240]   went berserk, of course, they owned that agency.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.160]   They did a story, a shock story the other day about,
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.800]   I think we talked about this last week about RFID
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.000]   on your pants, putting the woman.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.800]   - Yeah, we talked about this last week.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.880]   - I found more since then, the woman they could,
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.880]   they quote, "believes that RFID is the mark of the beast."
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:34.120]   - Yeah, well it is, it is, Satan uses RFID, we know this.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.280]   - You know, he's tagged all the demons in hell
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.600]   because it's a big inventory issue.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.440]   - There are a lot of demons.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.560]   - There are a lot of this going on here
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.320]   that I think can be damaging to the economic health
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.280]   of the web.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.040]   - Somebody said in the chat room, and I think this is good,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.200]   that sometimes all of this background noise
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.760]   about privacy obscures the real issues about privacy.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.440]   We get, it's a witch hut, we get concerned
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.880]   about the wrong thing, or there's so much of it,
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.240]   we just tune out.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.440]   - I put up a video that was backed by the German government
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.480]   that on my side, that shows a guy going through a store,
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.280]   and this is the trope you got there in Congress
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.800]   or in Germany, oh my God, people are watching me shop.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.480]   Well, yeah, I can go to a store right now
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.320]   and watch you shop.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.720]   - I'm standing right here watching you shop, lady.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.160]   (laughing)
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.240]   - Well, but you would agree, Jeff,
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.760]   as that there are some things to be concerned about.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.960]   - Yes, absolutely, and that's the problem
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.400]   is that we go so wing nutty and so emotional,
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.840]   we don't deal, as the chat room says,
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.680]   with the issues that are legitimately there.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.120]   And then the other argument that I'll make
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.640]   is that we also get so panicky
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.240]   that we don't want to do anything anymore in public,
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.880]   even as much as we used to do on the street.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.480]   - You know, I remember this lesson from,
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.000]   I think it was sixth or seventh grade,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.320]   when we went, I mean, really a long time ago,
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.400]   'cause I'm an old guy.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.760]   - No, no, just last week.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.280]   - '60s, and we went to a power plant.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.280]   It was a regular cold burning power plant
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.480]   in Providence, Rhode Island.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.800]   I remember it was there because I lived near it
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   and every morning there'd be this soot
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.880]   that had spewed out every night on my windows.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.240]   And everywhere we went in the plant,
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.120]   it had signs, you know, think, it was ecology,
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.360]   it was the word then, think ecology, think green,
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.640]   think the earth.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.160]   And I remember, I had a very smart teacher who said,
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.560]   yeah, I see all these signs.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.800]   Why do you think all those signs are there?
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:28.800]   I said, well, I don't know,
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.000]   they have a commitment to ecology?
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.120]   No, because they don't have a commitment to ecology.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.360]   They want to numb you to ecology.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.240]   So by beating the drum, you think, oh yeah, good,
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.800]   therefore ecology and you don't pay any attention
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.760]   to the soot on your windowsill.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.240]   And in a way, I think that this might be the same thing.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:49.120]   By beating the drum about privacy over the wrong things,
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.840]   people like perhaps Rupur Nork are numbing us
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.400]   to the very real concerns that we should be worried about.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.360]   Is that, like what you're saying?
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.040]   - Yeah, and I think the other thing that happens is,
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.080]   I haven't blogged this yet, but you have the case
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.880]   of the Blackberry being outlawed in the UAE
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.400]   and almost in Saudi Arabia and India.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.800]   You also, you have this odd relationship of government
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.400]   to data where in the EU, ironically,
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.280]   the government is trying to keep search engines
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.840]   and such to keep personal data longer
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.760]   so the government can get its hands on it.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.720]   - We're waiting for a news at,
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.440]   just a couple of minutes from Google
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.560]   and I know there's an acquisition,
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.360]   but there's news, Gina, that you're gonna be very
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.680]   excited to hear.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.040]   - I, you've lost me.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:32.880]   I haven't said anything.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.200]   - I got you got very quiet.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.800]   - Because I am reading the news.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.160]   I'm very happy about this news.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.360]   It doesn't have anything to do with Google, but--
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.000]   - But that's what they do with you.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.600]   - It does have to do with me.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.760]   - I mean, I don't know if your marriage is considered legal.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.280]   It probably isn't in the state of California
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.120]   to be to prepping.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.600]   - It is actually, we got married before prepping past.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.920]   So we're one of the 19,000 couples in California
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.280]   who are legally married, but a judge just struck down
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.840]   prepping, which will allow gay marriage in California.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.720]   Right now, it's, this is the decision suspected
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.600]   to be appealed in the Supreme Court,
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.960]   but I'm very, very happy that my friends
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.160]   can now have the same limited edition legal right
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.400]   that I had.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.880]   - Huge news. - Bravo.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.560]   - Everybody run out and get married.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.720]   Before they choose the month, we did.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.280]   - How long was the last window, Gina?
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.200]   - What's that?
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.040]   - How long was the last window?
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.120]   - It was June till November, I want to say.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.520]   So it was like six months.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.720]   - Wow, I think that's, I know that there are people
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.720]   who think that's terrible news.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.760]   I think it's, it couldn't think of better news.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.040]   It's really wonderful.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:35.880]   - Pretty happy.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.720]   - A blow stroke for truey.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.840]   - And that's why I've been so quiet
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.320]   as I've been reading the news and quietly.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.520]   And let me guess, Twitter.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.280]   - Yeah, Twitter, well, yeah, Jenny just tweeted
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.920]   that she was going to run out and marry a lesbian
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.840]   just because she can.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.920]   (laughing)
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.440]   - I was looking for a boy anywhere.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.520]   - Anybody anywhere.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.440]   (laughing)
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.440]   - Have fun.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.920]   - And that's exactly how I found a tweet deck
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.040]   is running in the background here.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:25:59.880]   So.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.000]   - I just, I, now it is a story for us
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.160]   because that really is how we get our news now, isn't it?
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.800]   It's not how you, you know, I immediately then did
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.280]   Google search and found a story in, let me see.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.440]   I didn't, you know, I didn't even pretend
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.480]   I'd touch the source.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.560]   The Hollywood Reporter of all things.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.800]   But, but that was, I went to news.google.com, found the store.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.520]   I did a Google search and found a new Google news story.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.160]   But, your first notice is Twitter.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.960]   Or in my case, our chat room, which got it from Twitter.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.680]   That's, I think it's a huge C change.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:32.400]   I think we see it again and again and again.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.360]   Twitter is the first line of news information.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.360]   - That's true.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.160]   I actually had a hard time finding it in Google news.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.640]   And I just went to LA times.com because, you know,
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.840]   Google just had kind of like breaking, you know, or CNN
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.800]   just has breaking, federal judge.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.760]   But there doesn't seem to be a story that you can click on.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.640]   So, but yeah, Twitter is the way you get the news
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.600]   up to the, up to the second news for sure.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.760]   That's how I, that's how I, that Michael Jackson died.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.240]   And I mean, made your news events in recent times
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.880]   as it's all been about from Twitter.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.600]   - There's great tweets here too.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.400]   Love wins.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.680]   Does this mean Tom Cruise can come out now?
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.520]   I love this one.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.920]   It was retweeted by somebody at Google.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.320]   If Rubenville said, if Prop 8 flips,
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.360]   I'm one step closer to marrying my dog.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.520]   Cause you know, that's where it's going to lead to.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.640]   - Oh, of course.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.480]   Of course it is.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.720]   - Sure.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.560]   Sure.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:26.480]   You know, what's wrong with marrying your house pet?
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.640]   I don't think anything.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.080]   Love wins anyway.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.560]   Did you see, we're going to wait for that Google news.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.840]   And we also have news of a,
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.360]   just broke of a Google acquisition.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.760]   Let me take a little break quickly here
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.720]   for one of our sponsors.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.720]   You're listening to this week in Google,
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.920]   Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.960]   And just the three of us today because we,
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.520]   we just kind of want to get back to basics.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.640]   We'll have some special guests on next week, of course,
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.720]   as always.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.240]   But I do want to thank our friends at Ford.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.680]   I was out of town over the weekend, Friday and Saturday
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.960]   to visit Detroit.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.600]   Had a great time, actually truthfully, Dearborn.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.960]   Kind of outside Detroit,
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.880]   where the Ford's amazing Rouge plant is.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.880]   They call it the Rouge.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.680]   It is one and a half miles by three quarters miles
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.000]   at its peak 100,000 workers building cars.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.600]   And Henry Ford's conception was in 1929,
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.760]   I think during the Depression, when he built this,
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.840]   you build a plant that limestone iron ore
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.320]   would go into via trains and cars come out the other end.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.680]   It's not quite that way nowadays.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.760]   Suppliers, of course, all over the world,
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.920]   make parts for Ford cars.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:40.600]   But it's still an amazing example of human ingenuity, high tech.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.920]   We went down, we were able.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.240]   And if you want, we have three Twitch specials
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.680]   based on our visit to the Rouge plant and the Maker Fair.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.520]   There's a Maker Fair visit because we had a great time.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.200]   It was fun to see the kind of the 20th century center
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.600]   of innovation juxtaposed with this 21st century innovation.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.480]   And I have to say, the Ford plant we visited, the F-150 plant,
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.520]   has a green roof that lots of solar.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:07.920]   When we went inside, it's open and airy.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.720]   You could eat off the floor.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.680]   I mean, it's really a very different experience nowadays.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:19.240]   So it's just fascinating to watch American industrial era stuff
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.200]   enter the 21st century.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.920]   And I thought the juxtaposition with the Maker Fair
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:22.440]   was great.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.160]   Four specials, if you go to twit.tv/specials,
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.600]   we have an assembly line special.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.160]   We've got very rare privileged access
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.520]   to actually go down on the assembly line.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.080]   I rode the line.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.000]   And we did that live.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.720]   And we got great video from that.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.280]   Then under the test track, where I
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:44.480]   rode a Shelby Cobra Mustang and took a ride in the F-150 Raptor
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.560]   over the bumpiest down digit.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.880]   I mean, it was amazing.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:51.000]   And then, of course, I crashed a flex into a Fiesta.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.160]   But that's another story.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.640]   It's on the video.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.640]   It has this automated parking thing where you pull up
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.080]   and it says, I can fit into this.
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.320]   And then you press a button.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.280]   And the wheel starts to spin.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.640]   It parks you.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.800]   But I didn't realize you're supposed
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.560]   to put the brake on after you park.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.920]   And I just kind of sat there.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.760]   And the car is in idle.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:08.960]   And so it starts going backwards.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.200]   And it hits a Fiesta by me.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.120]   I'm like, oh, that felt terrible.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.680]   But no damage, which is in a way a testimony.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:15.960]   All right.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.080]   When you're riding the line, I have visions of you
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.080]   at South by Southwest.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:20.760]   It was like that.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.200]   It was like--
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.360]   Well, it was very much like a crowd surfing.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.160]   Because it's a pop-a-raider by Stubbock.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:25.720]   It's moving.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.000]   I don't know.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.440]   It's moving.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.840]   It's not moving super fast.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.360]   But it's really kind of a neat thing.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.520]   And the line, actually, it stops sometimes
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.080]   and it moves.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.960]   There's a whole thing it's doing.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.600]   It's very fascinating to watch.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.160]   Not robots at the part-- we were watching the finishing stuff.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.240]   But robots, part of it, certainly, not where we were.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.800]   We saw the Koch Mentos show at Maker Faire.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.120]   The Power Wheels Racing was something to see.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.520]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.520]   All of this brought to you.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.760]   And I want to thank Ford by Ford and Voice Activated.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.320]   I think the in-car communication and connectivity system
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.120]   in my Mustang that I love so very much true hands-free
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:58.760]   calling.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.720]   So you never miss a call.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.560]   Turn by turn, voice directions.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.920]   911 assist, voice activated music, podcast browsing.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:10.160]   And I love this on the Droid X. When a text message comes in,
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.360]   there's a little bong.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.080]   And I press a button, or I could say, go ahead, read it to me.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:19.080]   And a very nice female voice reads me my text messages.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.760]   On the end, amazing.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.280]   I love it.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.440]   Personalized traffic alerts, weather, and a whole lot more.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.880]   It's like the car is alive.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.520]   And does your bidding?
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.400]   Give it a shot.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.000]   You can go find out more.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.680]   There's videos there at SyncMyRightpodcast.com.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.200]   Or, of course, you're Ford Lincoln, our Mercury dealer.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.440]   It's a standard in some models, optional, and others.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.280]   My recommendation, if you've got a choice, get the sync.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.920]   Thank you, Ford, for your sponsorship back.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.240]   We come to this week in Google.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.760]   Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.160]   Gina, are you watching the other news?
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.960]   I know you've probably been tweeting like crazy, but--
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:58.800]   Yes.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.040]   So the Google News just broke.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.160]   Google's no longer going to update, no longer
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.240]   going to develop Wave as a standalone product.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.320]   What?
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.600]   Are you sad?
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.280]   I'm sad.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.920]   I'm pretty sad.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.320]   I mean, the good news is there are tons of open source code
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.360]   out there that they can use in other products,
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.200]   that other people can use in their products.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.080]   They're going to keep Wave the site up until the end of the year.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.000]   And I believe there's going to be some good data liberation
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.280]   features so people can get their information out of Wave.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:27.960]   Oh, dear.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.360]   This is a big capitulation.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.880]   Wow.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.560]   That's got to be hard on you, Gina, because you wrote this whole book.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.240]   I love Wave.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.280]   I mean, I love Wave.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.560]   And I thought it was super useful.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.640]   And I really was hopeful for its adoption.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.000]   But it just didn't see the adoption that they hoped.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.680]   Yeah, but it's not an indictment of Wave.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:51.080]   I think it was an indictment of Google's execution of it.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.280]   That's a bit of a shock to me.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.720]   I mean, I can see that it wasn't taking off.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.120]   And that's pretty obvious.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:56.720]   It wasn't.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.480]   But it's like Buzz, which is not really taking off.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.480]   And I have the same feeling about Buzz that you have about Wave.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.760]   I haven't written a book about Buzz, but I practically could.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.960]   And you just kind of don't want them to give up so fast.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.880]   It's just barely over a year old.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.560]   It's true.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.080]   It's true.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.160]   But from what I heard, they had a million active users,
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.520]   which in Google's world is not just not very much.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.800]   I mean, I think that when Google develops a product,
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.160]   then it just doesn't get that adoption.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.840]   I think there's a lot of pressure for products
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.560]   to do super well.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.000]   And I think even though Buzz hasn't seen the uptake of a Facebook
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.720]   or a Twitter, I think that it still has incredible uptake.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.840]   I mean, I'd argue that's because it's connected to Gmail.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.920]   But I think that they did some amazing things with Wave.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.440]   So they really pushed the edges of what can happen
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.680]   and when a browser.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.840]   And I thought it was-- I just always
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.480]   love the project because it was so ambitious.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.480]   But--
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.520]   Do you think it was too ambitious?
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.120]   I think it was too-- I think that-- honestly,
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.720]   I thought that Wave was just--
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.840]   I think that Wave is just way ahead of its time.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.800]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:00.040]   Are they removing people and functions over to Docs or--
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.480]   You know, I think that they're going
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.280]   to be incorporating some functionality in other products.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.680]   But there's no specific news about which features
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.760]   and which products.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.600]   Could I make a suggestion?
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.520]   I think that what Docs is missing,
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.560]   one of a couple of things, is a great project manager.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.440]   Plug it into Docs as the project management tool
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.680]   that ties into other Docs.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:25.520]   I think people would love it.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.120]   Interesting.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.280]   Yeah, if they kind of molded it into a PM tool,
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.280]   which they really could with the to-do list.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.800]   And that's an excellent suggestion.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.480]   I think where they turned wrong, frankly,
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.640]   was right at the beginning when they said
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.960]   this is a replacement for mail.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.120]   And everybody said, no, it's not.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:40.960]   Yeah, that was a--
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.200]   It's a project manager.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.880]   That's what it always has been.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.640]   Yeah, that was definitely a misstep.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.320]   I think even the Wave team would agree that saying it's
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.560]   the next email was a misstep.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.960]   I think the big problem with Wave was, what do I do with it?
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.960]   Anything you want.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.120]   What do you want to do with it?
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:57.920]   That's too free for.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.600]   People need a very specific use case.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.480]   It needs to fulfill a need, a clear specific need.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.200]   And it really didn't.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.280]   It did everything.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.120]   It was whatever you want it to be.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.000]   But it was also just super complicated
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.880]   and had a lot of requirements.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.240]   It was ramp up to learn.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.360]   So I mean, I'm bummed.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.800]   Obviously, I wrote a book about it.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.720]   I love the product.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.720]   I hope that the protocol doesn't die.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.520]   I hope we see some of the other features.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.920]   I mean, some of the most useful features,
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.880]   the features that had developers kind of standing up
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.360]   in their chairs at Google I/O, not this year, but last year,
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.200]   was like live typing, live updates,
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.440]   and being able to drag and drop images into a wave
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.280]   and see them pop up as they load.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.080]   I mean, those are things that are all happening now
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.920]   and are possible in tools that we already have.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.160]   Like Docs.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.120]   Docs is not nearly as fun as wave though,
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.360]   as far as I'm concerned.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:45.800]   No.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.960]   So it's kind of a bummer, I have to say.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:55.520]   Do you think it was too free for,
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.960]   and it was difficult to understand.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.360]   It was a little chaotic.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.480]   But I think the thing that--
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.680]   we've seen this before.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.280]   Products are just ahead of their time.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.280]   You don't have a reasonable depth.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.080]   People didn't know how to use it,
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.320]   and they needed to give it time, not for users to come on,
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.040]   but for developers to come on.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:17.200]   It's very easy for a product to move too far ahead of.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.840]   You have to be just right.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.040]   You can't be old hat.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.240]   You can't be too new.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.320]   You kind of have to hit in the middle,
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.560]   and I think it was just--
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.760]   maybe-- well, that's sad.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.160]   So, Borgina, you're on a roller coaster today.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.320]   I know, it's like, oh, I get a salary.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.360]   Oh.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.120]   They say, yeah, they knock you down.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:37.960]   They did.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.880]   I mean, I'm sad that they didn't give wave a little more
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:40.760]   of a chance in Gmail.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.880]   I would have loved to have seen some sort of good Gmail
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.720]   integration to give wave the chance that Buzz had.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.840]   I mean, the original use case was like,
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.440]   don't you hate those group emails
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.560]   with that everybody hits reply all,
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.400]   and you get a stack of messages?
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.400]   Edit one wave.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.520]   So I would have loved to have seen,
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.680]   and that was my favorite use case,
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.880]   was having a small group discussion.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.360]   So I'm sad that it didn't make it in a Gmail,
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.960]   but it didn't see the uptake.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.040]   And they-- and they-- I mean, you also
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.560]   have to respect a company that can look at a product
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.600]   that isn't working and move on.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.160]   I guess so.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.520]   I mean, you do get-- you have to give credit
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.960]   to a company to do-- yeah, you're right.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.160]   I think so.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.800]   Because that's a hard thing to do, too.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.840]   I have that problem with shows.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.600]   They'll just dribble on, you know?
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.680]   Yeah, it's tough.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.080]   It's tough.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.560]   You got to be an editor.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.080]   And it's not like they don't have 20--
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.920]   whatever, it is-- 45,000 employees.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.160]   They could easily afford just to have wave
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.520]   continue in the corner.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.320]   Why kill it?
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.320]   Why kill it?
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.480]   What's the advantage of doing that?
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.040]   I-- you know, maybe just a more perceived sense of focus.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:42.280]   Maybe I/O was this past I/O, or every session was wave.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.800]   It was kind of the last chance for it to prove itself.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.560]   And maybe it didn't.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.000]   I don't know.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.360]   This is all-- you know, just--
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.760]   this is me just thinking possibly.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.280]   I don't have confirmation of all this.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:58.120]   But-- yeah, I'm bummed.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:58.920]   I've got a book.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.120]   I mean, limited edition.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:01.960]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.800]   It'll only help me at the end of the year.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.200]   Everybody run over to the completewaveguide.com
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.560]   and buy Gina's book as a way of saying goodbye wave.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.960]   Exactly.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.640]   Oh, gosh.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.440]   Can we think of another product that Google has killed?
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.400]   Killed?
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:19.920]   Has killed?
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.520]   Well--
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.520]   It was a good product.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.680]   --they neglected a ton of product.
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.560]   I mean, look at Nal, which is--
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:26.720]   No, but--
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.220]   Nal.
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:27.920]   --is all of the band--
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.920]   Nal is still--
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.360]   Nal's still there, but they could have--
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.440]   they might as well kill it.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:32.960]   What's that?
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.280]   Jai Koon never took off, but isn't quite dead yet.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.960]   What was the four square predecessor from Dennis Crowley?
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.280]   Oh, Dodgeball.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:40.760]   Is Nal--
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.200]   Dodgeball.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.800]   Dodgeball was killed.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:44.200]   Dodgeball was killed.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.080]   I guess that felt different because it was an acquisition.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:46.440]   Right.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.280]   They just didn't use it.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.480]   But Nal's still there, alive and kicking.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.840]   And I guarantee you less--
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.800]   He's maintaining wave.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.880]   I guarantee you fewer than a million people use Nal.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.800]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.080]   Well, they probably had fewer people working on Nal.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:06.080]   So notebook is notebook and Dodgeball.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:10.240]   It's an empty graveyard.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:10.760]   It's a small--
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.480]   Well, that's wild.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.480]   --it's probably went on to create some huge phenomenon
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.360]   because he couldn't do it inside Google.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.200]   Which shows-- I mean, that's a failure of Google.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.640]   I mean, here at four square is--
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.960]   I mean, growing.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.600]   It's huge.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.040]   There's huge commercial potential.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.480]   Everybody agrees.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:32.040]   It created this kind of location, check-in, gaming thing.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.040]   That's what Dodgeball was.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.320]   The danger here is--
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.920]   I mean, this is the danger they know.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.760]   Which, but it said it, you get too big.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.200]   Not too big to be regulated.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.160]   So you have to regulate it, but too big for its own good.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.920]   And I think this might argue that Google's heading there.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.160]   And so it's buying things instead.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.440]   Is it doing a good job of integrating those purchases?
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.440]   That's the problem.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:59.040]   AOL and Yahoo sure messed up plenty of companies that way.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.720]   You need some new strategy for having hit this size.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.840]   Right.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.120]   What happens to the Rasmussen?
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.720]   Did they-- any word there in that?
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.800]   That's an excellent question.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.640]   There's a whole lot of talent on the Wave team.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.840]   And that might be a good argument for killing it, right?
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.800]   They've got a whole lot of talent working on Wave.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.640]   I don't know.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.560]   I don't know what happens with them.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.920]   I mean--
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.360]   There was an interesting--
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.000]   Wave, you know.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.520]   They came from maps.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.040]   Right.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:24.840]   There's smart guys.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.040]   Yeah, they start maps.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.960]   They built maps.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:31.760]   There's an article by the CEO and founder of Postorus,
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.240]   Sechin this week that came out talking about Apple.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:40.360]   And Apple, as opposed to, say, Microsoft, it came up
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.520]   because Engadget said, you know, we love the remote app
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.480]   on the iPhone.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.200]   But why hasn't been updated in eight months?
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.040]   And Sechin says, I know the guy who developed it.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.040]   Let me tell you.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.200]   The reason hasn't been updated, because it's one guy who
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:52.680]   wrote this.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.560]   And Apple doesn't--
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.720]   this is how Apple works.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.880]   It buys-- it gets the most best minds it can.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.240]   And it moves them from project to project.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.880]   And unlike Microsoft, which builds these great big teams
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.760]   around projects, and they just kind of become clunky and huge,
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.480]   so that the disadvantages--
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.480]   apps might not get updated.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.600]   The advantage is they're brilliantly written apps.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.080]   And you've got these brilliant engineers
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.640]   that you can laser-like target.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.680]   And I would guess that Google's in a similar situation.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.360]   There isn't an infinite pool of brilliant people out there.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.920]   Google has more PhDs on its campus than any other company
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.440]   in the world.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.000]   But you've got to figure the rest of the motions
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.680]   are a prime resource for that company.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.680]   So that must be really some of this.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.360]   Definitely.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.480]   I would imagine that's part of it.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.160]   Yep.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.160]   Oh, sorry to hear it.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.320]   Other acquisition from Google?
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.120]   They just bought Slide for Mac's Leviton.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.520]   What is Slide?
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.720]   Slide's another game--
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.200]   another part of the game strategy.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.960]   Leviton, of course, is one of the founders of PayPal,
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.320]   sold it for $182 million.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.720]   Which TechCrunch says--
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.240]   Sarah Lacey says is disappointing.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.640]   Last valuation was at $500 million.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.880]   He was hoping to sell this company for a billion.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:06.960]   But Slide, I believe, is a game creation game platform.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.960]   And so it fits into Google's new game strategy.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.440]   See, I think $180 million seems completely reasonable.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.520]   I have never heard of this.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.240]   I don't know what it is.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.480]   If I go to the web page, it doesn't even make any sense.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.800]   It says Superpoke Pets, Select a Pet.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.520]   It was overcome by Zinga.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.560]   Way over-comb by Zinga.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.920]   It was really-- it was before Zinga.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.040]   It was a game platform.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:32.440]   It was a way to create games on Facebook originally.
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.840]   It does look like post-people.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.840]   Yeah, because they say Superpoke.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.400]   That's a Facebook thing.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.440]   Yeah, that's where it was originally as I remember it.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.520]   And Leviton was creating a new platform.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:51.000]   And then Pickis came along and just mowed over this with Zinga.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.080]   And that's always the problem.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.040]   It's the same as Wave.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.160]   You're first in.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.640]   Maybe you don't know exactly what the shape is going to take.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.680]   And somebody else comes along and learns from you and does it.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.080]   It's kind of the Caliconus, or even for that matter, Gates way.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:05.120]   Right.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.240]   Well, it's good to be the second guy sometimes,
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.960]   because if the first guy gets acquired,
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.960]   then Yahoo or Google, whoever didn't get you,
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.520]   gets hires the second guy.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.320]   So I've just created a lamb named Gina.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.320]   And now I don't know what's going on.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.040]   I have no-- I must be too old.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.000]   I don't-- what do I do?
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.520]   Decorate--
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.480]   Because the last dude is just going
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.840]   to get shaved momentarily.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.360]   I just bought a super duper table for my lamb.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:35.080]   Now that I've finished decorating, I can clean the lamb.
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.080]   Do you know what you mean if I shower you?
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.000]   There you go.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:38.840]   Go for it.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.240]   There you go.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:39.840]   It's nice.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:40.440]   You just so fluffy now.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.200]   That's a clean, fluffy lab.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.080]   Today's was such a crazy day at this point, whatever.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.080]   Whatever.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.640]   Whatever you want to do.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.520]   I validated.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.520]   My book got killed.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.200]   Even you know, whatever at this point.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.160]   God, my heart is breaking.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.080]   I feel-- I don't know whether to be happier or sad.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:57.760]   It's cool.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.320]   It's cool.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.680]   There will always be more new, fun products to write about.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.000]   You know what?
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.600]   There'll always be more of people
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.320]   trying to game Google Earth.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.800]   TCBY Yogurt.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.680]   Did you see this right next to the Google campus?
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.800]   They cut into the grass a message.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.320]   TCBY Frozen Yogurt.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:21.640]   We think the new Android 2.2 Froyo upgrade is sweet.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:25.400]   Now this is as huge as big as Building 42 right there.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.240]   So I don't know.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:26.840]   They have--
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.960]   It has that much land and mountain view, geez.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:36.880]   And I guess the point is that when Google Earth's satellite
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.800]   passes over, it'll capture that.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.280]   And it'll become-- you know, this is viral.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.240]   I mean, that's smart, right?
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.840]   They're going to get a lot of attention.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.320]   All I had to do--
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.880]   You see the other news from Google Earth this week
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:50.080]   on Long Island, one of the towns is using Google Earth
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.280]   to find illegal pools in backyards.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.280]   He saw that.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.240]   There's nothing you could do either, by the way.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.080]   That picture's been taken.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:44:59.800]   It's taken--
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:00.880]   And it's perfectly legal.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.000]   You don't have a privacy.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.360]   You can't cut off people from the air from seeing what's there.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.720]   There have been court cases to that effect.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.360]   Really?
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.080]   Oh, wow.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.400]   Yeah, I guess it's no different than flying planes
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.480]   to find marijuana plantations or whatever.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.960]   Just use Google's.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:17.400]   Geez.
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.440]   We're seeing a lot of Android tablet talk.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.000]   And I think we're going to see more as we get closer
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   to Gingerbread Android 3.0, because it's really clearly
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   a tablet OS.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.720]   ViewSonic wants to do a 2.2-based tablet.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.480]   They do monitors-- pretty good monitors.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.880]   I mean, really, if you think of it,
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.960]   a tablet really is just a monitor with some electronics
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.040]   behind it.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.520]   Our coast-- this actually might be kind of interesting.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.680]   It's eighth generation.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.000]   It's been doing using Android for some time.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.440]   The R-Coast Generation 8 tablet--
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:54.600]   3.2-inch screen, a little tiny screen, 400 by 240.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:59.920]   It's almost like an iPod, not like a tablet device.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.360]   But it will support video.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.880]   It's $150.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.520]   MPEG-4H.264 WMB.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.960]   You know, this is an interesting thing.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.960]   We're not only are we seeing Android tablets kind of start
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.200]   to emerge, but we're seeing a range of prices,
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.840]   like the Augen, which is $150.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.480]   Very affordable.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.240]   Yeah, but I don't know how good it's going to be.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.400]   It's going to explore the user base.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.560]   It's going to be much bigger than iPhone.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.560]   There's just no doubt.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.600]   Already is, by the way, the-- in fact,
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.600]   it's not only already bigger than iPhone.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.880]   It's bigger than the rim.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.600]   It's the latest news.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.440]   Let me see if I can find this story.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:36.120]   According to NPD, which is very reliable,
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:41.800]   Android passes BlackBerry in the second quarter.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.240]   That is-- that means they're number one.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.880]   And I would guess it's in the US.
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.920]   It does not include-- maybe this is why it's bypassing
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:51.680]   BlackBerry.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.120]   Corporate or enterprise purchases where BlackBerry has
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:57.760]   a huge install base, as does Windows Mobile.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.920]   Pretty phenomenal.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.400]   33% of consumers choosing Android.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.800]   28% BlackBerry.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.400]   22% iPhone.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.000]   Number one--
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:07.320]   That's huge.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:09.960]   You know what?
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.920]   But the writing was on the wall.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.400]   I think it's very clear, again, to back to that analogy
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:19.120]   of Windows Mac, Windows Android is going to be dominant,
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.760]   going to have 80% or 90% of the market.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.960]   Mac, people don't care.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:27.560]   They're going to have their special, unique niche device
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:28.520]   that they think is better.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.080]   It's like being a BMW.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.240]   I don't think that there's anything wrong with that.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.520]   I do think it's very interesting to watch iPhone fanboys
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.920]   rephrase the game that way.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.680]   For a long time, we're number one.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:41.880]   We're happy to be number two.
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:44.320]   We're happy to be number three.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.680]   Well, kids, you're now number three.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.320]   Just don't point it that out.
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:47.760]   Now, I'll see.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.720]   Now, I'm going to get the hate mail.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:49.720]   I love Mac.
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.240]   I love your step in my life.
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.800]   I'm going to get the hate mail.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.400]   And by the way, just want to mention that reset fixed it,
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.480]   fast, snappy.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.320]   So I had obviously put something on the Droid X.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.120]   Maybe it was that alternative launcher I was using
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.280]   that was slowing it down.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.720]   Everything now is fine.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.480]   I just sent out a text message.
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.840]   All of this stuff is fine.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:14.160]   So lesson learned to stop customizing, Leah.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.000]   Just like Windows.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.560]   That's what people do on Windows.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:22.240]   The number one selling Android handset, Motorola's Droid,
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:27.880]   HTC Droid Incredible, HTC Evo 4G, HTC Hero,
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.640]   and the Droid Airs filled out the rest.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.080]   This report, of course, doesn't include the Droid X,
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:32.680]   which just can't--
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.800]   It's a changeable target.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:34.600]   It's a movable target.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.840]   Very movable.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:36.560]   Fast moving.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:42.640]   Speaking of OS's, if I may, Tariq Crimson's Jolycloud
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.600]   just came out as 1.0.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.920]   What's that?
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:50.800]   It's a-- Tariq was originally--
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.120]   he's forgetting what he did.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:52.720]   Tariq performed.
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.560]   Suddenly, I'm blanking.
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.120]   Chatroom told me.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.520]   That instead of no, whatever this is, I'll find out.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:04.200]   But Jolycloud is a netbook OS, very, very simple.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.400]   Clay Shurkey says he just uses this.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.720]   And Dropbox.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.360]   And I certainly--
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:11.960]   Certainly.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.640]   Yeah, it's just kind of a--
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:19.640]   it's a Chrome sense, very, very simple OS, very free or cheap
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:22.480]   so that you can buy the cheapest netbooks
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.320]   and have a new OS on it.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.640]   But Linux-based, I guess so.
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:28.240]   Yeah, it's a Linux.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.200]   Yes, Linux-based.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.720]   Yep.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.400]   Tariq Crimson was NetVibes for--
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.040]   NetVibes.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.040]   Oh, I love NetVibes.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:41.320]   NetVibes is an internet starter page that used CSS and JavaScript
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:45.120]   to do an amazing, like, app, web-based app.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.520]   NetVibes is fantastic.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.000]   Huh.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:47.960]   So I'm going to try it.
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:49.960]   I know.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.440]   I've been very happy with Ubuntu, the netbook
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.240]   remix of Ubuntu, which is really excellent.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.560]   I think, as I remember in the new Ubuntu,
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.920]   they just kind of deprecated that and said, just put Ubuntu on it.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.040]   It's fine.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.000]   I might be wrong on that.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.600]   But the netbook remix was really nice.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.160]   That big icon is very easy to use.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:07.040]   I have it on one of my little netbooks.
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:07.040]   Right.
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.000]   Here I need some advice.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.200]   So if I buy a netbook to run this,
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:17.600]   what's the safest choice that it might also run Chrome?
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:20.200]   Gina?
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.720]   Also run Chrome on the net.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.600]   So Jolie Cloud is a web-based app.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:25.480]   I'm so confused about it.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.480]   No, it's an OS.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.480]   No, it's an OS.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:27.980]   OK.
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.280]   OK.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:34.560]   I'll tell you, my favorite still is the Asus C-Shell.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.920]   I think that's one of those.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.880]   They're really thin.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.280]   They're really attractive.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:43.920]   Asus invented this category with the EPC.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.400]   I had a 12-0 one-end.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:48.440]   It's atom-based, but it has a nice big hard drive.
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.360]   It was stolen from it.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.720]   Two gigs of RAM.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.480]   So you want a dual-boot Chrome OS and Jolie Cloud?
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.160]   I think anything will run Chrome OS, right?
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:05.680]   I guess my best recommendation would be just look at the list of netbooks that run Chrome
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.680]   OS.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:07.680]   That's right.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.360]   They're the most popular.
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.320]   I really like-- I have an Asus.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.160]   It's an Asus or Asus.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.360]   Asus, I'm told.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.360]   Uh-huh.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.360]   But there's a large list of things.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.360]   I get told a lot of things.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:21.720]   I don't know if anyone would be true.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:22.720]   All right.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.880]   We're going to take a break.
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:27.200]   Come back with our number tool and tip of the week.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.720]   Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trapani, Leo LePorte.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.560]   Coming up in just a few minutes, Tech News today.
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.040]   I want to mention our friends at Citrix though before we run out of time.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.840]   Go to meeting to be specific.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:43.400]   Go to meeting is that great software that lets you travel less, do more.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:49.440]   Replace the face-to-face meeting with a conference call that is galvanizing, engaging, gets the
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.200]   job done, you'll close more sales.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:55.080]   It'd be great for product reviews, for training, for collaboration.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.240]   The nice thing is your client doesn't have to have it installed ahead of time.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.640]   You just start to go to meeting.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.680]   You could do it in Outlook.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.560]   You could do it just by emailing a link.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.560]   You could just do it on the wall.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.560]   You're on the phone.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.880]   You tell your client, "Just go to go to meeting.com."
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:09.880]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.320]   They enter it 30 seconds later.
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.320]   The software is very quick.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.320]   It installs.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:16.280]   And now they're seeing your computer on their desktop.
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.600]   They see your keynote, your PowerPoint presentation.
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.600]   They see your spreadsheets.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.520]   You can work together on a document.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.520]   It's fast.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.520]   It's effective.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.240]   It's the new way of doing business.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.160]   Avoid the hassles of traveling.
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.320]   Exceed your sales goals.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:31.000]   Get more done in less time with GoToMeeting.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.720]   And, oh, by the way, try it free right now.

[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.160]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.560]   Okay, Gina, try your tears.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:48.440]   Actually, you knew before the show began.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.480]   You were just embargoed on this, right?
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.520]   So you've had time to compose yourself.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.520]   You can't even say that.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.520]   I've had time to process.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:59.160]   So I'm glad the good news came in to cheer you up a little bit.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.720]   I'm really, really happy about it.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:03.520]   I'm very excited to go celebrate with my wife about Prop 8.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.520]   Champagne tonight.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:10.360]   I put up the link to the wording on the friend and feed list.
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.000]   It's wonderful language, too.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.680]   It just makes it very clear this was unconstitutional.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:20.600]   That double sex partner should not be seen as superior to single sex partners.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.600]   And this is unconstitutional.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.600]   It's a period done.
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.600]   I like double sex.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.600]   And this comes from a sports expert.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.600]   Double sex.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.600]   Same sex, double sex.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.600]   We're like a double dick.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:30.600]   I love double sex.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.480]   You should all be a d-you have- wait a minute.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:33.640]   You have two sexes?
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:34.640]   Oh my.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.480]   I think that's too many.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.680]   And a Bomination, Leo.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:39.680]   That's what I have to say.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.680]   It's an abomination.
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:46.080]   If double sex were in the Bible, I think we'd know a little bit about it.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.360]   I don't know what double sex is, but I don't want it.
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:49.360]   It sounds bad.
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.360]   What's the alternative?
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:54:00.280]   Jeff, if I were you, I would get the E-triple E-E-E-P-C, which is kind of at the top of the Chrome
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.280]   OS.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.280]   It's a good.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.520]   I'm glad to hear that because it's my favorite net book.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:06.120]   Yeah, it is mine, too.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.120]   It's the one I have.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.120]   And so I'm glad to hear it runs Chromium.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.120]   That's good.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.120]   Yep.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.120]   Also one story that we didn't capture.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.720]   Google is testing multiple logins right now.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.680]   And I have been testing it out.
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:19.680]   And it works really well.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:20.680]   It's just pretty simple.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:24.560]   It's just you just get a drop down on the top on a right or your Google account.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:28.240]   And if you're in Gmail, you just click the drop down and select another account and it
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.640]   just logged you into that other account.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:33.960]   So you can see your Gmail inbox without having to start another browser or sign out and then
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.360]   log back in and it's working really well.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:40.000]   You can use it, Gina, with both your apps and with regular Gmail.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.240]   Yes.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.480]   That's what you wanted so much.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.480]   I know.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.480]   That's what I've wanted.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.960]   Well, they've had it on the phone.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:49.840]   You know, if you on the Android, you just click the right button there on Gmail.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.760]   I know it's from account to account for easily.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:52.760]   Right.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:53.760]   Yep.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:57.280]   But like if you're a Google reader, you can have a personal and a work, you know, RSS
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:02.840]   feeds, for example, and it works with a few different products, not all the products.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:04.800]   But yeah, they're rolling out.
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.040]   That's been rolling out this week.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.480]   And so you should see it in your account in your account settings.
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:09.760]   Check your account settings.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:10.760]   You should see it.
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:12.240]   If you're not seeing it now, you should see it soon.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.760]   Yeah, that's exciting.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.760]   Hey.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.560]   Your tip of the week, and there was a tip?
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:19.040]   No, no, that wasn't my tip.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.800]   I have another quick tip, which is a Gmail tip really quick.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.960]   Attachments, you can drag and drop them from your email to your desktop now.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:32.040]   So they just launched, you can drag and drop into a message to attach something.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:36.200]   Now if you receive an email and attachment, the link that says download, just if you hover
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.600]   over it, it'll say click, you know, you can click and drag it onto your desktop and it
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.040]   will download that file.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.720]   So you don't have to go through the your browser's whole rigmarole download where, save, what
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.600]   ever, just drag and drop and you're good.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:48.600]   Good deal.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:51.520]   Yahoo, your number of the week, JJ.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:58.160]   1.1 billion, which is the cost of Google's spending spree so far this year.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:05.880]   But of course, that just got changed by 182 million because slides not part of that.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:06.880]   Right.
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:10.360]   So they said at the beginning of the year, Eric Schmidt said we're going to start buying
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.360]   some stuff.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:13.360]   And they have, obviously.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:17.200]   AdMob cost a little bit less than the original 750 billion.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:22.640]   It came in at 681 in stock and 26 billion in cash.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.960]   And you know, not very exciting, but that's just they are buying.
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:26.960]   It's interesting though.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:27.960]   They've been frugal.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:28.960]   I mean, how much was YouTube?
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:29.960]   It was more than twice that, right?
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:30.960]   Or, yeah.
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.480]   So they have been, they have got some good deals.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.480]   Yes.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.800]   Yeah, not spending like crazy.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:43.040]   My pick is something that I, you know, Android is all about choice, which means that sometimes
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.920]   Android is a pain in the ass.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:48.360]   Choice and pain in the ass go together, don't they?
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.200]   Let's face it.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:53.240]   You know, if Apple does it all for you, you're in the gated community.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:57.160]   You don't have any choice, but you just, they carry you along a little basket of cotton
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:59.400]   lined, you know, batting.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.760]   Android, you get to do whatever you want.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.960]   And sometimes that means, as I did, for instance, you have put too many apps on there
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:05.960]   and I was bogging it down.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.840]   I had different launcher going on.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:11.200]   And one of the debates on Android is, should you have a task killer?
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.680]   I've yet to see a definitive answer to that.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:18.160]   I know from looking into the, you know, Android SDK, as I know you have two, Gina, that the
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.520]   SDK is very aware of this.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.920]   They say again and again, you're in a resource constrained environment in terms of memory
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:28.720]   CPU and all of the applications have built in to them.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.720]   Oh, you know, they can be killed.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:33.120]   They have ways to come back from the dead and so forth.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:37.880]   It's part of the environment, unlike a regular computer operating system.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.480]   So in theory, you shouldn't need a task killer.
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:45.040]   The fact that multitasking exists shouldn't mean that there's a problem on Android.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:47.640]   And frankly, I have yet, I've tried it with and without.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:53.680]   And I, while I use the task killer, if things get sluggish, I've yet to see any, any repeatable
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.400]   evidence that a task killer is of benefit.
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:57.400]   I don't know.
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:58.400]   What about you, Gina?
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.920]   You have, do you think you have to have a task killer on Android?
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.520]   I don't, I don't run one at a principle.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.000]   I feel like I don't want to have to run one.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   I don't want to have to run one.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.600]   And honestly, sometimes I go into my managed applications.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.840]   If I'm having a battery run down pretty quick, I'll go into managed applications to see my
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:11.840]   look at my running process.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:12.840]   See what's going on.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:13.840]   Right.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:18.240]   But, but, but no, I, I have removed my task, my task managers.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:23.920]   Here's, here's the good news about, about it is that, uh, Android gives you plenty of
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:27.040]   ways to monitor this stuff.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:30.560]   So it's not, I mean, you, you know what's using your battery, you know what's going
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:31.560]   on.
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:34.240]   And so you can, you can be proactive on this.
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:38.620]   Robert McCauley, this came from Buzz, actually, from one of our listeners in our last shows
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:41.280]   Buzz says, uh, just finished Twig 53.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.560]   Heard some talk about using a task killer once a day.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:48.280]   Could I suggest trying my app, watch dog or watch dog light instead?
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:53.680]   Uh, it is, uh, I think it was, it was in US, but dollars is $3.99.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:57.480]   I think it's a dollar, a one year, $1.99.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.640]   And there's a light version.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.520]   I try, I bought the, I like to buy them.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:05.920]   And, uh, I have to say this does a really good job and probably does obviate the need for
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:06.920]   a task killer.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:11.560]   What happens is it monitors your phone for CPU hogs, for things that are locking the
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:15.200]   phone, you could set the threshold and all it does is it notifies you.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:20.040]   I set it for a big buzzer alarm, but you can set it for whatever you want.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.480]   You can have it do a notification, whatever.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:27.200]   And so this is a way, if something is holding up the system, you get a notification alert
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:29.680]   and then you can go in applications as you do, Gina.
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:32.520]   Or if you want to do, you could use a task killer and kill it.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:36.520]   He says the upside is in memory apps launch quicker than dead ones and you won't break
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:38.360]   apps that need to stay resident like Aster.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:39.360]   And that is true.
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:43.040]   That is one of the problems with a, a task killer is you can kill stuff.
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.600]   You shouldn't be killing.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:48.080]   And it's, it's nice to leave stuff running if you can.
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:50.320]   So I'm going to, I'm going to continue to use this.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:53.400]   I've used it for a day and it worked quite well, I thought.
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:56.480]   So I'll, I'll give you full feedback, but it's called watch dog.
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.680]   You could find it in the Android marketplace.
[00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:02.280]   It is a light version and a paid version, which is not too expensive.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.720]   I have a dumb question, which is what I specialize in.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.840]   We should have the dumb question of the week for me.
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:12.680]   I can't get anything to move to the memory card on my Android.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.720]   You need to do.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.720]   I have to do.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:16.720]   Huh.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:17.720]   Well, it's app by app.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.400]   The app has to have that feature enabled.
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.200]   Most app developers are starting to update their apps so that you can store.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.680]   Talking about storing on the, on the, on the, on the app on the SD card.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.720]   If the app can do it, you'll see a check mark in the, usually in the app settings.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:36.000]   It's only because two, two is so new.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.040]   I, I've only recently noticed apps starting to do that.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.760]   Cause I, man, I ran out of memory on the thing.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.720]   Google Earth went wacky on me and filled up tons of stuff.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.320]   One big advantage, I think of the Droid X eight gigabytes of app storage.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.480]   And Google Earth is particularly big.
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.480]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.480]   But, but yeah, Droid X is a sounds nicer and nicer.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.480]   Eight gigabytes.
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:00.720]   I have 12 on the, on the Nexus one and like you, both of you, I've run out of room on
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.720]   the Nexus one.
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:02.720]   I just have no room for apps.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.560]   Maybe that's not a bad thing.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.400]   Maybe that eight gigabytes is what I got in the problem.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.560]   Saving you from yourself.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.040]   Too many apps.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:15.160]   Jeff Jarvis, it blogs at buzz machine.com his book so far.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.280]   Google hasn't canceled Google.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.960]   So his book is still good.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.160]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.000]   I'm so sorry.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   Somebody, somebody in Twitter.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.560]   Eli Center said Google drops wave insert joke about Twitter's fail.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.560]   Well, here.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.880]   Oh, there is all kinds of snarking going on about wave.
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:37.880]   It's been tweeted.
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.400]   Wave is dead and two users are upset.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.400]   Oh, all right.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   It's all right.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:49.760]   Mean, I mean, mean, ahead of its time people.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.720]   They're laughing to cover the pain, Gina.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:53.720]   That's it.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.520]   They're laughing because the other alternative is crying.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:01.400]   Gina Trapani is the guy at the author of One Last Chance to Buy It Quick.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:02.560]   It's on the remainder table.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.800]   The complete guide to Google Wave at completewaveguide.com.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.360]   Heather Gold has just stepped into the studio.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.560]   She's going to be doing TNT this afternoon.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.920]   She says, hello, Gina.
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:13.440]   We'll open a bottle of champagne for both of you.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:16.320]   And yeah, really, really good news about property.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.320]   Yay, gays.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.120]   Go get married.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.120]   It's the Yay, gays show.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:27.120]   Happy gays are here again.
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.600]   Happy gays are here again.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:30.960]   That might be the title of this show.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.960]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.960]   Thank you, Jeff.
