[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.440]   I'm thrilled to have Mike Elgin in studio with us. We love having you on this show. I'm sorry
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.440]   It's like the palace
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.360]   Versailles I'm glad to be here and what a day to be here. This is a momentous day and it's fantastic be here with you and Jeff
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.760]   If you're just tuning in this is the day after the US president
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.420]   That's right. Also with us Jeff Jarvis a known Clinton supporter not wearing the hat anymore though. Are you Jeffy?
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.280]   I still have the Jeffy. Thank you very much. I still have the button all right
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.020]   It's a black one though. That's interesting. Do they make black ones for a
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   With my outfit
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.920]   Professor of journalism at the city yesterday. I got home and there is one of my thank you Hillary Clinton magnets sitting there finally got here
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.120]   Yeah, a little late
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.800]   But you know that refrigerator wasn't gonna vote for her anyway
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.780]   That one magnet could have made a difference man that one
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.520]   So just to reassure you well, maybe I won't reassure you if you're tuning in and saying well
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.360]   I hope they talk about Google we will but I think we have
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.120]   We have to talk a little bit about the election
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.080]   But I think what we're gonna do is talk about it and the lessons of the election and talk about it in context with Silicon Valley actually
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.720]   Starting with and I bet you this is what the PBS NewsHour wants you to talk about Jeff Jarvis
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.240]   Silicon Valley's reaction. This is the Wall Street Journal's piece today
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:14.920]   Silicon Valley braces for uncertainty after Trump's victory there are wins and losses for Silicon Valley on the one hand
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.520]   Donald Trump called for a boycott of Apple because they didn't hand over the phone in the San Bernardino case
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.400]   And wants Apple to bring all of its manufacturing back to the United States on the other
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.960]   Amazon and Jeff Bezos doesn't like the Washington Post and as a result doesn't like Jeff or Amazon very much and his promised
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.600]   Antitrust action against Amazon
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.040]   But on the other hand says but we do want their
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.120]   Companies to repatriate all their money Apple would love to bring its billions back. So would Amazon Microsoft Google. Yeah, and
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:51.840]   One proposal it's very hard the hardest thing is to figure out what Trump's proposals were for instance on the H1B visa
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.840]   He went back and forth and back and forth
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.080]   But it does seem that at least on his website
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.040]   He proposed a 10% tax rate for repatriated money
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.680]   Yeah, which I think Tim Cook would like to do they want to get that money back in the US and be good for our economy
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.080]   Billions of dollars that would be spent on R&D acquisitions hires
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.880]   Now whether he wants to amend the tax code so that the rent so the new money doesn't go out of the United States
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.280]   I don't know I think
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:25.800]   This is the I think this is the big problem. I don't know. Yeah is he answered a lot of these questions. I'm less concerned about
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   benefits or penalties for
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.520]   multi-billion dollar corporations than I am about Silicon Valley's role in in
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.280]   Providing fees free speech
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:44.920]   Trump has talked about the cyber a lot and he has a new as the internet Trump Trump does not really understand technology very well
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:52.040]   He I guess he'll be looking to his son Barron for he doesn't use a computer doesn't use a computer uses
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:05:00.540]   iPhone very well. However, he's no an Android phone. No Android. That's right. He's certainly Twitter aware. Yeah, he though has
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.260]   He said he's not in favor of net neutrality
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.800]   he says he
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.560]   He says
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:21.080]   He doesn't have an official position, but he this is the journal writing he expressed displeasure with the FCC's open internet order by tweeting
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:30.120]   I'm telling you were reading the tweet leaves at this point Obama's attack on the internet is another top-down power grab net neutrality is the fairness doctrine will target
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.640]   Conservative what media I know I know
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.520]   That's why we don't really know what he thinks and I don't think he knows what he thinks
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.560]   one thing though an interesting quote from
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.760]   Aaron Levine the chief executive officer of box
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.680]   Dot-com and we should say a Clinton supporter
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.760]   You don't want innovation to happen in isolation
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.880]   He says and have people just deal with that disruption without having a plan in a world where government and technology are sort of acting in isolation
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.880]   In other words if Trump doesn't do anything
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.000]   Pro-work on for Silicon Valley what we're going to get is negative consequences from disruption in other words government
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Should be levy things planning for the inevitable disruption the new technologies are going to offer
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.200]   Yeah, and and figure out ways to keep people in working and and so forth
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.400]   Yeah, but look it's very it's very instructive look at the stock market because they're you know much
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.320]   I always gonna it's gonna implode it's gonna implode and last night the futures are down there
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.280]   They were down because people had the wrong bets on the market and they had to they had to deal the shorts
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.080]   They had the long as they hadn't figure that out and today the stock market was up to 56
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.040]   Why because this is somebody who's going to reduce taxes on companies as much as possible
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.600]   The company is gonna be happy. Yeah, if if it's for companies then that's you can presume
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.240]   That's what he'll do. Yeah, I think unless it's a company. He doesn't like well the H1B visa is an interesting one because of course
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.600]   he's
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   campaign on an
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   immigrant
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.640]   platform the H1B visa is a visa that allows
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.240]   foreign workers
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.800]   To come and work for tech companies tech companies want this expanded. They want more foreign workers, right?
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:11.960]   When questioned on it, I'm not sure he even understood what the program was but he said that he wanted to
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:19.780]   Encourage he said the problem was you have people coming to universities the United States
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.840]   Getting skills and leaving yes, that is a problem and he wants to keep them in the United States
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:31.400]   But he also said he wants to raise the wages of H1B workers to a point where it doesn't undermine
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.200]   The American workers who could do the same job. They're not cheaper than American workers in other words, which is actually sounds
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.560]   Sensible Silicon Valley says we can't get enough high tech workers with the skills we need we have to
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:51.160]   Bring in overseas workers using H1B visa that has has been abused Disney used it for instance to bring in lots of workers
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160]   they had the American
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.680]   IT professionals train these workers and then fired him yeah
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:03.120]   What kind of visa did his current wife get one sheep on the got it. Have you seen that reported? I don't know
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.080]   Now Jeff you've got to stop fighting these old battles
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.760]   I we're not the elections over no no no
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.880]   I tweeted David Ferren hold the Washington Post last night and I just said please don't stop
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:21.680]   Well, no no we have to we didn't get enough coverage of his character and his history
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.080]   One way or the other by God there's gonna be some wonderful Edward Snowden somewhere
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.720]   Oh, we gotta bring that up to some wonderful Edward Snowden somewhere who?
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:36.480]   Will reveal at peril his taxes, you know, we got it. We gotta go for transparency
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.040]   It's too late. He is elected. What does it matter? What his taxes are the
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.360]   Cuz you'll be in office because you'll be in office. Well, that's what that's where I'm headed
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.900]   Oh, Lord. I mean I think that this point it would be a good thing to say he's the president
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.380]   It will be the president January 20th. Let's give him the benefit of the doubt and let's
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:09:01.900]   Hope that he does a great job when he stopped if he doesn't then we can protest we can take to the streets
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:07.940]   But until then he hasn't done anything. Oh, we know is campaign rhetoric. That's campaign rhetoric. So so
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:13.060]   I've been thinking about this for a couple months, you know, what if this could happen because I believed it could
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.820]   For some time and and I've been trying to get my head around this notion of resistance
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.060]   Right as we believe and he did not
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:27.100]   We believe in an early transfer of power Hillary Clinton did the right thing Barack Obama did the right thing in spades
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:32.900]   They they they were elegant and and graceful and they've done the absolute right thing
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:38.620]   And and that is right and yes, we do have a transfer of power and I'm not gonna question the legitimacy of the office
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:45.740]   Fine, however, let's say this guy just for the sake of argument goes out and starts routing up little children
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.740]   inside and back to Mexico
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.820]   What does resistance look like in that kind of work?
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.140]   We could cross that bridge when we come to it well
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.020]   Well, but I think it's no
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:00.620]   I think it's something that we want to start because because the lines are there what what is still respectful of the office but
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:06.780]   respects the law so I can't this is an off the record session so being being being a
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.500]   Patriot means also protesting something you don't agree with so would you
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.860]   Iraq I went what took to the streets marched carried signs
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.500]   I mean I that doesn't mean you have to agree with everything he does
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:25.900]   But I he hasn't done anything yet one of the great ironies of this election which is radically under under discussed
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.900]   Which is the whole immigration issue?
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.460]   Trump has hinted that he wants to deport
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.500]   illegal immigrants and
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.820]   Mexico has had things to say about that people say they're gonna move to Canada if he does that
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.300]   Both Canada the Canada immigration website down all that's nice
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:48.180]   Both Canada and Mexico deport illegal immigrants as a matter of practice and policy
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.380]   So to win I think that the perfect
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:58.620]   The perfect immigration system for Trump to emulate is in fact candidates because Canada what Canada does is they cherry pick immigrants
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.060]   They're H1B. Oh, yeah program is is their whole immigration policy, right?
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.660]   they basically say we want the best and the brightest from all over the world to come in all of them and
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:14.580]   Everybody else not so not so you know yes if it's a much a few that by the way is a knee jerk reaction
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.460]   Maybe not knee jerk. It's a reaction to Canada's open immigration policy of about 30 years ago
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.740]   Yes, Canada is a very diverse as you know
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.420]   Yes, it's a very it has to China town
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:29.180]   Yes very diverse nation because they had open immigration and then there was they had what was called a green paper
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.620]   Yeah, but you know it's it's in this Canada is a is a
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.660]   exemplary democracy however, it has to be said that the
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:44.780]   immigration policy that Trump has been raked over the calls for is Canada's immigration policy right the best and the brightest so
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.940]   Best and brightest and deport the illegal immigrants. They do not also so I think we talked in Canada
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:54.500]   I we had this quiz. I think some some months ago Leo where I asked would you?
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.740]   Harbor hide in your house a
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.260]   Young Mexican immigrant was gonna be sent back for no reason other than spite
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:11.140]   Separated from his parents, you know, I mean maybe you know get the heartstrings going
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:17.900]   Give me some sympathy here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, let's let's let's stack exactly and Frank, but uh,
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:23.180]   Oh, but facing deportation so churches churches have
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:30.220]   Thanks, right, right so that I also I was an off-the-record things so I can't say who but a fairly important
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.860]   I'll just say either intelligence or military official
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:38.940]   Very high level I heard in an event two weeks ago and was asked by the very good interviewer
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.700]   okay, so Donald Trump was in office a turtle in the room hug and
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.540]   He orders you to waterboard
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:51.900]   And this when you say no and in fact, that's exactly that's this no military is told to do that
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.940]   You cannot you have the right to refuse an illegal order
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:02.060]   But what and we prosecuted the germ as a who said I were just following orders. I know I know I think I
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.580]   I think the military will say no to illegal orders
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:11.980]   But all I'm saying is I think that that if he does start doing some of the things that I find heinous that he's threatened to do
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.940]   Against the press as well changing libel laws suing the journalist for they say something he doesn't like
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.580]   What kind of resistance?
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.580]   Should I as an individual consider?
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.900]   You know one of the great things about having worked in the campaign and don't worry people. I'm not going to go off
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.900]   It's too late
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.620]   But I thought this the other day
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.420]   I relearned how to become a citizen
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.980]   As a journalist you separate yourself from the public you have this this view that you're apart from at all
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:43.980]   No, we don't have a problem. So apparently exactly and so by being a partisan by being involved
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.060]   I felt my citizenship
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.380]   again, you know in my soul I cared about something I allowed myself to care about something
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:55.900]   And and with that comes tremendous responsibility and I felt the responsibility not of being a journalist first
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.660]   but to being a citizen as well
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:03.740]   And so if you believe in the principles of this country and someone does start violating them
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.300]   Then I'm just saying it hasn't happened yet. You're quite right Leo
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:12.140]   But I'm starting to just get the wheel spinning about what would I do? What would my response be? What does resistance mean?
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:18.380]   What what protects the principles but doesn't destroy the office for future holders if that happens
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:25.820]   I'm not saying is what I'm gonna do when you do here, but I am asking the question. Yeah, well you you and you and I you write about journalism
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.620]   Exactly then that's where I'm taking this
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.100]   And we all write about social media
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:36.860]   Before you head to that I want you I know you want to go that's what I want one more point about Silicon Valley
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.580]   There was at least one person in Silicon Valley who made a bet on Donald Trump, but that's people Peter Teal
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.740]   Yes, and we talked about this
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.500]   there was a move to oust him from the
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.620]   Facebook why combinator board the Facebook board
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:55.260]   Both companies defended his right to donate one and a quarter million to the trump campaign
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:01.580]   And I think it was my position at the time that that was his right. He was the republican candidate. However you feel about him
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.140]   Teal
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.460]   Made it looks like a second good early bet. Remember he was the first a bit on facebook
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:13.340]   He might be made secretary of the cyber. I wonder I wonder if you'll have a a role
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:18.940]   He was of course co-founder of PayPal or early backer of facebook. He's on the facebook board. He is
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.140]   and a libertarian
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:28.140]   And uh, so one of the things he said and he's not about a week ago at the national press club is
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:33.420]   When I work in silicon valley people are doing just great most americans have not been part of that prosperity
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:38.460]   It shouldn't be surprising to see people vote for bernie sanders of Donald trump is the only outsider left in the race
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.460]   So I don't know
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:45.500]   Uh, if teal was angling for a position in the cabinet or just supporting the guy he liked but yeah
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:51.580]   He will be sitting in the catbridge. He will be influential regardless and but but I you know, is that a bad thing?
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.580]   I don't I don't even know teals polnot not politics, but but you know technical
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.900]   Accumen
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:04.780]   Um, it's funny because meg Whitman republican meg Whitman was a clinton supporter. Yeah
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.980]   um
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.180]   teal had supported carly fierina in the primaries
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.980]   Um
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.100]   I don't know
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.940]   But the the thing that I think um is is a is a is a really
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.780]   great
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:24.780]   uh thing for this show particularly to focus on on an ongoing basis is the fact that trump in fact
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.180]   um did promise to
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.380]   He wasn't specific about it, but he basically said that
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.300]   The internet is one choke point where we can prevent isis for example from
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.020]   Understands obviously the technology, but he misunderstands it but somebody you know, he's gonna
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:44.220]   He may drive that point. He's we have no reason to believe he won't so you think what do you think treble do on?
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:49.980]   Uh surveillance mass surveillance. I was the encryption. He's gonna. He's gonna try to get laws passed
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:54.700]   Requiring back doors into encryption. So we're gonna have to use encryption from outside this country
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.540]   And he will have by the way the support of probably a republican congress. Oh, yes, I would guess
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.980]   Sure
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:05.660]   But but when he goes to facebook and says okay, I want you to do xyz and he goes to twitter and say I want to shut down
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:10.220]   All these uh these accounts said he was gonna call bill gates on that one. Yeah
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.460]   Well first he's calling he said this first he's calling poutine
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.540]   All right, well he wants to meet with poutine as soon as he gets in office
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:23.660]   We shall see what what happens teal uh on uh tuesday night last night issued a statement
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.140]   Congratulating uh the president elect says he has an awesomely difficult task
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:33.420]   Since his long past time for us to face up to our country's problems. We're going to need all hands on deck
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.900]   Uh, they asked max levchin who was with teal co-founding paypal
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.300]   And this was interesting max said peter is very shrewd very smart. He bets
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.300]   contrarian
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.860]   As he did this time, but not when he knows he'll win
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:53.180]   But when he knows that his odds of winning are much better than most people think so teal was crazy like a fox. Yeah
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:18:00.060]   He um, he knew what to do now teals also the guy who funded hell coagens lawsuit against galker. Yep
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.180]   Um one that one too and oh yeah
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:08.300]   Teals uh wrote in his book that his dream had once been to the supreme court clerk
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:13.340]   Well, I think this this raises a another central issue which which you know teal trump
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:19.980]   Um, I think there's a movement of foot for billionaires to get involved in the media in a big way in the in the case of teal
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:27.660]   There's this idea that oh somebody criticized me. I will bankrupt that publication and trump is as has gone after
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:33.180]   uh publications that criticize them of which there are many I don't he his major endorsements were
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.860]   Um the kkk newspaper and one other major newspaper
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.380]   Um, but most newspapers didn't support him
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.700]   But you know for example, he'd be criticized new york times and then he would call the failed failing new york times
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.260]   Etc
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:49.900]   So there's there's a movement of foot for billionaires and people who are powerful to shut down the publications
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.620]   uh per teal punish punish them by
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.220]   Ending them
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:19:00.380]   Uh with their money with their influence with their power with whatever resources they have at their disposal with the power of lawyers and lawsuits
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.340]   Um, and so this is something that I think it needs to be a concern
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:09.500]   I'm a little concerned because it's very clear that in the in the trump supporters. There's a very strong anti media
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.660]   Yeah feeling right they were oh
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.740]   CNN sucks. They were chanting and uh
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.540]   Well, and I actually have I have I have
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.580]   I wrote a piece a few weeks ago that that now more telling than ever
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:26.060]   Which I argued that that that is indeed our fault in liberal media. This is another post I wrote
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:33.820]   Um post mortemism journalism. Yeah, I wrote this kind of refers back to this where what I argued was that we in liberal media
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:39.260]   And let's be honest media or liberal i'm media i'm liberal and when we're not honest about really
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.300]   That's wrong
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:47.340]   We in liberal establishment media left a void in a vacuum that was filled readily by
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:53.980]   Movements masquerine is media starting with fox and there's bright art and and drudge and and many far worse
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:59.420]   And it's our fault. We left that there because we didn't respect that half of the country
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:03.020]   And and my second argument is that we didn't um
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:10.780]   We didn't empathize with we didn't listen to and understand the concerns and the worldview of that half of the country
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.860]   And as a result that half of the country said you never reflect us you why should we trust you?
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:20.700]   We don't trust you you don't understand us. That's our fault. I take that fully on in journalism and media
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:29.260]   I actually believe that we should invest in um responsible fact-based journalistic conservative media because the only outlets the conservative side had
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.460]   We're fox news and bright bar and such and so what do we expect?
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.620]   They were gonna think about climate change and other things when that was the only real you're talking about a
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:41.660]   In echo chamber um and and so we abandoned half of america
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:46.780]   And I take that fully on that was that was media's fault and and they don't trust media and they don't trust media for a reason
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.060]   I don't think journalists abandoned half of america
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.580]   I think that I mean they used to be that every tiny little small town
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:58.460]   I started my career in small-time newspaper small small town newspaper journalism
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.860]   And every small and one of the amazing things about the united states was that there were
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.740]   Thousands of newspapers every little town had its own newspaper representing local views. I heard a
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.020]   Terry gross interview with with the cartoonist
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.660]   Gary Trudeau recently
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:19.340]   Uh, and he was talking about how he never felt bitter when they when they censored or canceled or you know
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.900]   Eliminated his cartoon because he said each of those small town newspapers has a response
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:30.620]   But that's just called editing that's not censorship. They all have a responsibility to reflect the values and concerns of their readership in the local communities
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:36.140]   And that's how it used to work. I don't think journalists walked away from I think journalists would love to have a million newspapers
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.620]   I think no, I don't think it's that
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:42.700]   every every news organization available to every citizen and people
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.580]   Gravitated to the national and international
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:51.740]   Publications, I think I think journalists love the old system of having a little local paper where they could begin and work
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:58.380]   Their way up to I mean that that's how it used to work. Why so what so you think that it's because
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:05.180]   I mean, it's an I guess in many ways that the trump movement is an anti-elite movement, right?
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:09.660]   And so yeah, the so journalists are media elites and so yes
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:19.180]   Um, here's a t-shirt. Uh, somebody cited at a trump rally rope tree journalist some assembly required. Yeah, um, you know
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:25.180]   But I but I'll have to say and when I talk to friends and family members who are
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.740]   Uh, or trump voters
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.660]   Pretty much to a person
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:34.860]   They revile the new york times they reviled mainstream media as reflecting
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:40.380]   They say liberal. I think what they're really saying is an elitist point of view
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.580]   Yes, but the thing is that phenomena beyond control
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:49.820]   But it's phenomena beyond the control of individual journalists led to this for you know
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:56.780]   This idea that journalists are inherently elitist is just provably false when I started an instagram business
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:02.460]   I I I made far below the poverty level when I started. Oh, you can be an elite without making good
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:06.300]   Well, I mean, I had a I had a bachelor's degree and so I guess that makes me yeah, you know
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:11.260]   And I think like I think journal unless I every single journalist I've been with in the last week
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.940]   For everything that's the old journalist was with yesterday was a big event with journalists yesterday
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.260]   And we were instructed firmly to have no
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.220]   Emotional response whatsoever to any of the results because it would look bad
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:26.380]   I couldn't take it anymore. I needed to go have a primal scream somewhere. So I I left it was it was interesting watching the news anchors
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.340]   Uh, yeah, there and there was some palpable sighing. I kept your sighing on msm
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:35.340]   Yes, see their temple throughout yeah temples throughout the truth is mike. I think we
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.620]   Virtually every journalist I know there's very few exceptions
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.300]   There's the david from us out there. There's a few others out there
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.820]   But every journalist I know is liberal
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:46.540]   And when I say that I'm not saying that that we abandon communities in the sense that we abandon the the outlet sure
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.260]   We'd love to have more jobs and more outlets. So I agree with you there
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:53.820]   But no, I I am saying that that in big media
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:59.020]   Whether that's the new york times or or nbc or you know pick the outlet
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:03.180]   There's very little understanding of that center of the country that voted all red
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.340]   There's very little understanding of their lives
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:11.420]   Um, the other example I gave is I wrote I wrote a I read a piece of the new york times a few weeks ago about evangelicals
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.140]   in indiana
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.020]   And I called one of the subjects of the story. Did I talk about this in the show?
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:21.580]   I don't think so. I'll make it very quick because it's not really tech, but I found it interesting
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:28.700]   Um, and the headline said evangelicals in despair and the minister I called to find out what they thought of the story
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:33.180]   Said because he's not the reporter did a very good job the photographer did a good job, but the story itself
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:39.420]   Um his precious came to him and said don't they understand we don't despair. That's the definition of being evangelical
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:43.420]   And and it was an editor put that that's actually a good point
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:49.660]   It is an excellent point right and it showed there because of the process we have the editorial separation
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:57.500]   The editor puts in something puts a take in a spin in even though the reporter did an excellent job of really empathizing really listening and wrote a good story
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:03.500]   It still separated them from the understanding because i'm editor in new york who didn't know any better
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:08.140]   And the minister had given the reporter the scripture that says explains why we don't despair
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.460]   That's what we what we want what they go back to is that scripture and if you're gonna understand them and empathize with them
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:17.260]   Then you've got to include that, but we don't do that. We don't put the bible as a karan and quote that in media
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.740]   So i i'm i'm i'm agreeing to the extent that
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:26.380]   Um with with the conservative community that their mistrust is warranted
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:31.340]   And we've got to fix that and the way to fix that is by listening to the community
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:36.780]   And your right mic then one way to listen is to have more outlets that are closer to people's lives
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.740]   And the internet is what enables that funding back to technology
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.620]   Let me uh hold on for a second because I do want to talk about
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:48.220]   That I also want to talk about uh, you know facebook and its role in and this social media and its role in this
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:55.260]   Some people say trump is the first twitter president um twitter stock up by the way significantly. Yes. Yes. Yes
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.260]   And some people say we elected a meme
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.700]   You know what I think we did I don't think that's far off
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:06.060]   Uh, I also want to talk about michael wollstone article in the hollywood reporter. Uh, he's talking about
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.620]   uh lessons learned
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.740]   from this and
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:15.100]   Uh, he says trump's win exposes medias smug
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:18.940]   failures, so we'll get to that and we have some google news
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:23.020]   But this is this is our beat right here media
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:29.500]   Uh, the internet technology, uh, and this is a historic election. There's no getting around it in today's the day
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:34.300]   I think i wonder because I think probably I was looking the new york times did a great thing a couple of days ago
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:39.420]   They had uh front pages from elections going back to the 1850s when they when they first started
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.980]   And every election was historic every election was a shock every
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:50.380]   Uh, every election was a watershed but not every but many elections were watershed moments and and surprises
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:55.180]   When you read those front pages you realize if you have historical context this may not be
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:27:00.620]   As historic as we want to think of it. But this this leo is our first orange president
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:05.100]   And say it's breaking the color barrier and for that reason
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:09.420]   Jeff has no sense of humor today
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:14.540]   No, I don't today. No, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's gonna be okay
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:19.100]   We're this is a great. I don't know. This is a great country with great institutions
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.220]   All right, let me ask my company. Yes one more one more question here
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:25.100]   So we have all this talk of you mentioned in canada
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:31.580]   We all this talk of leaving you're the one person like you're the one person who's qualified to speak about what it takes to just get the hell out
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:37.900]   Yeah, um, what does it take and uh, if you were to get the hell out, where would you go?
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.300]   Oh, yeah, you know is where to go. Exactly. I would go to spain
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:46.700]   Uh, and uh, no, it's it's a it's a big wonderful world
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.380]   I actually wrote a medium piece about this jeff a couple of months ago and because i heard it
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:55.660]   Yeah, it started saying oh if trump gets elected, i'm leaving the country i'm moving out and i said no you really should do that
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:59.020]   That's like a great idea just temporarily right well
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:03.660]   Yes for as long as you want and see what happens is when you temporarily go somewhere
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.980]   You fall in love with other places the world is a big beautiful place full of wonderful people
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:14.700]   Right despite the rhetoric of this election and um, and what i found in all kinds of far-flung places
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.740]   i've been to jordan morocco, kenya, turkey
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:23.580]   Uh, europe, mexico, etc, etc, i've been all over the world and literally to a to a place
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:29.980]   I would want to live in every single one i did live in those play but i would i wouldn't mind living permanently in any of those places
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.580]   It's a wonderful country. So what you do is you put your own house on air bnb
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.940]   You figure out how to work from home because if you can work from home
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:43.340]   You can work from rome and then you take off and you live abroad while you monetize your house
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:48.140]   Try to meet or exceed your mortgage or rent with the air bnb
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.620]   income and
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.740]   And
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.180]   There you go. You can live anywhere you can live in you can the most
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:29:02.220]   Deliciously ironic place you can move in my opinion to protest trump is to move to mexico climb that wall go live in mexico
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.780]   mexico is a fantastic country and uh, and that would be my recommendation
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.460]   It's never been easier. Thanks to the internet thanks to all these services. There are
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:16.700]   Co-living places there are you can you can live and work on a boat you can i mean there's so many different
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.940]   Opportunities and options out there
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:27.020]   Um, and i just think if you're gonna talk the talk you should walk the walk and you're gonna find out that it's a great choice to to live abroad
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:31.180]   I would if if i could do podcasts if i could do what we do here
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:36.380]   Where would you go? I love traveling, you know when we were on our last vacation we
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.540]   Every seat we got a cup and hagan saying hey, I wouldn't mind living here. This is cool. Look at all these bikes
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.940]   We get to Amsterdam. Hey, i'd love to live here. Look at all these bikes and canals
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:50.060]   I'd live in a house boat. I mean, yeah, I know what you mean when you get to the get places all over
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:54.540]   You know one thing that said you you you were in cuba you've been in cuba several times. Yes, really loved cuba
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.940]   Trump has said that he will reverse
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:02.380]   A ballous policy of opening the doors of cuba. That's over. Yeah big mistake. That's a that's a big mistake
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:07.100]   I think the i don't even sure why it's not like they're harboring soviet because because he wanted florida
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.300]   He wanted the republicans in florida. They're so anti-castro again
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:16.620]   You know i'm willing to hold off on campaign rhetoric versus actual action and let's and let's see yeah
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.620]   That's right. That got him the cubano vote
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:22.940]   He won florida although cuba did respond to the election today by
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:29.100]   As they have in past elections having military exercises just a little saying, you know
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.780]   We're not just like patsies down here. We we got an army, you know
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:40.380]   Okay, we're gonna take a break. By the way breaking news. Uh, thank you gardener for passing this along
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:44.460]   Twitter is coo adam bane has

[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.940]   I know shocker break heat news shocker
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:04.700]   Uh our show today brought to you by my mattress. Let me tell you
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:09.580]   I was up late last night. Nothing better than getting in bed and going oh, it feels so good
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:13.180]   I liked you don't like to do. I like to put nice fresh sheets
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.380]   Casper sheets of course on my nice mattress
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:21.820]   And just it feels like it feels so good. It feels so relaxing you sleep
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.940]   Uh the casper mattresses are an award-winning
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:29.660]   Combination of springy latrix foam and uh and kind of supportive
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:34.060]   Memory foam it that gives you just the right sink just the right bounce
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.580]   long
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:39.500]   Lasting comfort and support and uh they they breathe too. They're cool
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.260]   You know, I gotta tell you even in the winter there's nothing worse
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:47.820]   You know being too hot and now you want to you want to be comfortable and that's comfort comfort is the word
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:54.220]   For a casper mattress obsessively engineered mattresses made in the us at a fair price
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:32:00.140]   They offer free shipping and returns by the way. Let me explain that in a second to the in the us and canada
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:04.620]   The reason they offer returns is if you think about if you're going to sell a mattress online
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.420]   People are going to say well. I want to try before I buy
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.980]   So casper has the most amazing and the liberal trial policy ever
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:17.020]   By a casper mattress. It comes in a very compact box. You open it up
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:21.820]   There it is lie on it and at any time in the first 100 nights
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:26.940]   If you say this isn't the mattress for me casper calm they'll come they'll pick it up
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:30.300]   There were fun. Yeah, every penny will have cost you nothing
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:34.780]   So there's it's absolutely no risk and you have not five minutes or 10 minutes in a showroom
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.700]   But a hundred nights to try your casper mattress. I love my casper
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.700]   I know you will too by the way. I love it so much
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.260]   I I mentioned this before I sent one to my son in college
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:47.100]   Because he needed he didn't want to sleep on that mattress in the dorm room
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:51.980]   And it was easy. They could schlep it upstairs in that box. It opens up and and it's affordable enough that
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.100]   After four years, I'm I'm gonna say just leave it there for the next guy
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.460]   He deserves a nice mattress too and he'll take it because he's a college student
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:58.860]   Yeah
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.660]   And you know the thing the thing is that about mattresses too
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:06.780]   I think that we assume that people sleep in them and a few other things, but I like to work in bed
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:12.780]   I mean, it's like one of the things about being a telecommuter. I could see you cross-legged totally in your bed with your laptop
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:13.740]   Absolutely, I totally see you
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.380]   Hours and I just that's my favorite place to work
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:21.420]   You need a firm because you have to have somewhat firm right? Yeah, exactly exactly you would like this
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:25.900]   It it comes it cushions. I do like it. I do have a cast bar mattress
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.540]   There you go, and it's fantastic. That's good to work in it's a grid
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:29.580]   It's my favorite office
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:33.100]   Casper mattresses started $500 for a twin 950 for a king size

[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.820]   he's a columnist
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.940]   Jeff's muted
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:17.340]   I see his mouth moving, but I don't see anything. That's what that's the way most people want me
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:23.500]   Uh, you know, I could give you a hug today. I would give you such a hug
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:27.340]   Uh, and I wish I'd been with you last night. I know that your son
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.060]   Uh was in the javitt center
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:35.820]   Yep, and it was that he deserved a hug too. I've never seen such sad people. Oh god
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:43.260]   Except maybe the cleveland indians at the after the seventh game. Yep. Just well, but even even then they kind of had to say okay
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:48.380]   108 years all right, all right, all right, we get it and in baseball. There's always next year
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.380]   I don't think there's a next year for a hillary clinton. Oh no. I know
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:56.940]   I think the foundation is gonna do great work now. She's got plenty she can do. Yeah
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.220]   uh anyway, um
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:05.020]   Michael wolf I was asking, uh, I don't know if you have an opinion on him
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.820]   But I think he made some very good
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:13.580]   points, um the media turned itself into the opposition and accordingly was voted down
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:18.940]   As the new political reality emerged typical of the media to say this was a vote on us, right?
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.900]   But he does make an excellent point when he says
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.940]   What do we learn here?
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.580]   Trump didn't buy ads ads don't work
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.700]   Clinton spent the usual billions and by the way
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:36.460]   A number of people in my business and the radio business have pointed out that this is very bad news
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.380]   For broadcasters who frankly depend on those buy annual
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:44.380]   Buys of political ads. That's a those are at top rates
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:50.620]   Big big influx of money trump bought hardly any ads. We learned that polls are not reliable
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.820]   That's what we learned at brexit. You would think we'd have
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.220]   I mean, this was another case of that work
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:01.100]   And I don't know if that's because people don't tell the truth the pollsters pollsters are probably perceived as media
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.340]   Right, so there you know screw you
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:10.700]   I don't know. I don't know a moment of vote for I also perceived that what the media did do was they conveyed a sense of
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.140]   If you openly support trump you will be ostracized
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:17.020]   You're a jerk and so people kept it to themselves and quietly voted
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:21.580]   So but I I disagree with this thesis that ads don't work and the reason I say that is that
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:26.060]   Trump had something better and more powerful than ads for example
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:29.180]   One of the best trolling that he did in this entire thing was he said
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.500]   I'm gonna I'm gonna go
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:36.220]   Open my trump tower my new trump building and on pennsylvania avenue
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:42.060]   And and the press went there and he was deliberately late by like an hour and cnn and all the cable news networks
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:45.820]   Just had this camera on his over and over on his hotel doing his brand
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.860]   He said I'm gonna make a major announcement. I don't remember what it was exactly
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:54.220]   About the birther issue about right i'm gonna announce what what i've concluded about obama's citizenship
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:58.620]   And then and then he went there. He's like, oh, there's nothing really say he's he's he's an american citizen and he left
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:04.860]   He was a one hour ad that he got for free. So that's better than advertising. He's a master
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:10.940]   I mean, there's no question he's a master of the media and he's learned that in reality television michael mark bernett taught him a lot
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.780]   Yeah, right
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:20.140]   Celebrity endorsements don't work. You know you you watch these clinton rallies with biancé and jz and trump
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.500]   And be standing there with you know john voi they're just morally
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:31.420]   Uh, and it didn't make a difference media endorsements don't work as you mentioned he got two newspaper endorsements one from the kkk
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:37.740]   Yep, one from sheldon idleson's last that's right las vegas review journal. Uh didn't make a difference
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.540]   Right ground games everybody's saying oh
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:47.100]   The clinton ground game. It's the best in the business. They got all the professionals on the ground didn't they got jeff jarvis
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:51.260]   Canvasing in the pencil v one did do what did it do didn't do diddly
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:55.820]   Well, it must have done diddly. Actually, we don't really know it all of these things could have worked
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:03.500]   Could be clinton started, you know with a 50 point deficit. We don't know it just didn't work enough. I guess is is his point
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.300]   um, so
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.300]   I I think one of the things
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:14.060]   That's kind of exciting about this is it's a new world
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:21.180]   and the media and especially social media is now has a very
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.100]   Powerful role in all this trump what did trump master the social media?
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:29.100]   You know one of the things that he did on social media. It's a very basic basic thing
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:34.380]   which is that 100 of his messaging on twitter and elsewhere was
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:38.140]   um, was a pandering of sorts to his
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.100]   desired audience whereas
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:49.500]   uh hillary clinton, I think she she was so over confident in victory that she had felt that she had the luxury to take the high road
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:54.460]   Now this is a cynical position i'm taking and I I understand that but she would tweet things like
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.300]   We need to support
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.300]   Muslim immigrants. We need to support
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:04.380]   Uh, the trans community the trans community does in my opinion need to be supported needs to be
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.660]   Uh accepted needs to have legal rights needs to have
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:13.180]   Everything that every other american has I personally believe that but that's such a tiny percentage
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.940]   Of the voting population that has a more shameless populate
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:23.180]   Politician, uh one who is more in tune with how social media is more effective we ignore
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.500]   The tiny little groups now i'm not saying it's ethically the right thing to do
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:31.660]   But i'm saying that's the thing that gets you elected whereas trump 100 percent of what he said
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:39.180]   appealed to the vast majority of his potential voters and he never went off and on principle supported anyone
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:44.540]   Or did or said anything that didn't wasn't directly related to getting him into office
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:51.100]   You know he had a fabulous feedback mechanism both on twitter and at the rallies in fact, I almost feel like the rallies
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:57.900]   Uh were like a comic trying out material he would try out stuff. Yes, and the stump speech was honed
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:01.660]   Yeah, just by the response from the crowd and he honed that
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:08.220]   Stump speech to the point where he didn't need to for instance prepare for the debates because he knew what the lines were
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:11.580]   That he needed to say the lines that got the biggest choose interesting points
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:14.620]   Uh and the lines that he had learned initially
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.340]   Uh from twitter
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:21.820]   Um, how about facebook's role in all of this does facebook have we were talking about
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.100]   For the show about what is does facebook have a responsibility?
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:29.020]   I think they do and and so there are two things going on with facebook
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:34.940]   So I I tweeted out this morning a little crowd uh crowdsourcing about these ideas and said, you know
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:39.340]   What is youtube's facebook's and twitter's role in this the outcome of this election
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:44.540]   And I got some pushback from people saying hey facebook is just you know people are just following who they want to fall
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:48.940]   I'm like, you know, no not not exactly facebook has a filtering algorithm something like 50
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:54.700]   Millennium's don't know the facebook filters the news feed. Yeah, um, so i think it's interesting
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.580]   They assume they're seeing a chronologic right and you're seeing a
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:04.940]   Minority of the things that the people you follow post right and and facebook and they make it harder to choose most recent by the way
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:13.740]   It stops stories and right on mobile you have to dig deep to find that and facebook's criteria is what gets the most engagement well emotional
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:20.540]   Often fabricated stories get the most engagement the most sharing the most clicks the most argument the most comments
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.900]   And so you end up with these dual filter bubbles
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:30.460]   So so we elites in the media and all etc have live in a world that's partially facebook constructed
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:35.180]   And I single out facebook more than twitter because it's so much bigger. It's 140 million americans use facebook
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.100]   and and then and then uh, there's another group of people who who
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:44.540]   You know facebook's algorithms result in a different world that they live in a world of
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:49.260]   Information and and what facebook one of the things facebook did is they got accused early
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.740]   um by the by bright bart of
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.500]   favoring
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:58.700]   Uh the liberal elites and so what they did is they overcompensated they fired the human staff
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.700]   They put it all in the hands of the algorithm and they were careful and avoided
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:08.700]   Eliminating patently false stories that that supported both sides but predominantly
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.300]   uh
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:14.860]   Pro-Trump stories many of these fabricated by Macedonian teenagers for profit, right?
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:19.500]   I don't know if you saw that news. Yeah, where we're a vast majority of the false stories
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:23.500]   Um that favored that we're anti-clint in our pro-Trump
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:29.020]   We're actually just generated by a small group of Macedonian teenagers just for money because they realize okay
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:33.420]   This is a way to get a lot of eyeballs and so on buzzfeed to a news gut. Yeah great story
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:39.100]   Yeah, how teens in the Balkans are duping trump supporters with fake news. That was the headline and so it's nice work
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:40.540]   If you can get it it's nice. We're gonna get it
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:44.380]   But but what is facebook's responsibility to not let that stuff go viral
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:51.260]   When when it when you can identify if it's false, I would argue zero. I mean what you don't want to do is start
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:55.820]   I don't know. This is maybe why trending topics aren't a great thing right have
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:43:02.700]   But what you I hate it's a slippery slope as soon as you start doing any editorial curation
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:08.220]   Uh, which they tried right? Yeah, and they got and they got reamed for it. Yeah. Uh what you what you can do
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.780]   They'll have a responsibility suddenly. Yeah, right
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:17.340]   So what what I think that the the journalism should be doing in this case and facebook should be collaborating is in
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.060]   entering facts and
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:24.940]   Fact-checking and such into people's conversations and let them choose whether they're not they want to act on it or not
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:30.540]   But I told the story I think on the show like two months ago the the picture of Justin Trudeau kissing a politician
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:33.580]   And when I moused over it
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:41.020]   Came the the related content the related content was buzzfeed saying people are passing around a fake picture of Justin Trudeau kissing a politician
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:46.700]   Interesting and right next one snopes. So you can see very easily as a system there that says hmm
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:53.740]   Before I share that maybe facebook could say uh some people some respected or outlets have looked into this already
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:57.740]   And uh, you may not want to share this you might want to share it because you want to laugh
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.540]   Eddie you might want to share it because you don't believe those uh, what's that's up to you
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:06.060]   But we just thought you might want to know this before you might have to in 10 minutes say oops. I got fooled
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.220]   Um
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:12.860]   Now that's not going to get rid of all fake news and all lies and all scummy things on the internet
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:17.020]   No, nothing's going to do that, but we can feed the conversations with more information
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:21.580]   This is one of my huge complaints about my dear business is that we still think of ourselves as a destination
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:28.140]   We tell you to come to us even on facebook and instant articles. We tell you this dizzying kaleidoscope of great activities going on
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.900]   Now stop and read my thousand word articles now get back to the kaleidoscope
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:37.020]   Right we're not at all appropriate to the platform and to what's going on there, which is conversation
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:43.900]   So we should be feeding good memes smart memes memes with facts memes with with with responsibility
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:48.460]   Into there and I and give people the opportunity to share good stuff. That's not what happens
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:54.060]   All the only but the smart people like pornography are the ones who take advantage of the medium put the crap in there
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:58.540]   The crap gets passed around then we would decry all of facebook and everybody on it because they're spreading it
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:01.020]   To see when we didn't do a damned thing to help
[00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:03.900]   Yeah
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:09.500]   In her concession speech this morning secretary clinton also mentioned secret facebook
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:16.620]   Groups and I think she was what was the reference? Oh, you know, no, i'm a member of the secret face. Oh, are you secret?
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:21.020]   Oh, that's like, yeah, so oh, she was okay. Yes. You're a member because you went at pants suit nation
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:25.660]   That's a nation else. I would well, but there are also secret groups on the other side of which they
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:30.460]   Have huge audiences and this is this is one of the things that don't show up in our filter bubbles
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:32.220]   But right do show up in the filter bubble
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:36.540]   So let's talk about the filter bubble because you jeff of a long time e like paris or course wrote the book
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.860]   right describing filter bubbles saying that
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:45.260]   Google facebook and others are responsible for creating an environment which we can just hear what we want to hear
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:49.900]   Not hear anything that we don't want to hear and that is just and boy you
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.020]   I don't know if there is a culprit, but you certainly
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:57.420]   Can see that the country is kind of dividing into
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:03.900]   Camps right that don't really listen to voices from the other side, right? There's no doubt about that
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.380]   um, is this evidence?
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.780]   Of a filter bubble. I know
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:14.460]   You've denied that there's a filter bubble jeff. No, i'm not fully denied it, but I think it's I think it's not the fact
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:20.620]   Everyone concentrates on the negative expose you also have more right exactly exactly
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:25.500]   We're exposed to so much more we have more opportunity to get facts and new opinions and some sense of other sides
[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:29.580]   And we have all of that, but of course, uh, you know the nattery and napobs of negativism here
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:35.900]   Concentrate just on the negative and the negative that that that justifies our existence
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:39.580]   Either there's no greater fill of us just quoted spiro agnew with an idea
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:47.500]   And but that reminds me spiro agnew did fall because his tax returns and his connections with nefarious folks
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.140]   Revealed while he was in office. Yeah, so
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.940]   There you go. There's a
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:58.780]   Wave with a helicopter. Yeah, um, but one one thing. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.540]   Lost it. So go ahead. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:06.460]   So it's okay one one key difference that people need to understand whenever you talk about
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:13.500]   Facebook and google and filter bubbles and google would be quick to point this out is that in fact google's search doesn't filter
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:18.220]   It's technically not a fickle filter. They rank they give you all the results
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:23.580]   And they choose the order now that that may be splitting hairs, but facebook on the one hand
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:30.300]   Literally filters what they they never delivered to your newsfeed the majority of the things that people you follow have posted
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:34.060]   Well, you wouldn't want that you can see that on the right of the page you can see it all
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.060]   I understand what exactly
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:40.860]   But again again 50 percent of milleniums don't even know it's happening so they're not going to go in and tweak their settings
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:43.180]   but by default they
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:45.340]   Actually never deliver the majority
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.820]   Okay, let me rephrase that delivers all of it every time you know what?
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:52.460]   Amazon never gives you every book
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:57.180]   Amazon only gives you books that Amazon thinks you're gonna like you're in a book filter bubble
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:02.060]   No, I'm in a recommendation system that gives me greater relevance and saves me effort
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:06.460]   And that's that's what facebook is doing. They say we we know from your behavior what you enjoy most
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:10.940]   Will give you more of that. I don't see any problem with that amazon does give you every book
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:15.580]   Um, no, no, not not in the recommendations. They give you not the motions
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:19.500]   Not ever this I could hey I can search for a friend and see everything you said mike
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:25.660]   I can see but there is a real reason a filter bubble search is worthless the real reason if you're probably you're absolutely right
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:28.380]   That's another issue the real reason a filter bubble exists is because we
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:37.500]   In wanna filter we respond. We like the filter bubble. I confirm I for instance followed every republican candidate in the primary
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.980]   Uh the libertarian the green
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:45.820]   Uh every democratic candidate on facebook. I wanted all of that feed and I keep seeing ben karsens
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:51.820]   Feed in there by the way, that's how I know for instance that of all of his opponents in the primaries ben karsen
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:57.980]   Was the one that stayed the truest to donald trump had carried a lot of water on facebook for donald trump almost every day
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:03.900]   Carson posted karsen posted no surprise then the karsens on stage during trump's acceptance
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:09.100]   Speech trump trump's team was very aware of the power of social media
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:15.420]   And used it masterfully and hand and we like filters novels clip cleanness was clearly not
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:20.780]   Oh, not at all and that spreads not just a social media per se one of my criticisms of the clinton campaign
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.420]   Was there was no sense of a grassroots effort there?
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.060]   I was an old style top-down campaign
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:30.940]   Uh, they didn't even enable this is my pet peeve but they didn't even enable people to get the damn yard signs
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:34.300]   So the trump won the yarn side battle and the perception that was there
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:40.460]   Amazing it was hard to volunteer for the campaign. There was no sense of that whereas in trump there was no organization
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:43.340]   So you could hey i'm part of the trump campaign. I can be whatever i want to be
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:46.140]   I love by the way
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.020]   karas and keeler writing in the san francisco chronicle
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:55.020]   Uh, we are we liberal elitists are now completely in the clear the government is in republican hands
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:50:00.060]   Let them deal with trump democrats can spend four years raising heirloom tomatoes meditating
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:04.140]   Reading jane austin traveling around the country tasting art is in beers
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:09.980]   Let the republicans build the wall and carry on the trade war with china and deport the undocumented and deal with opioids
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:16.780]   And we democrats can go for a long brisk walk and smell i'm literally going to do all of those things. Thank thank you karasan
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.820]   karasan keeler
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:25.580]   Uh, let's take a break. Um, I I didn't want to get political, but you know, it's the day after an election
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:27.980]   You kept it pretty real then you kept it real then
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.940]   Uh, yeah, well, we didn't go too far. There may be some dis- there may be disputes some that dispute that
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:38.460]   They're well, they're always are with me. That's all right. When we come back. Let's talk about uh adam bane
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:44.540]   What a shocker? Yeah, that is and then you can all go smell the roses our show today brought to you by the ring
[00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:47.340]   video doorbell i'm sorry stacey's not here she's
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:52.780]   Had an event right some sort of internet of things event she's become our internet of things
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:58.780]   Uh guru and boy there's a lot of internet things news in the news these days
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:04.620]   But there's one internet of things device. I don't even think of as an internet of things device because it's so darn useful
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:12.940]   You don't need a hub to control it. It's secure. They do firmware updates and it serves a fantastic purpose
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:17.100]   It's the ring video doorbell and you know it doesn't unlock your door
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:21.900]   Uh, in fact, i'm nervous. I don't have a door lock that unlocks my door when I walk up to it
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:25.900]   That makes me nervous especially voice controlled one. Yeah. Hey door open. No
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:31.740]   This all this does is you put this you replace your regular ding donger with this and you don't by the way have to have a wired one
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:34.700]   Because the ring video doorbell there's several models
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:39.980]   But the model i have in my hands right now has a big old lithium ion battery good for a year and you can recharge it
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:42.780]   So it can add a doorbell to any door
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:47.820]   Uh, I use it on my wired doorbell though. It was very easy to install and has a complete kit
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:50.220]   Everything you need to do
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:54.940]   The only thing that really kind of makes it an internet of things device is then you pair it to your wifi
[00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:59.180]   And now when the doorbell rings not only does the chime ring in your house
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:06.540]   But it rings on your phone no matter where you are on your tablet on your windows or mac pc
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:13.580]   And you can answer it because there's a speaker in a microphone built in you can see who's there there's a high def camera built in
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:16.300]   So so it's like your home
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:21.020]   Which is really great for security because if some bad guy comes up to your door thinking
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:25.900]   I wonder if their home rings your doorbell. You could say we're home go go away
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:31.820]   And by the way almost every week. I just saw another story about a ring video doorbell caturing a thief
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:35.500]   On camera and getting the guy arrested so it really does work that way
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:38.700]   But I you know what we live in a safe neighborhood that's never happened to me
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:41.740]   But I like knowing when the kids come up to ring the doorbell and run away
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:47.500]   I like seeing when the uh ups or fedex guy comes and I can say hey leave the package on the porch
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.900]   And I can even keep an eye on it. He's got you know
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.260]   It's never happened to you because you have evidence that it's never happened to you because if it had
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:58.380]   Have happened to you you would have a video of it. So isn't that I mean I love that
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:03.420]   Now if you know something Leo, I knocked on a lot of doors the last four months in Pennsylvania
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:07.820]   And even though I didn't see you know rings on every doorbell lord knows that you saw a lot it changes
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:13.340]   It changes the but but but it's already had an impact I think on your behavior at someone's front door
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:16.780]   Yeah, yeah, because they're looking at you. You're not picking those
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:23.980]   Yeah, and and I can see if it's one of them darn clinton canvassers and I hope that's exactly true
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.620]   Here go away
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:32.780]   People often shocked when I tell them that I bring my ring video doorbell with me around the world and everywhere I stay at an air bmb
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:37.660]   I install it. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Sometimes with duct tape. Sometimes without
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:42.140]   Yes, I I would you're hooked never leave home without yeah, I
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:47.740]   It's even better. It's even more important when you're living abroad because when I come that's a good boy
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:52.060]   I'm staying in an air bmb all the neighbors know that whoever staying there is a foreigner probably has a lot of money
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:56.700]   And it's a good one. I come back from being out in the town
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:01.260]   I can just check my phone before I even go in the house and know if anybody's inside
[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:05.900]   It's very it's very reassuring from a from a piece of mine point of view
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.100]   I completely agree
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:11.100]   They have a variety of other products too if you want to observe the sides of the back of your house
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:15.020]   They have the stick up cam, which is a ring video doorbell minus a doorbell
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:18.460]   So it's got the camera the microphone the speaker you can go. Hey, what are you doing back there?
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:20.780]   It's fun to scare the cats too
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:24.860]   Yeah, you can see the video on your phone on your tablet on your computer
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:28.540]   They even have a little solar panel you can connect so it has no wires at all
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:34.140]   It's powered by the solar panel has a battery so the panel charges it up at during the day and it works all night
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:40.060]   All the ring doorbells and the stick up cam have motion sensors and they will alert you
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:43.820]   Um, and they're you know, they're really affordable you in fact
[00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:49.340]   We've got these kits a hundred up to 150 dollars off a ring a security kit that includes a variety of different ring products
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:55.580]   Every kit comes with the solar powered ring security sign to let the world know that you are protected
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:57.660]   Yes, you can pack that in your suitcase too
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:01.980]   Uh, they also offer a chime which can be a doorbell when there is no doorbell
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:06.620]   So you can extend the range of your doorbell. There's some some great stuff on there just go to ring.com slash

[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:14.540]   slash twig
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:16.620]   Your ring video doorbell
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:23.980]   That is one good thing about the election being over robo calls. Yes are done right. I hope
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:26.780]   Wow, that was out of control
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:30.460]   Not so much in california where we were kind of giving up
[00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:35.820]   Nobody nobody thought we but there were a few I kept I was getting three or four calls a day
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:41.660]   I couldn't stop the bernie sanders spam. It just kept coming even after he dropped out
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:46.060]   Even after he jumped dropped out and I kept unsubscribing and it just nothing could stop it
[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:48.780]   I did get a lot you know, I gave money to clet the clinton campaign
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:53.740]   I did get a lot of calls once you give money I gave money to abama last time and once you give money
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:56.220]   They're gonna keep calling you. Yeah, it was fun
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:59.580]   You got a hook in your mouth because at least it was getting all the Donald Trump mail
[00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:04.940]   So we really had it covered so so can we can we talk a bit about mail mailing list because I said I think this is another tech
[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:07.020]   angle one of the
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:14.220]   Terrifying things for trump opponents out of this whole election and this is a minor detail that slipped the attention of lots of people
[00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.940]   But but for for a variety of reasons
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:22.460]   Trump was the trump campaign and donald trump personally was given full access
[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:24.940]   uh to the entire gop
[00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:26.620]   mailing list
[00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:32.860]   Inperpetuity which he can use in the future for any purpose he wants he also had his own separate mailing list
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:37.740]   Um that was that he did not give the republican party access to right?
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:43.580]   Donald trump now has the world's largest political mailing list that he personally can control
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:51.020]   Uh, it's the definition every year. I'm sure i've had there the democrats. No, no, I believe that on the democratic side that the candidate
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:56.060]   Uh for double hillary plinton doesn't get to keep that and use it and and and email people
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:59.100]   Uh, it was it's uh the result of a variety of things
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:03.740]   But I was shocked to discover that and I back when I thought trump would lose
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:06.700]   I thought well, this is going to be the foundation of his media empire
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:11.660]   He's gonna he and and rod roger ails are going to launch a fox competitor
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:17.260]   And and they're going to clobber them because they have that they have the gop and the donald trump mailing list away
[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:22.780]   That rumor is another great example of the bubble that the media was in yeah
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:26.860]   Well a trump's gonna lose right and b when he does it he's gonna do what we do
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:30.540]   Right. It was like completely confabulated around
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:34.780]   The media's sense of what's going on in the work, but there was some evidence
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:38.860]   The empire kind of started on facebook live. Oh, yeah, right?
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:43.340]   Uh editor on leave. Yeah, steve bannon would probably have likes too. I think both
[00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:47.500]   I wonder what bannon's role will he be press secretary in the oh, he's gonna have to shave
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:55.340]   No, no, no, he's a suit. He's a he's a callea conway. You think she'll have a role in the administration. Oh, yeah, typically campaign
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:58.140]   Uh
[00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:02.220]   Chairs yeah, you're right. She can she can maybe make more money just going on to the campaign
[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:09.660]   Professional political consultant. Yeah. Yes. So typically people like james carville don't take a position in the administration. Yes
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:13.340]   They're hired guns that move on right. Although one wonders
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:20.620]   Whether she and david axle rod became head of staff. He did that's that's absolutely right. He was an advisor though to clinton
[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:22.700]   But left pretty quickly
[00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:25.020]   if i um
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:30.620]   Conway though, will she get any credit for trump's victory really? Yes, I think she will. Oh, oh, yes
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:33.980]   She put up with a lot of crash. Well, she put up with okay. She has to defend a lot of
[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:39.740]   Apparently it seemed as if uh, trump was running his own campaign single handedly, right?
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:46.940]   Um, you know lewanda ski was fired and uh conway took over with the and and bannon with no
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:51.900]   Seeming change in strategy. I wonder i guess we'll someday somebody will write the book
[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:55.020]   I can I look forward to reading it. Yeah, jess
[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:59.580]   Well, no, somebody was somebody with insider access the whole time. I would hope
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:02.860]   This is a surprise. Um
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:07.020]   Adam bane is widely considered the most likable guy at twitter
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:13.900]   He ran sales right jeff before he was moved to coo get over to twitter in 2010 from um murdock
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:19.500]   Yeah, I usually used to work with him at advancement years ago. Oh, you know it comes from me. Yeah. Yeah, great guy
[00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:26.060]   Really, really wonderful executive. Uh, yeah, when they were talking about who's going to be the next ceo before they
[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:28.780]   made jack dorsey the ceo
[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:33.580]   Uh, his name was most widely touted. He uh wrote in a statement
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:38.060]   Uh, the past six years have been incredible. I'm inspired by what twitter has become
[00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:40.700]   And what it will be in the future
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:47.420]   Anthony and I have worked side by side since he joined twitter in 2014. Anthony is his successor by the way, Anthony natto
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:52.140]   The cfo he's gonna take the least temporary successor like the coo
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:55.020]   Uh wall twitter searches for a new cfo
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:59.180]   So I guess no no natto is going to be the coo and they're going to replace him. Yeah, anthony
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:01.180]   I've worked side by side since he joined twitter
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.460]   2014 I have full faith in what he and the team will accomplish in the future
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.260]   Why is adam bane leaving?
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:14.300]   That's the question everybody's going to be asking is this an ouster is jack dorsey trying to consolidate
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:21.020]   Um, certainly nobody dislikes adam bane spent more time with family. They always say that
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:24.700]   Uh, i'm looking in the new york times story
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:30.140]   Um people work with bane requested anonymity
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:34.620]   Said he would not join a major twitter competitor like facebook
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:38.540]   Instead he'll more likely pursue something outside the advertising
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:42.300]   industry, but I don't think there's anything in here that says
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:47.340]   Whether he's leaving on his own. I think he's been poached
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:55.420]   Whether he's been poached or whether twitter's forcing him out. He'll be working first. Just gonna have to read the tea leaves
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:01:02.620]   Don't know what it means. Uh jeff you uh, where do you stand on the pixel now you keeping it
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:11.100]   So here's here's my here's my bad to worst story. It should have been this is an omen
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.300]   So I go to the philadelphia rally for hillary clinton
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.980]   and uh, you know wonderful
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:20.940]   event, you know huggy with my fellow liberals
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:25.580]   Um, that's the one john bonjovas was that right? Yeah, so I see bah
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:29.260]   I see the back of bonjovie and then the back of the boss. It was a weird setup
[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:34.220]   So but I was in the crowd of loving me. Steve was there too. That's right. He was there too. Yeah. Yeah, it's under road
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.780]   In fact, I saw your picture from behind
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:41.100]   I remember seeing the picture a little tiny a little tiny boss
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:43.500]   The other horizon
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:47.260]   Uh, and I was actually pretty close actually I thought yeah, it looks pretty good like a good
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:53.340]   I was close, but it was but it was but it was the guy went far back from me. Anyway, all those people are shouldn't be voting but anyway
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.100]   um
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:56.700]   So I come home
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.700]   and I have my
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.220]   Old
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.740]   6p in my pocket
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:05.980]   And I'm I wrote a piece about how I always grumpy and i'm thinking okay fine. I'm gonna get the real this thing
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:09.580]   I'm probably no i'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna spend a month before fortunate i'm probably about this
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:15.420]   And I'm luckily I hadn't done anything yet, but I better with a toilet and boom in goes no
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:18.540]   So god chose
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:21.580]   Well, yes or no, I mean I dried it off and it seems to be okay
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:28.380]   6p, do you remember if it was I don't think it was uh, no, I don't think it was
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:32.700]   So I hope it's kind of but I think that may be god telling me yes to go ahead
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:36.780]   I think you're gonna like the pixel. I have the little one now. I'm using the excel
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:41.980]   Oh, yeah, yeah, you like you know and I really like did you take this picture with the pixel or with a 6p the
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:49.100]   O6b okay, okay the camera. I think you're gonna really like the camera. Yeah, so so the eyes are what appear
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:53.660]   I I know it's become a joke on this show and that's fine because it's shtick
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:03:01.100]   But it's really really honest to god true. I have just frigging frigging had it with google and and and and the
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:09.980]   Treating g spot. Oh, I'm sorry g suite. Yeah, I count users formerly known as apps users as second class citizens when we are the paying customers
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:17.820]   What other companies disadvantaged they're paying customers. This is not hard to solve just give me the option of saying
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:23.100]   I want this calendar related with that activity. I want those photos related that activity
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:27.980]   Just gonna give me the customer the option it is shameful and I was just reading through the comments on medium after I wrote this
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:32.780]   People saying yeah, I've had it the same thing with the home that arrived
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:35.580]   Right
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:38.940]   Complain about that because it doesn't work with the calendar
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:44.620]   Exactly because I'm a g spot. Excuse me g suite customer and actually you know
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:48.780]   What's amazing the Amazon echo does a better job of the google calendar in the google home. Yes
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:52.220]   So google dammit
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.540]   Good google
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:57.020]   Neuban go go
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:02.540]   I'm not joking. I'm really I'm really just pissed off. I hear I am a google fan boy. I talk about you
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:07.580]   I say one of the things I defend you in europe. I do all these great things, but jesus freaking google
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:10.700]   This is your shortest company on earth
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:13.020]   Solve it
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.380]   It's not hard
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:21.820]   Give your customers the option of how to use their own damn stuff and their own damn identity with the activities that you get
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:24.220]   and do not
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:28.620]   Disadvantage your pain customers. So not just it just pissed me off all over again
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:33.340]   There are things that I can't do because I'm in a sweets application that number one number two
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.740]   It is wildly expensive to my view and yes
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:39.820]   Others have pointed out to me on medium that it's overpriced like other phones are overpriced
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:43.980]   Um, but I think it's a rich person's pricing and number three
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:48.140]   I do resent the idea that they limit assistant because it's BS that
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:52.460]   Assistant is limited to the pixels absolute BS. There's no reason for it
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:55.820]   So so what they've done is they've they've forked their own android
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:05:02.940]   And those who spend too much money on their phone get a function that the rest of android users who've made google huge
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:09.180]   Should be nine out of ten phones with android won't let them use that's BS google
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:16.860]   So i'm grumpy about all those things around the phone. I'm and and I got the rma. I have 14 days to decide
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:19.500]   From when I got it two days ago
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:23.180]   Um, and the other thing I've done so I've tried three times now three times
[01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:27.660]   I've tried to go ahead and say all right. Let me go ahead and put the two wires in and i'll move everything over
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:31.740]   Hours it's spent and this stuff never arrives. It never finishes
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:35.500]   So I don't know if that's just because there's a lot
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:39.580]   I don't know. Yeah, so that was I by the way, I thought a nice feature
[01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:44.780]   Powered by the type c connector. I guess although I could do it with a regular usb
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:49.020]   As well, but I was able to connect the six p to the pixel
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:52.940]   And just say copy and it copies all the how long did it take?
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:58.140]   You're not going three hours. No, no, no, it was like an hour and I and I had a lot of stuff
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:04.140]   I don't I think there's something going on there. I don't know how to because it's it's it's autumn as I can't figure out how to do that
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:08.620]   So so you know you're spending a fortune on this thing and they're pissing me off
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:11.420]   And they're playing a game with us
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:17.660]   And so here I am we're on this week in google and i've been i'm the google fanboy been there all along but but google
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:19.740]   You've made me grumpy. You really made me grumpy
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:23.100]   I don't yeah, so there's another casualty of
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.820]   roost porets
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:28.540]   Belt tightening at alphabet
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:32.700]   Uh the drone project. I remember we were talking about project. I'm in august. Yeah
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:36.140]   Uh, that was that was the one that was delivering chipotle
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:43.180]   uh burritos to students of Virginia tech remember we had positive that you'd have to have a burrito umbrella to
[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:47.100]   Keep from the burrito hitting you clomering you in the head as they dropped it off
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:54.460]   Um, it won approval for test flights in august as part of a white house effort to encourage unmanned vehicle delivery
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:59.340]   Uh, they were considering and then next a partnership with starbucks
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:02.620]   Uh, this is according to bloomberg technology
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:08.460]   Uh, the project leader left in october dave, uh, devos and the unit froze hiring
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:11.500]   And began asking staff to seek jobs elsewhere
[01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:15.660]   In the company so the drone project
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:20.780]   Uh, not exactly a moonshot more like a burrito shot right?
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.860]   but
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:25.820]   I didn't care about the burrito one but the latte one that latte
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:32.540]   I really wanted so you you'd have uh heirloom tomatoes. Uh, yes gently dropped from hell from
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:35.980]   parachutes to you. Yes, that would be nice
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.860]   That would be nice
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:40.860]   Uh, deep mind
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:43.980]   The google uh ai that won, uh, the go
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:51.500]   Competition against one of the top go players in the world is now going to take on something even harder than chess or go
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.820]   starcraft 2
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.100]   Yeah
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:59.340]   Actually if it's playing those, you know, I stopped playing games like this online
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:03.500]   Because there are kids in korean, uh, cyber cafes
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:09.580]   Who have the reflexes of you know, and now those kids are going to see what it's like when deep mind is out there
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:13.900]   Maybe it can they're but it doesn't seem fair to have a computer play a computer game. No, it's like
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:19.420]   That's like having a frenchman speak for it. I had a lot of that. Yeah, I think yeah
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:25.900]   I always hated it when the when the french kids took the french classes right with you right in college
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:29.660]   I took chinese like with all these chinese kids. They said, you know chinese
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:36.460]   That's not fair. I would that's what that happened to me at at ucla. I I took japanese for three years
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:44.380]   And in the first year everything was great, but but as we got closer to the three-year period everyone else in the class was japanese american went to japanese school
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:45.660]   It's like
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:46.860]   It's not fair. It's not fair
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:52.300]   But and it was also not fair when watson was clobbering everybody on jeopardy because watson didn't have to be a base
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:57.260]   Well watson didn't have to press the buzzer, you know, I mean there wasn't a reflex component to watson's
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:04.220]   Yeah, that's a big part of jeopardy. Yeah, in fact, I remember uh ken jennings the jeopardy champion saying really you should assume
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:08.460]   Everybody knows the answer to every question. Yeah, it's not about the questions and answers on jeopardy. It's about
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:11.660]   Press the button right yes at the right time
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:18.300]   I never use this, but this is another dying google features google showtimes. Did you ever use that?
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:19.900]   Never
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:23.420]   No, only a search it would come up with short times. I've used that
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:24.700]   Uh
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:30.300]   But I never used I never used the separate service that yeah, so you can do it in search so they don't need a separate
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:34.780]   Stand-alone movie site shut down on november 1st. Thanks for stopping by
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:42.540]   It was discontinued. How do we feel about the google's growing reputation as a company that you can't
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:46.860]   Can't trust you can't trust because they may or may not cancel anything right
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:53.740]   Is it is this a an existential problem for google? I think it is. I've said this for a while. It's uh, yeah
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:56.220]   absolute uh
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:02.620]   Feeling I think among people that well don't get too involved in anything with google because it's gonna break up with you any minute
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:08.540]   They came out with aloe and everybody was saying yeah, you know, it's like they're gonna cancel this in like a year or so
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:11.500]   I was talking about aloe on windows weekly earlier
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:16.620]   And paul throt and I we're talking about the various the effect that on android you could use third-party mess
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:21.180]   You could use like for instance. I use facebook messenger as well as sms messenger and I
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:27.660]   Said but you can't use aloe google's own messaging product cannot be used as its main messenger, right?
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:34.140]   You know, it's so infuriating if google imagine if google had
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:40.860]   Any kind of vision what they would do is they would come out with a product and they would say it's called google messenger
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:45.580]   We will never discontinue this product no matter what we've guaranteed that for 20 years at least
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:52.940]   We will support this product going forward and have no other messaging product and in that product you have third-party integration bots the assistant
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:57.180]   You could have sms native support everyone would use it
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:03.580]   But no they have nobody even knows what their messaging strategy is or what their apps are still going and well
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:08.940]   I had google voice but now now I have google phy and that what does that mean for voice and how do I delete?
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:11.100]   It's like nobody knows what's going on
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.500]   and and it's like they're just they're just
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:18.060]   Bumbling their way to not being involved in the messenger movement
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:23.660]   It's too bad because this is as apple has shown a big deal. Yes. Yeah
[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:31.500]   YouTube this is the according to the the verge
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:38.700]   YouTube read which is that yeah ad-free version of youtube as of late summer
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:44.060]   Only has one and a half million paying subscribers and i'm one of them
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:49.980]   But I don't ever watch anything. I get you get you get the audio with red right you get some other things with red
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:56.620]   But i've got to cancel it you can like download the music. Yes. Yes you get you get the subscription to their music service
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:12:01.740]   Well, don't don't you get that with the music service? Yeah, so i'm wondering if that's including people who subscribe
[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:05.980]   That direction music service because that's what I do I subscribe to google
[01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:10.300]   I don't think access music or what do they call it google play music now and I get youtube red
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:12.700]   Are they counting me in that one and a half?
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:15.660]   I guess if that's the case that's terrible
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:19.820]   I think this number isn't meaningful because uh
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:23.580]   There are more there must be more than one and a half million subscribers
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:28.540]   Because i'm sure google's play music has more than one and a half and subscribers
[01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:33.820]   What does that mean for ad-free youtube people aren't willing to pay for ad-free youtube?
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:35.820]   I
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:41.420]   Because you're not you're not watching anything. It's you know wildly amazing. I really care
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:44.060]   Yeah, sorry. Yes, it's really bad. Yeah
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:52.460]   Uh coming in thanksgiving a nine episode virtual reality tv show from the nfl
[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:55.660]   on google daydream
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:59.180]   Uh now
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:03.100]   It's my sense that daydream view is just like cardboard right? I
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:06.940]   It's I could watch out to somebody who used have you used it? No
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:10.700]   I talked to somebody who did and I don't know what's the difference
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:14.140]   That's the main actually that's the main reason to hold on to the phone is so I can use daydream
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:15.420]   Yeah
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:18.620]   Right because yeah, don't you have to have a pixel to use daydream? Uh
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:21.820]   That's another question. I don't know do you
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:25.660]   Uh, but they said you need a smartphone. I don't know if it works with others
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:28.220]   You have because you also have the um remote
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:30.300]   the
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:34.780]   The ui device on it. Um, they thought it was amazing and different
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:37.980]   But I didn't get a chance to really quiz them about their experience well other things
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:42.780]   Let me look go to store. Googled because maybe I should just they're not very expensive
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:47.180]   But I just thought well if it's well if you know if you want a pixel you should get it for free really
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:49.820]   Yeah, you're supposed to get a um
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:54.380]   Frustrated sometime in november you're supposed to get a code get it for free
[01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:59.020]   Well, I want to get it, you know, whatever else gets it. I want to wait so it's another thing. Maybe grumpy
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:04.380]   They're gonna email me or something. Yeah, let's see does good does the pixel
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:07.820]   J dream require the pixel
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.860]   I mean it's gonna say that on the site, right?
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:14.860]   I don't think so. Oh a daydream ready phone such as pixel
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:21.580]   But what other daydream ready phones are? I don't know they're vague about that so presumably other companies will do that
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:26.220]   And then right under it when they they say see more like this and it's the 15 dollar google cardboard
[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:29.580]   So but there's there's okay
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:32.860]   So there's some hardware improvements specific
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:37.020]   to down dream blue tooth le for two le
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:41.100]   You have to have a display between 4.7 and 6 inches
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:48.060]   resolution 1080p at 60 hertz so I could use it with my pixel my little I have the baby pixel
[01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:51.420]   Does anybody else hate the fact that it's fabric
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.340]   Yes
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:57.500]   Well, that makes a little bit of dollars. It's uh, just is it real fabric or is it
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:03.260]   fake phony fabric? It's just it's it's I just I'm repelled by the material. It's really
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:10.220]   Well, but the problem is the problem with the cardboard of course was you got grease on it, right?
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:15.660]   Right, but with this you have grease that is like just sort of absorbed in the material. Hmm. Oh really?
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:21.580]   Um, I mean it's like I just I don't like it. It is. Oh, I tell you I don't like it
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:26.060]   I can't remember if we talked about facebook's results
[01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:30.060]   I think not I think they came in after the show yesterday
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:35.020]   Well, no, we did we did talk to the results. Yeah, okay
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:37.660]   Um
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:43.260]   I'm just looking for other stories. Make sure we cover everything. Oh, so so I had a brush with fame
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:48.220]   I should tell you about a brush with fame a brush with fame, but jeff you are famous. Oh, no
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:50.780]   That would be self-brushing
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:55.500]   I uh, when when the the I'm not trying to get back to the politics, but when the combi
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:58.460]   Scandal was out
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:02.700]   Uh, and and they had six day to analyze 650,000 emails from, um
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.500]   The perverts laptop as they said in the ads
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.500]   Uh
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:13.420]   Baby, you know how much time is it gonna take us all difficult and flin the military intelligence advisor to trump said
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:17.340]   Uh, they couldn't possibly do this in a week and kelly con congress, huh?
[01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.820]   So I just went on twitter and I said, hey snowed
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:25.420]   Uh, how well we're taking nsa to d do 650,000 emails
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:30.460]   And boom he came back in an instant and said well get rid of the um
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:34.860]   Uh, the un responded to bbc and so on fields
[01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:38.780]   Uh hash them compare take out only the difs
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:42.140]   Uh old laptop minutes to ours. Yeah
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:47.100]   No, that was not that picked up. It was never a question. Yeah, no, but I was really happy
[01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:51.500]   I was trying to make a point and snowed and responded. I mean people were writing articles about it
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.380]   Yeah, they did which is ridiculous. That's all it takes pretty cool
[01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:56.860]   So what he characters you get an article right?
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:17:02.540]   Well, that's trump's that that was the thing trump discovered you could turn it and the world would turn his tweets into articles. Yeah
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:10.460]   So before we move on from the google world. Yes, I wanted to mention a little startup
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:14.940]   Which inspired me a lot because it inspired a column and a podcast
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:18.700]   These it's a it's a new category of
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:23.580]   Smart glasses that I call invisible smart glasses the company i'm talking about is called view
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:26.380]   They only have four employees. It's a totally tiny startup
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:30.220]   But they make smart glasses that have that you can't tell are smart glasses
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:33.420]   They're just regular prescription glasses and regular sunglasses
[01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:36.300]   And the way they say is a kickstarter
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:39.660]   They they have a very successful kickstarter. Oh, yeah, no kidding
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:43.900]   Yeah, and so they they said they're on their official target was smart class
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:47.820]   Their unofficial target was 500k and they exceeded 500k already
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:53.580]   Uh with 30 days. So here's a dark wearing google glass. Yeah, and you're VR
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:54.700]   Yep
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:18:01.420]   Uh and the pizza guy's going skeptical. Yeah, I'm not talking to you buddy. So these are the so that's a touch screen on the side
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:03.340]   So they they have
[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:07.580]   Bone conduction audio and a patent pending bone conduction audio on both sides
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:12.220]   So you have speakers you hear they're speakers so you can hear there's a blinking light and inside
[01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:16.620]   So the other people can't see the blinking light but you can detect it meaning you have notification
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:23.340]   Is a microphone that didn't the pixel the google thing use a bone conduction? Oh, yes, that's on one side
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:28.460]   Yeah, and so they also had earbuds that came down awkwardly that you plugged in it optionally
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:31.740]   But this has later. Yeah, this has bone conduction on both sides
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:39.580]   And they also claim that their their patents prevent noise leakage. So other people can't hear you hear better other people hear less good
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:46.620]   Where's the camera though? They can't there is no camera. There is no screen. Oh, and so so there's my content phones in my classes
[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:48.940]   my contention is that
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.940]   everybody's going to go gaga for
[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:57.020]   Artificially intelligent virtual assistants the future versions of google assistant the future version of series
[01:18:57.020 --> 01:19:03.580]   Etc, but it's going to be so compelling I believe is an interface that we're going to want to have them all the time
[01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:08.940]   Now people are saying well, we're going to have herables, but you can't really have earbuds in your ear all day long
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:15.180]   What is on the other hand what about apples earbuds? You're going to wear your prescription glasses all day no matter what
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:18.060]   Right, and so I think this is the future of smart glasses
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.660]   I think when you go to the optometrist office in three years or five years
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:25.100]   You're gonna you want it's gonna be one of the options you want this frame that frame
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.580]   Do you want smart dumb glasses? What do you want? You want smart glasses? Okay?
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:32.220]   And it's just gonna be a normal thing. I think how do you choose? Do you have to go through our audio menu?
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:37.740]   They're gonna have a they're gonna have a website where you go. Oh, I'm sorry choose options choose an option right it is
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:39.740]   There's plenty functions
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:42.140]   Yeah, they're gonna have a they're gonna have an API and stuff like that
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:47.580]   But out of the box right out of the box you answer phones by tapping the side and you can have the conversation through the glasses
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:52.620]   You get you have your conversations with Siri or google assistant or whatever through the classes
[01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:56.620]   So to a certain extent they're earbuds that don't go in your ears
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:59.580]   And and they have a microphone built in
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:05.100]   And but I think these are just ideal for virtual How much?
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:10.860]   Um, they're gonna be 279 in the kickstart of their 179. That's another benefit. They're super light
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:13.580]   you know, they're just they're just
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:17.820]   The the idea isn't view. I don't think honestly. I don't think view is going to be able to
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:23.180]   Be back the enormous competition. They should be getting from larger companies with when you know who's getting you know
[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.180]   Who's really getting into this and in fact?
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:32.380]   We talked about on a twit on sunday snaps spectacles. Yeah. Yeah, and this is uh, this is a an instagram from mike murphy
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:36.380]   Yes showing snaps filters if you're using the spectacles
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:41.740]   So one of the things that's most popular in snapchat is those filters going the other way, right?
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:46.860]   Right, but he's showing robe me rainbow spewing clouds as he looks at the right
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:49.420]   They're gonna be $130
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:56.540]   And snap is doing I should call it snapchat the company's called snap snap chat snapchat is doing something interesting
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:21:02.140]   They are going to only offer these spectacles initially to people who are highest right? Yes snapchat
[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:04.300]   They're gonna try to create demand through envy
[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:08.220]   Which makes me want to start sharing everything I do on snapchat
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:13.100]   But they look ridiculous and they'll never take off in the market because nobody wants to look at walk around looking like
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:17.020]   No, no, they won't it's it's a it's a parlour trick in a novelty at this point
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:19.900]   They'll never be mainstream and you were right
[01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:23.660]   Yeah, you were right, but these are hip and sweeten
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:29.260]   Only until you actually have people are we and you can't wear them see this is the thing
[01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:35.500]   The doing snapchat and doing this stupid augmented reality pokemon stuff is not a compelling application
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:42.780]   Having an artificially intelligent AI all day guiding you informing you keeping you up to date giving you advice
[01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:50.060]   Doing things for you that is the interface that is the way we're going to interact primarily with computers in the future
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:52.460]   And we have to have a natural
[01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:56.300]   Socially acceptable way to to interact with our virtual assistants
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:01.580]   And it's not going to be having google home in every bathroom and every car dashboard and no
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:08.140]   We don't want microphones everywhere. We want to wear the microphone and glasses are the our device that we're already wearing
[01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:13.100]   Very you know, so I think I again. I don't know the view will be the company
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:17.660]   But that category of which there are a couple of other companies as well working on it
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:22.620]   I think this is the sleeper hit of the next two or three years
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:28.140]   That's where smart glasses are going to go mainstream. We're going to be interested. How do you spell view?
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:32.060]   viewy it's on kickstarter right now. Yeah
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:39.340]   The order code order pair Mike. I have not no too expensive for me and I wear contacts
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:41.420]   But you wear glasses every day. Yeah
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:48.780]   Adobe has demoed a new Photoshop for audio. This is kind of worrisome to me that lets you
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:53.420]   Edit audio edit speech as easily as text in other words
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:58.220]   You could put any words in anybody's mouth listens to you talk for a while
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:05.420]   And then after it masters how you speak and what your voice sounds like you can just type things and it will say in your voice
[01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:11.660]   Everything you type. So oh my yeah. Oh my oh, I thought it was just editing. Oh, this is huge because
[01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:16.780]   It means soon. I'll be able to take a day off right you'll never know well you can sit there
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:22.780]   You can sit there in your casper mattress just typing words. Yeah, I would be saying. Yeah, I like it
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:23.820]   Yeah
[01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:28.700]   I had that to a I and we have the Leo robot, right? You know what's funny though. That's exactly right
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:33.820]   I saw this technology demoed in micro at microsoft research lab in the 90s
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:34.620]   Oh wow
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:41.500]   They had this right they had Elvis and mare aluminuro talking and jfk and all this stuff and you could pick any celebrity voice and they said oh
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:44.060]   You know six months will be able to do your voice
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:46.620]   Never emerge from the lab. So
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:51.180]   Somebody in the chat ever said kids are going to use this that would get their mom's voice down and they'll have their mom
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:55.020]   Yeah, school and say yeah little little Johnny sick today
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:59.740]   You know when when I'm working on columns what I do is I find stories like that and I think well
[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:02.460]   What is the bigger picture and I swear a little way in a folder?
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:05.740]   Yeah, and and this falls into the category and I'm going to be writing about this
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:09.900]   Hopefully soon of new technologies that help distort reality
[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:16.460]   You know, there's another yeah technology being available to the general public where you can lie convincingly
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:21.100]   And confuse people and make them think something is true when it isn't true
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:26.700]   And that there's a whole category of these kinds of technologies. We're really going to have to emphasize in education
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:29.180]   how to make
[01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:30.860]   kids skeptical
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:37.100]   And how to be savvy consumers about what they're seeing and hearing and so on and this is just one small example amazing
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:41.740]   By the way, we didn't is it is it we were all set
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:44.060]   for the
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:46.780]   disruptions of the elections hackers getting into the
[01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:53.100]   Databases voters suppression see apparently I mean I haven't heard anything about it. Nothing happened, right
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:25:00.060]   We were we said we're gonna hit back if Russia messes with our election Trump Trump said that the election was rigged
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:05.100]   So I expect now that he's gonna be present he's gonna investigate and find out exactly how this really took place
[01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:10.140]   If Clinton rigged the election she didn't do a very good job
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:14.220]   uh, so I guess that none of that happened, but maybe it was
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:17.100]   uh, maybe the whole idea was uh
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:21.260]   For that article that said will strike back was just a little warning
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:28.460]   Don't mess or or a strike back has actually occurred they they you know that the indication was and the wise policy was that you
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:31.180]   You do it behind the scenes. You don't do it as a public shaming
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:34.860]   You do it as a as a behind the scenes thing that's never less painful
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:39.260]   And so I'm certain that the us has the capability to strike back
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:43.660]   Um, and I think it's important that we do in situations like this
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:45.660]   I
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:51.740]   Well, uh, let's take a break and uh wrap up. Uh, jeff has to get going. So I'm not I don't know
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:55.500]   I don't but it's whatever you want. Not they haven't they don't love me. They don't care
[01:25:55.500 --> 01:26:00.460]   They don't have a come back to me. Maybe s was supposed to put him on, but I don't know what happened
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:04.300]   You know what they do. I've had this happen to me. Oh right overbook
[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:09.420]   They well they also call you and they interview as if they're gonna put you on but really they're just getting background
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:12.540]   Yeah, yeah, they're letting you do the work. Yep. Yeah
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:14.860]   Yep
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:19.820]   Anyway, uh good. Well, we uh, we'll we'll keep you around for a little bit longer anything
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:28.300]   Have I I guess we can we can there's still a ton of stuff about the election and you know, uh, yeah, but I think we probably
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:34.540]   Corey doctor o a mad man has been given the keys to the surveillance state
[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:37.660]   Um, you know, but it's so unknown
[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:45.980]   Someone known what's gonna happen here. Um, I think that one of the the interesting things about this
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:48.620]   election, uh, is that
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:53.820]   It's raised the question exactly what can a president do?
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:27:02.460]   Uh, without any supervision and what can what what in what ways are our presidents constrained by
[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:07.100]   Other factors by congress, whatever, you know, I it's a good question in the surveillance thing
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:12.940]   How much access does a president have to people's answer this question before the election of ben wisener who is snowedans?
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:16.700]   Attorney and works at the aclu
[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:27.180]   on issues like this and he said we we have an imperial presidency he said particularly in foreign policy, which includes issues like surveillance
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:30.380]   Uh, the president has very few checks
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:33.500]   ca a domestic
[01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:37.020]   Congress will absolutely weigh in and you know, maybe have more power
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:41.340]   than the president, but there's very little to stop a president from launching a drone attack or
[01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:45.980]   Uh, surveilling you or incur or having the nsa surveil
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:49.980]   Um, and and especially since so much of this is done in secret
[01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:52.220]   um, and the
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:58.140]   Intelligence committees of course are going to be run by republicans who are presumably supporters of trump. Yep, so I think
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:03.420]   The question isn't whether he can do it. The question is whether he would want to do it
[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:06.780]   And if he would start doing that and certainly there will be pressures
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:11.420]   From the fbi the cia and the nsa to do it. Yeah
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:16.540]   Uh, and my guess is that that trump's inclination would be to say yeah, go ahead
[01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:20.460]   But I but I don't know. Yeah, what is his policy on that?
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:25.900]   It's not gonna be a question of trump. It's gonna be what's allowed of it. Can you imagine juliani with that power?
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:29.420]   Yeah, I think juliani'd probably do it
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:33.100]   Yeah, exactly. Here's here's a here's a hypothetical so
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:39.580]   Obama has never has never held back. I mean, that's you know, that's what we fed out. Yeah, I mean, obama
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:45.500]   Uh, one of the campaign promises that obama has failed to live up to is he promised to reign in
[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:50.460]   Um surveillance mass surveillance and so on and he didn't really do that
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:54.220]   Um, but but there's a difference between a president
[01:28:54.700 --> 01:29:00.140]   Using mass surveillance to do counter terrorism for example, which is a completely legitimate
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:05.020]   Uh use of surveillance technology and again we have to remind the public
[01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:10.620]   Uh again and again that the nsa exists to to spy on
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:18.540]   Foreign communications. That's what it's for the cia are their spies. They they they exist in order to steal secrets
[01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:23.020]   This is the correct this is the correct use of of something like the nsa and the cia
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:28.620]   So what we're talking about is the potential for nixonian you abuse of those kinds of things
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:31.100]   So let's say there's a reporter who's criticizing
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:34.060]   Uh trump to to to good effect
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:37.020]   What access does trump have to go
[01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:41.020]   Listen to that reporter's calls now. He's done this at his hotels. He's installed
[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:46.620]   Surveillance equipment and listening on the phone calls real of people who've stated his hotels reportedly
[01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:48.220]   Um
[01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:53.100]   And this is one of the many things that got lost in the in the endless barrage of accusations and so on
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:55.100]   But that's something to look into
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:58.300]   So that's actually great music for what i'm saying
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:04.060]   The music you know more and where websites are doing autoplay video. It's driving me
[01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:08.300]   These shows just turn off the sound at least please
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:12.780]   Okay, so so so you know so the question is what can he go and listen to that?
[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:19.340]   Reporters private and look dig up dirt on that person to intimidate or to arrest or whatever
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:21.820]   Is is that something he can do not?
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:24.300]   I'm not saying he would do this
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:26.940]   But can he do that? What would stop him from doing that?
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:29.660]   Well, and we know that already thanks to omorosa
[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:33.660]   The president trump president elect trump has an enemies list
[01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:36.460]   um
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:39.260]   She
[01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:42.940]   She told she remembers she was a contestant on the apprentice. She was the evil one right?
[01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:46.780]   I didn't I met her I didn't either but I met only reason I know this is I met her
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:51.660]   Uh when I did it alive with regis and kelly she was a guest at the around that time
[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:55.740]   Brush with fame. Yeah, my brush with fame nothing i'm proud of
[01:30:55.740 --> 01:31:00.060]   I spent half an hour in the green room with rosio donald once there you go
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:07.340]   That fat she she will not be in the no she's on the list. I believe she's on the she has certainly on the enemies. Yeah
[01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:08.380]   Or
[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:14.940]   Oh morosa told the independent journal review last night at the election party. It's so great our enemies are making themselves clear
[01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:19.020]   So that we when we get into the white house we know where we stand
[01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:22.380]   Those who vote against trump will be placed on a special
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:27.340]   List if she's talking about senator lindsey graham
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:33.020]   Uh who voted announced that he voted on twitter of all places for another candidate if graham felt his interest
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:35.820]   Were with that candidate god bless him. I would never judge anybody
[01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:40.300]   For exercising their right to and the freedom to choose what they want, but let me just tell you
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:48.780]   Mr. trump has a long memory and we are keeping a list. Holy cow. That's uh, there you go. There you go
[01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:52.860]   I consider this source. I don't know if she has it inside the insider's track now
[01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:55.500]   Now just to just to uh, track back to what I said
[01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:59.580]   I was kind of vague about it, but the this is a buzzfeed report on june 30th
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:07.020]   Uh, and they say they claim that they have sources that trump had a phone console near his bed at the at the at his florida hotel
[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:10.060]   Oh, yes. Yeah, he had a big switchboard. Yes
[01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:15.020]   The butler's the butler told us this he had a big switchboard there and he would from time to time listen in
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:15.740]   Yeah
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:17.900]   And so this is the person who now have zach
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:23.580]   I want to know what access he has to the surveillance that the nsa is gathering
[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:30.940]   Uh because he's already demonstrated an inclination to do that to personally listen listen in on people's very nixonia in very ways
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:31.740]   Yeah
[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:34.860]   Will president outgoing president obama pardon edward stoden
[01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:38.220]   I think he should
[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:40.220]   There's a certainly a move to do that a petition
[01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:41.820]   Oh, yeah
[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:42.620]   Um
[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:45.020]   I doubt it, but it would be a cool move
[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:47.820]   Certainly I would I would love to see it happen
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:49.340]   um
[01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:50.540]   lean pardon
[01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:52.540]   secretary clinton
[01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:57.180]   Can you pardon somebody who's actually who's not been charged and died charged?
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:33:03.980]   Very tight it just a pre pardon an advanced pardon. Well nixon was never charged. No, that's true
[01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:09.820]   Was he pardoned? Yeah, it's right. Gerald Ford pardon and Gerald Ford pardon. Yeah, so yeah, absolutely you can you can
[01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:12.060]   Well and wait for the next part in coming up
[01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:14.300]   pristine
[01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:19.500]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, january 2 yeah or january 22 kind of president pardon himself
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:24.700]   Actually president can't be ch. I've heard him say it. He said pardon me pardon me. Yeah
[01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:31.660]   Uh, we're going to take a break and give you a chance to have final thoughts. Uh, if you wish jeff
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:34.300]   rank, okay google
[01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:38.460]   Can a president pardon himself?
[01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:45.260]   google's very good with because of the knowledge graph with some things. Yes, that's a kind of uh question that may not
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:49.180]   It's more promiscuous with sourcing and a president pardoned himself
[01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:52.540]   pardon me
[01:33:52.540 --> 01:34:00.540]   It's like
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:10.940]   Oh, then stop reading. However, no president has ever attempted to pardon himself. So I guess you could
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:14.620]   I
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:18.140]   Oh, I don't know anyway. It's complicated. It's complicated
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:19.900]   um
[01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:23.180]   And I say that in jest not it's complicated, but can a president pardon
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:26.300]   Not i'm not
[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:33.740]   Incinuating that there's anything to be pardoned for yeah, uh our show today brought to you by those great people at a base camp
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:38.700]   Uh who have made a fabulous tool you probably are well aware of millions have
[01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:42.300]   Used it. I think a hundred thousand companies. I should say not millions
[01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:50.620]   Millions is the new hundred thousand. Yes, 100,000 companies use base camp and the all new base camp three is so
[01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:56.220]   Sweet, you're gonna love it. It'll make your life much easier more organized. It's a private secure
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:58.940]   online space
[01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:01.180]   To help teams stay organized
[01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:03.740]   Discuss everything they need to get a project done
[01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:09.580]   No more searching through hundreds of emails or relying on chat to get the latest updates with base camp
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:12.780]   Everyone's always in the loop
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:17.100]   No matter where I've mentioned this before, you know, uh companies easy to manage when there's three or four people
[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:20.140]   But as you get the bigger and I think around 15 to 20 employees
[01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:23.260]   It's just hard to know who's working on what what the status is of that
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:26.860]   We have a lot of meetings and things but until we found base camp
[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:29.260]   It was really a hard thing to do to keep up on
[01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:38.300]   All of this to organize all of this base camp is sweet and because unlike certain other tools from a company with two o's in its name
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:43.340]   They don't charge by the seat, but they charge a flat fee. I'm always with with g-suite
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:46.780]   I'm always have to make this decision. Well, should I add this person to our g-suite?
[01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:51.420]   It's gonna cost me their five dollars a month not with base camp base camp
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:55.020]   It's a flat rate and you can include not only everybody on your team
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:57.660]   But uh clients and so forth and give them limited access
[01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:00.220]   Art we use it on our live production team
[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:04.540]   Uh, a live events production team to manage all the events were up to things like ces
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:06.460]   We're already in planning for that
[01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:11.820]   Colleen who says it was our our manager there says is very intuitive provides a great visual overview of
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:18.540]   Current projects. It's easy to assign tasks to team members to track productivity through reports and daily updates
[01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:21.420]   Cara likes the email reminders
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:23.980]   She helps her get her job done stay on track
[01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:29.500]   And I like the fact that you can say what your work hours are and get no reminders when you're off duty
[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:33.740]   Because you know what base camp's all about a more civilized work life
[01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:38.860]   In fact, Jason free do you see talking there? He's the founder of base camp wrote the book rework
[01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:43.260]   They spent a lot of time thinking about work. David honda mire hanson. We've had both of them on the
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:48.780]   Triangulation, uh, the guy who vented ruby on rails and and was right right space camp
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:51.500]   They are all about having a great
[01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:57.500]   Work life being more effective more efficient and they've got a great tool to do it base camp
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:01.020]   Dot com slash twit and you could try it free right now base camp
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:03.500]   dot com
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:06.620]   Slash twit make sure you go there so that they know you heard it
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:12.460]   On this week in google. It's not slash twig though. It's slash twit base camp
[01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:15.260]   slash
[01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:16.220]   twit
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:19.180]   Anything you want to mention that you've been using lately
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:23.420]   I have a prepared statement about the use of inbox versus gmail, which is
[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:27.420]   I use both of them. What are you supposed to?
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:30.860]   I know every I think people are they think well, I should move to the new one
[01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:33.820]   But I kind of like the old one, but should I use the new one? I'm gonna pick one
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:38.300]   I don't think we have to pick I personally like to use gmail
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:44.540]   Uh the old fashion gmail, which is new version by the way. It's faster. I use it for searching because I've started exactly
[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:48.940]   Everything for today. I just wish there's one feature. I wish I had which is to mark as unread
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:51.900]   Which you don't have an inbox that you do have a bunch right?
[01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:55.100]   I love that you've come around to inbox Jeff because I know you oh yeah, I'm using it
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:59.260]   I know I I resisted for a long time, but but I I generally like it
[01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:03.980]   I like the reminders that you could put in there and I like the canned it responses
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:09.340]   I think and I like the filters like the auto filter whole settings thing is just so many options
[01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:14.460]   It's pretty old school for inbox or gmail for gmail. I do email, but then it's affected in inbox
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:18.060]   Oh, I see see if I see something in inbox. I I want to add to a filter
[01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:23.900]   I go to gmail to do the filter and then I come back to to inbox so so it's like gmail settings are like so
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:31.500]   Yeah, oh, so if you set up a filter on gmail it propagates. Yes, it functions in in inbox
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.620]   Yes, and this is this is what like I
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:38.700]   Anybody in tech journalism gets a gazillion
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:44.620]   Press releases or invitations or whatever every single day and I just can't I can't even so I have
[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:47.340]   I have hundreds literally hundreds of
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:53.820]   of filters in gmail that says okay take that take that and put it in that folder and then once a day I
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:59.260]   Address that folder. Well, I do that, you know five six times a day. I set up a new filter with a new
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:02.700]   There must be thousands of PR companies out there
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:06.460]   And I need that you know and I get I love inbox
[01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:11.900]   But I need that and there are a few other things in gmail that I need I need the all mail folder sometimes
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:16.220]   To look through things and so I appreciate the fact that they're simplifying. I love
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:18.940]   the insanely high tech
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:20.300]   uh
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:25.580]   Nuts and bolts behind the so auto reply even though the auto applies so cool though
[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:30.220]   It's so cool. I love auto reply. I love the I love the reminders. I love all that stuff
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:35.900]   Um, but I still need gmail and I think we should all unapologetically use both both. Yeah
[01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:39.820]   Actually, I do you one better because I then I do
[01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:47.580]   And then I forward all my gmail to another email provider and I use a third client to access that. Hmm. So I
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:51.500]   I don't know. I guess I want all my mail and i've run by the way
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:57.420]   And I I was I just on gmail so I'm using gmail probably as you have for since it started
[01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:59.180]   Is that 10 years something like that?
[01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:04.140]   Yeah, so I was curious because they mentioned that Anthony winner had 650,000 emails on his laptop. Hmm
[01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:07.260]   That seemed like a big number to me. Yeah, seemed like a large note
[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:11.340]   I don't think it was all on his laptop. I'm betting that was I heard one reference that was metadata
[01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:16.540]   It was probably how much was in an account because I'm I'm looking at all the mail I've ever received over
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:22.780]   More than 10 year more than a decade. Yeah, I have I'm asked i'm curious if you could look at your all mail and tell us what it is
[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:25.820]   But I have 263,000 589 emails
[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:31.500]   So if you go to your all mail folder, it's under more. Yeah, I got this is this is all you're looking at all mail and this is
[01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:35.180]   On-in-box you account. No, it's 293,000
[01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:37.420]   293,000 no on gmail itself
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:42.540]   So I'm saying how do you have 600 and by the way you and I are no slouches right?
[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:46.540]   I receive in junk mail right right I never delete mail. Yeah
[01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:48.700]   So where do you go Leo?
[01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:53.260]   Uh just open your gmail account and uh got it under more on the left
[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:56.220]   You see one of the folders is all mail unless you've moved it up
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:41:00.540]   All mail has all the mail including some of it and everything else
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:04.540]   263,000 is what I see up in the upper left hand corner
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:07.500]   24,000 yeah, so we're all in the 200,000 range
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:11.100]   Yeah, and we hold on hold on hold on hold on
[01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:19.180]   How often do you use those google things and tells you how much you have and then when you get to you have 100 and you get 200 and suddenly you have 200
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:25.740]   What are you talking about what you sometimes is an approximation. It's an approximation number. I don't think this is approximate
[01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:27.740]   This says 263,000
[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:32.460]   I don't know. I don't know but sometimes they they're like that this and I have a lot of storage
[01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:36.620]   I have four to 20 gigabytes you probably have as much too because you we all have pixels right exactly
[01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:38.780]   We got a terrible
[01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:43.340]   Um and I've only used 75 gigabytes over 10 11 years. Yeah
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:49.740]   Oh, I've also occasionally gone in and purged so I think this number is a little ear numbers low
[01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:56.140]   Yeah, but but I would it's not that you know, I probably have a total of 300,000 625,000 seems like a lot
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:42:00.140]   I don't know. I'm just saying
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:05.260]   Okay, when you're when you're tweeting teenagers you get more mail. I think right
[01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:09.980]   Jeff you got a number not 6. Oh, yes
[01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:16.540]   Ah, so I found this interesting I found that uh get a sense of the kind of
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:23.180]   Associations these companies have wpp the giant advertising agency run by sir martin as oral
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:27.980]   Will spend five billion dollars with google what?
[01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:30.860]   For advertising
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:35.820]   Five one company one agency of course bringing middle companies in it's a gigantic agency
[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:39.420]   But five billion dollars last year. They spent four billion dollars
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:44.620]   Facebook last year was one billion dollars and he and he uses this as an opportunity to get some leverage
[01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:48.060]   He says the relationship with google is very good the relationship with facebook not so much
[01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:51.260]   He spent a bill
[01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:53.260]   These are like ads
[01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:56.380]   Yeah, they're just ads spending how big is that agency?
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:59.500]   Oh, it's gigantic. What's the lot?
[01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:04.140]   That's amazing and I get excited when we get a $50 buy
[01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:07.740]   I'm in the wrong business
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:12.060]   Uh, I was going to mention because I'm using the pixel
[01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:15.660]   And I wasn't really crazy about and this might be of interest to you, Jeff
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:20.460]   I wasn't crazy about the pixel launcher. It's okay, but it's google doesn't hear it already has it
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:22.300]   Well for one thing
[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:24.380]   This is just a weird quirk of mine
[01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:28.860]   I'm always accidentally dragging icons and widgets to other places on the screen
[01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:34.620]   So I like to lock the screen so you can't move the widgets and pixel launcher doesn't offer that most other launchers
[01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:37.020]   There's a lock button so that you can't drag
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:40.540]   Icons around you kind of have a setup that it stays that way
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:43.580]   But the reason I stayed with pixel launcher is the long press
[01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:48.700]   And admittedly it's only a few apps most all google apps that allow you to long press and get a menu
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:52.860]   So you can long press on the camera and choose video or selfie and like that
[01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:55.100]   Well, I found another launcher
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:59.020]   That is a great launcher. Thank you florin's ion for recommending it called action launcher
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:01.100]   That does in fact
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:03.820]   Let you do that thing that long press thing
[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:09.740]   I imagine all of them will eventually but if you have a pixel and or you're using nougat 7-1 somehow
[01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:12.300]   Maybe you borrowed a rom from somebody
[01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:13.900]   um
[01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:15.900]   You you might want to try
[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:19.500]   Action launcher and it has some really nice folder features
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:23.500]   But it has it's not a long press it allows you to swipe down for instance on the camera icon
[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:27.340]   And choose the menu from the camera icon just by swiping down
[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:34.780]   Uh if you swipe down on hangouts you get or the actually the phone's a good one because you get most recent contacts and so forth
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:38.460]   So if you are using a pixel and by the way, I have to say
[01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:41.660]   Jeff not withstanding. I like my pixel a lot
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:44.140]   Oh, okay
[01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:48.380]   For weeks now, I'm trying to get you just give me an order and I'll follow it
[01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:54.060]   Jeff keep it Jeff get rid of it right Jeff. You're a fool if you don't blank, right
[01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:59.660]   It's not biting. I can't I want for me Leo. I can't I can't I can't
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:02.380]   I don't I don't want to be responsible
[01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:07.900]   For your freedom. I'm gonna be whining at you for every everything that goes wrong. Yeah, is that it?
[01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:10.380]   I it's a better phone than the six p
[01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:15.100]   Uh, I I like nougat and I like 7-1
[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:21.900]   I guess you got nougat in the 7 and this 6p name. Yeah, um the camera is really what blows me away now if that's not important to you
[01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:25.820]   These 6p camera is a pain because it's it's slow
[01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:32.700]   This is fast. You can double click the uh start button on off button and launch the camera right away
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:37.740]   Oh, yeah, that's some other phone. That's by the way. Once again, that's a software feature
[01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:42.540]   That could be on any Android phone most Android phones do have that but but it's nice to have that and it's fast
[01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:49.500]   So even if it's locked, I can get right to the camera. Um, the camera is superb. I'll show you you want to see a picture
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:56.140]   Something I just learned like I actually am using the little five inch one
[01:45:56.140 --> 01:46:00.780]   Uh, I took we had a weird night a couple of nights ago
[01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:03.740]   portending strange things
[01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:09.740]   In the universe. It was a very red sunset. So this is not you might think oh, there's a color cast from that camera
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:13.900]   But no, this is actually perfect color. This is exactly that's why I took this picture
[01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:17.980]   But look at this picture. I'll tell you red is very hard to do on a digital camera
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:23.740]   I'm getting some nice adept of field on this. Uh, I think this is an example of a camera
[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:25.980]   That's got great color rendition great detail
[01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:31.740]   Excellent depth of field. I'll zoom in a little bit so you can see that the the detail is is very good
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:33.740]   Let's zoom in a little bit even a little bit more
[01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:35.020]   um
[01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:39.260]   I think I it's a it's as good as the iPhone which is you know, the
[01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:41.260]   state of the art
[01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:43.260]   um digital camera that's probably
[01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:46.700]   One to one or close to that's one to one right there
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:50.780]   So I would say keep the pixel jeff
[01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:53.660]   All right, I'm gonna take responsibility
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:58.780]   For your pixel. Why do you just I mean just since you're you're the tech guy and you can help me with anything
[01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:03.500]   Why do you think it's not in that when I try to transfer the data? It never gives me an estimated time
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:08.140]   Well, how much data do you have? I don't I don't how much I very little and I said don't move my videos
[01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:10.620]   Don't move my photos is there all stored elsewhere. Oh, okay
[01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:15.180]   And it but it takes like two three hours in saying no, yeah, it's hanging up
[01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:19.740]   Yeah, I would restart both phones and try again. I mean turn them off and turn them on again
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:22.700]   Try again. So what you say on the texture all the time is exactly what I say
[01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:25.900]   Try again
[01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:31.500]   Take two aspirin and get off the phone. It's very fast. I like the 821 that's nap dragon 821 this in there
[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:32.700]   Um
[01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:36.140]   Feels good. It's you know, it's not the most pretty how does the size feel do you well?
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:38.860]   I have a five-inch you know that you had the answer. I know you had to go small one
[01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:42.060]   Um, I like the excel the excels got better battery life
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:46.860]   Uh, but this was batteries is quite quite good. 1080p on a five-inch phone is very nice screen
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:47.660]   Yep
[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:53.500]   I like this was it looked rather dull and blue to me if you put these six p next to the excel
[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:58.460]   Well, let me put it on a white screen the excel did not look as good
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:02.060]   Let me the six p was much brighter. Let me put this next to the iPhone
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:05.740]   Do you have it over the camera somewhere over the shoulder?
[01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:08.460]   Okay, so there's the iPhone
[01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:12.060]   And there's this I think that's a better that's better looking picture
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:15.820]   Uh, frankly on the pixel than on the iPhone
[01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:19.820]   Um, I think it's really really quite beautiful
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:23.740]   It looks actually a little blue on the iphone looks a little blue next to it
[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:28.620]   Oh, it's funny the the pixel look a very blue next to my six p
[01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:30.780]   uh
[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:35.580]   Well, you know, I don't that I it could be that you have a screen that's that way
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:37.740]   Here, let me put that picture up on it
[01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:44.300]   This is Lisa showing there we go. There we go. That's the that's that picture originally
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:46.540]   It probably won't rotate because I turn off rotation
[01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:53.820]   I think that's a pretty good. I actually have the same picture here. We go ahead to head comparison
[01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:57.900]   Thanks to google photos. I should have the oh, it hasn't copied it over yet
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:49:00.700]   Same picture on the iphone, but I don't
[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:03.660]   Um
[01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:05.900]   I like that screen. I think that's a pretty good screen
[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:09.980]   I like and I like the 5 inch. I'm kind of liking a little phone

[01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:46.460]   Uh, I I don't think I can remember and I don't think this has ever happened
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:51.900]   Maybe with dewy Truman. I don't know where you really thought oh this one's in the bag. Yeah
[01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:58.860]   And the slow but inexorable realization that it's not going right well at all
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:50:59.980]   Oh
