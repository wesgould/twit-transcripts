[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.400]   And finally there's a lot of Google stuff to talk about
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.840]   Jeff Jarvis is lost somewhere in the snow drifts of Denver, Colorado, but Mike Elgin's here filling in from him
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.840]   It's great to have Mike always
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.840]   long time friend of twit and I don't I probably don't even need to introduce him
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.600]   But remember Elgin calm
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.680]   Gastronomad.net where they do these great trips around the world and Mike is a
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.320]   Gastronomad himself the pair of pathetic Mike Elgin you're at home though right now
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.320]   I'm in Mexico City right now. Oh this is Mexico City. Yes. We arrived last night. So nice here in Taco Taco Town
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.560]   Now I don't think they appreciate being
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.320]   Yeah, I was gonna say I'm pretty sure they don't go for Taco Town. Well, they have tacos
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.240]   They do they I personally think tacos is the greatest food in the world
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.920]   I love I think Mexico City as the greatest tacos in the world
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.560]   So it's my highest complement for a city to call it taco. No, no burritos because that's a thick American. Yeah
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.880]   There's a lot of awesome tacos. Yeah
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.680]   What what are they what's different about them is at the breakfast?
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.840]   We have all kinds of tacos. We have tacos for Mexico City. We have tacos from interior of Mexico
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.360]   We stick everything in a taco. What I'm thinking plantains or southern Mexico that kind of thing
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.200]   What's that what's a typical Mexico City taco? By the way, that's Stacy Higginbotham of Stacy on IOT and
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.440]   Stacy on IOT podcast with Kevin Tofol. Sorry. I want to introduce you before we get it. Meet in onions and cilantro. Yes. Oh, yum
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.040]   That's all you need
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:15.440]   Well to to answer your question the the great thing about Mexico City is that all of the different regions are represented here and
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.120]   In addition to modern regions of Mexico. You also have a lot of ancient
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.120]   Aztec and Olmec foods that are just completely amazing most of the
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.640]   The every country has a food region or two
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.560]   They like to brag about and here it and here in Mexico. It's southern
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.800]   Mexico it's where all the great stuff is is coming from but I agree but they there's just so much
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.840]   Incredible variety and layered on top of all of that regional variety. Well, it has to be said that
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.560]   Texas and California Mexican food are considered
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.240]   legitimate
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:58.200]   Variants of Mexican food here in Mexico City as well. So layered on top of all of that you have this revival in the food business with
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.240]   You know hipsters creating like experimenting with a lot of different things one of our favorite taco places
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:10.720]   They put goat cheese and avocado and things like that. It's just it's just really fantastic and it's just a great foodie city all around
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.280]   Wait, are you eating any moly because in Mexico City? I would be doing like the moly sampler all day long
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.160]   Stacy I'm bathing in it and
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.560]   That's an Aztec invention chocolates and Aztec invention
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.560]   It's it's it's actually a little more recent than that that the Aztecs used a lot of chocolate
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.200]   But the but they didn't use it in a sweet variety or in a sauce like that
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.880]   But it was kind of like up it came in the last few centuries
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.480]   But there's so much innovation in in moly. It's just mind-blowing and yes, we eat tons of it
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:53.800]   My understanding is moly is not just a particular sauce, but it's a mix of ingredients. It's kind of like gravy
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.080]   How we wait?
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.320]   Is that yeah, we we go and we do on the guest room and Mexico City experience. We did this
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.880]   Essentially, it's a chili class where we're learning about chili
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:13.360]   But we also do this go into moly in multiple ways and one of the molys that we try it actually has a hundred and thirty
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.120]   Something ingredients one of what one of which is cookies. There's this style of cookies that they actually grind up but put in the mole
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.120]   So that's like that cookies multiple ingredients itself, but but that's made by this woman
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.800]   Who's like she's she's an older woman who lives in a village where they grow this very rare kind of chili and she
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.320]   Once in a while comes to Mexico City and teaches chefs
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.360]   Three-day class on how to make her moly the entire three days is just about her mole
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.560]   And we get to eat it and it's just it's really really really incredible
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.760]   We also go to Puyol, which is probably Latin America's best restaurant and they have their
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.960]   What do they call it there? They have a five-year-old mole
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.880]   Which I know about this
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:07.080]   Yeah, well, they serve they serve you a plate and they put the five-year mole in a circle on the plate
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.520]   And then they put a new mole in in on top of it. I could be there
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.960]   Come on Stacy seriously. We had somebody who postponed the Mexico City experience
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.160]   And they're gonna come later. We have a room for you. Come on. Come on down. When is the Mexico City event?
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:32.360]   I know
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:39.160]   Wow, yeah, five years or twenty way. Wow. Yeah, oh I could come down for the 26
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.320]   Come on. Then I have to then I have to fly out Tuesday morning to Helsinki
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:51.280]   Bucker sounds like a trip. Sounds like it. You should do it. That's a daughter and bring everybody's Spain
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.920]   So Spain yeah, she's in Spain. Oh
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:01.960]   Everyone's cool places except me. No, you're in Austin. That's a cool place. I'm always in Austin
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.160]   So let's change the subject for something Stacy's intensely interested in oh
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.120]   Something she couldn't care less about
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.440]   queso gaming
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.040]   Stadium why am I on this show all I do is talk about food
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.880]   You know, I don't mind is turning into a food show. I totally am behind that
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.920]   queso and chips with Stacy. Yeah, sorry
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.120]   That's the title of this episode as a matter of
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.200]   So you better get some queso talk in there pretty darn quick
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.480]   Stadia which we taught we covered the event
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:47.600]   Yesterday at the Google Google spoke at the gamers developers conference GDC game developers conference and announced their streaming
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:56.480]   Gaming service. Well announced is a big word for what they did because they didn't they left out a few critical elements like
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:02.000]   Time it will be released sometime this year cost we don't know
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.640]   Nor do we know what games will be on it except it looks like there might be a version of doom
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:16.960]   Um, however, it's an int there were a lot of interesting technical features and I think yeah for GDC. That's probably
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.560]   Uh, you know why they were talking about it there. They want to get developers on board
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.840]   We talked a little bit about Microsoft has a similar streaming
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.880]   uh plan for next year and
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.080]   Uh, we were talking about it on windows weekly today and really Microsoft is in a much better position from
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:39.760]   A gamers point of view already they have a reputation because of the xbox is a gaming company
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.320]   But also they have a ton of titles
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.000]   Google doesn't own any gaming titles. They're going to start a google studio
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.160]   And so it's unclear what games you'll be able to play on the other hand the idea that you could play a high quality
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.360]   You know triple-a title perhaps on your chrome book on your andrewade phone
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.080]   And best of all on a chrome cast ultra hooked up to your tv using a
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.880]   controller made by google
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.680]   Uh, that's an intriguing possibility
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:14.000]   Yeah, and it has to be said, uh, so first a little ice water on evanybody who's excited about this
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.880]   Uh, they announced something very similar to this
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.680]   Three or four years ago and it was going to be based around google plus
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.760]   And they were going and and google then the google play store
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:32.400]   Now it's primarily a function of youtube and vlad, uh, savaf has a really good piece in the verge today
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.800]   Talking about how this is really about saving youtube more than, uh, uh, beating microsoft
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.400]   They need to save the most successful video platform
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.680]   because this whole this whole world of
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:51.760]   Um gamers remember that pewdiepie started as just a guy who put a camera on himself
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:58.080]   Playing video games. That's right. And so there's a lot of video gaming stuff that is put as posted on youtube
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.840]   after the fact, but twitch, uh, is
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.120]   It's kind of a scary thing. It's live. Um, there's some live gaming going on youtube
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.280]   But that's kind of the future and I think
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:18.080]   Google sees the ability to stream directly and integrate youtube as a way to make it super compelling for the really
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.000]   um high-end gamers who want to stream and and do that sort of thing they also
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.960]   Love when there are products and services that require massive data center power
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.920]   Because they they excel in that area. They want people spending more time on the internet not on
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.680]   consoles or lo- you know using local files and stuff like that their whole
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.200]   uh, sort of
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:43.600]   Business models to get people streaming from the cloud and so this is very a very, uh, googly thing in lots of ways
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.600]   Um, but I have to also say a couple of points one one about
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:55.520]   Um, as a as a nomad as a digital nomad. This is like the greatest news ever because you know my my kids are playing
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:01.200]   Xbox constantly and I can't you know when i'm traveling i'm not gonna travel the next box even though my
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.680]   My younger son has done that. Um
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:10.160]   So i'm just like I can't play these games they're playing these multi massive multiplayer online games and i'm just like oh
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.680]   That's nice. I don't have any ability to do that with this. I
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:20.560]   Should be able to do that in most cases if I can find the the internet speeds and it's not just nomads who
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.160]   Don't want to buy a console don't have the the
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.280]   Spaced for a console, etc. It's great. It's going to be great
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:35.360]   Probably to play these kind of triple a games on a phone a tablet
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:42.320]   Uh chromebook or whatever it's also a great thing for chromebooks in general because they've optimized this thing for pixel remember they the uh, they
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.320]   sort of beta tested the
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.160]   Assassin's Creed game for a while with with select
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:55.520]   Uh pixel users. I actually signed up for it immediately but couldn't play it because I was in Italy or something. It was only for us users
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:02.400]   I think um, so that's that's really cool regarding the microsoft being way ahead. I don't really necessarily think that they are way ahead
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.520]   um
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.880]   Microsoft is way ahead in terms of gaming titles, but
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.720]   I think microsoft has a long way to go before they could stream them
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.840]   Uh, and and and essentially deliver them
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.440]   Two people who don't have the console who don't have an x xbox
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.080]   Maybe they could do it, but they may not be in cenetitude since they make consoles and pc's
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.720]   Uh, that may not be their business model, but they certainly have as your cloud
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:33.600]   And you know, I mean you've got you've got three big players here with big cloud services microsoft google and amazon
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.240]   All three have a foot in this space
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.080]   Amazon owns twitch so they very much have a foot in this space
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.160]   Um, yeah, right. I don't think that this is this is just google saying here's what we'd like to do. There's no
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.280]   Yeah, no having said that. I mean, I think they I think they could do something
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.480]   It's not it's not going to be as good as that what they showed for a long time. Yeah, I mean that was a demo
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.920]   Well, it also ignores a critical factor that's out of google's control, which is the last mile
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.240]   And yeah, you know
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.280]   Some people have a great experience people with great bandwidth and low latency will have a great experience
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.200]   And then the vast majority of americans will have a terrible experience
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.840]   And now stacey there is something that you are into that this is
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:24.000]   Relates to is I imagine some of this is the hope that 5g will solve that last mile problem for more people
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.560]   But that's a long way off right? Well, yeah, and it's not going to be okay
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.360]   Depending on how 5g works it
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.040]   You're going to have it convert to Wi-Fi in your house
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.080]   I'm trying to think logistically because the massive spectrum that we're going to use for
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.760]   fixed
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.760]   wireless 5g service
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:55.680]   The in to get the capacity they need you're going to need a lot of megahertz. You're going to be using some of those
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.880]   uh
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.600]   Upper gigahertz spectrum that doesn't penetrate walls. So you're going to have something outside your house
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   That's going to funnel that into your Wi-Fi network. So logistically, that's what that's going to look like
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.680]   um
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:13.920]   Also, I'm sure google wants to see people doing this on an android device out and about two if you had the bandwidth
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.160]   Yeah, but
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.880]   Honestly, there's about 18 players in this including some non
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:28.400]   You know big companies and frankly this is this was tried years ago a company called on live
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:34.400]   Uh did this and the problem on live had was that they didn't have enough servers
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.840]   Because there was a lot of use during peak hours and very little use during off hours
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:45.440]   And they couldn't they didn't want to keep all those surfers online. This is a problem google will not have
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.440]   Um, maybe google's doing this to get a killer app for its gigabit
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.320]   internet and I know it doesn't want to do fiber anymore or the fiber kind of falter
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.240]   That's the big question like if you knew you were going to do this wouldn't you have pushed fiber harder?
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:04.240]   Well, I mean the the investors didn't want them to push that harder
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.840]   Um, and they also ran into technical troubles in the way they were doing it. They did it in a very googly way
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.680]   Which was they were like
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:18.080]   We will build the fiber loops around cities that is our plan and we will invent a new technique and then that didn't work out so well
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.600]   So they're like we will try something else and that didn't work out well and then they were like never mind
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:30.000]   And by the way, also we're not getting the subscribers. That's the other thing right when I talked to real users like my wife
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:37.840]   She this the but always comes up now when google announces something new is well how long before they kill that
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.720]   Google has really created a reputation
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.840]   And not just with geeks but with real world people of I mean inbox just went under right
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.040]   uh of of just killing things kind of
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.080]   Randomly and that doesn't help
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.120]   So that's why I think microsoft has a huge head start they're already in the gaming space
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:03.360]   They they you know, they're in it to stay they could have killed xbox a long time ago when they struggled against playstation
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.600]   But they didn't they have a lot of titles they have a studio google's announced a studio
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:13.200]   But they don't they haven't announced any titles or or even you know all they have is jade raman who is a legend
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.800]   In the business. She's running the studio, but they've got a convinced developers to develop games for this
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.280]   non-existent service
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.200]   Some you know if you think end users have to take a leap of faith
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.200]   Developers have the same problem. You mean i'm going to develop a game for the service who knows if it'll launch
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:38.000]   And if it does who knows how long it's around if i'm a developer I say i want to stick with sony and microsoft's
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.160]   Thank you very much. I really think they will be and should be a different set of games because
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.880]   The the sort of the best
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.200]   The greatest hits xbox games
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.000]   Are always going to be better on playstation xbox etc on consoles that
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.280]   NPC by the way steam steam on pc's it's going to totally dominate that but totally
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.840]   So this is this is not going to appeal to anybody who already has an xbox or playstation or a gaming pc
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.000]   That's just not it's going to appeal. That's right primarily to people who don't have any gaming
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:16.480]   Hardware right now. It's going to improve casual gaming. Yeah for casual gamers and so that's not how my it's not how google was pitching it though
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.920]   Yesterday it felt like that's right. They were going after the triple a titles
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:26.000]   Yeah, but I and i'm sure that they will exist but if you really are into gaming
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.840]   You're not going to want to do that streaming and there is going to be latency there will be latency
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.080]   And and it's going to vary based on a whole bunch of things. This by the way is another
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:42.480]   um kind of punch in the nose to rural users who have who are always get shafted in terms of
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.640]   Rural
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.960]   Exactly. So it's it's it's really problematic on that score. However
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:56.080]   I can see up and coming game companies or innovative game companies or even the big game companies developing
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.120]   games
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:04.960]   Optimizing them for streaming not not just a you know converting old titles streaming but but optimizing games
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:10.880]   And so hopefully I'd like to see it become a new like I mean look at the difference between console gaming and self
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.000]   You know smartphone games they're night and day. I mean to
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   For the most part the most popular games on smartphones
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.960]   Are not the console style games. They're more like word games and you know
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:28.480]   You know silly cartoony type, you know true, you know get your mind off of you know
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:33.200]   You stand in line with the dmv type of type of distraction games. I was playing that game the other day
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.600]   Yes
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.160]   And but but I'd love to see streaming games sort of occupy the space between that you know
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.680]   I have to play out though
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.280]   There is one triple a title that people play on consoles they play on pcs
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:51.920]   And they play just as avidly on mobile devices and that's fortnite and I think that truthfully google's
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:19:01.040]   Prayer is that they can get the next fortnite one of the things they talked about was a battle royale fortnite style game with a thousand players
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:06.480]   They talked about cooperative gaming that they can do uniquely well because the servers are co located
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:13.440]   Run, you know high-end gaming hardware next to each other and so you at home can play a cooperative game
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.520]   And everybody can have a different device for instance and the latency between
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.240]   Game instances is zero
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:26.480]   Uh, so I think that's what I honestly think that's what google's just crossing their fingers for who knows maybe they have something in development
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.640]   The problem is you can create something doesn't mean it's going to be as successful as a fortnite
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.880]   But if they that that could be the make it a break it for stadia
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:42.000]   Is is just some game that you could only play on stadia that everybody in the world wants to play
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.200]   And you know, they do have a game kind of like that with pokimongo
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:52.000]   Uh harry potter wizards unites going to be like that. They need a title like they need a title that just takes the world by storm
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.840]   And then they need to get lucky. They need to get lucky. That's actually that's probably the best way to say it. They need to get lucky
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.120]   Yeah, here's what we asked a 14 year old gamer
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.880]   Carsten bondi sun zak
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.760]   Carson asked him what he thought and he said one
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:14.720]   He talks about the beginning where uh ceo sundor pachai took the stage and said i'm not a gamer. He said it's incredibly dumb
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:19.360]   To start off your gaming presentation with your ceo saying the words i'm not a gamer
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.640]   Kind of agree and i have to say that's an excellent point
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.240]   It doesn't set the stage gamers are looking at throwing well screw you
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.400]   Number two
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.520]   Why do they announce a gaming system without any games?
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:40.640]   Even the one game they said they were going to have a doom update. They never showed any gameplay from
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:48.160]   Uh during the keynote they confirmed doom, which is already playable on literally any this is zax
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:54.240]   Thought literally playable on anything that even vaguely resembles a computer including by the way
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.880]   There's doom versions for the apple watch and the ipod
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:02.000]   Uh, they have no exclusive games. The only first party title google has ever launched
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.760]   Do you know what it is?
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.600]   It's the one sundor pachai said is the most played game of all time the dinosaur game
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.520]   Which you get when you get a 404 on a website
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.880]   That is awesome
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.440]   And by the way, you can't play it on stadia
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.080]   Because your internet would be down
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.240]   If and zak is smart carsten
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.800]   Let me know when he's old enough for us to hire him
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.880]   Number three if your system is dependent on an internet connection
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.600]   It looks really bad
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:43.120]   When your announcement live stream glitches out twice in an hour and you don't even bother to fix it in your youtube video
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:50.720]   So this is what he's talking about and we we noted this when we were watching the event. This was everybody saw that
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.040]   And by the way, first of all the cameraman's butt is in the shot
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:01.840]   It's frozen and glitched and this was for everybody watching it. They didn't even bother to edit that out of the announcement
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:08.000]   On youtube 1.3 million people said well if that's how good it is I ain't playing it
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.960]   That happened several times
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.040]   So if you can't stream a video you can't I can stream a game
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:24.240]   Uh, so sec concludes maybe the dinosaur game will be playable on stadia after all final judgment worst game system announcement ever
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.480]   But I knew that in fact I even said carsten i don't know if you remember this during the event
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.560]   I said I could tell you right now. I can hear the hate from the gaming community
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.920]   Who are notoriously fickle anyway and are quick to jump on anything they feel is not
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.080]   You know, whatever
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.280]   gamish
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.880]   Uh, but that's not who this is for this is not for current gamers. I don't think I don't I don't think that's the goal
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.280]   But the question is it for anybody
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.920]   And we know it's not for stacey higgett bossom
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.440]   Nope
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.440]   I'm so i'm just i don't i don't game
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.640]   I mean, I'm excited from the technical perspective like you've never like on your phone played
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.360]   Like scrabble or anything
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:09.600]   Um, I think I play I used to play words with friends way back in the day. That's okay. Well. Yeah, and I play board games
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.400]   I just I don't like games at my computer
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.560]   I I played missed a long time ago. You're not a gamer
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.560]   Have you played the dinosaur game
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.880]   I've seen people playing the dinosaur game. Does that count? Yeah
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.760]   See the future of my inner
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.320]   Is my internet's down? I go read a book
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.680]   So it's so funny because it really is and I I am very guilty of this
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.080]   But there really is a reality distortion field in these keynotes and I always have to kind of
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:45.840]   Pinch myself slap myself on the wrist while i'm watching them because they're oh, you know, if they're well done
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.840]   They're exciting and you watch them you go
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.680]   The this is great. I can't wait to get this and then
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.680]   As you get farther and farther from the event and the real questions
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.840]   Seep in you start to realize maybe that's not so great
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:05.840]   Yeah, this is it's a lot of that potentially great. I mean really is it's all potential
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:11.600]   It's just that um, you know in the same week when they're closing google plus and aloe
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:17.040]   Yeah, it's kind of hard to be like, yes, i'm all in i'm doing this all the way, man
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.680]   This is like the greatest. This is the future. No, maybe it will be the future. Maybe it won't probably won't
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.200]   So, you know google's really you know, they i am surprised that they don't
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.280]   Do a better job of explaining this whole reputation
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.560]   They act like they don't have the reputation that they clearly have of closing things that
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.160]   Their most passionate users care about that's the thing they don't close the
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:45.680]   Nobody cares about the boring stuff, but like they build up all these passionate users around inbox
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:52.240]   Or or google reader people will super into it and then they kill it and then they create another thing and they get all these passionate users
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:57.120]   And then they kill it so it's like nobody trusts google anymore to not kill things
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.000]   And that's really hurting them and they never talk about it
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.920]   The only i've come to think of it the only
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.640]   Counter example to this reality distortion field that steve jobs perfected
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:15.680]   Of uh, you know so exciting in the announcement and then a little bit less overwhelming is sam's song it does the worst announcements
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.280]   Yeah
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:23.360]   But i have to say now you're having used the s10 plus for a week and a half the more i use it the more i love this phone
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.360]   this phone is
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.640]   Awesome
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.920]   If they had done it on purpose it would have been brilliant to lower expectations
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.200]   And have everybody be delighted with the reality
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.080]   Yeah
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:40.960]   Well google has learned the steve jobs way and uh, it was an exciting announcement. I hope they get the
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:45.680]   I hope they succeed. I would love it if I could play games on my pixel book
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.120]   Uh, or on my chromecast. I mean that would be really great. Yeah. Yeah, I would love it
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.560]   I would really love it in fact I occasionally go looking for
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:01.120]   Xbox style games that I can play and I inevitably give up and just be like well, I guess that's not gonna happen
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.920]   Yeah, yeah
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:11.120]   Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. Go ahead. No, just chromecast. Uh, the new one it supports five gigahertz. Wi-Fi. Yes
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.040]   Okay
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.040]   The ultra the tablet
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.040]   The ultra the ultra
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:23.840]   Which is I think 80 or 90 dollars is 4k hdr 60 frames a second and 5g
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:31.440]   Okay, yeah, it does not have an ethernet jack however, so you you will want to use the 5g obviously for 60 frames per second
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.440]   That's not awesome for gaming
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.080]   Um, no
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.520]   It's enough though
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:42.960]   Okay. Yeah, it's sufficient. It's when is a gamer ever been like oh, so you're right though often gamers
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:48.560]   You know are talking about framerate. I think less so now maybe but uh, they often talk about framerate 60s plenty
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.360]   That looks real scooter x says it does have ethernet
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.400]   Is there is there a dongle that comes in the box? Maybe that's why I don't remember ethernet online
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.880]   Maybe there's a usb dongle. I guess that sounds right. So if it has ethernet, that's even better
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.240]   Yeah, um
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.240]   In the power adapter, okay
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.560]   Oh, yeah, I guess I do remember that mine's been sitting behind my tv for so long
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.040]   Than layer of dust on it. I don't I don't really remember unboxing it even
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.320]   All right. Well if it has ethernet, that's that's pretty good
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.880]   um
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.600]   All right, I think we said it all which is ironic. I thought we'd spend a lot more on this uh subject
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:29.520]   But I I think that there's just so much unknown that there's really not much more to say except
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.840]   It's all potential
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.600]   Our show today brought to you by express vpn
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.480]   I am an express vpn fan. I found my vpn folks
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.840]   And uh, if you've been looking you might have found it too express vpn
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.640]   Look
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:54.000]   There are two reasons why people use a vpn virtual private network. That's the thing that encrypts your
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.760]   internet traffic from your computer to the vpn server
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:05.520]   Eventually it has to enter the public internet, but why should it be visible in the open wifi coffee shop or at the hotel?
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.440]   or even to your internet service provider, why should
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.080]   AT&T get your data, right? They we know they don't what they do with it
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.920]   They sell it
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.040]   even your home internet service provider often
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.400]   sells what you do online to third parties
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:29.280]   So people are using vpn's more and more often there is an important distinction though between
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:37.680]   A good vpn and a bad vpn. There are many many bad vpn's out there first of all always before you buy a vpn read the privacy policy
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.840]   When you see express vpn's privacy policy, you'll note they don't log anything that you're doing
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.360]   They don't keep track. They don't know who you are. You are completely anonymous
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.360]   And by the way, they're out. They don't operate in the united states. They're offshore
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.640]   So they don't have to respond to a subpoena from the us government. This is secure
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.120]   This is the best way to protect your online privacy
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:05.360]   Uh, it secures and anonymizes your browsing by encrypting your data hiding your public ip address
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.560]   You can operate in any country. They have servers all over the world. I think it's 160 different
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:16.240]   Servers that's good for two reasons one because you can emerge into the public internet in the country of your choosing
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.880]   But also because there's a server close to you
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:24.960]   So that means your performance is going to be better and i'll tell you most of the time when you're using express vpn
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.360]   You won't have any idea you're on a vpn
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:35.120]   Easy to use they've got apps that run seamlessly in the background on windows mac ios android phone tablet anywhere

[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.520]   I think i'm so much for their sport this week in google
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:23.600]   So uh, the third shoe has dropped things come in threes the third fine
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.160]   from the eu
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.840]   for google
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:33.920]   This the smallest fine only a mere 1.49 billion euros about at 1.7 billion dollars
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.120]   and uh, while
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.680]   Google stopped doing this
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:44.880]   Almost immediately so they don't have to make any agreements about not doing it anymore. It was
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.600]   A fine for limiting how some websites could display ads
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.200]   Sold by others
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.680]   Others then google's ad services if that makes any sense
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:03.920]   Um, I don't know if if it's over now. Uh, I don't know if google's going to dispute this
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.960]   I think they're just going to pay it because a it's not all that much money
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.240]   And b they've stopped doing it
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:16.320]   Yeah, they're just um, I mean I I caught your conversation on
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:21.040]   Windows weekly about this and I think that's exactly right they just they have so much money
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:26.080]   They know these things are going to happen especially in europe so they just pay the fine make the changes that they have to make
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.560]   In business. Yeah, yeah
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:35.680]   and so this is um, this is for you know companies that we're using their search for internal search and um, you know
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.640]   essentially google was hogging the best
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:44.720]   uh spots for advertising and trying to exert control over
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:51.760]   So what sorts of advertising could happen by the the website and so it was a little bit abusive
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.280]   Um, I personally think it's kind of a borderline
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:00.960]   Abuse. I don't think it doesn't bother me that much. I mean it's they're not charging for the service
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:05.600]   Uh, and it's voluntary so on the part of the companies
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.000]   Um, but they are so dominant in europe they're much just I always remind people of this
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.560]   They're far more dominant in europe than they are in the united states
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:17.280]   And so google is a sore subject in europe because they are so popular basically
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.520]   so
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:24.480]   Uh, this is also by the way is the smallest of the big three fines. Um, it's not that
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.680]   Uh, it's not a lot of money for for google's just the cost of doing business in europe
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.840]   It's not the end. However if possible
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:39.280]   Uh action or charges or fines this uh for sure. This is the chart from the european commission
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.920]   There are actually five probes
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.160]   Uh
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.440]   Three of them have been completed the comparison shopping was the first
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:53.200]   the uh, misuse of android was the second and then this most recent one advertising
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.880]   um
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.480]   google has a pop
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.400]   Appeal the first two has not yet appealed and probably won't appeal. I think this one
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.920]   Uh, and then there are two more probes ongoing
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.760]   with regard to local search and maps
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.400]   and scraping
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.400]   And charges have not been filed. The probes are not going on but charges not so
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.120]   It's scraping
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.400]   I know what scraping is. I don't know what it is in context of google isn't it?
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:25.920]   Probably i'm going to guess it has to do and this is a pure guess
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.640]   But it has to do with snippets
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:33.280]   It's that like zong zik shrek where google puts snippets of content
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:39.200]   From the sites that a new sites that it uh shows research results. I'm guessing i you know
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   There's this is from a wall street journal article and i don't think they even explain what those other two
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.160]   probes are so
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.040]   I and i think i'll have to do some research i apologize
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.440]   And i think this one's been going on for a while a couple of three years or something like that
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.200]   Uh, if i'm not a steak google stop doing this in 2017
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:05.600]   Well this one but in terms of the scraping i think that they've been looking at that for a long long time and um, and so i think
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.800]   I don't know why it's taking them so long other than our seo
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.760]   Yeah, and there may be something that article is it article 13? It's the scraping one
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.960]   That might take care of it. I don't know there's and it's controversial as you know
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:28.640]   France and spain of both acted against snippets germany has to with less than stellar results so
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:33.840]   So anyway just an update google has also
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.480]   in an attempt to
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.560]   assuage the european union decided to do a browser
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:46.160]   ballot kind of like microsoft did in windows for eu android devices instead of
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:52.640]   automatically getting chrome and google search on your android device when you first set up an android device
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.800]   google will
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:35:01.840]   Let you choose which browser and which search engine you want to use this is the microsoft windows browser ballot, which was just
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.560]   So stupid
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.320]   And by the way, this isn't even all the browsers it went on and on and on
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.560]   Right and it was a random mix in a random order
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.320]   so um
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:21.200]   Google we don't we don't have an image of google's browser a ballot and how are how they're going to do it
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.520]   But that they've already decided that that might be the way to do it. I have to think
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:30.640]   I I've just imagined that the meeting they said oh they let okay
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:37.120]   Good, we'll put a ballot on the android phone. See how they like that. We'll show them
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:43.680]   I mean all this all this essentially this is a repeat of the internet explorer bundling
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.720]   And I trust thing in the 90s, which which was
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.120]   nobody
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.120]   talks about it like this, but essentially
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.720]   Microsoft's point was proved correct. Yes
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.400]   Basically, what mikersoph was saying is that anybody can choose any browser
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:02.320]   We're like one great browser away from being crushed and and then nets
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:07.360]   Firefox came along and crushed them and then and then chrome came along and crushed firefox so
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.520]   I the
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:15.760]   The bundling doesn't matter that much and offering a choice has practically no effect whatsoever
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.960]   It's you have to have a browser
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:25.760]   It's it's an integral part of any operating system if nothing else to give you a way to download a browser
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.480]   How you gonna download chrome if we don't put a browser on there?
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:35.440]   It's the only time I it's the only time I use safari is when I get my new macbook and I'm like boom
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.000]   Safari to chrome
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.200]   Uh, so when is so uh april is google is mikers of course the last google plus user
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.920]   Yes, oh april third. Isn't it is it even second? Oh, it's coming up
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.760]   Yeah, just I just got a thing saying save all my photos
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.960]   Are you saving all your photos between google plus and flicker and what are you gonna do man? Oh man?
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.440]   I already have all my photos
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:06.560]   And there's there there are multiple efforts to to so google has its own process for downloading
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:11.760]   I downloaded all my posts and some of them are I put a lot of work into and they're very evergreen
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.200]   So I'm I'm probably going to repost them on my blog good
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:22.080]   um, but um, but we do have um, I mean like I said I wrote in a google
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.680]   You know fast company piece a couple of months ago
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:31.840]   Most of what was great about google plus was killed in 2014
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:38.800]   And so it's kind of been a shadow of itself for the last few years. So it's at this point no big loss
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:45.360]   Uh to a certain extent. Um, that's that's uh heresy in in in some circles, but um
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.320]   The problem is
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:54.080]   A lot of passionate google plus users felt like this is the one social network. I want to use
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:59.360]   It's the only one I want to use and all these smart people that I've gotten to know really well
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.240]   Are here and we have these great conversations and everything was great
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.240]   and now
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.880]   Nobody knows where to go facebook's off the table
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.160]   Because they're horrible twitter is annoying
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.280]   To a lot of people and where else you're gonna go?
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:18.400]   So people are going to you know, they're they're going to plus bora and they're going to we me and they're going to
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:25.280]   All this social networks nobody's heard of but what's happening is that the google plus community is being it's going off to 20 different social
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:30.720]   And so it's it's it's a diaspora, but it's no long that means it's gone. It's being destroyed
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.360]   And I actually blame google
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:38.720]   For this because they did create something of value. They really pitched it hard
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:47.200]   A lot of people went all in. I mean mike, you know, maybe it was ill advised to put these full length articles on google plus and nowhere else
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.080]   But but you did it because you believed in it and you really liked the conversations there
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:57.840]   And how could google just let that go and this is why people no longer trust google they see this okay
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:03.280]   This feels like and this drives me nuts. I mean the web is no
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.600]   It's no different than the rest of our lives
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:11.040]   There are places I like to go and talk to people and hang out and I spend my time I put my effort in
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.840]   I've worked at publications that have gone under for example
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.640]   They're coffee shops where I hang out with my friends and they are no longer around or someone moves
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:24.480]   The world moves on and I know this feels really mean, but i'm kind of like
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.760]   You know, it didn't work for them. They shut it down
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.600]   okay
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.440]   I
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.560]   If you want your own clearly more than google plus lover
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:40.800]   Well, I wasn't but I I've loved other things like I mean all of my giga ohm stuff only half of it exists
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.960]   I've lost my entire podcast catalog from giga ohm and i'm like eh all right
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.840]   That's life, you know this life. I've got i'll tell you why it hurts
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:55.600]   Um, I mean it hurts, but just but i'll tell you why we need something like that
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.600]   Do we though?
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.920]   Yeah, we do apart it no because then we stagnate
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.240]   I mean then you go and create other communities
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:07.200]   You take your ideas that you learn from other people and then we I mean think about it in the physical world
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:12.080]   You know there is no way in the physical world if there were if there were things
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:16.000]   There's towns. Yeah, it's like a town is disappeared
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.080]   That's a big deal
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.520]   Right, but those people left that town. I'm not saying it's not a big deal
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.520]   I'm saying these things happen in life and you just have to accept it and
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:30.400]   Put you down your roots somewhere else and do it all over again. And that's what people
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.800]   That's life. I guess I just I just know what you're saying
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:41.920]   The the thing that that has to be said though is that google plus the original version of 2011 to 2014
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.880]   To a lesser extent afterwards was a really really special social network
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:53.120]   I mean it was really every social network for some reason I and I certainly have no idea why this is has a certain
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.680]   Has a certain feel to it a certain
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:01.920]   A tone a certain you know instagram is so different from twitter or facebook even though it's owned by facebook
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.200]   um
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:11.040]   And the the essential nature of google plus there were things that were achieved on that social network that you just are unheard of on other social networks
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:14.960]   One of them is lots and lots and lots of people actually
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:19.360]   Turned strangers into close friends in real life
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.760]   uh, and i'm one of those people I have
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:25.040]   15 20 people who I
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:31.920]   Go visit and who I know personally and who I didn't know until we started following them on google plus
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:36.080]   You learn you have a lot in common you have a lot, you know, you you gang up on trolls together
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.160]   You do all the stuff you do hangouts
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:46.880]   And then they're great friends at people in belgium and like I went and stayed with a great friend that I met on google plus in switzerland
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.120]   uh
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:54.240]   You don't you don't hear by that kind of stuff on facebook basically what you're doing is you're kind of
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:42:01.520]   Hoovering up all of the all the friends and acquaintances and co-workers you've ever had and maintaining some superficial connection with them
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.840]   on google plus you're like
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:08.480]   Everybody was a stranger because you're you know nobody's family was really to speak of
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.320]   and
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:16.240]   You make these great friends. I don't know why that was the case we used to have these things called hurls hangouts in real life
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:21.520]   Uh, essentially meetups and i've never heard of a social network that was so
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.440]   conducive to real world friendships
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.800]   People had in the early days of twitter and it stopped soon
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:33.120]   But in the early days of twitter there were tweetups and it was very much like that
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.200]   uh, but twitter
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.040]   Became mass appeal and that
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:42.560]   Ruined it and I think one of the reasons google plus was great is because it wasn't very successful
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.440]   Exactly the people who were there were great
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.840]   But I what is it what are the other lessons to be learned from this?
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:54.160]   Google can't do social no matter how much
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:59.920]   I would submit I will not I think we need to have
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.960]   uh
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:06.640]   I don't think we can trust any company to do this right
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:11.760]   Get a word press blog and do it yourself. Well, but that's not social ultimately
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.560]   It's only a little bit social. I mean honestly
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:20.640]   And it's been tried and this is so I know my solution isn't a good solution, but we need a federated
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.440]   open network
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:29.440]   that uh, and you know, I we had hopes that in you know, identical then status net then uh, uh,
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:37.440]   Mastodon would be that they have the right backbone, but somehow those communities never gelled properly
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.600]   But that's how it has to be because if a company's in charge of it
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.440]   All sorts
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.920]   A that could kill it but B they they start monetizing instagram was a great site great
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:54.640]   Social network until they put an ad every ninth post and they started adding all these features like stories and the influencer
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.080]   As soon as the influencers arrived instagram went way downhill
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.640]   What about something like Pinterest?
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:06.560]   Yeah, maybe Pinterest is the answer. I don't know. I mean, it's it's a high quality. I is it very social
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:11.360]   I'm trying to I mean like feels more like people put stuff there, but that doesn't feel like there's interaction
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:17.280]   Yeah, right. It's a problem. It's where people interact become cesspits
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:23.120]   That's not that's not a crazy idea. I keep I keep wishing mastodon would succeed because
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.720]   From a tactical point of view. It's the right thing. Nobody owns it
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:30.560]   Uh, it's federated. You can create your own server
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:35.760]   But the communities that have been created on mastodon. I haven't found one that really attracts me at this point
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.360]   Yeah, the problem is that every social network
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:45.040]   Is either a failure in which case it's not worth using because no it's on it
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:51.920]   Yeah, or if it's successful, they will ruin it in order to squeeze every nickel out of it. That's why it can't be commercial
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:58.800]   That there that those are the only two social networks. We've ever seen google plus was different for a while
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:03.040]   um, I mean people say it wasn't it wasn't popular and I
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:08.560]   I mean, it's way more popular than lots of other social networks that have emerged since that people think are popular
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:14.080]   Um, it has great features though like unlike mastodon, which really is a twitter clone
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.040]   It was a threaded conversation clone
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:23.680]   It was great with images people like trey rekcliff showed that it became a fabulous place to put your images
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.280]   Google mismanaged it almost from day one establishing
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:33.680]   This crazy circle system that no one wanted to maintain and then you know, I mean they just they they
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.280]   Killed it death by a thousand cuts and it's yeah
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:43.680]   It's tragic and it's a really good example of why google or any company shouldn't be in charge of social and yet no one's done
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.480]   I wish they you know what google open source
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.960]   Yes slack is slack for many people's turned into that. Yeah, yeah
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.160]   I mean maybe that's it
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:57.920]   And you know what I would say we had a so the former giga omers
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:03.360]   We actually had we we took our slack channel right at the end of the show or at the end of the company
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.960]   He still did it actually still is alive and for the year afterwards
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.280]   we actually even paid for our own private slack
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:13.520]   and we did it because we had a lot of value in it and
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:18.320]   Slack such a pig as an application. It's hard to support it
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:22.000]   Uh, oh there's no no it's just a terrible
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.080]   It's I mean it's written an electron and it's just big and heavy
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:34.320]   And it needs I don't know what I don't it's not bad. I mean I know people are doing it discord is another very popular
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.880]   um
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.640]   Social network
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.920]   Can I can I propose I have to say something?
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.120]   Yes, let me just say this before you do which is google
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:52.480]   Please open source google plus and let us take it back. Okay. The tragedy is that we already have
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.520]   the world's greatest social network
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.840]   Which is email
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:03.680]   And the reason that nobody wants to use email for social networking is because they've lost control of their inboxes
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.520]   Uh
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.760]   Lots and lots of people have 20,000
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:14.000]   Messages in their inboxes and because they can't can manage the spam and the hype and the thing and newsletters and all that stuff
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.200]   They're like, yeah, I let's go to let's all go to slack
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:21.760]   Um, this is the prevailing attitude, but it's it's mistaken
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.160]   Everybody goes to facebook for example
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:32.160]   Because for a bunch of reasons, but the number one reason is network effects everybody's on facebook because everybody's on facebook except
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:37.440]   Everybody isn't on facebook email. There are three or four times as many people on email
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:42.720]   Everybody is on email. Yeah, everybody's on email. Okay, but it's a terrible social experience. I agree
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:49.600]   That's it. That's like saying in what way exactly chain letters are awesome for social experience
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:53.600]   I mean, it's exactly what leo's talking about. It's an open system
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:59.280]   You can use your own front end you can use this that the other thing you can't communicate easily with people
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:04.400]   You can't see it the conversations when they're threaded the way email threads them are horrible. You can't
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:09.840]   That maybe it's just we need a better client and maybe the client
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:13.920]   That's yeah, no because then you would still split your email
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:21.920]   So then you would just take your email identity, but you still have to split them out like I don't want to communicate with my friends over email
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:27.440]   Because that's a professional inbox. There you go. There's a solution. Why don't we
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:31.120]   That's dead. Okay
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.640]   Well
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:42.240]   Yeah, my point is that that email is so close
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:46.480]   You mentioned the threaded. I mean, you probably use gmail the the threading of
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.840]   Message threads on on gmail
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.560]   An inbox is not great
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.560]   And but it could be it should be
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:58.800]   It should be something that is fixable in the client
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:04.240]   But it's it's a it's a it's a it's a great social network because you can't
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:10.240]   Uh, there's no algorithmic filtering. This is it and then the truth is this is one of the reasons people hate it
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:16.080]   Because somebody like facebook there's not some corporation monitoring your relationships and deciding who's important who isn't it?
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:20.320]   Anybody actually on me. Yeah, people people say they don't like that
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.920]   But actually people love that fact that that facebook is simply
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.720]   Uh, not showing you what people are posting
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.520]   Uh, I mean everyone there's too much information if there's no algorithm
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:36.240]   I mean, I have 17 000 unread emails in my inbox. This does not stress me out
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.600]   Yeah, but again, but again, that's handable in the browser
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:43.680]   I mean you there's no reason why you couldn't algorithmically sort
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.840]   emails
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:50.560]   Other than the fact that you also have mission critical business. That's kind of the same box
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:56.800]   Exactly, and that's that's my that's the dog again or dog. That's the mark against email
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:01.360]   I guess well this is one of the interesting things that happened when I got off facebook
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:05.280]   I mean I haven't gotten off yet fourth of july's when i'm officially getting off in the meantime
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:10.400]   I'm sort of criticizing them like every day and also trying to get people to sign up for my newsletter and go to my
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.880]   Nice book. My nice book is a
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:20.240]   folder on google photos where I post personal photos and where people can comment and like those photos and it's a kind of
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:26.880]   Replacement for facebook, but what i've noticed is there were I already have lots of family and friends who were not on
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:30.800]   facebook before and so they never saw my personal photos
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.840]   now that i'm on
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.240]   Google photos they see it because
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:42.880]   They get a notification in their email inbox and so they use in email, but they didn't use facebook
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.040]   And so now for the first time there were several
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:50.400]   Older relatives of mine who are seeing my personal photos for the first time
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.040]   Uh, but again that this is a way
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:58.800]   This is back to the promise of google plus google plus promise to integrate gmail and google plus so email
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:02.160]   Social networking was all kind of the same thing and photos by the way
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:11.040]   Yeah, exactly exactly and so now now i'm sort of email and photos is the same thing unless you choose to get notifications on your phone or whatever
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:18.000]   Uh, some people do both but lots and lots of a lot more people are seeing my personal photos on google photos
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:24.720]   Then we're seeing them on on facebook. It's smart developers should just reverse engineer
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:29.120]   all the best features of google plus google photos and email
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:35.520]   And make something there's an opportunity here. I think a lot of people are going to be leaving facebook
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:40.960]   Uh, there's p. I here's why I think it's sad stacey because I think
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:44.800]   We need a good social network. We clearly
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:49.920]   Like social networks, but we also see the downsides to social networks
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:54.800]   Is it impossible to design a social network that really works
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:59.280]   Maybe maybe we just haven't tried enough times
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:07.600]   I think I think the problem is there's not one social network that's going to work for everyone right and that the challenge then becomes
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:14.480]   Oh, well if everyone's not on it, then I can't reach everyone. Thus people are like, oh, this is not the right social network
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:21.280]   And then we get frustrated. I mean the things I want a social network are probably very different than the things mike wants in a social network
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:26.640]   I would guess since he is having a well designed app could probably handle both
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:32.800]   Maybe it could handle the difference between mike and me but could it do mike me plus my mom
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:36.560]   And my daughter. I'm sure it could. Why not?
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:43.040]   I think look at where that I don't think it would be as essential like I think at different points of your life
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:50.400]   You want different things. I think you communicate different ways with people depending on the type of person you are the type of interaction you're seeking
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.120]   I mean
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.200]   I just
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:59.040]   I don't think there's one for everyone in even every stage of your life
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:04.960]   I do think that there's a general idea that most people would love in a social network
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:11.200]   So the problem I think most of the problems with social networking especially facebook is
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:17.280]   Intensity so I would and I mean that very broadly so for example when
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:24.800]   When my uncle fester posts some meaning found I have no interest in that. I don't see why
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.840]   Uncle fester
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:31.840]   Yeah, I wish I
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:35.600]   Somebody needs to start naming kids fester so that down the road
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:41.600]   They'll be a future world in which people will have an uncle fester. Yes, please you young parents out there
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:47.280]   Please name your investor. You're not doing it for him. You're doing it for the future generation
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.040]   That's right. I think of the future
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:54.560]   but I but I I think that and so that ranges from people passing around memes or other people's thoughts to
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:59.600]   Russian interference to you know disinformation campaigns to
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:04.240]   That was the beauty of go with you could you could filter that stuff out?
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.040]   Well to a over time it
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:14.560]   People were sharing stuff that's not their own thoughts, but I would love a social network that had basically two rules one is
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:21.840]   No, no algorithmic sorting or filtering when I follow somebody I want everything they they post yeah second thing is
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:29.440]   Nobody I don't want to get any content that isn't the actual words or photos taken by the person
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:32.000]   No, no share. No resharing. No retweeting
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.520]   Yes
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:40.640]   Absolutely. I mean I don't mind retweeting but if but that I do that with tweet deck
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:46.560]   I turn off retweets and it really cleans the Twitter stream considerably because you don't get this amplification effect
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:51.440]   Yeah, but but you know that even with back when before social network
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:57.200]   Working one of the big problems we had on email was everybody sending these like you know these forwards
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:04.240]   Yeah chain letters and like you know and they were all that was fake news of the you know 2005 or whatever but um
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:11.120]   It doesn't I see it continues to this day by the way. There's plenty of yeah older relatives who continue to send those
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:15.680]   And another thing that this social this fantasy social network should have
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:19.600]   Is the ability to bring in content that follows the rules from other social networks?
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:26.880]   So somebody wants to be on twitter and and and I can just plug in twitter and have their tweets coming to this social network
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:29.120]   And then my comments go back out to twitter
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:34.000]   Uh, but again companies like twitter are gonna throw you know, they're gonna strangle that and it's cradle if kevin
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.760]   Marks were here. He would say this is the kind of thing the open web is you know
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:42.160]   Indie web is constantly working on and there are a lot of initiatives
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:46.000]   And a lot of attempts to kind of solve these technical challenges
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.680]   But I and I've tried a lot of them I play with them all because I want to
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:56.240]   You know, I'm looking for this this one thing there is one tool i'm going to mention because uh a big part of the
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:56:01.680]   Social networking that is email is newsletters mike. You've got a great one
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:08.640]   Um, the problem I have with newsletters is that I get too many because it's not just mike sending me newsletters
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:12.800]   It's also wayfare you got what I need and I don't want that
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:19.840]   So, uh, and they're all intermingled so megan moroni on ios today found a really nice app
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.320]   That's basic. It's called stoop
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.320]   That's basically you subscribe to newsletters with a stoop email address
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:29.040]   If you sub sign up for stoop you'll get an email address
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:32.880]   And then all the newsletters you actually want go into an app
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:35.760]   That you can read
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:42.880]   And this really works. Well, this is it's a it's a news read a news reader for email newsletters
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:51.200]   If it would be the elevator pitch. I I think that's I think that's cool. You know, it's basically this is what I I roll my own
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:56.240]   Uh for that exact same concept what I do is I have a full a newsletter folder
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:01.280]   I have a rule that basically grabs every email newsletter and puts it in that folder
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.760]   And then when I ready to go read newsletters
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:09.760]   I just go through them in reverse chronological order and it's very nice to not have newsletters in my inbox next to I do this
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.080]   emails from my kids or whatever and so
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:18.800]   Um, it really really works for me and as part of how I achieve zero inbox like several times a day
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:23.440]   Um, but again, this this is kind of a nerdy thing that most people don't want to do
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:27.280]   So an app like this is a great idea because it kind of kind of does it for you
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:30.400]   We need the opposite of a google change log
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:33.840]   Maybe the google dead list or something
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:36.480]   Yeah, the google graveyard
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.720]   Uh spring cleaning
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:45.360]   So april second and I actually there's a there's some details to this april second inbox is going away
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:48.720]   Uh and google plus are going away
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:54.400]   Here is how it works. Uh the timeline google's released this february 4th
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.440]   Which is past you can't create a new profile
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.520]   um
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.520]   All your web comments will be deleted
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:04.320]   On april second that's coming up
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:10.800]   In fact all consumer google plus content will be deleted that google has said they're going to keep a business version of google plus around
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.880]   I don't know what that means
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:17.200]   Other than google notes content that it's required to keep for legal reasons
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:19.840]   So photos videos
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:26.240]   Your album archive everything is going to go away. You need to go to google takeout and get it all
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.800]   There's also google support page for that
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:33.360]   But that's not all they're going to be inbox and google plus are going away, but so is goog
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:38.160]   Dot gl there's url shortener is going away
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:42.160]   Yeah, yay. Uh also aloe
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:46.800]   Yeah, I believe the links that exist for that will continue to work
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:49.440]   But you can't make new links. Yeah, right?
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:53.760]   Um, so google is really doing some house cleaning
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:57.600]   Um, I can't say i'm unhappy about
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:04.880]   Inbox because I mean it was good and I feel bad for google relied on it, but I think there are other choices out there
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:10.480]   Um, and the url shortener. There's certainly plenty of choices there. I use bit. Leave for that
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:15.280]   Google plus was long has been dead for a long time. They're just pulling the cord
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.880]   Um, but i'm sad. I'm actually most sad about that
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:21.040]   Yeah
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:27.840]   Well, the the good news is that internet archives and the archive and archive team are working to preserve public posts
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:33.760]   Thank you, and uh, they they posted this on a reddit and essentially what they're doing is they're they're going to
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:38.080]   Um, compress the photos so you're not going to have the high quality photos
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:40.960]   They're probably not going to preserve all the comments
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:45.760]   Like I mentioned that the the glory days of google plus between 2011 2014
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:53.040]   The google plus messages had a maximum of 500 comments and for many many users
[00:59:53.040 --> 01:00:01.200]   Their comments were maxed out every time on every single post so for uh posts that have
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:06.560]   More than pro they didn't say specifically, but I would guess a few dozen comments
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:13.920]   You're not going to retain all those comments, but they'll try to retain a screenshot essentially of the comment of most of the comments or some of the comments
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.520]   um
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:20.000]   For posts, but again the most the important thing are the posts and the photos and they're trying to
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.600]   Uh retain them all and that this is the reason this is interesting is because if you thought
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.840]   That
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.600]   If you were wanting to delete your posts and figure well, I was just like google do it for me
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.880]   Um, you really should delete them asap
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:42.480]   Before they're archived by these guys because they this archive may live forever actually let's hope it does it should yeah
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.960]   Yeah
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.960]   And then there's devin newness
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:54.480]   Hard not to uh to be amused uh by this
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.480]   Um
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:02.960]   He's a representative from california former chairman of the house intelligence committee now ranking member
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.160]   He's sewing twitter
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.440]   And a number of twitter users including his mom
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:14.640]   His fake mom devin newness mom and his cow devin cow
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:19.440]   To parody accounts for 250 million dollars
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.320]   Nunez is accusing twitter of facilitating defamation on its platform
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:31.040]   By ignoring lawful complaints about offensive content and by allowing that content to remain accessible to the public
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.760]   Saying that it violated terms and services of terms of service
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:41.120]   Uh on the other hand, it's not illegal to parody or mock people
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:44.320]   Uh and ironically
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.320]   Devin cow
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:52.160]   Which had fewer than a thousand followers when this lawsuit was announced. I should just go quickly check
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.560]   But has gained a lot of traction
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:00.640]   Mr. Ice and effect let me just see devin cow now has
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.440]   472 000 followers
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.880]   So it's frustrating
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.120]   Here is that people have actually
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:16.000]   Beat twitter up for having terrible terrible like reactions to people saying
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.680]   Hey
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:22.080]   Take this down. It's offensive. It bothers me and twitter's constantly like uh
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.960]   Like women who have been you know
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:31.360]   Yelled at on twitter that that's a big problem. They have they see all kinds of offensive content and twitter does nothing
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.120]   um
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.120]   so I
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:40.000]   Mean do I wish twitter had better standards? Yes. Do I want to get behind Devin Nunez and his
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.480]   Obvious attack on a parody account? No, well, that's gonna be really curious what jeff would say given his yeah jeff said
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:49.120]   The problems i have i uh with parody accounts
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:53.840]   Um, i've never sued twitter over that and i've and i've you know, I mean
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:57.440]   A if you're a public figure, especially if you're a member of congress
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:02.640]   Yeah, you you really kind of have to accept the fact that people are going to have something to say to you and twitter's
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.640]   A good place to do it
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:08.400]   Who told him he should sue? I mean what it was obviously bad advice
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.520]   He's grown the size of the
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.160]   Devin cow following
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.160]   By 471
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.840]   It's the best thing that ever happened to his cow. Oh man. Devin cow is so happy
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:25.040]   But but the my favorite part about this is that he is specifically talking about
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.440]   uh
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:28.640]   met about
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.280]   you know libel and defamation coming up to the
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.240]   18 midterms and
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:42.400]   The lawsuit is 250 million dollars for compensation and 300 and an additional 350 000 in punitive damages
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:47.920]   But like it's like wait a minute back up there 250 million dollars in compensatory damages
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.800]   He's saying that he's going to lose
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.960]   250 million dollars because of these parody accounts
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:00.960]   Well, I imagine uh that twitter will seek a surprise judgment and get it thrown out immediately
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.920]   I can't imagine this will proceed and even if it does there's no way he's getting a penny
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.000]   But where was this money coming from?
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.720]   Where is the court of a billion dollars you lost Devin?
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:17.760]   I mean yeah, was it from from bribes from from campaign finance turns out Devin newness is as bad a lawyer as he is a member of congress
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.360]   uh and and a bad
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.960]   strategic as well because or strategistian
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.120]   Because he Devin cow now has a hundred thousand more followers
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.880]   100 000 more followers than Devin newness is officially cow
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.120]   I think that seriously I think what he's actually doing is that I
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.520]   I personally have to assume that this is a publicity stunt
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:45.040]   and the whole it's it's basically um
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:53.120]   Trying to feed the republican narrative that social networks have a that's what's really conservative bias
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.160]   That's exactly what's going
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:59.280]   President's jumping on this everybody's jumping on this and in interviews with uh various people
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.240]   Jack Dorsey has pointed out that
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:08.560]   Most of the time much of the time when people say oh this conservative person posted some
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:14.080]   Conservative opinion and you block them he says well, that's what you think is happening
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:19.040]   But actually we see all the behind the scenes what they're really doing is they're in the part of this coordinated campaign
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.120]   Of this information with multiple fake accounts and bots doing all this xyz
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:29.120]   And the sum total of all these things that this particular instance is doing is getting them boot booted off
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:34.640]   What what is chilling and and nauseating about all this is that?
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:41.040]   There's a lot of dirty tricks in politics and you know, you can't blame just the
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:46.800]   Conservative but and so let's not let's just basically point out that disinformation works
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.360]   and that false narratives work and the
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:53.840]   The conversations are getting so extreme and it's all being amplified by
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.840]   By so by social media everybody's got a voice
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:02.880]   even uh noon has his cow has a voice everybody's got a voice and so
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:12.320]   There's a legitimate mainstream politicians are essentially trying to make the world safer for disinformation because
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:19.040]   That's the strategy. That's those are the tactics that everybody's glomming on to if we can basically shame
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.600]   social networks into allowing
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.520]   uh
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:27.120]   disinformation campaigns or you know any of this other stuff
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:33.440]   Um by saying that they have a conservative bias. I mean they've seen facebook actually reverse course on things
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:37.920]   When they were accused of having a conservative bias we've seen all kinds of hay being made
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:41.760]   When this particular person or that particular
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:49.440]   Account has been shut down or suspended or whatever and they they just immediately just apologize and reverse course on it
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:55.280]   So you can you know, it's just a strategy. They're trying to make they're trying to increase the size of the window
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:59.680]   Uh, that's allowed for any kind of speech that harms
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:06.960]   Political opponents. I think that's the problem if twitter were doing what newness's lawsuit says
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:11.440]   If it was actively censoring in shadow banning conservatives
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:17.200]   Thereby eliminating newness's voice while amplifying the voice of his democratic detractors
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:22.800]   So what I mean, I don't think they are but what if they were so what?
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:30.960]   I'm sure you could accuse fox news or msnbc of having a bias and not giving a voice to people it disagrees with
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:34.240]   If it's a media company, it's allowed to do that
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:40.240]   What what makes twitter special that that it's not allowed to have a point of view if it does which it?
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.120]   I don't think it does but even if it did that's not illegal
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.920]   Again, I don't think this lawsuit is being
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.080]   Uh filed in good faith. It's not serious. It's all it's all it's all
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.400]   Exactly. It's a tactic. I'm sure any judge will just say we'll come on
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.800]   Uh, here's one of the tweets from devin newness mom that was mentioned in the complaint
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:03.600]   Devin newness your district is looking for you are you trying to obstruct a federal investigation again?
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.480]   You come home right this instant or no more minecraft
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.960]   See that's gold. That's pretty funny. That's comedy gold. Yes
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:15.920]   Uh, and even if you were a devin newness fan, I think you would say well
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:17.920]   That's funny. It's not harmful
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:24.000]   Right. It's not you know advocating harm to another person like some tweets and lots of tweets
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.440]   Do that
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.720]   Yeah, we did yeah, we've seen a lot of that
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:33.920]   Yeah, and uh, I don't see that blocked. I wish it were but we don't see that blocked
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:38.240]   Can't bother you can't block the president of the united states. Come on. I know
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:41.360]   Um
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.360]   by the way, uh
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:48.640]   Finally finally a bill has been signed into law banning fake news
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:53.040]   And uh internet insults completely illegal
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.080]   Uh in russia
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:00.480]   Yeah, I'm so glad that somebody is standing up against fake news
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:04.640]   It's uh, it's about time. It's about time
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.560]   the bills, uh say you can't criticize
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.760]   The government let's see here's the exact quote
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:17.520]   There's punishment for spreading information that quote exhibits blatant disrespect for
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.680]   the society
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:22.080]   government official government symbols
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:27.360]   Constitution or governmental bodies of russia see devin newness would love russia
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:32.320]   You know the us did have laws like this what we had the treason and sedition law way back in the
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.720]   It was right after the first amendment became the part of the constitution
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:42.320]   We passed a bill that's that said oh and by the way, don't say anything bad about the government
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:49.040]   So, I mean we we came back from that. Thank goodness. Yes. Thank goodness. We're yeah, actually. It's really remarkable
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:54.640]   Uh how much the first amendment has become uh almost a state religion
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.000]   And I'm and I think that's a very good thing. But as you point out
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.960]   Historically stacy it was not it was uh, it was not particularly even honored by congress
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.520]   But thank goodness. It's kind of is these days
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:14.080]   And I think that's the right thing clearly in russia. There is no first amendment insulting state symbols
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:19.600]   And pouton will carry a fine of 300 000 rubles and 15 days in jail for repeat offenses
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:25.680]   I you know that this is California. You can flick off a police officer and it's considered a first amendment right now
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:30.560]   Yeah, that was an interesting case wasn't it? It's like oh, but I wouldn't recommend it
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:35.280]   I'm not saying as a policy. It's a good policy
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:40.560]   But uh, you know sometimes having the right to do it and actually doing it
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.760]   Are different things
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.760]   well one of the one of the fun things about
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:50.800]   President trump and I don't want to talk about his politics or this isn't a left right thing
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:51.440]   but
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:58.880]   uh whether you're conservative or liberal you have to acknowledge the obvious fact that he tends to call fake news
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.200]   News that does not
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:08.080]   praise or that's critical of him. That's his definition of fake news and good news is news that is praise
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:14.720]   That praises him. Um, and this is essentially the law that they've enacted in russia. Yeah to a large extent
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:18.400]   They're saying no fake news what is fake news? Well anything that criticizes the government is
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:26.880]   Right definition fake news. And so it's it's absolutely ridiculous. It's also ridiculous because of course it has to be said that russia
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.880]   is the
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.880]   probably the world's largest, um
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:34.400]   purveyor of
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.760]   There's a world so that's actually a very good point. I hadn't really
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:43.040]   I really thought about that. It's it's illegal in russia, but you could do it against anybody outside of russia
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:51.520]   It's it's something that russia has been on the forefront of for a hundred years. I mean they during the cold war this they're um
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:54.240]   You know, they they they they soviet union
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.080]   Governed to a very large extent by using disinformation within the country
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:05.360]   Uh, this is before globalization all that kind of stuff, but that the kgb was masterful
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:11.920]   At disinformation and just go look at the archives you see different versions of every photo where they before photoshop
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.920]   They were you know hand painting
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:19.440]   Uh people out of photos as if they never existed and so on so they've been at this for a long long time
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.000]   Stalin was a master
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:30.400]   Uh, actually the president is already campaigning for 2020 and his way out spending the his democratic
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.960]   opponents in ad spending on google in fact
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:37.920]   Most of his ad spending i'm not google most of his ad spending is on facebook
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.560]   He has already spent three and a half million dollars from the beginning of the year
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:46.480]   Uh on facebook ads a million on google
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:49.920]   That's more than all the other candidates combined
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.880]   Uh, and you know what it worked for him. It's uh, I think
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:59.760]   In a way this shows that these other candidates haven't learned the lesson of the 2020 election
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.760]   Facebook is really where the battle ground is going to be isn't it?
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:09.520]   I I think I think that of what's happening to very large extent is people don't want to throw a whole lot of money behind
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:15.760]   A candidate when that candidates chances of being the nominee are very so as soon as we have a front runner
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.240]   Then we'll see it ramp up
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:24.320]   Trump is absolutely going to be the you know the nominee the oh well that not necessarily actually after
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:30.240]   Uh, you know, there could be lots of news that comes out that could harm him and the republican party may may want to go with somebody else
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.080]   But mid-romantic are saying they're running so there may be some challenge
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:40.400]   Yeah, so but still he's he's a you know, it's it's a pretty safe bet that you can
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:46.720]   Contributors campaign now and and you'll be actually backing somebody who will be running. Yeah, which is nice
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.360]   um
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.920]   I think we'll be watching with a real interest because I think
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:56.720]   It's pretty clear that Facebook ads are the single most effective way
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:02.400]   Right, they were but you think it'll be very interesting to see how Facebook
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:08.320]   I mean remember we talk about this all the time facebook tweaks his algorithms and six newspapers go out of business or not newspapers
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.400]   but news organizations, so
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.640]   There's a very real chance that facebook could adapt the way that it
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:21.680]   Targets advertising or allows people to do things related to ads that changes that and that would be very
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.640]   I mean
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:30.560]   I wouldn't count it out. I guess is what i'm saying facebook could really facebook is very very much
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:34.800]   So a player here as much as it may not want to be as much as it may hate to admit it
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:40.720]   It can do things to make its ads make ads much more or much less effective
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.960]   Facebook getting a lot of heat of course for the tragedy in christ church
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:51.440]   Uh, it was streamed live for 17 minutes by the shooter or the alleged shooter on facebook
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:56.800]   Although do we still really have to call him the alleged shooter if he streamed the video of him doing it live
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:02.640]   Uh, i've not seen it. I know until until someone is convicted in a court of law alleged okay, alleged
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:05.200]   Uh, there's some pretty strong evidence however
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:10.240]   Uh, which he provided, uh, I never hope to see it
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.800]   But there are a lot of people who want to see it and of course the real problem
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.800]   All the social networks are having right now is keeping that video down
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:21.840]   Facebook says it removed one and a half million reposts of that video
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:27.840]   Uh, but that several hundred thousand still got through twitter and reddit and other social networks
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:31.120]   Have faced it and now in australia
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:36.960]   Telstra one of the big um australian telecom companies is actually blocking
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:40.400]   4chan 8chan and other sites
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:46.240]   They say because of these videos, but uh, I wonder if this is a gonna be a long-term strategy
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:52.240]   No, it was temporary. They've already unlocked them again. Okay. Okay. Okay. I think so and but it raises another question
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:57.120]   I mean back in the old days before social and before live streaming. I mean we really have to
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.280]   You know, we've all gotten used to live streaming, but what a revolution that is
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:06.240]   I mean I remember what it's first coming out actually talks to begin at google plus the first uh, uh,
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:12.560]   Way the first freeway to live stream multiple people was uh hangouts on air
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:17.600]   And it's like, you know, it's like owning cbs news or something like that
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:25.200]   But with a larger audience potentially if it's, you know, and obviously that kind of power is going to be gained by lots of people for lots of purposes
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.440]   including uh
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.000]   violent uh psychopaths and back in the old days
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:36.960]   Uh, it was a kind of a common thing where where crazy people would hold hostages or do something
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.720]   Threatened violence if you don't read my manifesto on the air. I will do xyz
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:48.160]   This is like this has been going on for now now. They don't have to do that anymore. They can go directly to the people and they can
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:53.200]   Uh live stream their stuff which raises the the question
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:57.840]   And this is a dicey issue because i'm saying this as we're live streaming this
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:04.000]   But do we need live streaming or they are the potential downs sides of live streaming worth
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.880]   the the
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.320]   We can filter something like this building filters for this
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.800]   that catch
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.920]   Something of this magnitude or even people who are trying to kill themselves over live stream
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:21.440]   Those are things you can actually algorithmically detect
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:25.440]   If not the content of the video the sudden interest in a video
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:30.880]   um facebook saying that no one apparently reported this feels like a real dodge
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.200]   and
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:38.320]   I know there are there 8 billion people on this planet now have we reached that yet 7.5
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:46.240]   And you know 3.5 of them have internet access so they could be streaming it something abhorrent at any one point in time
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.160]   but
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:50.000]   I do think there
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.040]   Is a there is an investment that needs to be made in detecting these and getting them down faster
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.280]   And it's not it's technically very possible
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:00.560]   I and I would say even if it weren't
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:06.880]   uh that it's that that's no reason to stop live video. I'm sorry. I just really feel like
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.120]   um
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.520]   Yeah, I mean it's awful, but but
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:18.960]   One of the things that's so great about the internet is the elimination of gatekeepers
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:23.520]   And and people who were protecting us against things we didn't want to see
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:27.920]   I think back to the vietnam war, which was some call the first television war
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:30.960]   and I think one of the reasons the vietnam war was
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:36.720]   So heavily protested was because people for the first time saw the horrors of war in their living room
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.640]   and
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.880]   I think that if you attempt to filter out the horrors of the world
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:48.720]   In a reasonable attempt to you know keep people safe. That's a mistake
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:53.120]   And I don't think the gatekeepers made the world a better place and I think
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:58.080]   You know, this is the problem with the internet. It brings in the good and the bad right into your living room
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:03.600]   But in the but in the long run, I think that any restrictions on the capabilities of the internet is a big mistake
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:09.360]   I also worry that that the the the facebook's and the google's of the world will screw this up
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:16.240]   Uh, there have been lots of you talked about the benefits of live streaming some of these have involved cases of police brutality
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:20.800]   Yes, where and and it's actually a shield to a certain extent
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:25.680]   I mean there have been cases where people have been on the brink of being attacked in some way
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:30.080]   Or violated in some way and somebody would be like well, this is streaming live right now
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:34.720]   You're you're like and that you can't you know, once it's in the cloud you can't take it back
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:38.400]   You can't delete the file or whatever and so live streaming
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.880]   uh has a
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.000]   vast
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.120]   positive
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.960]   upside however
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.960]   I just hope facebook can
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:51.280]   Distinguished between violence that involves
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:54.720]   Uh, that's being streamed by a victim in order to
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.680]   Yes, yeah, the weakness is I don't think it can
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:04.080]   And I think it's very hard and facebook is primarily relying on the you know reporting of the people who see it
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:07.680]   To take stuff down and honestly, I think that's fine
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:13.920]   Well, I don't think that's the that's the bitter with the batter. I mean, I think you just kind of that will that will be gained
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:15.200]   Let's say
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:21.440]   Some somebody on one side of the political spectrum is live streaming something that people on the other side of this political spectrum
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:28.000]   Don't like so this they they use their campaign methods the same thing they do on twitter to to like attack somebody
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:34.720]   Twitter mobs and they get it taken down as offensive comment and content and it's live stream
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:36.800]   So once they've gotten it shut down
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:45.280]   That moment has lost and so I worry about the incompetence of the of the companies the the I don't think they should be
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:52.160]   Immaturey to the technology and also worry about the fact that every powerful thing whether it's live streaming or
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:21:00.320]   Or reporting objectionable live streaming will be gained by propaganda the liars the cheaters the everybody's
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:07.920]   It's unfortunate and I think uh, what we definitely want to do is prevent the glorification of a mass murderer
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:13.040]   Uh by re-sharing this video and I think that the efforts companies have made to prevent that are well
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:16.160]   You know spent
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:21.920]   Uh, but I don't think turning off live streaming is the solution. I really think that's that we
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.720]   That's a technology that needs to continue
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:32.640]   It's you know, it's not the live streaming as much as it is the radical virality the real time virality
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.360]   It's a problem. I agree
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:40.720]   But you can't prevent it. So what are you gonna do to stop virality? That's human
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.800]   See I think a lot of times we want to legislate human humanity
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:48.320]   Uh, I guess that's what laws are right, but uh, yeah
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:53.440]   That's society's effort to control the worst of the worst of human nature. Yeah, we have them
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:22:02.080]   We're okay with that. Yeah. No, we are okay with that. Yeah, there was just the power of amplification is is really
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:07.680]   Does a lot of damage when it's when the wrong thing is being amplified and that's exactly what we're talking about here
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.560]   Yeah, I don't know what the answer is
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:13.520]   I don't know live in a cave and uh
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:18.000]   Not uh, no, that's not the answer. I guess I guess that's
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.320]   Well, you know New Zealand's decided they're gonna enact tougher good laws. Yeah, no
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:26.480]   That's actually very proactively doing things that I think will make a difference
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:29.440]   Like that's a start. Yeah
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:35.840]   Uh, or you could put those videos on my space and probably they'd get lost forever
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:41.600]   My space has lost all the music uploaded to it between
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:44.640]   2003 and 2015
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.840]   as a result of a server migration project
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:53.600]   Face my space says any photos videos and audio files you uploaded more than three years ago
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:59.520]   May longer be available on or from my space. We apologize for the inconvenience
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:02.880]   And suggest you retain your backup copies
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.960]   Oops
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.960]   Have you tried google plus? Oops
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.040]   Uh
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.680]   There's no backup. They're gone forever. This is an article from boing boing cori doctor. Oh, it's author

[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.360]   In fact, I've interviewed him so many times I said megan you take this one because
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:35.840]   Sometimes what happens if i'm interviewing somebody and it happened with you mike somebody I know really well
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:37.520]   it just returns into a
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:43.920]   Friends conversation instead of interviews. So i'm gonna let megan that take cori uh monday one pm pacific
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:48.880]   His new book radicalized. He is if you've never heard gory speak
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:55.200]   Tune in he is amazing or watch his talk at south by he's done a lot of talks recently
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:00.240]   Uh, he's just he's his mind works 10 times faster than mine and it's just
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:03.040]   amazing to watch him think
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.680]   um
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:07.680]   How's your boy betto these days?
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:11.760]   Uh raised 6.4 million. Yep. It apparently is
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:15.280]   His secret membership in america's old is tacking group hasn't heard him
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:21.360]   What was his handle in the cult of the dead cow?
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:29.280]   It wasn't funny. It wasn't very it wasn't a very good name. It was psychedelic something or other
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:32.000]   What was it?
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000]   psychedelic warlord
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.520]   53
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.440]   hahaha
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:42.080]   President that's president psychedelic warlord president psychedelic warlord to you
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:49.840]   Honestly, uh, haven't we been calling for somebody who knows something about technology? Yeah in the congress and the white house
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:56.000]   I think we have lots of we actually have lots of people in congress that know something about technology. Let's get somebody in the white house
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:03.600]   Well, what worries me is that is the conversation everybody's having everybody i've had it myself
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:11.200]   We're all having this conversation where it's like oh, but the problem is that the that his political opponents will attack him
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:16.080]   It's the the fact that a hacker, you know, if you look at his actual
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:18.000]   History
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.040]   Uh, it's all very innocuous. I think as far as we know
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:26.320]   Um, and it's actually much of it is very positive in terms of learning about technology learning how it works
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:33.040]   Um, but the word hacker has a negative connotation and so the propaganda the political propaganda's will try and destroy him
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.880]   He also has some different kind of hacker. He also has a DUI has other things going on although
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:45.600]   On the plus side if he got into the white house, he might replace the president's bowling alley with a skate park
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.760]   Which would be also we voted donald trumpin. Okay. Okay
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:52.960]   I'm just gonna
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:06.080]   I feel like, you know, we we had this conversation. We're like, oh clinton, you know, he did his mochweeb. Yeah, he totally did
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:08.480]   You know, i'm like guys
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:13.600]   We like took all of that and set it on fire and said anyone come on in come on in
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:16.320]   Well, he did say that
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:22.160]   Uh, he uh joined the hacker group because it was you know like the facebook of its day when dad bought an apple to e
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:26.720]   And a 300 bawd modem and I started to get on the boards. It was the facebook of its day
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:34.160]   You just wanted to be part of a community. Yeah, so I don't think being a hacker has negative connotations now does it?
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:38.480]   I think being a skater is worse than being a hacker or a punk rocker
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:42.400]   Yeah, I mean people don't like extremely california things
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.400]   and um
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:49.440]   Skating is one of them like you know, well and he moves his hands a lot right. What's that all about?
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:55.600]   He from all the skating you have to like be balancing. That's right. That's a good
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:59.760]   emphatic individual. No, we're just i'm jokin obviously
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:05.440]   Yeah, yeah, I mean he he was he was a young person who is not he was not
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:11.120]   You know like a lot of uh political candidates, you know president of the political club and right kind of doing all kinds of stuff
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.520]   He was calling to late in life
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:19.040]   So remember that show uh it was a movie back in like the early 80s called gleaming the cube
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:23.920]   He's a combination of the computer hacker and christian slater skater character
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:29.440]   That is that is what he is love it and if you didn't watch gleaming the cube
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:37.120]   It's because you were a massive christian slater fan back in the early 80s. He's as a teenage girl. He's a strange fellow
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:41.280]   I gotta there are a lot of people who um
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.760]   are very
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:47.120]   Respectable people nowadays who had who did a lot in
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:51.040]   Were skaters who have tattoos? It's gonna be hard to elects and do us up. I mean
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:55.360]   Things who are gonna i have a friend who he is just the most
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:58.400]   I mean if you you think he was
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:04.560]   You know, he seems like a ceo. I mean he's very seems like an ultra responsible person
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:08.480]   And uh after a while you learn he was he was actually a pro skater
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:09.760]   Wow
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.720]   Back in the day and it's like wow that's that's that's amazing
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:17.440]   But I I just I think it's a it should be a non-story. It won't be a non-story
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:23.520]   It's gonna be weaponized and it's uh, it's part of the it's part of the problem with our political conversation
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:29.920]   It's uh, it's only a matter of time before we get a skater in the White House. I'm just saying that's right. That's right
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.840]   Yeah, maybe avera Levine. I don't know
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:37.760]   Will be the first lady arsh time for the play the trumpets. It's time for the google changelog

[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:12.240]   from the google g-suites
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:13.360]   blog
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:16.240]   Three highly requested features being added to tasks
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:20.560]   Not clear if this is only in g-suites or if this is for all tasks users
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:26.640]   It's about time you could set a date and time for your tasks and get notifications you can create repeating tasks
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:30.240]   and import reminders into tasks
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:34.480]   isn't this uh self evidently a um
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:37.360]   a kind of
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.840]   mitigation of the termination of inbox
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:48.400]   Because one of the things that inbox had that google the gmail doesn't have is this whole super integration with with reminders
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:53.440]   And so they're basically saying oh, we're gonna kill the thing that where you have been doing most of your minder stuff
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:59.840]   And we're gonna give you gmail instead, but gmail has a click a button and there's your tasks and they're all your reminders
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:02.560]   Uh, thanks to this new feature. I think that's clearly what they're doing here
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:08.480]   They're just they're trying to find a place for the things that inbox users are are we're loving
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:14.720]   Well, and it's a basic thing for a task or it does seem like i'm something you should have
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:21.680]   Yeah, I never use google task because it sucked. Yeah, there's so many so many better to do lists
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:25.760]   Uh out there than tasks including google's own keep
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:32.640]   Yeah, I use google keep actually because it sinks across all my devices and I can put things that could place all those things
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:37.920]   Can I share a preview of something i've been working on i'm working on a
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:43.440]   Very short. It's I don't know if it's a column or a book or a essay or a pamphlet or something
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:50.160]   Um called the power of procrastination. I can't wait actually I guess i'll have to wait. You you'll have to wait
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:53.280]   Yeah, that's the whole point and uh, yeah leaders of tomorrow
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:54.880]   That's the news
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.880]   Uh, but but basically I
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:59.760]   My I've tried tasks
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:06.080]   10 times at least where i'm like i'm gonna use task i'm gonna i'm gonna change everything i'm gonna go use task
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:08.080]   It makes sense. It's logical
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:11.760]   And then I just I just don't like it like as stacey was saying it's just something about it
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:14.960]   I just don't like it. I've tried using keep i've tried using
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:17.680]   a gazillion
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:20.160]   apps and
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:25.360]   extensions and lots of things and now what I use is I simply use a snooze feature of
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:32.880]   Gmail so I try to do everything as late as possible and that's this has provided a structure around my work
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:37.840]   My workload and I I basically just go through my inbox and i'm like
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:44.640]   I don't have to do that till you know april, you know and off it goes and uh, this isn't due until friday
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:50.160]   I need like a couple hours. So let me put this at two hours before end of day friday. And so I push everything
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:54.080]   Off into the future and i'm kind of like juggling all these
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:59.600]   Things in the air, but man out of sight out of mind. It's like so nice. So if anybody
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:05.360]   is inclined in that direction, it's a great way to achieve the zero inbox you have all these tasks that have to be done
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:07.840]   but they're off into the
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:13.760]   Nether world of of of this news feature in gmail and uh, it's really for me
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:16.480]   I do the same thing except
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:19.440]   I I have what's called the bs hour
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:22.480]   And it's fridays because that's my light day
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:26.320]   So I schedule and I schedule the time on my calendar and I go through all of my
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:30.240]   I schedule is that with this beer and scotch hour beer and scotch. Yes, it's the beer and scotch
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:34.480]   It's the bold it's the power. It's where I deal with all the bullshit stuff. I don't want to deal with
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:36.960]   Um, it's an hour enough
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:40.000]   Um feels like feels like
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.280]   I honestly when you said that I thought that's the hour you get to do what you want and the rest of the time is when you do
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:48.160]   The bs it's okay. So it's about it. It's about two hours
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:51.920]   But if it doesn't get done in that first hour and something more enticing happens i'm on that
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:54.960]   Um, but yeah, so everything is again is
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:01.920]   Boomerang or slept or whatever it is that happens then and I love it. It's doing so well by me
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:03.440]   That's good and you just get rid of all that
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:06.320]   Stuff you know one who ever wants to do
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:09.120]   Yeah in one hour the phone calls
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:11.600]   I had that call
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:15.360]   Oh, no, it's only for email. That's just email. Okay, but it could be phone calls
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:19.280]   Right. No, no, you don't have phone calls. You don't want to do
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:22.080]   I don't make phone calls
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:28.240]   That's one solution. Just don't do it. I'm serious. I'm like I think I've called like
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:36.160]   I had a call to get salted delivered the other day for our water softener. Oh my husband deals with all of that
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.040]   I'm terrible at it. Yeah, I am
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:43.440]   Because yeah, I don't I don't make you so the favorite feature of email
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:49.360]   Forward does problem solved has anybody found a good replacement for inbox?
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.600]   Anybody do either of you use inbox?
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:35:00.320]   I don't like inbox. I never did so I'm both beard. Yeah, I used both depending on my mood depending on what I wanted to do
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:03.520]   but over time I
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:05.040]   I'm not
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:10.640]   crying because they you know, I'm not sad because they are killing I would have been really sad if they kill gmail
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:16.640]   I kind of liked gmail better because there's more control. It has an all male folder
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:21.520]   Uh, which that's not a gender reference. I mean all the mail, you know
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:27.040]   The replies and all that kind of stuff and so I like that feature if I don't trust that that my
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:29.200]   that my
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:36.240]   Filters have properly put things in the right place. I can just go to all mail it has you can go in and individually create rules much more easily
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:38.720]   um, so I like
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:40.720]   gmail a lot um
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:47.040]   But there are I do know a lot of people who loved inbox and are very sad that it's going away
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:50.000]   Despite the fact that they've added some of those features gmail
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:52.000]   I
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.680]   Gave up on gmail about a year ago and I just use uh, an i map but as as you said mike
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:00.560]   I'm terrible at email
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:03.520]   What did you mean when you said that?
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:09.200]   What I mean is it when when when people send you email you ignore it
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:14.800]   The chance that you're going to see it and reply within the next hour. Oh no
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:19.440]   Is not that is not going to happen. No, I mean that's not so it's um
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:26.720]   But I mean you must get just pounded with email and I get a lot of email. Yeah, I think because I haven't really opened my inbox
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:32.160]   You know, I mean by now. I don't get any email. I don't I don't really know
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:37.760]   Yeah, that's the I'm not going to do anymore. That's the google change log
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:44.880]   That's all there is. We're going to have to start a new google death watch is the new
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:53.280]   Is there anything else that we haven't covered that we should cover before we get our
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:56.400]   picks of the week in here
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:58.720]   Wow, really?
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:03.200]   I'll tell you what i'll do in that and then if you if i've skipped anything you really wanted to talk about
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:08.240]   You could bring it up. Otherwise your picks are next. I know you're waking you're ready for queso and mole
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:13.520]   I'm like I just I just uh, I am my husband. I'm like mole tonight
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:19.600]   Stacy isn't admitting it, but actually she calls this show the bs hour
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.200]   So
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:24.560]   No, this is the bs two to three hours. Yes. Yes. That's
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:27.200]   It's long long long
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:32.880]   Welcome to the bs hour episode 500
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:37.200]   Wanted to make it the beer and scotch hour. I know that's a different
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:44.320]   Are sure they brought to you by a thousand eyes, which is so inappropriately named. It should be a million eyes
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:52.160]   Thousand eyes is amazing. What an incredible company get an immediate unmatched view of all the networks and dependencies
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:55.680]   Let me let me step back
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:04.640]   Thousand I I have to explain that this is for people who live in the cloud if you have a business that uses the cloud for storage
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:08.240]   For delivery of content for apps
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:14.080]   If your stuff is in the cloud and nowadays I think most businesses have at least some stuff in the cloud
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:16.080]   you need
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:18.080]   thousand eyes because
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.480]   There's a reason why we draw the cloud is just this puffy little cloud up there
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:28.160]   It's a black box stuff goes in and you hope it comes out in a timely fashion
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:34.080]   But it often doesn't and it's very you know hard to see what's going on there in that puffy little cloud
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.480]   Unless you have thousand eyes
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:43.440]   With thousand eyes you can get an immediate unmatched view of all the networks and dependencies that impact your users digital experience
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:45.440]   Because it's awesome
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:52.880]   They they have eyes everywhere. There's thousands thousand eyes unique path visualization technology
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:55.520]   extends beyond any boundaries
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:00.000]   You can see understand and improve the experience for all your apps services and websites most people
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.880]   Most iD departments can basically most sensors
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:07.680]   Basically see what's on your network and as soon as it leaves your network, it's like well. I hope it gets there
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:11.920]   But thousand eyes has a massive array of vantage points
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:20.000]   Spanning both the public and the private internet cloud providers right down to the wifi in your local coffee shop
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.800]   It can see everything it's as if you've been looking through a smudged
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.840]   windshield it just
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:34.320]   Covered with mud and try and appear through it figure out what's going on and a squeegee just in it's crystal clear you can see it all
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:40.960]   Everybody who works in the cloud knows that there are times where you just go. I don't know what's going on
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:45.920]   And the boss comes and you say I know we're losing money boss. I I know
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:48.560]   the people aren't working or whatever
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:56.960]   And we're trying to figure it out, but we just can't see into that puffy little cloud now you can I can't tell you how valuable this is regain
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:03.120]   Control ensure the best possible digital experience for your employees for your customers for you
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:06.320]   Make sure you're in the right cloud
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:12.240]   That's another thing thousand eyes can tell you if the content you want to deliver should be in that cloud
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:19.360]   If you're connected to the right sass instance you can see issues before they impact your customers and employees with thousand eyes and they've have

[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:37.920]   Right

[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:31.440]   There's features on each that I like and the other is
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:36.880]   For caught. I don't know how to say it F-U-R-K-O-T
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:39.760]   For caught
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:41.200]   For caught
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.680]   Yeah, I don't know for that's about forget
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:48.080]   Miss the turns on your terms. Oh, I like this idea
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:53.760]   So what's neat there is you can actually tell it a lot of things like where you're at a where you're going
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:56.720]   But also like how much you want to drive when do you want to start?
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:01.200]   and it's it's a lot more detailed. So if you really want to like
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:05.280]   and then road trippers is really nice because
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:08.160]   It shows you like parks and things like that
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:13.680]   And I like both of them because you get like your total drive time you get like estimates
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:18.240]   I have to triple a and get a map with a magic marker on it for this
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:24.240]   Yeah, and like this this road trippers like estimate your gas costs and that sort of thing great
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:31.360]   So yeah, I was I was really excited. I think both of these are so far. I've experienced them
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:34.160]   as the free app. They're both high quality
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:40.720]   And I'm I mean, I haven't taken the road trip yet. Have you ever done a cross-country trip?
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:43.360]   No, I haven't the longest fun
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:47.280]   Yeah, I've driven to New Orleans a couple times and I've driven to
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:49.920]   Tallahassee
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:55.680]   Now I want to ask you why I'm like just fun
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:44:02.560]   Now this is going to be what a great mother daughter thing mother daughter and dog thing to do. I think this is great
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:06.480]   Yeah, so things like the giant ball of yarn and stuff like that, right?
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:08.480]   We're actually
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:12.880]   Focused on I think we're going to go see like the grand canyon. We're going to take some detours
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:15.760]   We're going to marfa first so austin amarfa
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:18.320]   and then possibly
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:20.480]   Somewhere in the middle then maybe the grand canyon
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:22.480]   And then
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:24.640]   We're going to drive through like the columbia river gorge
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:28.800]   I'm trying to convince myself that I want to go to the escoante national park in utah
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:31.280]   But that's also kind of like a lot
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:36.480]   There really isn't a whole lot to do in canesus except to go to caulkers city and see the world's largest ball of twine
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:43.280]   I'm just saying we're skipping canesus. We're skipping canesus is not on the agenda. Oh, come on. You know you want to see this
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:44.800]   Nope
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:50.240]   I think might you do a gastronomat adventure in caulkers city the twine experience
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:52.480]   a twine experience
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:55.440]   There's lots to see
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:02.240]   That sounds awesome stacey that sounds absolutely incredible
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:08.960]   Especially that app sounds great since the world's largest twine ball is pungent with a smell of moist twine decay
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:11.920]   Rose
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:15.680]   That's the review from roadside america.com
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:18.800]   Yeah, you don't have to go there. You can smell it from utah
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:26.400]   We went to um, we were in main and we did a roadside attraction. It was the world's largest chocolate moose and I will tell you
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:30.560]   It was pretty good. That's fun to see these. It's kind of tradition
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:35.120]   All right. Well, enjoy. I think that sounds like a great idea
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.920]   mr
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:39.920]   Michael elgin your pick of the week
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:45.200]   As you know, I'm obsessed with gans which are generative adversarial network
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:55.440]   Yes, I think this is the most promising technology for the future of fake everything we've ever come up with it's basically a
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:46:00.080]   machine learning technique that's been around for about four or five years
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:07.920]   Which can generate fake data can generate fake words fake images fake videos fake this fake that we're all familiar with deep fakes
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:15.040]   Those are generated with gans. So basically you throw a bunch of real data at this machine learning system
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:21.680]   One of them and there are two machine learning systems one takes the the real data and tries to
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:27.440]   Uh to imitate it with fake data lots and lots and lots of fake data throws are the other one
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:30.640]   Which is the discriminator which judges that data based on how
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:32.800]   good it is
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:35.040]   compared with the real sample and then
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:37.200]   the
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:44.480]   Uh, the original one goes back to the drawing board tries again does it better this time and both the discriminator and the generator
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:49.840]   Get better and better and better until you get fake data that looks completely real now
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:52.000]   We've seen that this person does not exist
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:47:00.000]   Uh before and then somebody came out with this cat does not exist. This is uh cats made with you know artificial cats made with
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:06.160]   This technology and now there's a website and this is my my obsession of the week
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:12.400]   Called this x does not exist. So somebody has started to curate all the goofy
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:17.120]   GAN related websites that people are throwing out there
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:22.720]   Um, this rental does not exist is one of them. It's a fake Airbnb listings
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:26.880]   Uh, this waifu does not exist. I'm not sure what a waifu is. I'm not really
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:30.800]   Uh, this startup does not exist. So they're creating those the startup
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:39.840]   Websites that we've all seen that all very similar. Oh, I gotta go to that wait a minute. This is again created here's here's one
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:46.720]   Premescent using ai in fashion and it's got a nice picture of a fox
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:53.840]   Meet the team of pre-mess it get to know the heads behind pre-messen or even better become a pre-messen
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:57.280]   Masana la four the cco
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:00.000]   Shelline claps the c o o
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.800]   Thuglass domain the ceo
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:05.440]   Premescent is more than just blockchain
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:10.160]   Funding calling and startup are just a few characteristics of pre-messent
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:14.000]   But we offer a lot more fear it fearless
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.880]   Eurynstably
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:19.600]   Premescent is like google but for fashion
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:28.720]   This is this is this is auto generated. This is brilliant. This is this is brilliant
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:37.760]   Oh, I think that over time this this site will be populated by lots and lots and lots of examples of some some of them better
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:41.840]   than others of again generated
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:50.720]   fake data and images and videos and everything and I think that'll be very healthy for us to pay attention and like see what is being produced
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:55.200]   So that we can dial down our well dial up our skepticism about
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:59.520]   the images and words and sites and everything that we're presented because
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:04.320]   The problem with this kind of thing is that you can you can when when you can create
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:07.360]   fake
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:14.400]   Anything at scale. Yeah, then and let me give you another example that we don't talk about because I wrote about how
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:17.360]   This technology could be used to crack security
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:22.320]   There there's a can that can actually crack fingerprint
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:27.040]   Readers the kind that you you have in your your smartphone. Here's how it works
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:30.320]   Basically these fingerprint scanners don't scan the whole fingerprint
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:36.160]   They scan little chunks of it and lots of little parts of it to see these patterns that are unique to each person
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:41.680]   However, there are some snippets of these fingerprints that are more common than others
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:44.000]   And so somebody use GANS to create
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.960]   thousands and thousands and thousands of
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:48.960]   fake
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:55.520]   fingerprint snippets that are most likely to pass as real snippets and then they're combined
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:01.760]   In all these different variations and so it's essentially a brute force attack on fingerprint readers where they throw
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:07.840]   Thousands of these snippets at until they get one to unlock the device and of course this can happen very quickly with
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:14.000]   You know fast computers. It's a brute force attack just like a password attack, but you can do it with fingerprints now
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:20.240]   Thanks for this technology. So there's lots and lots of ways that this general method can be used to
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:26.480]   Do things they're not supposed to be able to do they they they just have absolutely destroy captures
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:34.800]   Uh, and so which is ironic because the whole point of a capture is to prove you're human turns out machines are better at proving they're human than people
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:36.800]   Oh, of course they are
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:38.960]   Wow
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:42.240]   Anyway, this x does not exist. I love it. Check it out
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:48.000]   This was our 500th episode if you've been listening continuously
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:54.560]   Since episode one you've listened for 37 days seven hours 17 minutes and 52 seconds
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:51:01.440]   Time will spend I don't know about that, but it's better than two hours of bs. That's all I could say
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:04.160]   Thank you. That's your life. Yeah
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:09.760]   That's your life. Yes, this the hours spent on twig. Wow. That's a lot of hours
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:14.560]   Uh, thank you stacey higginbotham for spending about uh 20 days of that with us

[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:11.200]   You would not we are not in the location yet because it's okay pretty expensive, but
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:16.960]   uh, this is our this is apartment we rent when whenever we're in mexico city and uh, it's a it's a view of a
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:23.280]   Kind of an average street in a vaguely posh neighborhood. It's not bad. It's not exciting
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:28.720]   Yeah, but the but the the apartment itself is great and has as good Wi-Fi and all that kind of stuff. So that's awesome
[01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:32.320]   Yeah, it was great. Uh, thank you so much for joining us for mexico city. Thank you
