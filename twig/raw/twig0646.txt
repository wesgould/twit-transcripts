[00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.260]   the meta verse.
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.540]   Used to be the Facebook verse and now meta owns it.

[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.220]   Aunt Pruitt's here from Hands On Photography.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.220]   Hello Aunt.
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.220]   Hello Mr. LaPorte.
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.220]   How you be sir?
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.220]   I am great.
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.660]   I just drank a bunch of no-tropic energy stuff.
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.780]   So if I start to get strange, you'll start to start to be another Wednesday.
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.740]   Is that just another Wednesday?
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:37.380]   Also with us the Leonard Ta Perfessor for journalistic innovation at the Newmark.
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.740]   Oh, Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.740]   Hello Jeff.
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.740]   Hello.
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.740]   Good to see you.
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.100]   It was to you.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.980]   And Stacy, it was a little under the weather.
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.380]   We're giving her the day off.
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.380]   But good news.
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.740]   We got Mike Elgin in her place.
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.820]   He's back in the US.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.620]   Mikeelgin.substack.com, home of his newsletter.
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.620]   Hey Mike.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.620]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.500]   Are you going to do this standing up?
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   Yes.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.500]   Wow.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.220]   That is a physical humble brag.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.220]   Yeah.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.980]   I thought about doing that before.
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.300]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.460]   Get a nice spin.
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.140]   The truth is I spend so much time sitting.
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.540]   It's really almost dangerous.
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.940]   So any chance I get to stand up?
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.940]   That's great.
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.460]   I don't like to have a rear end just to use it.
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.380]   I like your attitude.
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.860]   We got these, you know, elevating tables.
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.380]   I guess the theory was that I could stand up and do this.
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.060]   But then we realized you were going up as your chair going down.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.180]   Well, the funny thing I also is as I get older, I'm going to blame the cushions and the chair
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.020]   becoming less resilient.
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.420]   But I think it's actually me shrinking.
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.140]   I'm starting to get dwarfed by this chair.
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.540]   I'm just getting tinier and tinier in the chair.
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.540]   Everybody says it's going to be me.
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.540]   And now it's time for twig.
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.020]   Ah, Leo, Leo, Leo, if I may, the may.
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.020]   Yes.
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.900]   In the old days, remember, we used to have unboxing.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.420]   Yeah, you got something?
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.420]   I have an unbagging.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.420]   Unbagging.
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.420]   Unbagging.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.260]   What you got in the bag?
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.780]   Caccio e Pepe Puffs from Trader Joe's.
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.060]   Did they send them to you?
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.060]   No, no, no, no.
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.580]   I've held on to them, though.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.580]   #sponsored.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.620]   No, you bought these with your real money.
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.100]   So this is my first try.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.100]   I could have opened them today's a go.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.540]   I said, no, I'm going to try them on the show.
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.540]   Because of first...
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.540]   Yes.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.300]   Just for background, Jeff loves the Caccio e Pepe reel for reel at Trader Joe's.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.300]   Is this anything like...
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.460]   Survey says?
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.460]   The Caccio e Pepe.
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.700]   And that's in the bag at Trader Joe's.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.340]   Judging from Jeff's moment.
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.340]   Jeff's moment.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.860]   It's a little odd, you got to hold up, but the aftertaste is wonderful.
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.860]   Aftertaste is wonderful.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.860]   That's good.
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.860]   So you have to get on the bags.
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.340]   So you have to get on the bags.
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.340]   The aftertaste.
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.820]   My wife went to buy them, and the nice lady she deals with all the time at Trader Joe's
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.940]   saw her reaching for them and said, "Oh no!"
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.740]   I thought, "I don't know this thing wrong with them, but they're going to go to this
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.740]   interest."
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.140]   And lady said, "Those are so addictive!"
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.140]   Uh oh.
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.580]   Oh God, he's going to crunch the whole show, isn't he?
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.700]   Oh, this will be great.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.220]   Somebody's saying the Taco Bell now has subscriptions.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.220]   That might be something you'd be interested in.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.220]   Yes they do.
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.220]   For tacos and for burritos.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.220]   They had a burrito-sus-rushing.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.220]   I'm in.
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.020]   It's like a taco a day or something.
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:37.060]   Yeah, the 30 days of tacos for 10 bucks, it's the Taco lovers pass.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.020]   Choose from one of seven select tacos.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.860]   But a taco at Taco Bell is like a 30 cent.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.860]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.100]   It's a taco lovers pass as in pass, as in a pass if I love tacos.
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.860]   They're so tiny, you only get like two ounces of meat on them.
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.100]   I wouldn't even use the word meat for whatever that is.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.460]   I say air quotes.
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.380]   Well, you could tell how much it's worth 30 days for $10.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.180]   It's a mess.
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.180]   Okay, Taco Bell is the master though of marketing, aren't they?
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.020]   They're kind of amazing.
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.820]   But they used to be, you know, I've loved them for years and years and years and years.
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.100]   People made fun of me and now it's hip.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.100]   Yeah, it is.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.540]   Well, thanks to marketing.
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.740]   It's hip like Mentos got hip.
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.580]   Thanks to marketing.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.100]   In the early days of MTV, I know this because the guy who was our program director at Tech
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:40.460]   TV used to was a programmer at MTV and his he said, Mentos before MTV was grandma's thing.
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.620]   It was the thing you'd get in the cut glass crystal when you went to grandma's house,
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.340]   the candy no one wanted.
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.740]   He said, but then they started advertising on MTV, the fresh maker.
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.740]   That's right.
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.860]   And it became suddenly hip.
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.900]   So it's really it's just marketing, you know, and now by the way, it's back to grandma's
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.100]   except grandma watched MTV.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:08.100]   It goes around.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.460]   Grandma's never end.
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.300]   I am happy to tell you a proud report.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:21.260]   According to Mike Elgin in the computer world.com, you can safely ignore web three.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.980]   Oh, appreciate you got to tell the rest of the web.
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:25.980]   Yeah.
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:31.580]   It's funny, we had on Sunday, we had we would have been our futurists panel.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.100]   We had a science fiction author.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.900]   We had Kevin Rose.
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.140]   Everybody got sick.
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.500]   So it ended up just being a priest and Amy Webb who's an actual free futurist.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.900]   I sort of thought it was like, well, we got the medieval point of view and we got the
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.900]   future.
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:50.060]   But one of the very first things we talked extensively about is this notion of web three.
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.500]   Maybe Mike, because you wrote this article, you can explain what web three is.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:03.740]   Well, OK, so web three is the idea that the next version of the web is going to be based
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:11.220]   on the blockchain tokenization and distributed decentralized.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.580]   Yeah, decentralized, radically decentralized.
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:20.580]   Interestingly, you'll notice that the mission of the web three decentralization powered
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:26.140]   the people instead of the corporations, the governments, this was the mission of what
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.700]   formerly called the internet.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:35.220]   This is the techno utopian hippies that created TCP/IP and all the protocols that are current
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.380]   internet and later web would be built out of.
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:47.220]   That was their intent to remember John Perry Barlow's manifesto where he said, we won't
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.660]   be subject to governments, we won't be controlled by anyone.
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:56.660]   Well, that turned out to not work out so well because as the web three enthusiasts will
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:04.460]   tell you, web two, the current web where content creators have to deal with these gigantic
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.820]   corporations that really have all the keys and control everything.
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:16.980]   Well, the problem with this whole thing, the idea of rebuilding the web based on NFTs, blockchain,
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:23.460]   cryptocurrency, etc, etc, is that it's fundamentally incompatible with human nature.
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.140]   So this is the way the nature of technology but go on.
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.940]   And the nature of business.
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.060]   Exactly, Jeff.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:38.020]   And this was where Jack Dorsey chimed in and basically said that, look, because Jack Dorsey
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:43.420]   is in fact committed to decentralized communication, which is why they're working on what is it
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.420]   called, Jeff?
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.420]   We're working on the...
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.420]   Luska.
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.900]   Luska, right, which is actually a decentralized project.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:59.300]   His point is that the problem with the vision of the utopian web three crowd is that everybody
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:04.020]   wants to invest in it because they want to make money, which means they have these corporations
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:09.140]   that want to grow and profit heavily involved heavily in control because that's where the
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.620]   money is coming from.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.860]   And so as he said, the web three will never escape their incentives.
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:20.620]   Their incentives are to use their power that they have from their investment to direct the
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:26.220]   nature of these products to profit themselves.
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:31.180]   This is in direct contradiction to the notion of this democratic, the people in charge, the
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.340]   crowd is in charge kind of ethos.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.500]   So it doesn't really work.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.820]   And I think Jack Dorsey had a great point in that regard.
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.220]   The other two ways that it doesn't work is that the giant tech corporations that in fact
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.740]   do control many of the services that we use aren't going to go along.
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.820]   And the public is not going to go along because it's all too complicated.
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.980]   People don't want...
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:58.620]   And this sort of touches on what Jeff wrote about brilliantly, I might add, in his Buzz
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:04.020]   Machine piece, which is that human nature doesn't really...
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.420]   Content creators want to create content.
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.060]   They don't want to be mucking around with running their own servers with doing all this
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.060]   stuff.
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.260]   They're not going to go along with this.
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.620]   And so it's kind of a non-starter.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:19.420]   But the problem, the beef I have with the journalism around this and the same...
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:26.620]   Something similar is happening with the metaverse idea is that every cryptocurrency thing, every
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.180]   blockchain thing, every tokenized thing is called web three.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.300]   Well, it doesn't really mean anything if we're just talking about individual applications
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.860]   running on the web too.
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.500]   Web three is how Taco Bell got cools marketing.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.260]   Yeah, it's the 5G of the internet.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.260]   It's just...
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.260]   For 5G.
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.260]   But 5G is...
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.300]   I could argue 5G is actually something.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.420]   We will actually connect over 5G.
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.540]   Whereas the idea that it's a very different proposition to have what we have now, which
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.500]   is some cryptocurrency stuff, some blockchain chain stuff.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.820]   We have NFTs, services around those things.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.140]   We have Bitcoin wallets.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.780]   We have all that stuff.
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:10.300]   There's a big difference between that, which is inevitable, and all that stuff will grow
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:15.380]   as well, and having the internet be based on that sort of thing.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:19.060]   That's a part that's not going to happen, ever.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:23.460]   And if that isn't the web three, and some people, nobody really fully agrees on what
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:29.540]   this is, but if that isn't the web three, then it's just a word that means all that
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.500]   stuff that the Bitcoin bros love.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.500]   Jack's tweet is the short version, which is, "You don't own web three.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:41.100]   The VCs and their limited partners do it will never escape their incentives.
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.180]   It's ultimately a centralized entity with a different label.
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.420]   Know what you're getting into."
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:51.220]   And of course, he was immediately blocked by Mark Andreessen.
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.220]   Mark Andreessen.
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:57.500]   Because Mark Andreessen and Andreessen Horowitz are basically the chief proponents of web
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.500]   three.
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.300]   It's kind of a portfolio deal for them.
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:08.260]   I think maybe the long version of this, which is kind of technical, but I think worth reading
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.140]   is Moxie Marlon Spike's blog post at Moxie.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.140]   Oh, it's brilliant.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.660]   The guy that resigned.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.660]   Yeah, he's a former CEO of Signal.
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.980]   He invented Signal and his...
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:19.980]   Two days ago.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.700]   Yeah, has passed it on, which is completely appropriate.
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.180]   We'll talk about that in a bit.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.860]   But he makes, I think I'll see if I can summarize this.
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:32.900]   He makes the point that one, and this is really important, people do not want to run their
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.620]   own servers.
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.420]   And they never will.
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:42.020]   I happen to run my own server, but I understand why nobody with any idea of scaling or anything
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.740]   is going to run their own even big companies run their servers on Amazon.
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.260]   That's why Amazon is so successful.
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.380]   So that's problem number one is you can't decentralize something that's by its very
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.380]   nature centralized.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.500]   You're not going to get people to run their own servers.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:03.020]   He also points out, and this is a deeper insight but actually really good, that this is going
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.020]   to be a little hard to understand.
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.180]   A protocol moves more slowly than a platform.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:13.100]   And to give an example that really is a germane to our audience, IRC is a platform.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.860]   It's been around for 30 plus years.
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:23.100]   And he says people are still trying to standardize sharing a video reliably over IRC.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:28.860]   Meanwhile, Slack lets you create that, but create a custom reaction emoji based on your
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.460]   face because it's a platform, not a company.
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.420]   It's a company that is controlled.
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.500]   Yes, it's controlled and that's the speed.
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.980]   So he says if something's truly decentralized, it becomes very difficult to change and often
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.980]   remains stuck in time.
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.180]   This is a brilliant way to put it.
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.980]   I thought that was the best of the post.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.540]   Yeah, I think a really great insight.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:57.220]   And once you understand that, you realize why it's hard to, hold on just a sec, I'll
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.420]   get to you in a second.
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:04.340]   It's hard to propose a decentralized web because nobody's going to run their own servers.
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.980]   And it's not going to move along very quickly because the platforms are just going to leap
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:08.980]   from it.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.740]   He also talks about kind of peripherally making an NFT.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.340]   He makes an NFT, I'll tell you how this ties in in a second, but he makes an NFT that
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.260]   looks different depending on where you look at it.
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.300]   So the first one is on OpenSea.
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.300]   The second view, same NFT is un-rareable.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:31.020]   And if you do it in your wallet, you get a poop emoji.
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:36.620]   And the punchline of all this is that when you buy an NFT, what you actually buy, what's
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.220]   registered on the blockchain, is a URL.
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.220]   Is a link.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.220]   So if somebody's on the phone.
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.940]   And furthermore, so he's able to change this because he can change it depending on where
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:47.940]   you come to it.
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:53.700]   But then the punchline on this one is OpenSea blocked it because they said, well, you violated
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.540]   terms of service in some vague way.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.220]   And as soon as it's blocked on OpenSea, which is one platform that is very popular
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:07.260]   for NFTs, none of those versions of it got seen because it turns out crypto wallets don't
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:08.260]   do the rendering.
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.260]   Nothing does the rendering.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.460]   They all use OpenSea's API to find out what's in the NFT.
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.340]   Centralization strikes again.
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.820]   Completely centralized.
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.060]   And if OpenSea blocks it, it's gone.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:25.100]   Which really is I think problematic for this whole notion.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.540]   So I'm sorry.
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.780]   So then we got to pop the stack in order.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.300]   So this is a this is a LIFO stack.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.740]   I think I owe you a comment first, Ant-Pruett.
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.740]   Go ahead.
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.860]   Well, there's two things.
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:47.300]   Has anyone even considered where the people running the infrastructure stands on all of
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.300]   this?
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:55.420]   We move to say this whole web 3 decentralized that stuff still has to run on top of infrastructure
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.140]   that's going to be controlled by big companies?
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.820]   What are their thoughts?
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.820]   Those people are the ones promoting this.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.020]   I like entry snorowets.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.020]   Okay.
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.020]   And you know why?
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.020]   Because they're going to make money.
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.860]   Who makes money in NFTs?
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:09.860]   People like OpenSea.
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.220]   Things who mint it.
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.180]   Not the people so much selling it.
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.180]   Okay now.
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.180]   And then also.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.180]   Okay.
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.180]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.180]   You're not fully popped.
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.180]   Go ahead.
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:24.980]   With the thing with OpenSea block in it, that sort of reminded me of Apple Podcasts and
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:30.060]   how Apple Podcasts seems to be the end all be off of the podcast industries.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:35.020]   When you go and look up a certain podcast application or whatever, they're usually pulling
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:42.140]   from Apple's database instead of going to look at the actual creators source.
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.140]   Of course.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.460]   And that's still sort of centralized unfortunately.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.460]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.460]   Okay.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:54.540]   I popped the stack and now it's Mike Elgin next.
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:59.620]   So it feels to me like, and you've mentioned the idea that cryptocurrency is a kind of
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.620]   a.
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.620]   Ponzi scheme.
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.900]   Ponzi scheme or pyramid scheme, whatever.
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:10.180]   And it seems to me that the people who are investing in this sort of thing want massive
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:15.260]   universal buy in because that's very profitable in general.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.620]   So they've got this sort of double thing sort of self-fulfilling kind of language thing
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:25.060]   going where they say, will they make the claim that web three is all this stuff that I'm
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.700]   invested in.
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.780]   And that's the future of the web.
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:35.780]   And so ordinary consumers of technology news will get the sense from the incredible hype
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:39.860]   around this concept that web three is the future.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.820]   So I better start investing in all these startups.
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.580]   And it just seems like a kind of a.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.620]   It seems like a grand marketing scheme similar to the metaverse thing.
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.100]   And I don't know if we want to talk about that later, but it seems like a grand marketing
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:19:00.380]   scheme to legitimize something that is really that a certain minority of people are super
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.260]   passionate about and the vast majority couldn't care less.
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.260]   They don't understand it.
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.780]   They don't care, et cetera.
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:11.460]   And they're trying to get the massive sort of the majority of people to just go along
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:18.140]   with it to invest in it to make the world safe for this sort of thing for their own profit.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:23.020]   I think it's always easier to market something that doesn't exist.
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.020]   Yes.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.020]   It's the Vanu.
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.620]   It's the Vanu White principle.
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:33.260]   When somebody asked Peter Jennings why everybody liked him, he says, "The Vanu White principle."
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.900]   Javanan never says anything.
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:41.740]   So you project upon her your at the attributes you like, you assume that she's like you.
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.780]   And I think that that's the same thing with this marketing.
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:48.300]   You assume it's what you want because it isn't anything.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:53.820]   The best paragraph in your column, Mike, is the two biggest buzzwords in tech right now.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:59.180]   The metaverse and Web3 describe platforms that don't exist aren't expected to exist
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:04.140]   even by boosters for a decade at least and probably will never exist.
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:08.980]   Of the top 100 concerns for tech pros, Web3 is 101.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.580]   All right, popping the stack, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:20.900]   So then I read, I got it, Moxie's piece is really smart, but it's difficult to get through
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:21.900]   it.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.380]   I was wondering whether to assign it to students.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:27.260]   It's very dense with ideas and technology.
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.140]   So I read it a couple times hoping I would get it.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:35.300]   Then Matt Mullenweg, who I admire greatly, founder of WordPress, tweeted this.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.300]   Also very smart, very smart.
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.300]   Very smart.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.300]   Very smart.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.300]   Yeah.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.540]   I don't know about it last week, but there was a really good profile of him in protocol.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:44.540]   Yes.
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.380]   I would highly recommend.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:52.980]   So Matt said, people seem to be redefining Web2.0 as Facebook, etc., that own data.
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:58.260]   Web2.0 at the time was platforms like WordPress, ODO, Six-A-Part, Flickr, Technorati, and Delicious
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.180]   that had open data and interoperate.
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:07.980]   So I was thinking about this, and then I started riffing on it on Twitter that became a post
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:17.700]   that said that I think that we make a mistake here in thinking that Web1, 2, 3 is a progression.
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.860]   Second, we make a mistake in thinking that we're at Web2 or 3 anyway.
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:30.500]   We're at Web.0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, or 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, and Unilish Dick Gutenberg.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.500]   It's early days.
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.980]   14, 75, you've heard that spiel before.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.140]   But same true with the Web.
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.140]   It's very, very early.
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.540]   We don't know what it is yet.
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.820]   It's not as like we've graduated from something.
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:45.020]   The problem with periodization, the problem with thinking that the dark ages were there
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:48.260]   and they were worthless and the Renaissance was a good thing.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:53.180]   It's the same problem with saying, "Well, Web2.0 should be discarded and Web1.0 should
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.220]   be discarded because now we're Web3.0."
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.220]   No, we're not.
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.180]   And what Matt said here, it struck me, is there's things to learn.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:04.980]   And in a way, what Moxie asks for at the end of his wonderful piece, in a way Matt and
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.620]   open source answer the questions.
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:15.860]   Because I remember when the Polaris VC, who called me when they were thinking about investing
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.940]   in WordPress and they did, they said, "Is it nuts?
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.940]   He's going to be open source.
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.140]   Why does that work?"
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:26.220]   And I said, "He's already beat movable type because he's put something out there that
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:31.020]   because it's open source spreads widely, how much of the web is he now serve and gets
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.260]   updated.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:37.980]   And so in a sense, we've seen Web3.0, it was Web1.0, it was called open source.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:38.980]   Right.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:48.220]   With a similar mission of power to the people and the crowd and also to Wikipedia for that
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:54.060]   matter, interested, passionate people will have a bigger influence than the casual user,
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:58.940]   etc, etc, to build this thing without top down policy missing.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.740]   Yes, it's a creators tool, right, exactly.
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.740]   Right.
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:10.700]   But one of the differences though is that the whole open source phenomenon was so much
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.900]   less naive than the Web3 phenomenon.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:23.340]   For example, one of the big benefits of blockchains is that the ledger is permanent and public.
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:27.980]   The greatest doxing tool ever created.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:33.620]   You can make a purchase of some of those NFTs and as part of your notes, you can dox somebody
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.980]   to smithereens and nobody could ever remove that information.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.340]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.340]   Ever.
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.060]   Yeah, there's a block chain is permanent.
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.060]   Yeah.
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.060]   Right.
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.940]   Another one is like, "Oh, we'll use the blockchain to cure fake news.
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:49.700]   What we'll do is we'll make sure that every source of content is registered on the blockchain
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.220]   and then we'll know exactly where it comes from."
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:55.500]   Well, that doesn't address fake news at all because the problem with fake news is that
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.020]   is not that people are misled about where it comes from, is that they think the New
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:04.340]   York Times and the Atlantic are fake news and they think everything on 4chan is real.
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.340]   That's the problem.
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.260]   Blockchain isn't going to solve that at all.
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:12.380]   So there are no solutions to the problems of moderation.
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:19.660]   Like everybody likes to dump all of our Facebook for moderation, but either they do something
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.420]   about hate speech or when they don't, we get to yell at Facebook.
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.940]   Either way, that's better than just hate speech running rampant and somehow we're kind of
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:32.180]   in charge of it as a group.
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:38.460]   Nobody has articulated how that's supposed to work.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:43.700]   Other than we're all blockchain enthusiasts and so we're all people of goodwill, which
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:48.740]   is essentially how the original internet was supposed to, they didn't foresee spam, they
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:53.300]   didn't foresee any of this stuff because they thought, "Wow, once information is free,
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.540]   then everybody will be on their best behavior."
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:03.380]   You talked about marketing previously and I think it makes perfect sense that they would
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:08.940]   be able to capitalize on it because of this being a pandemic and where people are emotionally
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:16.020]   and socially these days with the whole resignation and wanting to just take more control of things
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:20.100]   for themselves instead of depending on their jobs and whatnot.
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:26.860]   Then there's also the group that say, "Man, I remember Bitcoin up 10 years ago and if
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.660]   I had just put $10 in it back then, I would be rich and blah, blah, blah, blah."
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:38.740]   I think they're going to just continue to market to that group and say, "Hey, you don't
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.220]   want to miss out because you missed out on Bitcoin back in the days.
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:47.420]   Don't miss out on Web 3 and just stick with this even though it doesn't exist, just stick
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.420]   with this."
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:55.500]   I remember talking to the Secret Service once about scams like the Nigerian Prince scam.
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.500]   Oh yeah.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.060]   There are really no new con games.
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:02.980]   The internet has just taken them off the street and put them on the internet and this
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:10.580]   does strike me a little bit as, "Watch your wallet because, "Oh, this is the hot new exciting
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.580]   thing."
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.620]   Now, it's just watch your Bitcoin wallet.
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:18.900]   Watch your, yeah, well, I wish I could.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.940]   Best place it could be is locked up right now.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:21.940]   I'm telling you.
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.140]   Best thing.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:28.860]   You mentioned Moxie Marlin Spike who has the greatest name in technology, probably not
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.460]   his real name, stepping down at Signal.
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:37.020]   I don't know if that's anything we should draw any conclusion from that in his post.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:45.580]   He said, "Signal, which he invented is growing, is doing well.
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:49.660]   Every day, he says, "I'm struck by how boundless signal's potential looks and I want to bring
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.620]   in someone with fresh energy and commitment to make the most of that."
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.900]   That's a normal transition.
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:27:01.100]   I don't think there's any reason to think that that means anything for Signal.
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.100]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.100]   Yeah.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.100]   It was unsustainable.
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.100]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.100]   He's great.
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:10.660]   I hope he works on something else, new and exciting and different.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:15.540]   What did you think about Casey Newton's point about Signal and untraceable financial contributions?
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:18.980]   A, what do you think about that and security and the world?
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.540]   And B, did that have anything to do with Moxie's departure?
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:25.420]   I don't think that's what kind of some people, and even in my mind, I kind of thought, "Well,
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:30.500]   because Signal's been getting into crypto and they want to have transactions over Signal."
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:35.580]   But most messengers, Facebook messenger, Apple's messenger, Android messages, most
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:39.940]   messengers have financial transactions.
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:49.900]   The difference is Signal is considering adding its own mobile coin, which is kind of anonymous.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:53.700]   It's built on the stellar blockchain.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:28:02.220]   It's completely fair for Casey to say, "Look, ransomware is taken off because of Bitcoin.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:08.180]   When ransomware first started, they would say go down to the 7/11 and buy some money
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:11.180]   cards and mail them to this post office box.
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:16.060]   It wasn't a very good system and they didn't do very well until Bitcoin became well enough.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:21.460]   And in fact, even then, when the first Bitcoin ransomware came along, they had a whole pages
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:26.220]   of description of how to set up a wallet, put money in the wallet, send us the Bitcoin.
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:30.300]   Now though, everybody kind of knows Bitcoin, and so it's really been good for ransomware.
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.260]   So that's, Casey's point is well taken.
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.580]   But they've been saying that since PGP came out.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:40.380]   I remember Phil Zummerman who invented PGP said, "I interviewed him on triangulation."
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.980]   I said, "Well, what do you say to people that say terrorists can use encryption?"
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:48.300]   He said, "Well, yes, that's right."
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.300]   But you use telephones?
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.180]   Yeah, that's life.
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:56.860]   It doesn't mean you shouldn't have something just because it could be misused.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:02.940]   It can also have a whispering conversation in the parking lot that people are going to
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.100]   have private conversations.
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:11.180]   And the risk to people who are trying to protect themselves and weren't doing anything
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:20.380]   terroristic is much higher than the damage done by terrorists who will...
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:25.900]   Anyone who's a criminal or a serious terrorist or whatever, they're going to know when they're
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.820]   being spied upon for the most part, and they're going to find ways to communicate without
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:30.820]   anybody knowing.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:35.020]   And we do have a very private form of financial transaction.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.140]   It's known as cash.
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.780]   And it's completely private.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:45.860]   If I give you a million dollars in unmarked bills, the problem is because of bank reporting
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.540]   laws, it's getting harder and harder.
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.740]   So government is kind of closing in on that.
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:55.300]   I think the primary reason for the crypto existence of cryptos.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:00.020]   Because people want that privacy the cash gives them, but it's getting harder and harder.
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:04.060]   Financial markets are moving towards credit cards and other easily traceable products,
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:08.020]   bank reporting requirements, et cetera, make cash less anonymous.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:13.740]   But we did not use cash because it could potentially allowed for unmarked bills and
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:14.740]   bags.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:15.740]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:20.660]   And we have to acknowledge what a great thing credit cards are.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:25.180]   Because if somebody somehow gets a hold of your credentials and they ring up, they go
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:29.780]   buy a Ferrari, you don't have to pay for that Ferrari.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:30.780]   Right.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:34.060]   Because you're protected through the credit card system and through laws that are so
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.500]   a lot of people say, but I want the privacy.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.260]   I want to be able to buy stuff without being tracked by Google.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.420]   And I understand that.
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.420]   But I can't get ready.
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:45.420]   Get ready.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.340]   There is a touch to push the ball panic to that.
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:54.820]   We're here rather than saying, where is the harm or what could go wrong and why don't
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.820]   I want this?
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.420]   It's just privacy, Google bad.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.420]   The moral panic button is broke.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.420]   Oh, there you go.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.900]   Oh, we saw as a black screen.
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:10.020]   Mr. Jeremy B was just really quick.
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:13.820]   You need a longer loop if we're going to keep this up.
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.980]   Well, I can't think really.
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.300]   My point is there's downsides to everything.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.300]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.300]   And there's upsides.
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.300]   Yeah.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.300]   Well, signal doing crypto.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.300]   Oh bad because bad guys could use it.
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.780]   You know, I don't.
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.380]   I mean, cash, bad guys can use cash.
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.380]   Bad.
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.700]   Let's get rid of cash.
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:41.020]   He does point out the DM, which is the Facebook created cryptocurrency has committed to following
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.020]   anti money laundering laws.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.860]   How?
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:50.900]   Well, this is the problem I have means report everything.
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:51.900]   Right?
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:56.700]   You report all transactions and you set up a system where there are no anonymous transactions.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.700]   Well, I don't know.
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:02.580]   Facebook is so eager to do whatever government would tell them to do to take them off the
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.940]   hook for what they don't do.
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:05.940]   Yeah.
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:06.940]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:07.940]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.580]   Facebook is the last person that's going to take a stand on the, you know, die on that
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.580]   hill.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.100]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:18.980]   And by the way, this is, this is the, this is the commitment they made in the early development
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:23.420]   of the Libra network, its members are committed to working with authorities to shape a regulatory
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:28.060]   environment that encourages technological innovation while maintaining the highest standards
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.500]   of consumer protection.
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:37.540]   I mean, it's not, it's not like, okay, here's what we're going to do.
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.220]   And they, by the way, they say as with any currency or financial infrastructure, bad
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:46.300]   actors will try to exploit the network when the network is open and accessible to everyone
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:51.580]   with internet access, the network's main endpoints will need to follow applicable laws and regulations
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:54.180]   and collaborate with law enforcement.
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:58.860]   And in turn, in addition, transactions on the blockchain will be in clear text like many
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:32:59.860]   other blockchains.
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:04.180]   So it's possible for third parties to do analysis to detect and penalize fraud.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.860]   Again, they're saying, yeah, well, you know, law enforcement comes to us, we'll work with
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:08.860]   them.
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.620]   And you know, people, Bitcoin isn't anonymous.
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.300]   You can see every transaction.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.420]   What's anonymous is your wallet number.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:19.020]   You know, Facebook says that they'll work with law enforcement, but who's law enforcement?
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.020]   Right.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.220]   You know, North Korea's China's Russia's.
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:29.260]   It's the typical bull, Pucky, you know, boilerplate that it's not easy being Facebook.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.460]   Yeah, I feel bad for them.
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.740]   Yeah, of course.
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:33.740]   Facebook.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:45.380]   Now, the FTC, which has been trying to get Facebook to divest WhatsApp and install their
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.980]   Instagram can go ahead.
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:53.660]   US district judge, James Bozberg wrote that an amended complaint, the agency filed in
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:58.220]   August, offered more robust and detailed evidence to suggest Facebook has an alleged
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.620]   monopoly.
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:08.740]   He actually started his, his completing with second time lucky.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:14.940]   No, no, lucky is associated with the with the VR product.
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:17.460]   Yes, Palmer, Palmer lucky.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:24.220]   He had thrown out the original antitrust complaint saying you didn't even say they're a monopoly.
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:27.580]   So apparently this time it's better.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.820]   And yeah, you can use the M word.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:35.620]   So there's some thinking that maybe the judge is giving them the green light to try to break
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:43.020]   up or at least force Facebook to divest Instagram and WhatsApp.
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.740]   All the judges decision, this is from Washington Post acknowledges the agency has overcome some
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:50.140]   of the shortcomings of the initial suit.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:54.940]   Judge Bozberg signaled it may be challenging for the FTC to ultimately prove Facebook is
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.460]   a monopoly.
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:00.820]   Quote, it's anyone's guess whether the agency will prevail.
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.380]   Who knows?
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.180]   Who knows?
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:09.620]   Oh, though the agency, this is a quote may well face a tall task down the road improving
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.980]   its allegations.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:16.660]   The court believes it at least now has cleared the pleading bar and may proceed to discovery.
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.780]   So I'm sure Facebook is not thrilled about this.
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:26.340]   You know, ironically, it feels to me in Europe that Facebook is an absolute and total monopoly.
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.820]   Less on the US.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:34.380]   Every one I know in Europe, all my European friends literally use Instagram, Facebook
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:38.260]   and WhatsApp and nothing else unless they own a business, in which case they might have
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.260]   a website.
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:45.460]   Beyond that, a huge number of people in Europe and probably elsewhere in the world use only
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.900]   Facebook products to use the internet.
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:52.900]   It's astonishing how you install when we got to Oaxaca, I had to install WhatsApp so I
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.700]   could text you in a mirror.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:55.700]   Yes.
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.700]   That's right.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.580]   Well, so you can text a mirror.
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:59.580]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.580]   I don't use WhatsApp.
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:01.580]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:05.180]   She's the only person in my WhatsApp book.
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:10.380]   But no, clearly, certainly WhatsApp has a monopoly in many nations worldwide.
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.380]   Yes.
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.300]   Not so much in the US.
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.940]   And you know, I think in, I don't know if Facebook has a monopoly or in the US, I don't
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.060]   know what the competition is for Facebook.
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.580]   That's part of the problem is Twitter competition.
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:23.580]   I don't know.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.180]   I mean, what's the competition for Facebook?
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:30.140]   But I think I talk to people all the time and they even say it in an apologetic tone
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.540]   and say, well, I do have a Facebook account.
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:33.540]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.540]   That doesn't matter.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:37.300]   That's how you keep up with your, that's how you keep up with your family.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.340]   And that alone is not a monopoly.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.820]   It's one of many, many things we use.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:44.780]   It's, it's, and it's, that's the question.
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.780]   What's the competition for Facebook?
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.380]   Is it a postal letter?
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.740]   Is it, I mean, that's the question.
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.740]   Right.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:53.740]   A monopoly in what realm?
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:54.740]   Yeah.
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.740]   It's a phone call competition.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.640]   What in what realm?
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.060]   There isn't anything else like Facebook.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.780]   Yeah, not yet.
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:01.780]   Linked in?
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:02.780]   No.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:07.420]   Uh, friendster's gone, friend feed's gone.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:10.140]   My space is around, but it's not a competition.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:14.260]   But you mentioned friendster wasn't friendster purchased by Facebook and then killed.
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.260]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.260]   Okay.
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.260]   Well, that's why it's gone.
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.220]   But yeah, well, no, it was already right.
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.220]   It wasn't doing that.
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.620]   It was, it was a little peaked already.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.620]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:28.300]   My space is an eel dash that imagine though, if, if, if friendster had one or friend feed
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.300]   had one.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.300]   Friend feed was great.
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.900]   I really liked friend feed was great.
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:32.900]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.980]   That was the Google plus before Google plus.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:38.540]   Um, but I don't think there's, don't make Mike sad.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.540]   I know.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.380]   I brought it up.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.380]   It is, you know what?
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.380]   God damn Google.
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.380]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:49.900]   I apologize to all the Christians out there, but I do want God to actually damn Google.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.700]   I, I, I apparently they already have.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.180]   You know?
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:59.980]   But honestly, what haven't they destroyed?
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:01.780]   Look at the messaging mess.
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.140]   And then they, and now Hiroshi Lockheimer has a temerity.
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.540]   We still have Gmail.
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.540]   We still have Gmail.
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:08.540]   We still have Gmail.
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.540]   We still have Gmail.
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.540]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.540]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.540]   Search.
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.540]   And search still works.
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.740]   But there have been reports that's not that good anymore either.
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.740]   I just saw that.
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:18.740]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:19.740]   I haven't, I don't know if I agree with that.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.340]   But back to the messaging thing.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:26.980]   Um, yeah, that was a, so, uh, uh, uh, Ron, Ron Amadio in the ours technique.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:27.980]   Yeah.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:28.980]   Road.
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.740]   It's one of those things where it's like, why didn't I write that?
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:31.740]   It was a great piece.
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.220]   Oh, so good.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:37.620]   But he basically points out, first he lays out the case about how Google is complaining
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.620]   that I message is too powerful that they use bullying.
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:46.860]   They actually Google accused Apple of bullying by making people who use Android devices green
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:47.860]   instead of blue.
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:48.860]   Oh, dare they.
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.860]   But this is taking off on the Wall Street Journal article, which because there was nothing
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:57.060]   else to write about, the journal suddenly discovered that people who are using the Android
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:02.060]   messenger, uh, feel left out of Apple messages conversations.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:07.900]   But after, but after laying out the case that Google is making against Apple, Ron just
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:14.660]   eviscerates them by pointing out that since, um, Apple launched iMessage in 2011, same year
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:19.340]   they launched Google plus, by the way, Google launched Google plus Google has launched 13
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.340]   messaging.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.820]   I think we've used them all.
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:28.100]   She's the only person I ever talked on Aloe with was you, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.660]   I know, but that's the only person I ever talked to.
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.460]   Remember, Aloe, where I'm the cloud is our conversation.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.460]   Oh, this is Bob.
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.460]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.460]   I think it's pretty.
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:42.380]   Ron's headline after ruining Android messaging, Google says iMessage is too powerful.
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.420]   Please stop kicking our butts so badly.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:50.620]   Google failed to compete with iMessage for years and now wants Apple to play nice.
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:56.420]   How many 13 like, 13 that they've launched in total, they've killed a bunch of them,
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:02.020]   obviously, because it's Google, but now even today they have eight and they're even incompatible
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.020]   with each other.
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:04.020]   She's.
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:08.100]   So today they have eight messaging solutions, but imagine theater of the mind.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:13.860]   Imagine if you will, ladies and gentlemen, if after seeing Apple launch iMessage in 2011,
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:20.060]   Google launched, uh, you know, Google messages, uh, in 2000, let's call it 2012 and said this
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:23.900]   is the only messaging platform we will ever support.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.620]   It's on real across the platform on everything.
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:28.260]   It supports all the bells and whistles.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.260]   You can make phone calls.
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.260]   You can do this.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.260]   You can do that.
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.260]   You can have it on an iPhone.
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.300]   You can have it on an Android phone.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.260]   They would completely dominate this space if they had done that, right?
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.860]   Because because iMessage has always been primarily for Apple users.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:41.860]   Yes.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:42.860]   Right.
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:43.860]   They could have made a cross platform.
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.860]   They could have had the WhatsApp.
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:46.860]   Yeah.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:47.860]   It would have been like WhatsApp.
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:48.860]   Yeah.
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:55.020]   They, they are so disorganized and visionless, uh, that they just couldn't do that.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.020]   So we're on.
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.860]   Also points out, because what is it?
[00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.060]   We've talked about this at Google saying, well, everybody should just use RCS.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:05.060]   If Apple would only add RCS to iMessage, we'd be happy.
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:10.420]   He says, even if Google could magically roll out RCS, rich community, rich communication
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:15.460]   messaging standard, rich communication standard, it's a poor standard to build a messaging
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.620]   platform on because it's dependent on a carrier phone barriers.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.100]   It's anti-internet.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:27.300]   It can't natively work on web pages, PCs, smart watches and tablets because those things
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.300]   don't have SIM cards.
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.380]   They don't have phone numbers.
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.260]   The carrier's designed RCS.
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:36.020]   So RCS puts your carrier bill at the center of your online identity, even when free identification
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:39.380]   methods like email exist and work on more devices.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:44.540]   Google is just promoting carrier lock-in as a solution to Apple lock-in.
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.340]   Unfortunately, I have to agree with them on that.
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:55.620]   Yeah, but the solution as I intimated a minute ago is for them to have an alternative that
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.260]   isn't lock-in, to have something like WhatsApp, but from Google.
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.180]   They could have put it everywhere.
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.780]   This is what they do with Chrome.
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.380]   Chrome has been hugely successful.
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.300]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:10.980]   Just make it free, make it available, Google benefits because people use it.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.980]   And just have one.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:12.980]   See the earlier discussion of WordPress.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.060]   Step one, yeah.
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:18.140]   Yeah, Google is only to only Google.
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.300]   Hangouts would have worked.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.300]   They were right.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.300]   Right.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:25.860]   Well, Ron and Mario points out that the Hangouts is the best thing, the best messaging solution
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.380]   that Google ever came out with.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.380]   And they killed it.
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.380]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.380]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:31.380]   It was solid.
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.860]   It wasn't perfect, but it was definitely...
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.100]   Well, the reason message is works.
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:39.420]   One of the reasons message works besides the fact is the default messaging app on every
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:42.220]   iPhone sold and you can't turn it off.
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.900]   The other reason is it degrades properly.
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:49.820]   So it uses the internet for data like WhatsApp, but it will also use SMS.
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:54.580]   And so you can have some assurance that you can eye message everybody.
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:55.580]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.380]   And then it has desktop.
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:58.380]   It works.
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.060]   It's a very appily thing because you can't use it anywhere else.
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.740]   And it's actually very secure.
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:05.220]   And it's secure.
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.140]   Apple knows what you're doing, but other than that, it's secure.
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:10.060]   Well, I don't think even Apple...
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:14.380]   Well, theoretically, they could find out what you're doing, but it's heavily encrypted.
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.620]   So the third party is gonna...
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.740]   It's a hell of a lot better than most stuff.
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:24.380]   And I used Hangouts for a long time because it worked on my iPhone.
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.260]   It worked on my Android phone.
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.100]   It worked on my desktop.
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.300]   Android messages will kind of do all of that.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.020]   I have it on all those places, but it's not as good as Hangouts.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:36.180]   Yeah, Hangouts was definitely the solution for our family.
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.180]   Yeah.
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.460]   Because we could use it everywhere.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.820]   So no, no, you can't bitch Google.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.700]   What was the rationale for screwing it up?
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.860]   Can you imagine what went through their heads?
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.620]   Ron wrote a long, or somebody did.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:51.660]   Ours had a long, 25,000 word history yet was Ron.
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:54.500]   History of Google's messaging.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.980]   And I did that once too.
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.300]   I wrote something like that for Computer World.
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.740]   And by the time it was published, it already was out of date because they changed the other
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:02.740]   thing.
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.980]   I'm not even touching it anymore.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:12.900]   So it's fun if you go through all the different apps, Google Talk, Google Voice, Google Wave,
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:17.340]   Google Buzz, Slides Disco, Google Play.
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.860]   I don't know what that is.
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:19.860]   I don't know.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:24.300]   It's in the article, the Google Plus era, Google Plus Hangouts video chat, the first Hangouts,
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.900]   Google Plus Huddle Messenger.
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:26.900]   Huddle.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:27.900]   Oh, God.
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:28.900]   Do we remember that?
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:29.900]   Yeah.
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:30.900]   Now it's a Microsoft.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:31.900]   Yeah.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:32.900]   I remember Huddle.
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:39.380]   Google Doc's editor chat, Google Hangouts, Google Spaces, Google Aloe 2016, Google's Dead
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:44.700]   on Arrival Whatsapp Clone, Google Duo, which I still use with my daughter for video calls,
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:51.860]   Google Hangouts, Meet, they renamed it Meet, YouTube Messages, Google Hangouts Chat, they
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.060]   renamed it Chat, Google Maps Messages.
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:55.060]   Google Messages.
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:56.060]   Oh, wow.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.060]   Yeah.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:01.420]   In 2017, he actually says, yes, this really was the thing.
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:02.420]   Yeah.
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:07.180]   So, I'm going to say, yes, Google Photos Messages, Google Stadium Messages, Google Pay Messages,
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:13.620]   Google Assistant Messages, Google Phone Messages, Google Chat Part 2, and then the last bit,
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.220]   is anyone in charge at Google?
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:17.180]   And the answer is no.
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:23.940]   To answer your question, the elevator pitch or the short version of the answer is that,
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:27.780]   just like Microsoft used to do under Ballmer, each division has its own messaging app and
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:31.380]   they don't talk to each other and they're competing with each other.
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:37.740]   There's nobody in charge, there's no Steve Jobs, there's no such a Nadella to say, no,
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.260]   this is the one we're doing.
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:40.260]   That's it, period.
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:43.540]   Everybody, we're putting all the wood behind this particular arrow.
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.860]   Nobody ever did that.
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:52.140]   I've been maintaining for several years that Sundar Pichai is a horrible CEO.
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:56.380]   Nobody ever says that, but look at the result of what's happened since he took over.
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:02.500]   It's all this stuff, the closures, the failures, this kind of thing.
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:06.620]   This is all getting worse and worse, and Sundar Pichai's leadership.
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:07.620]   Remember that great cartoon?
[00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:08.620]   I agree with you.
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:12.900]   It was making fun of Microsoft where all the divisions are shooting at each other.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.740]   I have the original on my wall at home, actually.
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.300]   The artist sent it to me.
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:23.300]   Apparently, Google decided that was a good way to do business and they adopted the Microsoft
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:24.300]   method.
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:31.940]   Microsoft had the good sets to stop doing that and to at least try to unify themselves.
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:33.500]   It's sad.
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:39.340]   For a long time, this spaghetti throw it against the wall and see what sticks approach was great
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.340]   for Google.
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.820]   They got some major hits.
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:45.900]   Gmail was a 20% project by one engineer initially.
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:51.700]   The idea of having advertising was just some engineer had to talk Larry and Sergey into
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:54.060]   doing ads and they were against it.
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.900]   They're like, "No, no, we should do ads."
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:02.140]   For a long time, most of the things that were best about Google were the result of this
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:07.500]   every engineer spinning up their own thing and then we'll try it and see what happens.
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:14.300]   Google grew so big and they became so successful that they could no longer be that kind of a
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.980]   startup like company.
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:20.300]   Now you have people betting their businesses on their infrastructure.
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:25.980]   You have all kinds of billions of people using their products and so you can't have that
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:28.020]   sort of scrappy startup.
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.820]   Let's try it and see if it works kind of mentality.
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:33.300]   You have to have a vision about what you're going to do and then you have to execute on
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.540]   that vision and they just can't seem to do it.
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:38.060]   This is a Man of Cornets.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:43.220]   This is Man of Cornets organizational trees for all the different companies.
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.820]   Here's Microsoft where they're all shooting at each other.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.740]   Actually, Google's is still, I think, fairly accurate.
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:49.740]   You know what?
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:52.180]   That looks like their new building.
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.180]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:58.580]   Every route of your reports to everybody else, Amazon's very hierarchical and I think it's
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:47:59.660]   still is.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:02.020]   That looks like Amazon's atrium.
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:03.020]   It is.
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:04.820]   It's the downtown Seattle atrium.
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:07.660]   Facebook looks like a giant bean bag.
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:09.380]   Everybody's connected.
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:14.460]   Apple, this is from the era of Steve Jobs, the era of centralized point, although I think
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.740]   it's probably still the same.
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.460]   And then Oracle is like a giant legal division.
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:22.900]   A little engineering division.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.940]   Man, you got it.
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:26.220]   And I'm very proud to have this on my own.
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:30.460]   By the way, Sacha Nadella, I didn't realize this in his book, Hit Refresh and the first
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.980]   page mentions this cartoon.
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:36.340]   And says this was the thing I was trying to solve.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:39.300]   So Google apparently did not get that message.
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.740]   Where did that cartoon originally run just on a site or?
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:46.540]   Yeah, Man who published it on, it's gone now, unfortunately, on Bonkers World.
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.900]   But it's no longer there.
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:55.620]   But I am very proud to have an original version of it from Man who sent us.
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:56.940]   Because we talked about it all the time.
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:58.780]   You're going to make it an NFT.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:48:59.780]   Ooh.
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.740]   Now you're talking.
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.340]   All right, let me take a little break.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:07.020]   We hope Stacy's feeling a little bit better.
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:08.020]   She's under the weather.
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:10.740]   But we're thrilled we got Mike Elgin in.
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:11.740]   It's great to have you.
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.740]   I'm glad to be here.
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.740]   Mike Elgin.substack.com.
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.540]   And of course, don't forget gastronomad.net.
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.420]   The Morocco tour is sold out.
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:28.740]   But there are more to come if you go to gastronomad.net and click the experiences tab.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:34.100]   Yeah, our next one after that is Prosecco, which is going to be really great.
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.100]   Nice.
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:38.740]   And of course, I was on the Wahaka trip and highly recommended.
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.260]   Morocco is a longer one, isn't it?
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:42.260]   Two weeks.
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:48.020]   And we go to I think something like eight or nine, ten cities.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:51.420]   Is there still room in the spring trip?
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.420]   The spring trip?
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.420]   No, that's sold out.
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.700]   But there is in October.
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.260]   In 2022 is also about the 2023 is already getting people.
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:00.260]   Nice.
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:01.260]   Very nice.
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:06.020]   A lot of a lot of Twit listeners on those trips.
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:09.980]   So you'll be amongst good people, I must say.
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:11.620]   So much fun.
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:15.500]   We're going to get you on I think next month, you and Amir on to the club.
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.500]   February 11th.
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:17.500]   To talk about it.
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:21.540]   So that will be our Valentine's Day episode.
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:24.860]   Also Jeff Jarvis from the City University.
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:26.860]   My gastronomad local spirit is right here.
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:31.500]   I'm going to make breaks like this.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:37.140]   And Mr. Pruitt hands on photography who did not go to CES.
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:38.500]   And that's my fault.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:39.660]   I hope still healthy.
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.940]   Are you okay that you didn't get to go?
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.540]   I'm totally fine, sir.
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:46.620]   Yeah, it would have been fun.
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:51.100]   Father Robert was there a quarter of the normal attendance by 40,000 people.
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:52.860]   So it sounds like it was pretty empty.
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:56.500]   There was some cool things, but I feel like it's a very gimmicky show.
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.660]   And I don't know how much stuff really.
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:05.500]   Well, yeah, I was one vendor put up just plywood or two by fours and plywood and QR
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:07.540]   codes and no hardware.
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:12.460]   You know, the only advantage I would have seen at CES this year is it would have been a
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:15.460]   little bit more intimate for us when you would have been to boost.
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:16.620]   Yeah, very intimate.
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:21.500]   Not as many people there is a lot of times they are literally trying to flush you through
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.620]   so they can get the next press person there.
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:27.100]   But this would have been nicer to sit down and spend a little more time.
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.660]   But it's all good.
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:30.500]   We still got to just stop it.
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:36.900]   There a lot of these companies just did, you know, Zoom conferences and virtual conferences.
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:41.100]   Mari Barra from GM didn't go, but she gave her keynote via Zoom, things like that.
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:45.020]   Samsung had scheduled an event yesterday.
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:48.980]   The X and O's 2200 was supposed to be launched yesterday.
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:49.980]   They didn't tell anybody.
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:51.580]   They didn't show up.
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.820]   They didn't do anything.
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.140]   It was like dial tone.
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:58.060]   It was like the Golden Globes.
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:51:59.900]   Yeah, that was weird.
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.460]   I told my wife we're watching the football game.
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:04.180]   I said, oh, shoot, it's the Golden Globes are tonight.
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:06.260]   No, but you can't watch it.
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:11.820]   All it was was a few members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association tweeting.
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.580]   So they tweet, here's the winner.
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:16.900]   They held a Twitter.
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.340]   That's all was ever worth.
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:21.300]   They held it on Twitter.
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:27.860]   So Samsung finally did tell a business career that they are planning to unveil the new processor
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:30.940]   when they launch the new phone.
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:32.740]   There are no problems.
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.740]   That is all.
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:38.980]   That's not how you do a press release.
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:39.980]   That is all.
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:40.980]   Nothing more.
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:41.980]   It is something to see here.
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:42.980]   Move along.
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:48.700]   Yeah, I was someone looking at Twitter watching the Golden Globes thinking, oh, I wonder if
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.980]   Tina Fey and Amy Poehler will host it again this year.
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:53.220]   Maybe they got Ricky your face.
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:56.780]   No, it's just 87 old white men tweeting.
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:57.780]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.300]   Well, that was part of the problem.
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.300]   Oh, Lord.
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.900]   Completely out of touch with the Ziya.
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:09.420]   Yes, and really should never have had the prestige they had.
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:12.540]   I mean, it was just, you know, it was a hundred.
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:16.780]   The journalists, the foreign journalists that made up the Foreign Press Association were
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:18.100]   barely even bloggers.
[00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:21.180]   These are people from third rate, two bit little real news.
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.100]   Oh, freelance a little bit here and there.
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:24.100]   They invented it.
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:26.460]   The daily disgrace of rock.
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:33.220]   So I just wish though, it was a great car wreck of a TV show because everybody gets
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:38.380]   sloshed and they would hire people like Ricky Gervais who would just insult them right
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:39.380]   and left.
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:40.380]   Yeah.
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:41.380]   It was fun.
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:42.380]   So just do that.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:43.540]   Admit, we're out of touch.
[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:45.500]   We don't know what the hell we're talking about.
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:47.260]   We're just going to give some awards.
[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:48.740]   Come watch our party.
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.020]   It was a good party.
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:51.020]   I feel bad.
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:52.020]   I think I guess it's over, right?
[00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.900]   I mean, how do you come back from?
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:54.900]   Yeah.
[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:56.500]   I think it's definitely over.
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:01.980]   What's funny about Ricky Gervais is that he did some bits, some of his best bits in hindsight
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:08.620]   when you look through and find out what actually happened to them are just accurate depictions.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:09.620]   Yes.
[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:10.860]   He's telling the truth.
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.100]   He had this one joke.
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:19.260]   He said, oh, there aren't any black nominees because the Hollywood Foreign Press are very,
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.260]   very racist.
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:24.740]   Well, that was hilarious until it turns out that's just for Queens.
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:26.740]   He didn't get much true.
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:29.340]   He didn't care.
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.340]   Oh, God.
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:32.340]   Thanks.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:33.340]   Thanks.
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:37.940]   Another casualty of COVID, I guess, you know, see, well, see, you think CES will be back next
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:38.940]   year.
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:42.540]   Oh, no, which was the foreign press association.
[00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:45.180]   No, it was casually of scandal.
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:46.180]   Scandal?
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:48.940]   Was there actual scandal or just people realized they were actual scandal?
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:49.940]   There was actual scandal.
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.100]   Oh, there were multiple cases where bribery.
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:53.100]   People arrived them.
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:54.100]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:55.100]   And then there was a piece of Zadora.
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:56.100]   Remember that?
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:57.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:58.100]   She was best.
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:01.740]   Her husband, her husband, like, took the entire foreign press to Vegas and wind them and
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:06.660]   dine them and she won best actress or something for a horrible performance.
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:07.660]   And that was the first one.
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:09.740]   But there's been several since then that were kind of like that.
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:10.700]   But we knew about that.
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.300]   That was decades ago.
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:13.300]   Right.
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:18.420]   We didn't care because it was just a status quo.
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:20.340]   That wasn't exactly the word I was going to use.
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.940]   It did begin with this.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:25.100]   Well, the racism bit is the thing to them in.
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:26.100]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:30.740]   Didn't get a lot of press, but Tom Cruise actually returned his three golden gloves.
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:31.740]   Oh, really?
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.500]   The organization said I don't want him anymore.
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:34.500]   It was Cruise.
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.300]   Why was I thinking it was Tom Hanks?
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:39.500]   It was Cruise that her time.
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:40.500]   Don't quote me.
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:41.500]   I think it was Cruise.
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:43.620]   Maybe it was Hanks, but I think it was kind of thing Hanks would have done.
[00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.780]   I can't see Tom Cruise really caring, but okay.
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:47.900]   I thought it was Tom Hanks that did that.
[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:48.900]   Okay.
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:49.900]   I thought that was interesting.
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:51.820]   Somebody named Tom.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:52.980]   Let's be frank.
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:57.420]   I don't think the Academy Awards are much better.
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:58.420]   Are they?
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:00.220]   There's no evidence of bribery, but...
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:01.220]   On Cruise.
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:02.220]   Well, there's less evidence of bribery.
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:03.700]   All these awards shows are...
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:04.700]   They're all BS.
[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:05.700]   They're meaningless.
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:06.700]   But it's a party.
[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:07.700]   I like watching people.
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.380]   I like watching celebrities get drunk.
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:12.700]   Well, but that's entertaining.
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:13.700]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:16.540]   I'm shocked that I'm going to be defending the Oscars.
[00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:18.980]   But they actually have thousands of members.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:19.980]   They tend to be...
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:20.980]   They're in the trades.
[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:21.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:22.980]   Super luminaries.
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:24.580]   If you won an Oscar before, you probably a member.
[00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:25.580]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:27.540]   Steven Spielberg, all these people.
[00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:33.100]   But when they had their own race scandal two or three years ago, if you recall, and
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:37.540]   they responded by increasing the membership by like 25%.
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:40.100]   Plus, it's almost entirely a people of color.
[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:41.100]   So they...
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:42.100]   Good.
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:43.100]   Actually put their money with them out.
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:47.300]   And the voters are in the field that they're voting for except for the big awards.
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.300]   So...
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:49.300]   Social media made a huge difference.
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:50.300]   #OscrewSoWhite.
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:51.300]   Yeah.
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.300]   So White.
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:53.300]   Yes.
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:54.300]   Yes.
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:56.380]   It was by the way Tom Cruise, credits Tom Cruise.
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:59.540]   He returned his awards and NBC dropped the ceremony.
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:02.460]   I missed this article last year.
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:03.460]   That's why I wasn't on TV.
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:06.780]   NBC said it wants meaningful reform.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:09.580]   Good for the end.
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:13.140]   This is a defining moment for Hollywood, says Time's Up.
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.940]   I just think they should all be just deported.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:19.140]   And that'd be the end of it.
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:30.180]   You know, as long as everybody understands what a crappy thing it is, we can still enjoy
[00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.180]   it.
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:32.180]   Yeah.
[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:36.060]   They should rename it to be the trash Oscars or something like that.
[00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:37.620]   Yeah, the trash Oscars.
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:38.620]   Exactly.
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:39.620]   Don't...
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:40.620]   I'm not...
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:41.620]   I don't know.
[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:42.620]   Maybe not.
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:43.620]   I don't know.
[00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:44.620]   Maybe it does carry...
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:45.620]   It unfortunately carried a lot away.
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:46.620]   It was kind of the precursor to the Oscars.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.620]   Right.
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.500]   That is unfortunate, I guess.
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:53.060]   But I did like watching it fall apart in live TV.
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.260]   Ricky Gervais was just a gold...
[00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:57.100]   Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:58.940]   God, it was funny.
[00:57:58.940 --> 00:57:59.940]   What is...
[00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:00.940]   What is streak, sir?
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:05.500]   Oh, thank you for bringing that up because it is time to mention our sponsor.
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:06.500]   Thank you.
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.820]   Barry, where he's well done.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:11.900]   You protect the boss from himself, and what area is that?
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:14.700]   What is this streak I keep hearing about, he says.
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:17.060]   If you use Gmail, you know it's a gold mine.
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:22.260]   It's a database of so much valuable information.
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:28.380]   Streak is our sponsor and runs, I guess you would call it, a CRM, a customer relationship
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:31.660]   management engine that rides right on top of Gmail.
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:35.900]   In fact, it's directly inside Gmail.
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:40.020]   The thing that Gmail did so well, so right, is that don't delete your mail because everything
[00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.420]   in there is a value.
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:43.580]   It's kind of a database, a history.
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:49.500]   It tracks what you've been up to, sales and fundraising and hiring or support.
[00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:53.100]   Streak optimizes this in an incredible way.
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:56.340]   It kind of turns it almost into a spreadsheet of information.
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:59:01.140]   You can use Streak's free email tools to check if your emails have been opened, to send bulk
[00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:05.940]   emails with automated follow-up emails to improve your response rates.
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:07.300]   It's part of your everyday workflow.
[00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:09.380]   You're already using Gmail, right?
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:13.980]   But you can then inside Gmail see details about your leads, your customers, your investors.
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:16.700]   No more switching between Gmail and other tools.
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:21.100]   If you're prospecting for new customers or raising a fundraising route or growing your
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:27.180]   team or managing support tickets, Streak's pipelines, which are very cool, by the way.
[00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:31.260]   You can use them to track all your processes directly from Gmail.
[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:32.900]   You can set up a pipeline in a couple of minutes.
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:35.380]   It's very easy to get started.
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:37.800]   Customize the pipelines based on your needs.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:44.620]   This is, I think, a very cool way of thinking about mail, the process of mail.
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:48.580]   Streak makes it easy to collaborate by automatically sharing emails and notes with everyone and
[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:50.740]   anyone on your team.
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:54.060]   Google Technology Partner of the Year.
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.060]   Google loves them, too.
[00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:59.260]   It's used by thousands of founders, entrepreneurs and small business owners.
[00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:00.500]   750,000 to be exact.
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:03.580]   In fact, all you have to do is ask around.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:06.860]   It won't take long before the conversation goes to Streak.
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:11.200]   People who use Streak, they have to tell the world, "Oh, have you seen this?
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.200]   Have you tried it?
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.200]   It's amazing."
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.200]   You can try it today.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.080]   Right now, it's free to use on your own.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.080]   That's to get you in the door.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.720]   If you want to use it with your business, with your team, there's a pro plan.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:26.840]   In fact, you'll get 20% off your first year of their pro plan, their most popular option.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:31.920]   20% off their first year by going to Streak.com/twig.
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:42.140]   I want you to use that so they know you saw it here because I want them to stick around.
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:47.100]   Streak.com/twig and you get a big 20% off your whole first year.
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:52.580]   As I said, the free plan you can use on your own if you want to dip your toe in.
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:56.980]   Streak's pretty cool.
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:59.080]   Streak.com/twig.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:11.020]   Let me thank you so much for their support of this week in Google.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.100]   Did you put this in here?
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:15.620]   The cats that are sleeping on the Starlink dishes.
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:18.620]   I love that.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:20.220]   So they're going to headline too.
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:21.220]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:24.220]   Cat and a Hot Satellite dish.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:28.240]   They're heated so that they don't get iced up.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:32.240]   Apparently the cats figured that out.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:37.040]   The other problem is it's kind of hard for Starlink to work through a cat.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.480]   One customer, well I'll give you-
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.480]   That's their revenge.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:43.040]   Yeah, here's a five cats.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:48.600]   This is a tweet from Aaron Taylor.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:53.840]   Five cats who have discovered the warmth in there in the snow.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:54.840]   They're all bun...
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:59.260]   I wouldn't have thought you could get five cats on that dish but apparently can.
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:02.740]   And the great thing is cats always have that you got a problem with this look?
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:03.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:04.740]   What's the most?
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:05.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:06.740]   Their cats are funny, aren't they?
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:10.840]   They know they're doing something wrong but unlike a dog which will run off, the cat
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.580]   just looks at you going, "What?"
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:13.580]   Phew.
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:14.580]   Why?
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:16.460]   I dare you to challenge what.
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:18.180]   What's your problem?
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.940]   That's hysterical.
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:24.840]   Why is Zinga worth $12.7 billion?
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.840]   Fake hay!
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:27.840]   Fake hay!
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:32.480]   Is still too far away with the NFT of the day.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.480]   I did Farmville for years.
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.920]   You've got that fake hay.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.920]   Farmville 3 from Mobile is coming.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.960]   Oh, that's why.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.480]   Alright.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:48.360]   The original Farmville which died in 2020 has been replaced by games.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:54.420]   They've acquired quite a few gram games, small giant games, peak games, rolic, etc.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:03:00.500]   They're really the masters of the free to play, the freemium game where you get people
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:10.340]   hooked and then they give you lots of money for fake donuts or things.
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:15.820]   So take two which publishes Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption and Bioshock and
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:18.720]   Borderlands Civilization, really big Kerbal Space Program.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:24.340]   All the two K sports games are big gaming company just bought Zinga.
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:27.720]   A name, it feels like a blast from the past.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:28.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.880]   $12.7 billion.
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:39.720]   Which means probably you'll see Grand Theft Auto Mobile, right?
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.720]   Why not?
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.240]   There's the horsepower for it.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:49.380]   And that's why you'll be able to mow down farm animals or something.
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:50.380]   Wow.
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:52.620]   It's funny.
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:57.980]   I thought Zinga, honestly, Zinga was in the old tech TV building and I thought they've
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:03:59.260]   got to be gone by now.
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:03.820]   What are they doing?
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:12.060]   So last week we mentioned that Norton 360, the anti-virus program was installing a crypto
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.820]   miner.
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:15.980]   I think I don't think by default.
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:19.440]   I think you had to have the right hardware and be, I think you had to opt in.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:25.880]   But on people's computers, I thought it installed it, but you did have to opt in to run it.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.040]   Maybe that's it.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:30.780]   And they take 15% of it, as Corey Tocqueville pointed out.
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:32.760]   Now it turns out they're not alone.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:40.740]   Avere which was purchased by Norton is now doing it to, Avere has a big half billion users.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:43.860]   It was a free anti-virus very popular for a long time.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:49.420]   They have now introduced something called a Vira crypto to this almost would feel like
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:55.540]   the opposite of an anti-virus.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:57.060]   Wow.
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:06.660]   I guess, I mean, to me, it's already a problem with Norton slowing your system down, like
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:07.660]   molasses.
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:11.260]   To add a crypto miner, not to mention the energy waste.
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:19.300]   Again, I question why are we still pushing anti-viruses when Windows already has something
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:20.300]   pretty good.
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:21.300]   Yeah, I don't think we'll do.
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:22.700]   Why are we still pushing these things?
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.060]   Because there are money.
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.860]   There's money in them there, Hills.
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:27.860]   I guess.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.180]   You are Mr. Leo LaPorte.
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.940]   Can you tell people to just use Windows?
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:31.940]   I do all the time.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:34.220]   On the radio show, people ask me, should I get an anti-virus?
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:35.420]   And I say, no.
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:37.380]   Steve Gibson says the same thing.
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:41.620]   There are reasons you might want an anti-virus business.
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:43.180]   We run anti-virus here.
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:48.700]   Russell has us running an anti-virus because, well, we're a business.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.460]   And the last thing we want to do is get shut down by ransomware.
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:55.300]   If you've got a teenager, you might want to consider it.
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:59.300]   If the hardheads use the family computer, because they're not, I mean, when Michael's
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:01.420]   you know I have the solution to it all.
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.420]   What's that?
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:03.700]   A Chromebook.
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.220]   Oh, that's...
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:06.540]   Did you keep your acesters?
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:07.540]   What is that?
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:08.540]   What one is that?
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:09.540]   No, this is the Google one.
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.260]   You went back to the Google one.
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:12.260]   Yeah.
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.260]   That's the...
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:14.260]   Which is that the go?
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:15.220]   The one with the W.B.
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:16.220]   Go.
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:17.220]   But...
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:18.220]   Yeah, it is.
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:19.220]   The W.B.
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:20.220]   One.
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:24.740]   I still use the Pixelbook, the pre-Go one.
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:28.700]   And I share your smugness, Jeff.
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:29.700]   I just feel...
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:32.940]   That in a smug, I'm right.
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.780]   Like, come at me, man.
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.300]   Like, what are you going to do?
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:42.340]   It's true. It's like the same reason I hate Wertle. It makes sense. Wertle works on Chromebooks
[01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:49.940]   Well, I will never know that why do you hate Wertle? Never, I hate being spammed by all these people telling me look
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:53.900]   I can spell oh, you don't hate Wertle you hate Twitter see this is the problem
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:57.440]   This is the problem he will defend to the death Twitter
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:01.340]   But this is really a Twitter problem that a world problem
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:07.560]   No, it's the problem Wertle sets up this function so that everybody shares it like I should give a good rats
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:16.700]   Must be the people you're following
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:21.340]   Everything on the web is shareable
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:27.540]   So everybody on their web page has that little icon is this click here to share the Facebook or to Twitter or what have you?
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:31.980]   What is a news story fine, but it's your it's your sticky word game
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:37.100]   Well look this is another way to share it. Here's somebody who's cross stitching her Wertle scores
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:42.900]   Look she got that word in two notes. That's hard to do
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:48.620]   I think that's luck if you get it in two words. I really do I think that's mr. Jarvis. Do you think I play Wertle?
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.540]   No
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:54.100]   Well, actually I have but no because I didn't share
[01:07:55.060 --> 01:08:00.580]   Yeah, I don't share it. I'm pretty proud of my wordle score share. I don't share it
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:04.660]   I don't whereas I don't play it in a properly played it maybe play it so
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:10.940]   Oh bad, I never remember to play it. I got other stuff going on in my brain
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.940]   Yeah, I think I've got a more like life, you know, just fine
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:16.100]   You want to do it you want to have orange juice breakfast
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:20.820]   You don't tell me every day. It's like the old days of people people tell me those bloggers you see what they have for breakfast
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:23.580]   Well now everybody on Twitter just says oh I just played wordle
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:29.540]   It's not going to be replaced by an algorithm
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:35.500]   Artificial intelligence is smarter than all of you. It can use on github now. It can get the words faster
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:40.980]   Everybody's gonna cheat. It's over. Wordle is already over. Yeah. Yeah, I think my word for it
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:43.700]   What will be talking about where it'll next month?
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:48.140]   I went well, but like as in every member wordle
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:56.900]   All right worlds actually these pads they they it's a fan goes like quickly they do yeah
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:06.380]   I mean I get up at four o'clock in the morning and I start reading and writing basically and thinking and thinking a lot about
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:08.380]   words
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:13.540]   Me milk
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:20.380]   But I actually actually as you know Leo I lived on a farm for the second year I worked at Twitter and sometimes
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:25.900]   He had a farm is when on vacation and I literally got up at four o'clock in the morning to milk
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:32.340]   The cow to feed the pigs before coming in and doing TNT so that that actually happened, but
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:35.940]   Don't recommend it, but um
[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:40.180]   I checked out wordle today. I figured well must be fun. Everybody's talking about it
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:46.300]   I went there and like I don't want to have to struggle with more words. I do this from first thing in the morning to
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:54.060]   Dinner time. Yeah, that's the right word. That's what I do all day every day. It's like enough already so
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:57.660]   That's a good question. How many writers actually use
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:01.260]   Ashley pli use wordle because I do a lot of
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:07.500]   Coding exercises so I don't want my brain developed too big on one side
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:13.580]   I want to the others. I'm trying to keep my lobes even you do it for vanity. Yes
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:19.140]   I don't have a big bulge on one side on the right side, but I should have something on the left side
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:23.220]   So that's why I do wordle I crossword puzzles - I try to balance
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:26.420]   language and math
[01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:32.140]   Apparently I started playing at some point earlier. Oh there you go. I forgot about it. There you go
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:36.380]   You didn't even finish you just got to right that just shows you how much I really care. Yeah
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:44.220]   So will the Sonos be will the Google devices be banned because of
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:46.900]   Sonos's
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:54.260]   Victory in the international trade they're just taking away things right. Yeah, well Google's solution to this is to take away features
[01:10:54.260 --> 01:11:03.460]   So the final US ITC ruling last week Google infringe on the Sonos patents, but the ban will not they probably will not ban them
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:11.380]   Because Google has gone into crisis mode and strips stripping away features
[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:13.980]   From their their devices
[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:21.540]   You can't set the volume now for instance remotely through a device on multiple ones right multiple devices. Yeah
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:27.260]   Which makes me mad because I don't want to use a Sonos and the whole reason I was excited as I had the same
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:29.260]   I guess that's the point of the patent
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:35.820]   I guess that's the point of witness
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:42.820]   Oops, I just little little fuel on the fire there. Why can't they just pay Sonos?
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:48.940]   Well, that's my question because Apple has many of the same features Apple must be licensing it some type of license fee
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:51.540]   Yeah, I guess that Google doesn't want to do that. I don't know
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:54.500]   It would set a precedent. I don't know
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:58.460]   An open letter
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:02.260]   From the CEO of YouTube
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:11.260]   To the world's fact checkers. I'm guessing you put this in Jeff no - I didn't and it's an open letter to YouTube's from the world's
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:18.500]   Yeah, you see why I didn't put it up because oh no, we're gonna more panic. That's fine dear Miz Susan Wojiske
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:25.540]   So what are they they're worried that YouTube is promoting misinformation. Yeah, yes
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:33.260]   Is there a organization of the fact checkers of America? Oh, it's a fun. You can imagine the what a fun convention that is
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:37.940]   Yes, there is I don't think you had a ham sandwich for lunch is that a ham sandwich?
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:43.020]   I don't think there's any ham in that ham sandwich. I probably have look at all these organizations
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:46.260]   Africa check animal political
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:52.900]   Ous photos is very good Bolivia verifica boom check your fact USA
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:13:00.100]   What there's all of these checking organizations the Polish Demagogue Association
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:04.420]   Fact check Ghana
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:09.580]   We have quite a few in the US because we got a lot of fake facts in the yeah, we do
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:12.900]   my go-pen Taiwan
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.900]   All right
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:18.400]   Profta in Poland
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:24.340]   I don't think it's the same Profta. I doubt it the healthy Indian project sip
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:27.380]   There's Pravda
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:34.340]   So so Trump's new social workers a social network is called truth social would that be translated as Profta?
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:37.840]   Yes, it would. Oh, that's the word Profta in Russian is truth
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:42.860]   Have I shown you the picture of five cats on a
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:46.860]   I'll be here a week
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:52.020]   Did you make this face? That's the name the official name
[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:58.640]   Perfect perfect antenna
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:05.900]   Perfect it's an agenda. Did we do the worst of CES last week? I think we did I don't think no we didn't know the show
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:07.900]   Oh, okay, I
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:13.300]   Shows this is actually good last week. We were talking with them miss miss Geller, right?
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:19.220]   Your Kathy was great. Yeah, by the way was you're welcome. What a great you. Yeah
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:24.340]   And now I feel like ancillary copyright has become part of the English language which is
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:28.260]   Repeat after me nice to the truth, right?
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:37.780]   Holy cow not doing it. I'm not repeating we spent half an hour an ancillary copyright Mike Leo Leo's sitting there thinking
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:39.780]   How do I break into this how how I?
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:44.700]   Literally sitting here thinking I don't want to break into it's a very good conversation
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:50.300]   It was a good but I also can feel people turning the I this is from my radio days turning off the radio
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:56.380]   Like it was only 15 minutes for me Leo because I was listening at double speed there you go that it was fast
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:15:05.220]   The worst of CES this is six right to repair advocates who assembled last Friday to present
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:12.740]   Repair.org second annual worst in show awards a selection of the least private least secure least
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:17.100]   repairable and least sustainable gadgets at CES
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:23.780]   Cory doctor. Oh was the host perfectly appropriate
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:30.740]   He says it's our job here today to talk about the hidden or maybe not so hidden and completely foreseeable
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:33.820]   failure modes of these gadgets
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:35.620]   a
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:39.660]   Ward from the founder of I fix it Kyle Wien's good friend of the network
[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:44.540]   He gave the Mercedes EQS electric vehicle the award for worst product
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:50.180]   Because you're not supposed to open the hood
[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:56.820]   When you when you actually turn on the car here's the note this shows up a cop posted this on Twitter
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:03.400]   Notes on the hood only is a specialist person hell of a qualified specialist workshop should open the hood
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:12.020]   Access by the customer is not permitted not permitted to open the hood consult a qualified specialist workshop
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:17.940]   The reason they give and I think this is not unfair is electric vehicle and there may be you make it a shock
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.940]   You could shock us
[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:23.740]   It has a reason to buy the car. Yeah, but I have to say
[01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:32.520]   The only real car miss up I ever had was when my car had overheated in the desert when I was a kid driving across country to go to
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:37.960]   College and I I don't know why I decided to open the radiator cap. Oh
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.680]   mistake
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:47.180]   Oh, what came out steaming hot water in a gusher? Oh, I managed to dodge it. I didn't get burned, but
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:51.560]   Wow, that's an example of why you don't want to open the hood
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:58.200]   But you did have the right I had the right to do it. I had the right to hurt myself
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.240]   didn't Rolls Royce used to lock the hood and
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:08.240]   Only to be opened by a qualified maybe but if you're role if you're buying a Rolls Royce
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:11.400]   Do you think you're really gonna go check the oil yourself?
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:18.720]   Hard me do you have a dipstick I could borrow
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:28.960]   So it turns at sticks I didn't know was it was it Mercedes that piece yeah that they got rid of the dipstick
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.960]   That's another thing
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.840]   This is not the first time Mercedes has gone in this road
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:42.000]   Weans noted a few years ago the company removed the dipstick from its sea-class vehicles arguing that only an authorized technician should change the oil
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.920]   It's the automotive equivalent of an audio jack
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:51.200]   Yes, yes, maybe no dipstick for you
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:56.640]   Apparently I've seen on a number of blogs and probably on Twitter
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:01.160]   It is possible to open the hood. There's a secret handle that's covered
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:09.800]   Plastic and find the secret handle so Cindy Cohen the director executive director of electronic fun town tier foundation
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:17.840]   Gave the award for the worst privacy and I wish Stacy were here for this to the single smart health monitoring light bulb
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:20.640]   the
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:24.080]   This is a light bulb says cone that's supposed to be monitoring your health
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:26.440]   But really it's monitoring the humans in the room
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:35.000]   The the light bulb could track your sleep heart rate body temperature and if you put a light bulb in every room all over the house
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:41.440]   This is one of the things she said where some people are like we can do this thing now. Let's find a need for it
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:45.960]   And then I I guess the need for was in case grandma falls down
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:50.160]   She said of course grandma has all sorts of other ways to tell you that she's falling down
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:56.640]   That are really only about surveilling her and that she can control as opposed to this one which is outside of grandma's control
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:01.880]   Cone said the idea that you need a light bulb to monitor your heart rate is just creepy weird
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:06.880]   necessary, yeah, and of course they don't say what happens to the data
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.960]   They collect it right?
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:15.720]   Nathan Proctor national campaign director for the public interest nonprofit US Perg
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:20.240]   Talked about the new Samsung TV that has its own NFT
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:28.760]   Aggregation platform built in we did talk about that briefly did we okay? Yeah, we did talk about that briefly such a crock
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:37.960]   It is a ginormous OLED Samsung TV. What does it even mean it you can use it to buy sell and display your NFT artwork?
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:41.480]   Cheeseth I know well
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:48.120]   We're gonna have the wordle TV next last about as long. That's right Nathan says if you don't know what an NFT is
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.120]   I'm honestly jealous of your life
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:58.340]   Call Roberts founder of secure repairs.org
[01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:03.040]   Chose John Deere's fully autonomous 8R tractor
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:09.840]   This is actually was big news at CES a tractor that you don't need to get into you could just get set it and go back to the house and
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.240]   Or milk your cows as Mike does
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.400]   yes, and
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.920]   of course
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:20.400]   He's he's criticizing it not because of known vulnerabilities
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:25.040]   But because of the way John Deere engages with a secure security community and the yeah
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:29.640]   It's a problem for for many years because tractors are so automated and they you know
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:34.880]   That's another case where you're not allowed to look under hood so to speak of the electronics right in their tractors
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:36.880]   but this tractor is
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.400]   if
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.400]   John Deere is you know if their claims are correct is
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:50.000]   Really astonishing. Yeah, it's it's a fully self. They'll literally drive itself out of the barn down the public highway to the fields
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.240]   And then it will do all the work in the field perfectly and then it can work 24 hours a day
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:01.280]   So it's it's really an astonishing piece of equipment. The problem is of course that it costs
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.680]   $900,000 and
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:06.240]   farmers will have to go into debt more debt and
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:13.040]   Then they won't be able to fix it or do their own repairs. It's at all or it'll replace workers in corporate farms, right?
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.240]   Well, yes, yeah
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:22.160]   You know that some of these combines are so big. It's like a living room on wheels. Yeah
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:32.560]   They're pretty fascinating. Yeah in person. Yeah, what's what's also a nice tidbit about the John Deere tractors that the control for the remote control for it
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:38.480]   He's actually an a phone app. Wow. They actually control it with their phone like
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:44.160]   Remember that the James Bond from like 15 years ago where he was controlling a car with it with his phone
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.840]   It's just like that
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:52.320]   So you can you can take remote control of the tractor with a phone and again this thing is the size of a you know of a building
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:58.240]   And and then you can you can monitor what it's doing check its fuel find out, you know
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:04.080]   All the activities that it's doing so it's pretty pretty amazing. It's it's a fundamental
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:07.920]   Advancement in automated farming
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:14.000]   Speaking of automated farming. Here's a teenager David Colombo who has
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.040]   Took full remote control of over 20 Teslas in 10 countries
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:24.240]   And there seems to be no way to find the owners and reported to them. This is his oh boy tweet
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:29.440]   He says it's not a vulnerability and tev Tesla's infrastructure. It's the owner's
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:32.080]   false
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:38.960]   Uh, he can remotely run commands on 25 plus Teslas in 13 countries without the owners knowledge including disabling
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:42.960]   Century mode opening the doors or windows starting keyless driving
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:47.040]   I can query the exact location see if a driver is present and so on
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:53.360]   he could also play uh rick astley on their Teslas and uh rick rollum
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:57.440]   He can't he says stop the cars or
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:01.360]   Mess with a throttle or anything like this. I guess
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:04.560]   Uh it has to do with the app
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:07.840]   Teslas security team is investigating
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:11.280]   Uh in fact, there is a cve assigned
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:14.320]   So and it's good that it was this kid
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:19.120]   Uh who discovered it not not a not a malicious hacker
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.920]   It's a great plot for like a like a cheesy low budget b movie
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:32.000]   Where somebody gains access to 20 Teslas all in the same place and can drive them and has a swarm of Teslas that
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.680]   Terrorize little towns all over across the country auto mates
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:40.000]   Yeah, he has he's not bloomberg interviewed him
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:47.200]   Uh verified it by seeing screenshots and documentation, but he would he didn't want them to reveal the specifics
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:53.760]   Because uh there's an affix out there uh yet, but it's basically involves an insecure way
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.480]   The software stores information that's needed to link the cars
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:00.000]   Uh to the programs and authentication tokens, I guess
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:07.840]   Uh, you know, but why does this young man know this because he's doing good little hacker boy
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:13.840]   19 year old. I wonder if I can get into these Teslas. He's an information technology security specials
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:19.360]   Look, we shouldn't knock people who do this as long as they do what he did, which is disclosed responsibly. Yeah
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:24.640]   Um because the other option is somebody finds it who decides to play with these people
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:28.160]   Yeah, instead of going to tesla and saying here here, you know
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.880]   um
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:34.160]   He's a self-described tesla fan. He lives in germany
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.480]   He started coding when he was 10 years old
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.720]   Frustrated with high school coursework
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:44.000]   His father helped him petition german authorities to let him go to school two days a week and spend the rest of this time
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.600]   Okay, expanding his cyber security skills
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:52.960]   All right. Well, that makes more sense now. Thank you tesla does have a bug bounty, uh, program
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:58.640]   So it may also and you know, honestly, I know it's a little scary, but we should not condemn people who do this
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:05.440]   Thank god. They do this and as long as they responsibly disclose and reveal it. Yeah, they're they're making things better
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:10.000]   Uh, agree, although it's embarrassing. I'm sure tesla would prefer you to not tweet that
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:17.360]   It's a little embarrassing anyway. That's the the right to repair worst of ceas
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:21.360]   Uh for 2022
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:23.680]   Um
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.400]   Oh, I I didn't give you the worst in show overall
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.720]   Which cori says was linovo's new smart clock essential
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:34.160]   With alexa this is device that you put next to your bed
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:41.680]   He says that if you make an unintelligible random sound turns on and starts listening to everything you say I think we have one of these
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:44.240]   Actually in our bedroom, uh
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:52.000]   Dr. O said pointing to the work of security researchers who have looked into the data captured by amazon smart speaker system
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.800]   That just feels to me like one of those things that right out of the gate. We should be able to spot is not something we want in our homes
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:05.920]   And in our bedrooms, especially yeah, yeah, I got I got I got it all in my bed. I don't you know what
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.160]   Who the hell cares?
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:13.760]   Trackers have to have some sort of microphone. Um, no, I have a sleep. No, that's the way
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:20.080]   That's the way google's works. I have the sleep the sleep beauty rest sleep tracker, which is just a paddle
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.600]   Underneath the mattress and I think it's using
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:31.760]   Radio waves to see movement and so forth and ai to say oh, that's breathing. Oh, that's heartbeats. Oh, that's rolling over
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:36.880]   Okay. Oh, that's a small animal. Oh, that's four people in this bed that kind of thing
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:39.200]   Yeah
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.200]   You know you you say who the health cares you you have it in your bedroom and stuff like that
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.120]   but the difference is that
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:50.720]   You spend all day every day thinking about technology learning, you know learning what's happening in technology
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:54.720]   You write code you understand fully you are a full
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:55.920]   uh
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:58.640]   Participant in this thing and you know what it's doing and you're okay with it
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:04.960]   The vast majority of the consumers of these devices have no idea and if they did really understand what was happening
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:10.160]   They wouldn't like it. Maybe that maybe that dislike is irrational, but they still wouldn't like it
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.720]   So the I know people find it creepy
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:17.840]   I don't know. Is that is that a is that a reasonable?
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:20.960]   Criterion though for uh
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.560]   For prohibiting a technology. Oh, it's creepy
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:31.680]   Well, I think I think that google actually does it a lot better than amazon does google is very upfront about
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:36.960]   Reminding users. We're gathering this data. We have your location history
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:40.720]   We here's a here's a link to the page with all the stuff we're capturing
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:45.200]   Click here if you want to stop this click here if you want to delete that. They're very good at that
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:50.720]   I I'm not aware of much of that at all for amazon where people are buying all these products
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:52.720]   You have a lot of third-party products that use them
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:56.720]   And people are installing them in their cars the bedrooms etc, and they don't
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.120]   Amazon
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:03.200]   Seems like they don't really want people to know exactly what they're doing
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:08.080]   They probably don't want people to know what their robot is going to be doing in terms of mapping the house
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:12.000]   They don't want people to know what their flying security camera is doing in terms of
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.360]   Tracking things recording video uploading video and all that stuff
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:21.680]   They see it seems like they they're just hoping nobody will notice and nobody will care and I that really bothers me
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:25.440]   I would like a giant company like amazon to be more responsible about it
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:31.200]   Do what you're going to do but get it give everybody full disclosure and give them an easy option to opt out
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:36.240]   For whatever their reasons are it's really none of amazon's business what people's reasons are
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:43.760]   Whether it's rational or not people should know what the product does and especially in terms of recording conversations remember the
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:46.240]   Fire phone
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:54.000]   The disastrous smartphone that amazon came out with had a single button if you wanted to recognize a carton of milk and what the company was or whatever
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:58.720]   You pointed out and you pushed the button when you did that it recorded audio
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:04.240]   15 seconds of audio and uploaded that audio so people are thinking i'm taking a picture
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.800]   But it was capturing everything you were saying unnecessarily and was that that was probably a bug not
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:16.160]   Well, it was a it was a bug in amazon's culture. That's my point. They just don't care about that stuff as much as they should
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:23.760]   I yeah, I I guess I mean I feel like I I'm being made to feel guilty for not really caring if somebody hears
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.160]   me me snoring or
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:31.520]   You know, I mean, but you you know what it's doing and you agree to and and that's fine. I'm
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:35.680]   I'm in the same way. I I agree with you amazon should have more clear
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:41.840]   I have literally in my bedroom and amazon device a google device in an apple syria home pot
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:44.480]   I have all boards of tears
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:52.800]   Somebody's they would leave or something interesting even if even if lisa and I had a fight or I said I
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:57.920]   Just want to let you know lisa just between you and me. I'm in a murder. Jeff Jarvis tomorrow even if
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:01.520]   Even if that I don't it's like it was plenty of claws. I don't
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:07.040]   Who cares and if in fact I did murder you and the police got all of that
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:12.080]   They would rightly put me in jail and that would be good because I should go to jail for murdering you
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:17.200]   But there are people who know as much as you do who oppose it and understand that
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.840]   Here's my problem is their opposition is
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:28.320]   Limiting what I can do so it's all it's fine for everybody to make that judgment and not I know lots of people including people on the show
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:32.800]   We'll fuse to have these devices in their house. That's fine. Yeah, but but I don't want
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:35.600]   Some moral pant oaks arms
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:40.320]   I
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:46.400]   Got me in a free amazon echo. There's a game we're playing to see if they can get me to say it
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:49.920]   And I lost no, I don't I don't want somebody else's
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.120]   You know kind of nebulous creepy fear
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:57.120]   To to stop the technologies that I think might be useful
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:03.280]   I agree and I that's why I say that is should just about disclosure. They should yeah do all the things for doing
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:10.000]   Yeah, but have you be able to go? No, but I don't want I mean like what apple did recently with the the tracking thing for third party apps
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.880]   They have a new feature where it said when you install a new app it says
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:18.400]   Uh this app would like to track you across the internet you want to reject that and you just click one button and you're out
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.960]   That's reason that's that's a way to do it. Yeah, I think
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:24.960]   You know I got to point out that that apple button is meaningless that apple
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:31.840]   Is simply turning off the apple id for it advertisers and there's plenty of other ways to track you across the internet
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:34.400]   So in a way, that's a kind of a misleading switch
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:40.240]   There's ways for apple to track you but not the little app google could track you. I mean there's there's lots of ways to track you
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:43.040]   Um that don't require idfa
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:47.120]   And I think apple knows that and I think apple's a little cynical
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:52.560]   Saying look see we care about your privacy. Yes. Yeah, they're double dealing there
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:59.520]   Yeah, but I mean there's so many stories about flashlights that were uploading data to china and stuff like that
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:03.920]   That's like well, that's not right. I wish I would have had the option to to say no to that
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:09.680]   Yeah, but I don't know so yeah, I guess and I and everybody always says oh you're you're in the privileged position
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:16.000]   Blah blah blah. That's fine. Yes. All right. I don't well. I mean the thing as a journalist working with you know
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:21.600]   Confronting all the different tech companies about privacy issues amazon is a worst. I mean they yeah
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:25.040]   They they just stonewall you if they don't want to talk about it
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:29.280]   They they're very cagey. They're very secretive. They're very problematic in terms of their relationship
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:33.280]   The press google is one of the best companies in that i wish that amazon be better
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:36.080]   I think amazon sidewalk for instance is a really cool technology
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:42.320]   Which is a non-starter because people because people don't oh most people as pr
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:48.800]   It could be so easily which is mics point. It could be so easily fixed. They can fix it. It's just pr. Yeah, but they yeah, they
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.040]   Yeah, and mics point two is right. It's also enough
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:56.320]   Culture yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah move fast break things
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.960]   All right, let's take a quick break
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:03.120]   Our episode this week brought to you by this is a new sponsor want to welcome new relic
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:08.320]   Not a new name. I think probably to most people listening if you're a software engineer, you know
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:14.640]   You've heard and I hope you've tried if you haven't I want you to know you can try it for free forever
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:20.960]   You don't even have to give him a credit card new relic. What is it? Wow? I'm glad you asked new relic
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:27.520]   Instruments your entire stack so that when you get that 3am phone call
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:33.680]   Something's gone wrong and the app isn't working. You don't have to scramble around calling people
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:40.000]   Dredding the call from the ceo what's going on you can immediately fix it
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:47.600]   You've we've all been there if you're a software engineer and network engineer assistant, you know, you're you're fast asleep
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:50.560]   Phone rings three in the morning
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:54.480]   Something's broken something's wrong the the server is not working the app's not working
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:59.200]   You're going what is it? Is it the back end? Is it the front end? Is it global? Is it the server? Is it network?
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:02.240]   Is it the cloud provider do I have slow running queries?
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:07.760]   Oh god that I push a bug in my last deploy. Oh my god the whole team scrambling
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:13.440]   They've got all these different tools. They're trying the they're messaging each other like crazy to find and fix the issue
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:17.600]   Now if you had new relic like all these companies do
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:24.400]   You wouldn't have that problem you'd go to the source you'd fix it you'd go back to bed
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:29.200]   Sad thing is and this is a new we had a great conversation with a new relic
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:35.600]   They told me a half of organizations only half have our implementing observability for the networks and systems
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:41.760]   Only half that means the other half are getting up at three in the morning and scrambling like crazy people
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:47.920]   The report shows that maintaining network observability continues to be an issue for companies around the world
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:54.160]   It shouldn't be it will not happen just get new relic new relic combined 16 different monitoring products
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:58.240]   Things you might put together yourself separately
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:04.720]   But as a whole they give you complete observability across your entire software stack in one place
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:09.360]   Of the 16 tools there's application monitoring. There's an apm
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.920]   Which you could put in your apps or your microservices?
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:15.680]   It even it even you can give you the line of code it could say
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:18.960]   It knows the symbol tables say this functions breaking
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:27.120]   This database query is frozen that kind of thing use kubernetes. You'll love pixie gives you instant kubernetes
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:33.120]   Availability and then availability distributed tracing see all your traces without management headaches
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:36.880]   So that you can find and fix issues fast. There's network performance
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:39.840]   Monitoring so you don't have to guess where the issues are
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:44.880]   Ditch those data silos for a system wide correlated view and so much more
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:52.000]   Pinpoint issues down the line of code. So you know exactly why the problem happened you can fix it and fix it right
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:59.280]   That's why all these companies the devs and ops teams at door dash and github and epic games

[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:34.320]   A group of people come back from ces with the vid with the ronam is rona panam and a visit
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:37.040]   Um
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:42.080]   For all the number of people who got sick with something his way down this year. I mean
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:48.160]   Every year in the past, you know, it was it was a super spreader event of every flu and virus
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.840]   Oh god, everybody goes home sick, right?
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:53.200]   I actually beat it the last time we were there two years ago
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:56.240]   And I I almost washed my hands raw
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:01.040]   This is before covid, but I washed my hands at every opportunity and that actually helped a lot
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:04.240]   Um, if I'd known about it, I would have worn a mask
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.240]   70
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.000]   Yeah, you're gonna see masks at ces
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.160]   From now on guarantee it's everywhere
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:14.720]   Now masks everywhere. Why not? I like you and we've learned about masks
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:19.680]   We now know, you know that the you need a good n95 and you could see we kind of know how to wear them
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:21.360]   Why not?
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.360]   like wash your hands
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:29.840]   70 south korean attendees at ces have tested positive now for covid 19. I think this is just the beginning
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:33.360]   Just the beginning 70 cases
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:36.800]   Uh, that's because they test in south korea
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:42.320]   Samsung sk Hyundai heavy employees are testing positive
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:49.840]   Uh, south korean health officials are turning and urging anyone who went to ces to get a pcr test
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:55.760]   Um, navada says no evidence linking that surge with ces
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:01.520]   Tipthe all went to zes
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:03.760]   Okay, fine
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:11.600]   South korea had really was doing a good job and had really cut down. That's why they're very aware of all of this
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:16.880]   Right many korean business people with tenant ces are now confirmed to be infected with covid 19
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:19.680]   Said a senior south korean health ministry official
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:23.120]   Really feel like omochron is
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:29.680]   You know, it's it's it's really it's really slipping past a lot of the mitigations and your best bet is just to be vaccinated
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:32.640]   So that if you get it you she doesn't I think we're all going to get it
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.800]   And yeah, and if you're vaccinated and boosted
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:38.720]   But I think the boosting is pretty important my kids both got it
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:43.440]   Uh, they're both vaccinated and they were fine. I mean, you know, they got it. They were unhappy
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:46.160]   Right. They didn't they didn't have to go to the hospital
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:52.400]   Uh, I think I think jennifer got to their mom got it too. But uh again boosted didn't have to go to the hospital
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:56.640]   I'm i'm debating my my my five-year-old father has an appointment tomorrow. He gets
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.720]   Back to regeneration shots in his eye twice a month
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:03.520]   and the place is always crowded and
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.520]   I
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:11.040]   Do I don't know? Yeah, that's the others. I mean, I'm I'm really trying hard not to have a heart attack
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:18.080]   Because this would be a bad time wouldn't it right you schedule that for later. I'll schedule that for later exactly
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:23.760]   Exactly, but it's you know, but it's amazing. I mean I've been this last year. Well last year
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:28.480]   um went to europe three times with de mexico like six or seven times and
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:31.040]   I've never gotten covid
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:36.320]   Um, it's astonishing. I mean either but I think that this is a different beast now, right?
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:41.360]   Yeah, yeah, I think so and and and really that's that's the future because it's going to become endemic
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:43.920]   It's going to be floating around people are going to die from
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:47.920]   from uh covid every year from now on
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.520]   Tens of thousands of people will die from covid just as they do with the flurs
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:58.640]   60,000 people a year die of the flu and there's going to be new shots every year every two years, whatever it is
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:02.880]   And that's just life now. So but let's not get too
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:09.680]   Cavalier about I mean I other people I know who have long haul there's not long haul flu, but there is long haul
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:11.680]   Yeah, I know two years in
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:17.600]   Right, we just don't know at omocron. We have it's too. It's too new to know what the impact is going to be so it's still freaky
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:21.120]   Is it you who put this story in about the guy's genital shrinking?
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:24.720]   No, I put that in there. I'm sorry
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:28.240]   I put it in my twitter feed. No, that's where I saw it
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:30.560]   I
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:33.520]   So here's the funny thing. So I'm checking on
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:40.720]   Constantly because I want to see what's going on with no back joke a bitch, right? Oh, yeah
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:44.320]   Horrible story that is jeez so I put up this thing
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:50.480]   uh from um news.com. Daddy or news. Yeah news. I come to you which is the mordock
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:56.960]   Uh portal man's penis shrinks after covid diagnosis. No go to the other one first. It's it's it's in a thread
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:59.680]   so um
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:04.880]   It gets better when he says it was his bob average manhood it was above average man
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:11.120]   Right, which which strikes me is this is a reference to the george on sign film shrinkage
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:16.960]   Right covid is the new shrinkage. Yeah shrinkage. It was above average. I swear
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:24.080]   The best part is doctors warn it will likely be permitted
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.640]   That's roofer right there in a nutshell. That's basically the opposite of long covid if you know what I mean
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:34.640]   It's short covid. Oh
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:40.080]   So glad stacy's not here
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:44.720]   What do you think of this? I don't know what I think of this. I saw this in the new york times
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:49.760]   uh 22 year old actor he uh he came to new york city
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:52.480]   from a small town in georgia
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:54.800]   uh
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:43:00.240]   tiktok like crazy about his tiny apartment and how he came to new york to you know to achieve his
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:03.040]   dreams of stardom on broadway
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:07.520]   Said i'm gonna be um tomorrow. I'm auditioning for a juliard
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:08.960]   uh
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:14.400]   Schools undergraduate drama program most one of most prestigious acting schools in the world
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:19.680]   He said does a live stream when he gets the verdict from juliard after his audition
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:25.360]   reads it aloud for his audience of 2.4 million followers and tiktok. It was a rejection
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:31.120]   You are no longer under consideration for admission for fall 2022. He read
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:34.880]   Miss this is new york times mr. Weber looked crestfallen
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:38.160]   Now we're going to have to find a different way to be an actor
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:40.640]   Thanks for watching the journey
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:47.680]   The next night tens of thousands of fans flooded juliard's instagram account to express their anger
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:56.080]   You are so done for not getting axle in 21 000 likes on that comment
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:00.000]   Users started the hashtag justice for axle
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.640]   Left more than a
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:04.320]   justice
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:06.240]   You know he's probably a terrible actor right
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:13.680]   Left more but he's a tiktok star so left more than a thousand one star reviews of juliard on google
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:17.760]   tanking the school search results with negative reviews
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:22.320]   Some fans spoke of planning and in-person protest at juliard's campus
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:25.520]   Weber by the way to his credit is not encouraging it
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:30.400]   He says i do appreciate all the responses, but people are absolutely tearing them shreds i'm grateful
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:34.240]   We don't have to bash juliard. I want to spread positivity
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:36.240]   um
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:39.680]   Maybe he had something to do with all of the tiktok. Right?
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:44.240]   He was working at a as a bouncer at a pirate themed restaurant
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:48.960]   Yeah, i love the pirate theme is just the perfect
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:52.640]   I I
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:55.840]   Is there probably probably way for his audition? I
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:58.960]   I am the pirate
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:02.800]   That's all i know now. I have a monologue heart. I'd like to share with you
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:05.360]   It's too bad
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:10.400]   But again day if he didn't fit what they were looking for he didn't fit that happens
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:16.320]   Yeah, I was I was going to apply to juliard, but I saw their they only had two stars
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:25.600]   Well, they've really gone down hill. They only accept 20 kids a year. It's not a big program
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:28.880]   Uh does not mean that he is not you know
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:34.320]   He's just not right or whatever there is fit what they were looking for at that particular time
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:37.120]   That happens two million followers
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:42.240]   Including many influential content careers. It looks like he's in LA now. He'll do just fine
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:46.480]   What's hilarious is like oh, I'll have to find another way to be an actor
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:49.200]   He said to more people than saw the last
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:55.120]   One movie
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:01.600]   You're on fire, mike. Yeah, it's true
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:10.160]   He anyway, so that's I don't know. Is this good or bad or is there anything to say about this hashtag actual
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:16.880]   It is bad if juliard comes back and says hey, you know what we made a mistake that would be bad
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:23.760]   You're hired. That's that's that that would I would have a problem with that because that means they all are reacted because of some fans on
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:31.520]   A social media platform made them look bad. That's right. That's right. He does now have a talent manager in los angeles
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:36.640]   Uh, deyomie cordero who also uh represents an actor on euphoria
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:39.600]   Uh, I think he's probably gonna find
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:43.280]   There was a series of stories a few years ago about how
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:49.920]   You know, uh, hollywood tv shows and hollywood studios wanted to get in on this whole influencer thing
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:52.720]   So they thought oh will will bring in some
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:57.840]   YouTube insta, you know influencers and have them be uh have a guest spot on our show
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:01.280]   And so they would send they you know, they'd send a note
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:05.600]   To to the influencer saying hey, you know, we have a huge opportunity for you
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:11.760]   Finally you're gonna make it big and you can be on our show and they and they they get a reply from the agent saying
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:14.800]   Well, mr. So-and-so or miss so-and-so
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:17.680]   Um is willing to do that under the following conditions
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:24.880]   They need 10 million dollars and they need their own trailer and they need because the power was really at that point with the influencers and
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:27.200]   Hollywood hadn't gotten the memo every
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:33.120]   Yeah, so it was like it was really the the youtube influencer doing a favor to the tv studio
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:36.320]   They didn't get it. Let's say thought they were doing them a favor
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:42.080]   Exactly. So I think you know, I think this guy's already got his medium. I agree. I agree
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:47.200]   TikTok is kind of amazingly powerful. It really is interesting. Yeah
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:49.600]   Uh
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:53.680]   Get ready, uh android 12 l beta 2 is rolling out for pixel phones
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:56.480]   That means if i'm saying that it must be time for
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:59.200]   the
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:04.960]   In fairness of later, no way to see that
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:07.760]   That was really
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:14.160]   That that that's that's somebody taking a little break thinking i'm gonna have a katyoi pepi puff
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:17.200]   Because you wait and do another story or a four i have to worry
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:20.880]   I went a little jagata i couldn't start to walk away and then I did it of course
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:26.640]   It was very mean that was that was really mean. That's really edgy enjoyed it changed way too much
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:31.440]   Just kind of you know, I can blame it's all I blame the noa tropics. That's what's
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:36.240]   Google
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:39.040]   Is still not still no word. I keep checking my pixel
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:42.000]   Every day. Hey, sir still no update
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:48.640]   You know, you are joined now by marquez brownlee who said that his aunt hates his pixel six
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:50.240]   He says super buggy
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:56.240]   Marquez says i'm taking the sim out this thing is is gotten buggier and buggier and i'm putting it back into my samson
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:57.680]   Yes 21
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:03.040]   Because i can't i can't use i haven't had the same problems, but maybe there's hardware issues or i don't know
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:09.360]   It's clearly for me is clearly software. I don't think it's a hardware problem. I think it's the the os and
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:14.800]   It's so annoying the little things that i do i hit the back button and
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:20.000]   The screen goes back three times two or three times. Yeah versus unlike software
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:26.160]   Yeah, blue two still just randomly drops in the middle of me listening to the audiobook that we're going to discuss in the club
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:30.080]   Book club and how does the fingerprint reader work for you?
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:33.200]   Uh, that's been that's okay
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.640]   It's definitely not as good as the hardware button
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:42.240]   I just have to tell myself really press because it doesn't work if i don't really press on it
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:48.160]   Yeah, because um, I reason I ask is a marijofoli also uses a pixel six process
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:51.520]   It just doesn't work at all for her, but I think she may
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:55.360]   Um, and I have a screen protector on to yeah
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:00.960]   Here's marquez's tweet my pixel six pro has slowly gotten so buggy since launch
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:03.280]   I can no longer recommend it at $900
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:09.920]   Combined with the latest blotched update. It's just been a bad experience my sim is back in the s21 ultra till the next review
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:17.600]   Oh wow, that's pretty harsh and he has a lot he carries a lot away. He's not a tick tock star or anything like that, but
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:20.480]   But he has also been one to bat
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:23.920]   Googles pixel projects to you know
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:26.880]   This isn't just so great
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:31.360]   He says lots of small annoying things to display constantly drops way below 120 hertz
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:36.560]   The fingerprint sensor is still slower than the rest of the lock screen and auto brightness bug out all the time now
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:38.960]   The camera app has started slowing down
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:42.320]   Um, why that's sad camera did slow down for me
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:47.200]   A part of my pick of the week which we'll get into later
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:53.200]   I was out on a shoot using the camera and it was a bit slow that day and i'm thinking
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:57.840]   What is wrong? I thought it was just me but I noticed it was a little bit laggy between
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:02.320]   Making the contact with the shutter and and even navigating through the files
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:06.640]   But yeah, I saw seems like software to me not hardware
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:10.160]   He says he's on the November patches as most of us are except for those
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:12.720]   unfortunate few who got the
[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:18.560]   update by accident or early when they lost all connectivity that bork did more the bork did even more
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:22.080]   Anyway, they're doing the 12L beta 2 right now
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:25.760]   Which means we might be getting close they had said it'll be delayed
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:31.040]   And you know the the update which supposedly will fix many of these issues
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:34.640]   Uh was supposed to be released in December. It'll be delayed
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:41.600]   Um, they say there'll be one more beta next month before the consumer release what?
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:44.240]   in q1 march
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:47.120]   That's where dakk oh my gosh
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:51.840]   That's ridiculous. You know what i'm starting to agree with we're with you mike sunda but shy
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:54.400]   Not doing the job
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:59.040]   Some some somebody needs to take the control of that company. Yeah, say look folks
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:04.320]   We got a too big os right now with an expensive piece of hardware that people can enjoy
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:07.520]   We need to fix our slag already gone through testing
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:12.240]   Uh before we released it. So yeah, this needs to be priority one
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:16.960]   What you know, maybe rick osterlo lost his mojo or something. I don't know
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:20.400]   I don't know
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:24.720]   Uh 12L is not the pixel fix. Sorry. Okay 12L is something else. Sorry
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:28.880]   That's that's coming out. I don't know when the pixel fix is coming out
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:36.560]   Here's what google is changing uh to speaker group controls and device setup to uh, uh, uh, uh,
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:38.560]   A piece sonos
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:44.240]   Uh, the first change applies when setting up and updating your smart display or speaker a small set of users
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:49.280]   Will need to use the device utility app to complete product installation and updates
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:54.240]   You may jeez louise you may receive a prompt to download and run dua
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:58.960]   And it will ensure your devices connect to wifi and receives the most updated version
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:03.840]   It only has to be used once during the initial setup of devices that don't have the latest
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:06.320]   Ah, I get it
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:10.160]   The non infringing firmware so the duo will immediately fix
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:12.880]   your firmware to be non infringing
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:15.200]   and then
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:19.920]   You'll now have to adjust each speaker individually instead of being able to use the group volume control
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:26.560]   That was a nice feature. I remember on my sonos speakers one slider would turn everybody in the whole house up and down
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:28.880]   It's not so bad. You're gonna get
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:33.360]   This is an example of on the screen, you know a number of sliders and you can
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:35.680]   control those
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:38.960]   Third party devices have to be updated to new cast firmware
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:43.200]   Besides the volume change google says speaker group functionality remains the same
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:45.680]   um
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:49.360]   Most most speaker group should continue to function as expected
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:51.680]   unless
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:58.400]   You have a speaker group containing other brands of cast based devices like jbl or linnovo then they need to be on 1.5
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:03.760]   2.27222 or higher cast firmware blah blah blah
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:12.000]   So, uh, you know the trade commission ruled against him said we're not going to ban your devices
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000]   But you better fix this and this is the fix
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.120]   The pixel launcher at a glance widget if you are
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:24.000]   Using a pixel phone is going to have doorbell camera previews
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.800]   Uh, this is also part of the android 12 update
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:31.760]   You'll be able to customize the at a glance
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:33.840]   widget
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:39.840]   And even look at that even have a little picture on the at a glance see that right there of somebody at your doorbell
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:43.600]   That's kind of cool. Yeah, sure. Yeah
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:54.080]   Means nothing if the existing platform is it working? I think you're right. Let's let's not worry so much about that. Let's get the thing working
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:57.040]   Yeah, that's phone fix people. Yeah
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:59.840]   Uh
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:00.880]   This is good
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:02.720]   You may remember that google
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:08.720]   Started doing system patches to android through google's play store updates because they could push those without the carrier
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:12.800]   Blocking them, uh, they could push them to older phones and so forth
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:18.560]   So now they're finally and they never did this giving you a log of what's been changed
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:23.920]   When you get the play system update just as you do when you get a version update now you can go
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:29.280]   And click the google play system update and it will tell you you can manually update
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:36.720]   Uh, but it'll also tell you what is happening. There's a new support page that spells out what's new in the patches
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:39.120]   Here's the january 22nd
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:42.960]   2022 I should say patch the critical fixes
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:46.320]   Uh, and here's the play store play as you download feature
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:49.200]   New features. So this is one way
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:56.080]   Uh, google's updating phones that are not this is not part of the monthly security update
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:59.280]   So that's good to get that information now available
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:02.080]   Uh on your phone and also online
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:04.960]   and finally
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:06.960]   google launches ripple
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:13.040]   And open standard that could bring tiny radars to forward cars
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:19.840]   So I didn't know this but google has been building radar chips for about seven years
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:24.480]   Uh, that's what tells you how you sleep that radar in my
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:30.400]   Paddle not that paddle the other paddle the sleep paddle under my bed. Uh, you can control
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:32.880]   Wait what
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:37.520]   I want I want a diagram of all the all the electronics
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:40.480]   Just stop
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:44.080]   Where do you put your paddle
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:46.080]   Anyway, uh
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:52.000]   In the basement of course. Oh, yeah, the dungeon. Well, you gotta okay. So you have one in the dungeon, but you might need one
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.640]   There might be discipline needed. Uh, other times. I'm just saying
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:56:59.280]   Uh, you can control
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:01.200]   Oh
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:07.520]   The company's solely radar. That's the solely, uh, of course was in the last pickle of phones, but uh,
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:09.920]   Uh
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:13.840]   Didn't didn't really get that's the one where you could go like this to your phone and make it do things
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:21.360]   Now there is an open source api standard c if stacey were here she could probably explain this called ripple that will basically put solely
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:24.160]   in so li in
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:26.240]   Automobiles and other things
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:28.320]   um
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:30.640]   ripple quote this is from my
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:33.280]   Yvonne pupa ref
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:37.760]   The man who led the team at google's a taps conquarks that came up with solely
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:40.240]   Uh
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:45.920]   pupa ref says ripple will unlock helpful innovation that benefits everyone
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:54.160]   General purpose radar is a key emerging technology for solving critical use cases in the privacy respecting way
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:59.600]   The ripple project is open source on github. Oh, well, maybe not it's copyright
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:02.480]   But it is on github
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:04.640]   Well, I thought it's open source so
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:08.400]   So it depends on what you define as open source you oh
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:12.880]   Publishing the source does not necessarily make it open source. It's the license that matters
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:19.280]   It's open source ishish. You have to sign a google open source license agreement to participate
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:26.240]   Couple of things when they first rolled out solely they were talking about a very sophisticated
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:32.400]   Technology that could detect the finest movements they they were promising that someday
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:38.560]   Google would have solely on smartwatches and you'd be able to change the time by just moving your fingers ever so slightly
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:42.720]   And then oh yeah, I remember the actual implementation of it is like big big movements
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:48.720]   But I just it could be a problem in a car if it's implemented and somebody accidentally
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:53.280]   You know flip somebody off and then that's perceived as a gesture for turning the
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:57.280]   The radio on full blast or something like that. I don't know
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:04.720]   I'm not sure how this is going to be implemented, but hopefully for it would not tell the verge what it plans to do with solely but
[01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:09.520]   Only that it's looking at using quote interior radar
[01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:13.680]   To do things its exterior radars aren't doing today
[01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:16.480]   What did that mean?
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:21.520]   Well people should should should know that the the self-driving cars of the future
[01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:27.200]   Will have as many sensors pointing at the dash as there are sensors outside how come
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:33.280]   Pointing at the world because a big part of how how they'll function is they'll constantly be detecting
[01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:36.160]   Emotion stress conflict
[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:40.800]   They really want to see who is that who's in the car so they can customize
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:45.120]   Information settings and the seats and all that kind of stuff
[01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:47.360]   so there's a huge amount of
[01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:53.360]   Effort in Silicon Valley to build up all these sensors they want to see if
[01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:58.160]   Even before the the self-driving cars are self-driving
[01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:02.720]   Want to make sure that if people are falling asleep or if they're drunk they want to be able to tell all that
[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:09.040]   Through sensors so they can turn on or turn off certain safety features certain self-driving features
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:11.360]   And so this it looks like
[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:14.800]   Google has decided to jump into that existing
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:22.160]   nascent market with an existing technology it was originally promised for smartphones and wearables so
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:26.640]   That's basically appears to be what this is and they you know
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:30.880]   They they taught they don't talk so much about super future stuff because they want to get in early
[02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:36.240]   There are certain startups that specialize in this kind of thing that are kind of gobbling up all the mind share
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:42.480]   For car makers, but so I think google wants to sort of get in there and establish themselves as
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:50.000]   A technology that car makers want to use and build into their cars not just car makers. There there's like pet chip
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.800]   Pet collar chip makers that want to
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:56.160]   Measure your dogs internals like blood
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:01:02.400]   You know pressure and heart rate and temperature with one of these things they the amazon's apparently looking into
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:09.520]   Bed sensors to measure sleep so lots of uses for this. That's actually the fact is that with AI and and
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:12.160]   increasingly better sensors
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:18.000]   Everything and anything including as we learned light bulbs will be able to detect the state of being
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:22.240]   Uh in multiple ways and this is especially going to be true inside cars
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:26.320]   And in our homes and our desks and so on but especially in cars
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:31.840]   There's another company blue meo has a dev kit for a radar based blood pressure sensor
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:36.720]   So that's interesting. So there's gonna be a lot of health implications as well. So good. Soly's not dead
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:38.560]   It was a cool technology
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:42.080]   The pixel 4 did not show it off. Well, nobody used it and so they took it out
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:46.000]   But I think there are lots of uses for it. Yeah, and now it's called ripple
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.440]   and that's the google change
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:58.320]   Couple more stories before we get to our picks of the weekly associated press is going to sell in fts
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:03.680]   Now that now that makes them totally uncool and so nobody's gonna do them anymore
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:09.680]   But when I was a kid, I wanted to wear a nayroo jacket my parents wouldn't let me yeah, then johnny karson wore it
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:12.880]   Okay, now you can wear it and I said no, I don't want to wear it johnny's wearing it
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:15.520]   Uh
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:20.640]   You probably put this in uh, new york times buys the athletic. What is the athletic?
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:25.840]   The athletic is i'm glad we're a fellow um non-jock here
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:31.920]   Um, it is a uh kind of the major brand for a pay walled
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:36.480]   Service covering major sports. Oh and can probably tell us more
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:41.520]   Do you subscribe to the athletic and I do not because it was pay walled. Oh, yeah, right?
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:44.240]   1.2
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:48.960]   I paid for a better level that wasn't one. No
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:54.480]   Uh, 1.2 main subscribers what it tells me is that the times
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:03:00.000]   Is going to create a whole bunch of subscription products when they were they report how many subscribers they have 8 billion subscribers
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:08.240]   That counts separately but included in one one bucket the new subscribers the food subscribers and the puzzle subscribers
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:12.000]   Yeah, I subscribed to new york times cross-reposals new york times cooking
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.120]   Wirecutter has a subscription right?
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:19.520]   Um and then in the newspaper, I think though I buy one subscription
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:24.000]   That covers it all or but the point here is that if all you're subscribed to is food
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:28.560]   You are counted as a new york times. Yes. Well, why not? That's his revenue for the new york
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:34.560]   I mean, I think that's probably a revenue stream. I think what they did was they got a million to add it in and um
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:38.160]   uh, so so my friend erin pil over who's at
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:41.760]   uh temple university is brilliant x New york times x guardian
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:46.400]   Uh wrote this piece that I have in there saying that this is dangerous for local newspapers
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:48.880]   There's been a lot of debate about this. This is mean the times
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:51.280]   Is going to come after the local newspapers?
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:55.520]   And if you subscribe to the Chronicle just because you want giants coverage
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:04:01.680]   Uh, do you say well screw it? I'll study i'll do the new york times the athletic because they offer me a bundle deal and I don't like the local papers and that's it
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:05.120]   I don't know. This is what's happened in cable television
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:11.680]   All the cable companies including nfox and others have created new sports channels where they do local sports
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:14.800]   in in direct competition to the local channels
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:20.800]   And they furthermore they cover local local sports probably better in a more d i's gonna say i
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:25.840]   I've enjoyed that. Yeah, it's been good. It's been good for sports fans. Absolutely
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:30.640]   You can you get clams and games here? Probably through a I do. Yeah
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:36.560]   Streaming or that's not that's not like you didn't want to confess something. Oh, I haven't I haven't no i'm saying I haven't missed
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:38.320]   I haven't missed a beat
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:41.200]   Uh with what is it fs one? I believe is how it is?
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:45.840]   Yeah fox sports one. Yeah. Yeah, and it's it's been great to be able to see the
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:52.480]   The regional stuff, you know, I know that would know why's over here cares about app state university, but i'm curious
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:56.800]   I think that's the idea with the athletic right you've got 270 teams 47 markets
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:01.600]   You get local coverage and I think that could be a threat to the chronicle and other local
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:04.240]   So the a lot of came also also when it started
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:09.440]   They said we're gonna and they did this we're gonna steal all the best sports writers from all of these papers in the country
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:13.280]   They did they got them. Yeah, and then they built a subscription product
[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:17.280]   Uh, I don't understand this maybe and maybe because explain this to me
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:24.240]   Uh esp and as I understand it has kind of been on a somewhat of a downward slope, but I don't understand why that is
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:34.800]   Um because the esp and has been sensationalizing things that shouldn't necessarily be sensationalized in my opinion. Um, there's a lot of
[02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:42.720]   What they call them top plays that are nothing and they just play it over and over and over and over again
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:46.080]   And it's not connecting to the true sports fans. It's more
[02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:51.680]   Generalized it's link base. The ball is a yeah link bait basketball is a great game, but
[02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:58.560]   Not everything in basketball is a slam dunk, you know, and that's what esp and it's been doing for the last so far
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:02.720]   That's really true. I never even thought of that but it takes away from the idea of there's a strategic hole
[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:08.400]   There's a plan. There's a way a team plays. You're just focusing on that one shot
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:12.960]   Right. I never thought of that, but that really does take it away youtube tv has this feature
[02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:19.520]   Uh, I was working on sunday during the the big niners game the last game of the season where they had to beat the rams to get in the play
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:22.080]   Yeah, and um
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:25.520]   But when you go home and watch youtube tv it has the key plays
[02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:29.440]   And there's 49 of them which was showed you what a crazy game it was
[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:33.680]   And uh, so lisa and I said because she didn't watch it either. It was too stressful for her
[02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:37.600]   We sat down we watched the 49 plays, but it's completely out of context
[02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:39.680]   It's actually not a very satisfying experience
[02:06:39.680 --> 02:06:44.160]   You're seeing the touchdowns and the great passes and stuff, but it's like boom boom boom boom boom
[02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:47.200]   And you don't get the get get the shape of the game
[02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:54.720]   I don't have a problem with highlights, but I think there's a nuanced way of doing highlights to report the story of okay
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:07:00.000]   Team a play team b and team a was down for a little bit
[02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:07.120]   But team a was able to prevail and win the game. I think there's a nice way of doing that and not just having every single thing
[02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:08.560]   shown be
[02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:12.640]   a touchdown, I think there are a number of factors you're one of them is sports betting
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:21.280]   Uh, there's that because uh, you know big business if you're it gets to the point where all you care about is the overunder
[02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:22.880]   What's the score, you know?
[02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:28.240]   Uh, what's the other point of this purchase is that the athletic has been pure subscription revenue no advertising
[02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:31.920]   So the New York Times can bring advertising to but what's the big advertising in sports
[02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:36.160]   In the old newspaper days it was tires now it's sports betting
[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:41.440]   It's gamble and how much is your time is going to be doing for better and it's a little I think concerning they take a cut
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:44.080]   Uh of sports betting
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:46.800]   So suddenly they're profiting based on the take
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:53.760]   Which I think is complete. I mean, that's uh, let's put Pete rose in the hall of fame in that case because uh, right same thing
[02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:55.680]   completely
[02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:58.720]   Here in New York because New York just opened up a sports betting online
[02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:04.720]   Caesar's has been ever has like crazy and you see you see players in the ads. Yeah. Yeah, same thing
[02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:10.480]   Yeah, well, that's all gone. You know, this is more of the you know world timers
[02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:16.080]   Yeah, the world has changed so I get a question for you all three of you
[02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:20.320]   Um, we we've been approached by a sports betting very big name
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:22.960]   Group to do advertising and I said no
[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:26.080]   Should I say yes to that?
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:29.840]   Why don't well I
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:33.360]   It's easy to get any different made from us talking about
[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:40.480]   Crypto because that's a bit of a gamble. We do some crypto ads. Yeah, I mean, we don't add do ads specifically for crypto
[02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:42.480]   But there's a credit card with crypto
[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:45.040]   Uh rewards. I think we have coinbase
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:49.760]   So yeah, we have some crypto on here and for a while I was a little funny about that. We don't do e-sigs
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:52.880]   I don't know. It's a little weird. I mean
[02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:55.520]   Uh, uh, what do you think mike should I should I
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:09:00.080]   Just am I being all I think I think you called it. I mean, I've I've always um
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:07.120]   Uh loved your advertising because they're actually really great products and I basically I think I've bought every single thing
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:10.480]   You've advertised that a person who doesn't have a house could possibly buy
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:13.680]   And he's getting me like that too
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:19.840]   Yeah, and so it's like so the there's stuff where it's like yeah, I want that I know I want that and there are other things where it's like
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:24.080]   Well, I don't know if I wanted or not, but if it's being advertised on twit then I probably do want it
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:25.360]   So I'll just get it
[02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:29.840]   And if you veer off into it, you know, I think a lot of tech people are like me which is that
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:36.560]   Not interested in sports. A lot of tech people are interested in sports. Of course, but yeah, I don't know it just seems like it's uh
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:44.960]   It seems like it's a detour from the the the the the the policy that has worked very well at least from
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:48.160]   as a consumer. I mean because
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:52.480]   Advertising has been a little scant in in you know our natural
[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:53.760]   um
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:59.360]   environs we've been willing to you know we people still get a hard time about doing landscaping ads but um
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:07.600]   So I accept ads in a broader range of categories and we thought we would just because to keep the lights on yeah, keep the lights on
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:13.600]   Yeah, but but see when when you do the landscaping ads you you you're going after really really good products
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.920]   So I don't know anything about sports betting or any that world at all if it's a superior product or if it's you know
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:25.360]   Something like that if you personally would use it or whatever. I don't like to I feel like I think my personal philosophy is
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:27.920]   Gambling is a sucker's bet
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:35.520]   And I know I think I don't want to promote I wouldn't take lottery tickets either. You know, that's the problem. I'm the same way with lottery
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:36.960]   Yeah
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:42.000]   And yet, I mean, I don't want to be I'm not it's not a moral judgment. I just right I don't know
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:46.560]   I had a really think well it is it is a it is a regressive redistribution of wealth
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:50.240]   But so is everything
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:53.600]   So is the point I would like to redistribute some wealth myself
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:11:01.120]   Like I said the same can be said about the stock market the same could be yeah crypto is all gambling in a certain
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:06.240]   It is and I so it's a it's of you know, it's a challenge, you know, it's uh, yeah
[02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:12.320]   Uh, not to mention the fact that my wife is runs the business of self-defertizing so
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:14.720]   I have to deal with
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:16.960]   Deal with her when I say no
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:22.480]   So that's another gamble. Yeah, she's actually really supportive. She you know, she said well, you don't want to do this do you? I said no
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:26.400]   It's we were we were in agreement on that so yeah, yeah
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:32.000]   Let's take a little break final words your picks of the week. Thank you so much for being here, mike
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:37.040]   I really appreciate your feeling and unless I'd be here last minute notice. It's always great to have you on really appreciate
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:40.320]   I want to tell you about code academy by the way
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:45.040]   I know a lot of people are ask me how I want to get into coding. It's one of my passions
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:46.800]   I love it. It's my hobby
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:50.320]   And they say where's a good way to do it? I think code academy is a great way
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:55.280]   Whether you want to become a programmer and if it's a really good place if you want to get a new career as a programmer
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:58.960]   You're just getting out of school and you want to brush up your skills, but it's also a great place
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:05.200]   I've taken their classes just to kind of learn a new language or brush up. They've got some they actually have some really great
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:06.720]   um
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:10.720]   Uh, what do they call them? I can't remember but they little cards with the reference cards
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:15.840]   and stuff like that. There's lots of great tools code academy is a great place to learn to code
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:21.200]   There's never been a better time to become a programmer with code academy. You can code in your own terms
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:26.000]   Over 50. This is an amazing number 50 million people
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.600]   Already know code academy is the best way to learn to code
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:36.800]   That's because code academy not only teaches you job ready coding skills. It helps you build unique projects for your portfolio
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:41.680]   That's very important earned certificates. That's also important even prep for technical interviews
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:44.320]   One of the things I love about code academy
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:52.320]   Is your coding from day one and they have classes i've taken their python classes, but they have classes in html css
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:57.920]   They've got a whole new swift track if you want to learn to write for the most popular smartphone platform
[02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:03.280]   Uh swift is a great language. Apple's all swift now with code academy. You can learn at your own pace
[02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:09.200]   Great way to get qualified for jobs that are in high demand whether it's building basic websites
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:13.280]   to artificial intelligence to robotics and everything in between
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:20.880]   You don't need to be uh experience you can start from zero and you will literally be with your very first
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:26.880]   Day writing real working code in minutes and I think that's very important when you hit that submit button
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:31.120]   You'll know immediately instant feedback. Did your code work? Why not?
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:34.720]   You get feedback so that you're get on the right track
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:39.200]   sequel javascript. I mentioned python html
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:44.400]   Uh, here's a great way to start go right now to code academy.com
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:46.400]   C-o-d-e
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:47.680]   C-a-d-e
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:51.680]   M-y.com use a promo code twig so they know you saw it here
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:58.640]   You'll get they have a little programming personality quiz, which is nice because it's not like testing you for math
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:01.280]   it's merely
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:05.760]   Uh, asking you about your how you think what you like what and it will help you
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:11.920]   Decide what area to go into when Lisa did it it knew immediately. She's a numbers person
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:17.200]   They said you should learn r you should learn statistics. You could be good at this. They said I should I should get into
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:23.120]   Computer science and algorithms. They're absolutely right. Absolutely right. That's my my passion
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:29.600]   So the course recommendations after you take the quiz will be based on things that you're interested in. It's really cool

[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:35.920]   Had a code
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:39.120]   Best thing you'll ever learn. I gotta tell you so much fun
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:42.560]   Uh, let's see
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:46.080]   Um, have I told you the story of the la pd cops who?
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:51.360]   Instead of answering a radio call to a robbery in progress at a local mall decided to
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:54.080]   Play pokemon go have I told you that story?
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:56.080]   Wait, what?
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:15:58.880]   It's the greatest this happened in 2017, but
[02:15:58.880 --> 02:16:01.680]   They appealed it saying
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:06.880]   Uh, hey this uh, this in car digital incar video system
[02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:11.920]   Which caught our comments and conversation shouldn't be used against us
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:18.320]   Uh, so they've privacy case. Yeah, it's a privacy case. Oh, California appeals court
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:22.640]   upheld the firings from four years ago
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:25.600]   um
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:27.600]   so
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:33.760]   And I you know, I guess it is a privacy, uh thing, but um, yeah on the other hand, I think public safety
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:39.120]   Uh officers, uh, we you know, we make them wear body camps. There's good reasons for that
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:44.800]   Yeah, and honestly they there was a little malfeasance here. They were on a patrol
[02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:53.520]   Uh, when a radio call to respond to a robbery in progress with several suspects at a macy's in the grandshaw mall came in
[02:16:54.800 --> 02:16:56.960]   They told their supervisor they didn't hear the call
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:17:00.720]   But the recording showed they ignored attempts to reach them
[02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:04.400]   This is from the actual court ruling that came down this week
[02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:10.560]   After communications made a second attempt to contact petitioners officer lasano asked if they should
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:16.080]   Ask communications if there's a message officer mitchell replied well, it's up to you whatever you think
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:21.360]   I don't want them to think we're not paying attention to the radio lasano responded ask screw it
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:23.920]   Okay
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:25.840]   Uh
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:29.440]   officer mitchell alerted lasano that's snorlax
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:34.560]   A pokemon co-character had just popped up at 42nd 46th and laymark
[02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:37.520]   Um, we have primate
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:41.200]   After
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:45.440]   After noting that laymark doesn't go all the way up to 46 lasano said oh, you know what I can do
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:49.440]   I'll go down 11th and swing up on cranksha. I know a way I can get to it
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:53.040]   Mitchell suggested a different route told lasano. We got four minutes
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:56.640]   For the approximately the next 20 minutes the in car
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:03.760]   Video system captured petitioners discussing pokemon as they drove to different locations where the virtual characters
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:08.160]   Apparently appeared on their mobile phones on the way to their snorlax location
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:14.400]   Officer mitchell alerted officer lasano that a toga tick had just popped up just south the 50th
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:18.000]   Mitchell caught the snorlax explaining got him
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:22.720]   And then let's go get the toga tick and they drove off
[02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:28.160]   When the car stopped the recording recorded officer mitchell saying don't run away don't run away
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:33.920]   lasano described how he buried it and ultra balled the toga tick before announcing got him
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:39.680]   Mitchell advised he was still trying to catch it adding holy crap man. This thing is fighting the crap out of me
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:46.080]   I think i think there's movie rights to be purchased here eventually mitchell exclaimed holy crap finally
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:52.560]   Apparently in reference to capturing the toga tick and he remarked the guys are going to be so jealous
[02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:56.320]   We're unemployed
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:19:01.120]   So the crooks got away toga tick not so much the toga tick not so much
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:06.080]   A lot of people don't realize I don't know how this affects law enforcement, but in the united states
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:08.960]   The laws are very friendly for surveilling
[02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:11.200]   um employees
[02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:16.880]   Yes in general. Yes and oh, you know first first of all part of it is the dereliction of duty
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:22.800]   Apparently part of it is the use of of taxpayer funded resources like a gasoline
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:24.640]   to chase
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:26.640]   uh, pokemon characters and so on
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:32.000]   So, you know, I I don't think this is really so much of a privacy issue
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:38.720]   Right there were they were there was in a in a police owned car using police owned equipment
[02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:43.920]   To actually do something pure in their hours in dereliction of of you know public safety
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:44.800]   so
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:48.080]   There there is a notice that they were given that uh
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:51.920]   For this the di cvs system is used
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:57.520]   Uh as a tool for crime documentation and prosecution not to monitor private conversations
[02:19:57.520 --> 02:20:03.040]   But there is a notice that says it won't be used to initiate a personnel complaint investigation
[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:06.640]   Or used against an employee in the adjudication of a personal complaint
[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:11.280]   Unless there's evidence of criminal or egregious misconduct
[02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:16.000]   And the court said uh that notice is sufficient
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:21.920]   To protect for minor, you know or private per-perly private communications
[02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:26.320]   But it's too much to ask that commanding officers be forced to ignore
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:27.840]   egregious
[02:20:27.840 --> 02:20:33.520]   Misconduct that is in an unintentionally captured on the recording. So the court said no no you can fire these guys
[02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:38.400]   In fact they did four years ago, but they got the snorlax and that's that's really all that matters
[02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:42.800]   That they cared about clearly. Can you imagine you measure the conversation at home?
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:45.280]   You got fired for doing what
[02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:52.480]   In in all fairness, uh, this is 2017 pokemon go was all the rage
[02:20:52.480 --> 02:20:54.000]   I remember lee sennai
[02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:58.240]   Many the times we've come into work later had to stop somewhere to
[02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:03.680]   Her election of duty dereliction of duty. We've done it. I admit it. I'm jamer bee sitting there in the booth waiting
[02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:08.400]   There's no leo still waiting
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:12.960]   Interesting new plan from
[02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:15.840]   wise
[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:18.640]   W y z e we're fans of them. I would
[02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:25.600]   Uh, I would love to get stacey's take on this one as well. Well, she'll be back. Yeah, well, well, but um
[02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:30.400]   We love wise wise this stuff is very inexpensive
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:36.080]   What I didn't know is after nearly going bankrupt during the onset of the pandemic
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:39.600]   We launched cam prop plus our premium service
[02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:43.760]   It's a subscription service with ai and cloud storage features
[02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:52.480]   Um last year after much soul searching we had some of it a light bulb moment and started experimenting with a name your price concept
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:55.040]   So
[02:21:55.040 --> 02:22:00.000]   When we gave a premium feature to users with no obligation to pay for it many users voluntarily
[02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:05.840]   Paid for it anywhere to support fellow wise community members. I think this is one of the service part not the hardware part
[02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:09.360]   Yeah, yeah, the hardware you still pay for but it's like they're cheap. There's like 20 bucks
[02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:14.000]   And they they almost went on at a business. I didn't know that either
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:17.920]   Because of the pandemic a lot of businesses have gone of course
[02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:21.440]   Um, and so they tried the subscription business and they thought you know what?
[02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:25.920]   But this is and this is a measure of the goodwill people have to wise. Yes
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:31.840]   So they're going to expand the name your price experiment starting now to all current users
[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:35.520]   It's called meat. I'm sorry. It's called cam plus light
[02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:41.920]   12 second event recordings and a wise person detection of whatever price you choose including zero bucks
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:47.360]   But they're they're faith in their customers who do let's face it love them
[02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:50.000]   People love wise
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.080]   Right. I think that's great
[02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:54.800]   There's such an innovative company. It's yeah
[02:22:55.920 --> 02:22:59.680]   So i'll be i'll be very curious about this experiment
[02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:03.920]   But good for good on them. They're gonna make a another email
[02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:06.400]   uh from wise this is uh
[02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:09.440]   Where'd it go?
[02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:16.320]   Is a free upgrade to something for a i package including person detection pet detection yada yada yada yada
[02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:20.400]   For people that already have whatever this cam plus package is
[02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:24.560]   Um, heck. I thought I was already getting that but how much
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:27.600]   It just says free free
[02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:33.040]   It's not zero dollars or whatever you want to pay. It's just free free. Yeah, this is hey cam plus users
[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:37.200]   This is a free upgrade for being a kentress user interesting
[02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:40.400]   And then i thought i was going to say it came after that
[02:23:40.400 --> 02:23:43.440]   Sorry about that
[02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:46.960]   Why is this gonna start selling qubit tests? Yes, I saw that too
[02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:53.360]   Anything sold masks for a while. Yeah, you know what though. This is an example of
[02:23:54.160 --> 02:23:59.840]   Uh, make a company people love that gives good value for dollar and people will help you they'll support you
[02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:02.000]   Yeah, stick with you and they'll stick with you
[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:05.520]   Um, I think it's great good for them
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:12.160]   They're also one of the few companies that's similar to apple in the sense that if they come out with an entirely new product
[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:16.160]   People just buy it. Yep. They assume it's going to be a good value and it's going to work great. Yep
[02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:18.880]   And um, that's that's pretty rare
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:21.760]   That you know people don't wait for the reviews. They pre-order
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:26.160]   Products in an entirely new category like the vacuum cleaner and all that kind of stuff
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:29.760]   And uh, they've got really really a passionate user base
[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:36.080]   Nice. I gotta also give a little credit if you want to learn to code to your son kevin's
[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:40.080]   Uh wonderful project this uh tell us a little bit
[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:42.640]   uh about uh
[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:43.840]   Is it
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:52.080]   Chatter box chatter. That's right. Is it hello? I always remember the you are hello chatter box.com hello chatter box. Okay. Yeah, that's right
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:55.440]   Uh, this is a smart speaker for anyone
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:58.320]   Ages nine and up
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:02.000]   You build it yourself. It's the outside is made out of cardboard, which is very inexpensive
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:06.640]   And once you've constructed it you have a smart speaker that does literally nothing
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:12.880]   Until you go to this lego-like skills builder and build any skills you want it does
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:19.600]   It does anything any smart speaker does but you have to build each and every skill yourself and in doing so
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:22.400]   children learn that
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:29.120]   AI is just something that's been programmed by a person they learn how they work they learn all the parts
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:34.960]   And it's basically teaches what what kevin calls a ai literacy. So
[02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:39.360]   Kids who are alive today are the first generation ever
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:42.960]   uh to grow up in a world where a
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:47.040]   Artificially intelligent voice is talking to them every day
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:52.800]   And so it's important for this generation especially to understand what it is that's happening there
[02:25:52.800 --> 02:25:55.920]   Because this is the interface that's going to be with them their whole lives
[02:25:55.920 --> 02:26:03.440]   And they learn all kinds of stem skills. They learn logic skills and language skills because they're they're basically constructing conversations
[02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:06.640]   And it's very flexible. So you can say things like if I say
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:14.800]   What's the weather? How's the weather outside? Do I need an umbrella? You can you can have any number of things that trigger the response to go
[02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:20.160]   Using apis to get the weather and so on what ages what age is these are pretty little nine years old
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:22.960]   And up now I'm guessing that
[02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:29.040]   A lot of customers are adults who who just want a smart speaker that's super private fun to play with yeah
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:35.120]   Super fun to play with and but but it's it's really targeted at schools and and um
[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:41.520]   And also parents who want to buy one for their for their kid and again anyone who wants to tinker. I mean it's it's very
[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:43.440]   um
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:48.240]   If people want to to use a raspberry pie for example, there are a lot of raspberry pies out there
[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:49.840]   This is based on raspberry pie
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:55.280]   This is like the most fantastic thing ever to get you can get the the version that has no raspberry pie with it
[02:26:55.280 --> 02:27:01.200]   If you've already got one and just use the raspberry pie you have but it's really fantastic and it has some features that actually
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:05.280]   Alexa and some of the other smart speakers should have for example, it's got a button on it
[02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:08.560]   So it doesn't listen to you press the bell. I really like that idea. I agree
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:15.360]   Then all the communication is disentangled from the user so there's no way for chatterbox or any of the companies that
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:21.440]   Uh that have a api's that chatterbox access is there's no way for anybody to know who's using it
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:25.440]   So there's no possibility of monetization of privacy
[02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:28.800]   Uh violation or any of that stuff so it's very very secure
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:36.240]   And one of the things that kevin talks about is that it's it's a good idea to get kids used to the idea that the privacy
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:41.600]   Is not being violated because part of the ronomectonald's business model of a lot of
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:46.720]   Companies is just by the time kids are old enough to make their own decisions. They've been
[02:27:46.720 --> 02:27:49.360]   Uh, they've been
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:54.160]   Surveillance they've been their their data's already been collected their biometrics have already been collected
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:58.960]   You know, this is true of people by the time they're 10 years old. All this has already happened and they're used to it
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:00.720]   And this is
[02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:06.480]   You know, this is by design. This is this I think is why amazon for example has all these children's products
[02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:08.480]   They want kids to be used to the idea that
[02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:12.160]   You know, their data is being used and then it's being used for marketing and so on
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:16.640]   And so chatterbox doesn't do any of that stuff. It gets kids used to the idea that they have total privacy
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:19.600]   Love it. Hello chatterbox.com
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:25.120]   And uh, and of course mics the gastronomad will be off to moraca when he leaves
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:32.720]   Well, uh, we're gonna leave in uh next month if you can I think on the 16th if we can we're going to spain for a little bit
[02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:38.080]   And then we're going to moraco for a while. We always spent a lot of time before the experiences
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:42.880]   Uh to touch base with everybody to make sure that everything's awesome
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:47.200]   And so we're looking forward to that if it happens. Nice. You think it will but nice
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:49.760]   If our fingers crossed. Yeah
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:54.080]   It was so much fun going on. Well, haka. I can't wait to do more. I'm so glad I had a great time
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:29:00.160]   Yeah, uh, if you guys it was so so great. It's not a wonderful. Yeah, you saw us dancing to the pulkey
[02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:03.040]   [laughter]
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:04.880]   That was before the show. Thank god
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:07.680]   jeff javus a number
[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:10.320]   so uh this week
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:14.960]   Jack the one named jack at jack jack dorsey
[02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:20.240]   Yes, just tweeted simply a link to attack on public peace how to standardize on utc to support remote work
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:22.880]   Which makes perfect sense that we hear about utc on the show all the time
[02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:29.600]   And i just brought an idle curiosity to mind because this struck me the utc is the is the is the successor to grenish
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:31.600]   meantime, which is an incredibly
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:36.720]   Colonial way to look at the world. Yes, that's where i use utc
[02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:42.960]   Um, well, even though it is grenish bean still right right. Um, so I wonder what is the most
[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:45.520]   populous
[02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:47.520]   uh time zone. Oh
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:49.680]   like that should be
[02:29:49.680 --> 02:29:56.160]   Where you got it. That's the center of the world. Yeah, what is the utc plus eight
[02:29:57.200 --> 02:30:00.960]   Here which covers 1.7 billion people
[02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:06.560]   24 of the world's population in that time zone parts of in in isha is t more
[02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:12.240]   western parts of korea parts of north east china eastern more parts of western australia second part may leisha
[02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:17.040]   Um inner mongolia some parts of russia. I think that's more fair
[02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:19.120]   I mean, I wish we could use of the world's pep
[02:30:19.120 --> 02:30:20.880]   everywhere
[02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:24.480]   But that would confuse people when the sun rises at two aam and stuff but
[02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:28.800]   uh, so utc plus eight utc should start there instead of
[02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:33.920]   That's the center of the world. That's that was just an idle curiosity interest and god bless the google
[02:30:33.920 --> 02:30:38.400]   I look and took one second to find if you want to disrupt the fewest people
[02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:42.880]   a quarter of the world's population utc should start there
[02:30:42.880 --> 02:30:46.160]   and and um
[02:30:46.160 --> 02:30:53.600]   I wonder where so so what is utc to australia is if you're where does uh is it sindony where we always see the first
[02:30:54.400 --> 02:30:56.400]   um new yurziv stuff
[02:30:56.400 --> 02:30:58.560]   Yeah, yeah, so it's that's the
[02:30:58.560 --> 02:31:05.840]   It's actually that's farther east. It's the uh, this time zone is the eastern most parts of western australia
[02:31:05.840 --> 02:31:11.200]   So sydney is utc plus 11. Yeah, that's a big difference three hours difference. Yeah
[02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:14.240]   That's a good question. Yeah, so
[02:31:14.240 --> 02:31:17.120]   Interesting curiosity. I actually had a number two
[02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:20.000]   Yes, this is from ben beheron
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:23.760]   Who uh is actually quoting a morgan stanley note
[02:31:24.560 --> 02:31:26.560]   on autonomous vehicles
[02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:31.360]   morgan stanley said autonomous cars are the mother of all iotai projects
[02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:38.880]   But this is the number that's interesting it'll unlock more than a trillion hours a year of human attention
[02:31:38.880 --> 02:31:46.560]   Which we which is a the scarce commodity people want to buy we spend that much time driving
[02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:48.400]   Uh
[02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:52.080]   morgan says we forecast total human hours including passengers
[02:31:52.080 --> 02:31:55.680]   Spend side cars will rise from more than 600 billion hours
[02:31:55.680 --> 02:32:02.640]   Today to nearly 750 billion hours by 2030 1.2 trillion hours by 2040
[02:32:02.640 --> 02:32:08.000]   What's an hour of human time worth in a car with nothing to do depends on what you ask
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:12.720]   And this is just our view 1.2 trillion hours times anything is a very large
[02:32:12.720 --> 02:32:15.760]   Number, I guess I would uh invest in audiobooks
[02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:23.200]   But that's why they want to put screens in these cars so you can surf the web and so but that that number is the answer to the question
[02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:26.160]   Why would apple have a car exactly?
[02:32:26.160 --> 02:32:29.840]   That's exactly right
[02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:32.960]   The car is going to be as important to them as the smartphone
[02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:38.000]   You might spend more time apple can either get a big piece of it or they can just seed all that attention
[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.400]   Right to who knows who
[02:32:40.400 --> 02:32:44.400]   Uh, and it just shows you again google going what huh
[02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:48.400]   What what do you mean? What are you talking about?
[02:32:48.400 --> 02:32:54.800]   Oh lord google. Oh lordy lardy. We could do. Uh, watch out watch out watch out in line 120
[02:32:54.800 --> 02:33:00.880]   123 there's no line 123. Oh, yeah, there is now there is an
[02:33:00.880 --> 02:33:06.000]   I have a tik tok I have a tik tok for every occasion tick technology
[02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:09.120]   Was never supposed to make your life easier
[02:33:09.120 --> 02:33:12.560]   People whose jobs have been basically looking at a screen at home
[02:33:12.880 --> 02:33:19.120]   Have been told by boris johnson that they must now go back to looking at a screen in a bigger building miles from their house
[02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:21.920]   They must go to this building
[02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:24.480]   All right, you win
[02:33:24.480 --> 02:33:27.280]   That was a good one
[02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:30.880]   And your thing of the week your things of the week
[02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:38.640]   He's muted this shot out to me and mr. Steve brassel. Oh, I love steve rickshka
[02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:45.520]   Yeah, they had me on their show last week they're behind the shot dot tv and an image critique show
[02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:46.720]   and
[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:52.720]   folks if you're getting in a photography having your images critique is really really important because
[02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:55.920]   A lot of times you put your stuff up on
[02:33:55.920 --> 02:34:03.120]   social media and everything and and you just get all the likes and so much nice shot and blah blah blah blah
[02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:08.800]   But you're not necessarily growing because there are some things that you can do better with your photography
[02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:10.880]   and having other photographers
[02:34:10.880 --> 02:34:17.120]   Critique your shots can help you out and not trying to be mean not trying to be rude or anything like that
[02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:23.600]   But I highly recommend have some regular image critiques and his show i'm just a good job at that about once a month
[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:31.040]   And I was on steve does great concert photography. Oh, yeah, so you weren't a subject. They weren't critiquing your you were part of the judging
[02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:33.840]   I was part of the panel. Yeah, I was part of the panel
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:38.560]   We have the link to that in our show notes and next up
[02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:45.360]   Hardhead was a model for me and mr. Jefferson Graham Jefferson Graham was on my show has on photography
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:48.080]   a handful of episodes back
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:53.600]   Uh, we went out to balmy alley here in san francisco and did a photo shoot
[02:34:53.600 --> 02:34:56.720]   Which was sponsored by flip board and all that good stuff
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:02.240]   in hardhead just had a ball because he's so into fashion and
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:06.960]   Photography he is a hat. I have to say I mean I haven't seen him in a couple of years
[02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:13.840]   He's this guy's all grown up. He looks great. Very handsome there. Very good. Look at boy. I'll tell you
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:17.760]   Wow, he's got good jeans. Is he in college now? He's in college. Yes. He does
[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:20.000]   Yes, he does
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:23.760]   He's he's a sophomore in high school. He's a high school kid. Look at him
[02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:26.240]   That's right. He's great
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:32.000]   But you know we're linked to that to show you um that photo walk is on it's on this youtube channel
[02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:35.760]   Um, and I put a couple images on my website antperrot.com
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:39.120]   Um that we shined it was all based on smartphone
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:41.600]   Um photography so
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:48.240]   Some pretty good stuff there and we even made a clip flip board magazine that people can contribute to and share their stuff if they'd like
[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:50.320]   What a handsome fella
[02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:54.960]   Walking around the city. I bet you had to beat him off with a stick didn't you?
