[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.060]   president, creative director of advanced.net, the online
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.420]   arm of advanced publications,
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.120]   I want you to be that again. He's also the paycheck was a
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.200]   hell of a lot better. I'll tell you that. I bet it was. But
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.260]   now you're doing God's work teaching the young's Yes, how to
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.380]   do journalism, which is really good. He's the Leonard
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.440]   Ta O professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.740]   Newmark graduate, School of Journalism at the City of New
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.360]   York. Always a pleasure. And we would like to do a Stacy.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.120]   I disappeared Stacy. What do we say? Leo.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.120]   Stacy is getting her UPS delivery, but she will be back. She's
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.720]   in her new house. We're very excited. And we thought it'd be
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.120]   better to start the show without her so we can make a big
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.200]   deal about her coming back to the show because it feels like
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.400]   it's been weeks. Even with theme song for her. We have a
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.220]   theme song for her waiting as we wait. Should we play the
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.800]   waiting theme song? Yes, she planned. This is adapted.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.280]   From the Gizwiz show.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.800]   Stacy.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.640]   Stacy.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.440]   Stacy.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:57.840]   They apparently didn't know where her house was. So
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.400]   I didn't know where her office is. She's lost her way back
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.800]   lost to the mansion. It's a giant house and she can't figure
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.680]   out where her office is. I'm watching this is Stacy's new
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.520]   room. She says for those of you who are ladies and gentlemen,
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.760]   it's Stacy.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.240]   She's back. Wow. Sorry. We thought you got lost on the way
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.720]   back. No, I know I had to sign and show so I'm on where to
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.800]   put it. So that was it. It always takes me a long time to
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.880]   show someone where to put it. Was it a bookshelf? What did you
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.320]   get?
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.480]   It was part of a water heater. Oh, wow. That's exciting. Oh, no,
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.000]   wow. He's installing it. Yeah, not a water heater. A water
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.600]   purifier.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.040]   So you're fire. Very important. Are you unwell? I am. Yes.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.760]   Very important. You want to purify that water. We do soft
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.920]   water. I prefer soft soft water. It's better for your hair.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.280]   And you can't. Yes. Oh, how? How do you do that? How you
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.960]   reduce your salt? You don't make it so soft. Just a little
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.320]   soft. Yeah, it's still is there a titration on the salt? It's so
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.800]   weird. I don't really understand how this works. Stacy, I
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.400]   don't even explain because we're doing giant bags, giant bags
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.960]   of salt. And it goes through them. I don't know where the salt
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.080]   goes, because it's not in the I hope it's not in the water.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.800]   Otherwise, it'd be making salt water. So where's the salt go?
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.400]   And how does it work? I never understood this. Stacy's gonna
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.320]   know, you know, she's gonna know I don't know. I have no idea
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.920]   about the chemical reaction. He just showed me where to go. He
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.840]   just showed me what to do to like, can you can you get out
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.800]   and have to explain to us please? So is the deal? You got your
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.720]   eyes motion. She so you got on one side of the membrane day, you
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.840]   got to salt the other side of the membrane day, you got to the
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.960]   water. And then it the salt goes into drain and the water goes
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.760]   in your mouth. Well, I see a video here from Gary, the water
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.600]   guy explaining how you imagine being Gary, the water guy. Okay,
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.680]   first of all, this is the farthest we've ever gone from this
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.400]   weekend Google. Oh, by the way, Stacy, the show is actually
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.160]   gotten. I figured that. Yeah, I assume. Okay, we decided to be
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.800]   going to and let you make a big entrance. I didn't mind because
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.280]   I figured we wouldn't start talking about Google for a while.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.040]   Right. Hey, go again, man, get over here. Explain it. No, we
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.160]   have that too, because we're unwell and you want to have
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.040]   clean water, but you also want to have good tasting water. And
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.440]   yeah, it's nice to have a lot of processing. What's going on
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.040]   whenever in the rest of the world? But yes, let's yeah, I know
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.040]   Gary, the water guy. Gary, the water guy is explaining. You
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.360]   drink the water, you leave the salt. What's complicated about
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.920]   that? Someone someone said something in the chat about
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.600]   membranes or resins or yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.000]   something or something. The salt draws the the heavy metals or
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.720]   whatever. Is there like an ionization where the chemical
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.840]   reaction and salt is pulling? It's a yes, or it would pull the
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.040]   yeah, there's a mineral tank, a control valve, a brine tank. I
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.120]   guess I must be blind. All the people who know this stuff, which
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.800]   is like 90% of our audience. Yeah, yeah, you're a tree.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.360]   Not this you idiots, you idiots. Can we get Gary the water guy
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.200]   is an advertiser, Lisa? He could be really great on a show.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.920]   All right, moving right along. Very important. No, no, this is
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.520]   important. We get our monthly assault delivery. You got to be
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.360]   there for that to be a good bringing the salt of the
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.080]   you have a soft water to yeah, I didn't know I can read your
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.240]   hair. Yeah, well, it doesn't rinse. You know, soap doesn't
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.880]   rinse as well, but it is better than using SLS is in your soap
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.120]   anyway. S O S is S L S is what's that? What are they?
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.960]   You're a medium Laura sulfate. Yeah, that's what makes things
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.080]   suds up. I thought you didn't want that. Yeah, you don't
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.520]   want that. But if you use shampoo and stuff without it, it
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.520]   doesn't. So I do want it and I don't want it. No, no, you don't
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.320]   want them. Oh, you don't want it. So if you use shampoo's without
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.720]   it, you shouldn't have as much of a problem. I see. But then
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.760]   your shampoo just lies flat on your hair. It doesn't foam up.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.200]   It's still cleaning though. We're just we're just
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.960]   scrubbing bubbles era of people. And my and my skin doesn't feel
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.000]   clean. It feels slimy. This is the weirdest conversation we've
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.600]   ever had on this show. All right, Google had a smart home
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.600]   summit this morning. That was definitely boring. Go ahead.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.480]   You tell us how exciting it was. It was last night. I thought
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.680]   this was great. They did three of these. And so I don't know
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.520]   about you, but I watched the A Pac one. Of course you did. Well,
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:08.120]   this is your beat. Yeah. It was great. Oh, you should show
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.240]   Kevin's story. Okay. About Chromebooks or on your site.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.520]   Yeah, I don't see any of the Kevin wrote it up for me though.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.280]   So tell it. But you while I'm showing his story, this is the
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:24.000]   new works with Google program. Yes. So what Google Google
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.760]   announced one big thing and basically gave us updates on a
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.600]   lot of other things. Okay. So the one big thing was that your
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:36.560]   Google the sorry that they would create a home button or a home
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.440]   platform on your Android and the upcoming version of Android,
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:45.280]   where you press the home button or the power button and you get
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.840]   access to all of your smart home gear. That is the biggest
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.280]   so-wist thing that this is sort of the way it works with the
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.240]   Apple if you have an iPad or an Apple TV or an iPhone, if you
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.920]   have an Apple device, I don't think your computer can be a hub,
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.520]   but everything else can be. It becomes the center. And what's
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.520]   kind of nice with the Apple solution is both your Apple TV
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.360]   and your iPad can do it. There's not doesn't have to be just
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.640]   one. Right. Is it this is Google very similar to that?
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.440]   So we don't know yet. This is going to be an Android. Is it
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.080]   Android 11? Is that where we are? I think yes.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:28.800]   Android 11 are. Yeah. And I'm assuming they're going to if
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.520]   this works out for them and as they play with the design,
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.400]   what are those the little tiles or whatever they're calling
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.840]   them widgets, the widgets, the tiles, we'll start to see those
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.960]   shrink. I mean, are they going to put it in like WearOS? Who
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.480]   cares? No one's using that, right? But maybe one day when they
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.440]   have Fitbit, they'll do something better. So of course,
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.120]   those of us who use Google Home Hubs, the screens, I presume
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.360]   those will also be used that way, right? Well, those already
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.160]   have it. So what you're going to see on your phone is the
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.200]   thing you can actually drill down to this type of things you
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.520]   see on the phone. But what this or sorry, in the display, but
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.000]   the cool thing is you haven't you've only had voice and then
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.320]   your apps, you had to dig forever to get to that. And it was
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.640]   stupid because like if you were in bad or something, you'd be
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.200]   like, Oh my gosh, I want to turn off my lights without waking
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.440]   my spouse. And now you can just hit a button on your phone
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.560]   and just get there, which is nice. Cool. So that was the
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.440]   biggest news. The rest of it was pretty, pretty lame in the
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.560]   sense that we just got a bunch of updates. So and maybe we'll
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.400]   see more from the developer side. But you know, they talked a
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.960]   lot about the local SDK, which we are very excited about, but
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.920]   we've known about it since last year. And then in April, they
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.720]   kind of started rolling it out. We saw the S.D.K. The
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.760]   software developers kit is used by third parties to integrate
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:01.000]   with Google home stuff. Yes. Well, you're smiling at me as if
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.440]   no, I'm smiling because I'm like, yes, translate. That's right.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.520]   I have to. I'm sorry. That's just my job. And they have a
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:13.440]   number of partners, including Phillips and tile, GE, CASA. Are
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.520]   these some of these I've not heard of are these all the big
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.440]   players? Nanoleaf, I know life. These are all lights in my or
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.480]   it's you're there is a little tile tiles, not a light and
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.760]   causes an alight and homogeneous isn't a light.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.480]   Cosa might be a light because they've got they do have bulbs and
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.360]   they also have the outlets. But these these particular use
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.600]   cases. One, I think Google focused on lighting first, because
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.800]   it's an area where latency really causes problems when you're
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.680]   like, turn on the light and you're waiting for two seconds, you
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:52.520]   notice, right? And so it's really annoying, actually. Yeah,
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.760]   actually more annoying is when I turn out the lights, because
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.120]   I'm going to bed. I say turn off the lights. And then sometimes
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.000]   it doesn't work. So I have to wait until it succeeds. And yes,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.720]   it's just two seconds with feels like an attorney.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.240]   Why did I do this again? I could have just hit a switch. I'm
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.160]   used to just flipping a switch, right? Yeah, except that it's
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.880]   more lights than one switch could control. So Oh, I like
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.880]   you in the chat. Yeah. Oh, is saying that you can actually
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.000]   try the new feature now with the Android 11 beta. Well, that's
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.080]   one of our change log points. But I do have the Oh, yeah, don't
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.840]   get ahead of us. Now we can't get ahead. I have the latest
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.160]   stage. We're talking about it. So I was like, Oh, if you have it,
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.520]   I do have it. So let me so this is the beta two of Android 11,
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.120]   which just they part of the public beta that just came out
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:44.280]   today, which is probably the last beta before the release, the
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.400]   thinking goes. So how would I do this? Is it in the settings?
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.960]   Hold your power button down for a second. Oh, how fancy
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:58.160]   schmancy. Okay. Oh, device controls loading recommendations.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.200]   Now we don't have probably anything here. But if I were
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.840]   home, this is where I'd see my hue lights and anything else I
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:10.480]   had in this list of things, right? Yes. Okay. So I can add
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:17.120]   controls. Yes. Oh, you know what? This is interesting. It's
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.960]   seeing the stuff at home. So there's my nest cameras. There's
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.160]   my house. Right now and turn off some lights. Well, there's not
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.160]   I don't see any lights. Oh, so what happens if you click on the
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.680]   like a camera? Let's see what happens. Let's go to the Hello
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.960]   doorbell. Choose controls to access. Oh, I'm gonna turn them
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.640]   all on. So these are using right now they use Nest Aware, but
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.760]   that's a Google product. So now it's added them. So let me
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.000]   just repeat now that I have those buttons on here. If I press
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.040]   and hold the the on off button for a second, I get the the usual
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.960]   the power locked out emergency. I also get a Google Google pay
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.720]   card. But then I get these buttons from my home. And if I
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.360]   tap front door, I don't know what happens. It should give me it
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.600]   is going to give me a picture of the front door. Well, that's
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.560]   pretty cool. Isn't that nice? And if you had lights, it would
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.960]   let you automatically turn it on or give you a slider. There's
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.000]   somebody in my house. So that's really so instead of having to
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.040]   use the nest app now, I can have that on the front. And what
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.640]   else can I if it were lights that have a slider or controls that
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.080]   would change our lines or any of these other things. thermostat
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.960]   is much needed. Yeah, it is. That's that's why I'm like, it's
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.600]   the biggest news from the thing and probably the most interesting
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.040]   for most people because it does it makes it much more like home,
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.960]   the home app in Apple, which just, you know, you touch it and
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.520]   you're like, right, right. And it's clever to put it on the power
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.280]   button because that that is a quick that's quick access. I don't
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.760]   have to I don't have to launch anything. I you know, it
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.680]   literally is one button. And there it is. I think that's
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.560]   actually very nice. Apple sort of is like that you slide over and
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.760]   you can get in the widget page. But maybe now that Apple's adding
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.480]   widgets in the next version of iOS, they'll also be widgets to do
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.520]   that. But that's cool. Can I add widgets to do this too? I wonder
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:16.240]   if there's a Oh, why would you want to? Well, I guess you're
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.440]   right. It's so quick to get to that. I don't need to have it on
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.120]   the screen all the time. I mean, Hugh has a lot of these have
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.520]   widgets, but yeah, yeah, but then you've got your one, you get
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.680]   to a point with all your widgets. You're like, how crap
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.080]   scrolling scrolling. There it is. This is much faster. I think
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:39.000]   yeah, you're right. I love this. Boom. Ta-da magic. Okay. That's
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.520]   part of the SDK or that's that's it's actually very easy for
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.480]   developers to do. It's going to. Oh, that's that's the local
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.080]   stuff. Sorry. Can I have routines as well here? Could I
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.840]   have buttons for like turn off the house at night and stuff
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.960]   like that? I don't know. I would hope so. I haven't I haven't
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.440]   downloaded the beta yet. So I haven't played with it just yet.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:09.320]   Sorry. I was recording my show. I can drag him around. That's
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.080]   nice. So that's a little early change log. Do I have what?
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:17.760]   Do you have routines already for your Google Home stuff? What
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.840]   would I say? Turn on the front door camera then turn on the
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.600]   back yard camera. Then no, you would have like good night. So
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.800]   your door would lock your lights would go out. See, I don't
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.160]   have the door lock. I have hue lights. So I could be to the
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.920]   hue hub could if I were home, would it see the hue hub?
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.720]   Yeah, you should be able to control and set up a routine for
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.360]   all of your hue lights to turn them all off when you say Google
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.920]   that would be better than saying an out loud. Well, I could
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.640]   say hey, G now turn off the lights. I know but good night
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:53.480]   turns all of them off. I don't have that many. I have like six
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.520]   things that happen when I go to sleep. Yeah, the thermostat
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:01.040]   goes down the door locks. Yeah. Yeah. We used to have a nest
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.440]   thermostat. I didn't install it when we moved. I just some of
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.320]   this stuff. It'd be nice. For instance, if it could make sure
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.080]   the garage doors were closed. If it could turn off the porch
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.840]   light, turn off the lights in the house, lock the front door. I
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.680]   don't have a lock that does that. I'm not sure how the chamber
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.560]   lin my cue on Google or chamber lin my cue. You're talking
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:29.080]   about my garage door. No, should I? Oh, I appreciate that's one of
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.400]   my favorite devices. Show her why you keep showing me I'm not
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.560]   interesting. Jeff wake up. Thank you. I'm boring. I don't
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.720]   have any of the stuff. Jeff is fun. I have the switches. Yeah,
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:49.760]   switches which work hard. Up down. Up down. Up down. Up down.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:56.920]   Okay. So the my cue is a garage door opener. The usefulness of
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.800]   that is it ties into Google. So yes, you could tell it to make
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.960]   sure your garage doors closed. But it's it sends you the alert
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.520]   if you leave your garage door open. So you can set a timer like
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.480]   after 10 minutes. If it's still open, just send me a
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.760]   notification and you'll be like, Hey, your garage door is open.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.600]   And then you can remotely close it. Nice. Which is really
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.720]   handy for a lot of people who like worry if they left the
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.480]   garage door. I'd have to replace. So I have the ones that came
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.040]   with the house and after a place that you don't have to replace
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.440]   them. It's actually a little device you stick on the top of
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.520]   your talks as long as it's. Yeah, it's handling compatible. So
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.640]   it'll probably work. Yeah, you're fine. Yeah, it's long as it's
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.200]   like 1996 and older or in younger. Sorry. What's this
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   called the the Chamberlain my cue? It's one sensor. You need
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.480]   one sensor for your door, your garage door and you just tape
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.800]   that on there. And then there's a little router hub that you
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:56.040]   stick on your garage door opener itself. Nice. So I've got to
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:00.320]   sort of have to get to or I guess you would just buy one of
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.040]   the hubs and then two sensors. Yeah, that makes sense. I'm
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.840]   going to do that. Now I can have actions. I can have I can
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.480]   have scripts. Why didn't you let just open the door for the
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.680]   guy? Yeah, see Stacey? See, you could have just opened the
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.880]   door. You had to show him where it goes. Yeah, see, goes down
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.560]   in the storage area with all of the house accoutrements.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.680]   I think it was. Isn't that the the sun ran for president in
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.000]   succession? I think it is.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:36.800]   All right, cool. That's Chamberlain, which makes as I
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.440]   thought made garage door openers. But now I see they do so
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.400]   much more. My cue smart home. Well, thank you, Stacey. See, we
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.640]   missed you. Anything else? So you can buy more things. Well,
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.240]   the only other big news from the Google Smart Home stuff. So
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.160]   we're excited about local SDK that they just talked about it
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.720]   a little bit. They also did their smart home entertainment
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.160]   devices that they're integrating and giving a deeper integration
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.560]   into Google Home with like so you can cast to more things and
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.360]   more things can you can control things on certain
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.760]   entertainment devices. And then the other really useful thing
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:18.280]   that people will care about is when Google did transfer transfer
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.920]   to away from works with Nest to works with Google, they I don't
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.440]   know if you'll remember, but it basically took away the ability
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.000]   like the Nest thermostat and other devices to talk directly to
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.800]   other devices in the home. Right. So a lot of people lost
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.080]   presence awareness and that made them sad. Google is now
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.880]   bringing back presence awareness. So if devices in your home are
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.680]   like, no one's here, it'll tell those devices and then it will
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:50.040]   automatically turn your cameras on or your thermostat, whatever
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.760]   nice needs to happen. So that is the other thing.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.880]   And is that required Android phone to know that you're home
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.040]   or not? No, it's it's based on the device. It's based on the
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.680]   Google devices in your home. So if they hear you or see you then
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:08.400]   like, yeah, I mean, it's like the PIR sensor in the nest or I
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.920]   guess if your cameras are on. Okay, maybe. Well, we see we don't
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.640]   have cameras in the house for that. You know, obvious
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.320]   reasons. But okay. Now, did they announce any new hardware at
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:25.000]   all? No, no hardware. We were sad. Yeah. They did they talk
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.680]   about the chip alliance at all because that's the they did it
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.120]   was so lame. It was basically just yeah, it was basically what
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.760]   Apple did at WWDC, which was like, Hey, chip, we're part of it.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.880]   It's still happening and it's coming the end of this year. And
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:47.040]   remember, we were skeptical that Apple Google and Amazon could
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.280]   ever agree on anything. But this was the idea was unifying
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.400]   their their connected home all efforts.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.280]   And this is frustrating because there's so many questions. If
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.800]   you're a developer, you're like, okay, how are they going to
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.240]   handle like device onboarding? How are they going to handle
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.600]   things like talking to assistants? People really want to know
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.520]   this and no one Google Apple all the working groups, they're
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.440]   figuring this out, but they're not allowed to talk about
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:17.640]   anything. Google and Apple and Amazon are locking it down. So
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.840]   all we know is it's still expected by the end of this year
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.360]   before the end of this year, the first certification, your first
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.960]   devices, then come out next year. So that's where we are.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.680]   That's where we've been. Yeah, why don't we? Yeah.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.400]   We missed you Stacy for many reasons. But one was when the
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.800]   Apple chip stuff was coming out of a Stacy should be here. Oh,
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.400]   it's Apple Silicon. Oh, the arm stuff. Yeah. Was that it?
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.280]   Yeah. Actually, there's a this is really not this is what
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.640]   Hey, it's a little closer to our topic than water sufferers.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:55.000]   One of the things technology Leo is technology. One of the
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.360]   things that we were talking about earlier on Windows weekly
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:02.000]   kind of stunned me, which is that I thought because Microsoft
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.320]   has been promoting Windows on arm and working hard, that
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.160]   Windows would somehow be able to coexist with Apple Silicon at
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:14.520]   least run an emulation or run, you know, somehow. And Paul
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.000]   told me, you know, they really shouldn't call Windows on arm.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.280]   It's Windows on Qualcomm. And apparently, and I don't know
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:25.760]   how much but a lot of the code is reliant on features unique to
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:30.040]   Qualcomm's arm implementation, which of course would mean that
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.520]   it's completely incompatible with anything Apple does. So I don't
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.800]   know if you're familiar with that at all, but you are our chip
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.560]   expert.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.520]   I'm not unfortunately. Yeah, I think that was that's going to
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.520]   be interesting. We'll talk about it on Mac break weekly,
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.480]   obviously, but I people have been worried that Apple will not be
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.000]   supporting Windows very well in future. And this may mean they
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.160]   can't support it at all, which would be really odd.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:59.200]   Oh, like through parallel. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Okay. And it
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.560]   would I think it'd be a problem because a lot of people are
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.120]   willing to use Macs as long as they can run a few Microsoft
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.040]   tools or they can run Windows and emulation and you know,
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.600]   somehow do that. Microsoft said they would support containerization.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.160]   I'm sorry, Apple said they would support containerization, but
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.760]   those would only work obviously with ARM compatible Apple Silicon
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.640]   compatible programs. It's not emulation.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:26.680]   That's they they will push for that. I mean, Microsoft is running
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.560]   ARM based chips in their servers. Obviously, they're not their
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:35.880]   servers are not running Windows. But there's a huge effort that
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:42.240]   ARM has seated for the last decade to get code for again,
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.720]   mostly enterprise and server oriented stuff onto the ARM
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.840]   instruction set. I don't think Windows, I don't think that's
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.960]   going to be too. Well, let me this actually then this is really
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.840]   the question for you. Because you're really up on this. We know
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.760]   that there's two different kinds of arm licenses. There's the
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.320]   actual license of the ARM designs. And then there's the ARM
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.840]   architecture license, which allows you to you know, basically
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:13.240]   licensing compatibility with arm. ARM is not arm, right? Just
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.720]   because a chip is an ARM compatible chip that's there seems
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.840]   to be some big differences in in ARM implementations.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.120]   Yes. So what happens is ARM is what you're licensing is the
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:29.000]   ARM instruction set. And that's the commands that help. It's
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.600]   how the chip talks to the firmware. Is it does it come down
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.960]   to things like the registers, the number of the size, and the
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:42.040]   assembly language instructions that the that are required for
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.640]   ARM compatibility? Is that kind of what we're talking about?
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.880]   I think it's it's lower level than that. He's it. Oh, so it's
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.800]   micro code. Huh?
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:55.600]   Well, it's in this is where like, because I'm not I don't code.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:02.920]   So this is like it's this is how the chip deals with like memory
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:09.880]   and accessing like sending like IO in data back and forth. And
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:15.160]   how then that talks that firmware talks to now you do have to
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.920]   optimize all the way up the stack for an instruction set,
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.840]   right? Right. But that's definitely a different instruction
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.600]   set, because that's the whole point of ARM is it's a risk
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.920]   right instruction set. But it must be so it's that's interesting.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:33.240]   So it includes IO. It includes a whole lot more. Apple's going
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.360]   to do its own custom systems on a chip.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.760]   So yeah, what what the difference between an arm like a
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.880]   traditional arm license and an architecture license is you in
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:48.440]   arm actually just introduced a couple weeks ago, a custom
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.760]   design architecture to so that's and I don't know if that's
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:57.520]   what Apple's doing, but it lets you so that's the core license
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.520]   which lets you actually use the cores. You take yeah, you take
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.960]   the core and you pop it on and like if but if you're Apple,
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.200]   if you're Google, if you're gonna use more flexible than that,
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.000]   right? Architecture lets you really tweak everything. And then
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.280]   the one the new one that you mentioned that came out last year,
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:21.720]   arm flexible access. It gives unlimited access to all of
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.280]   arms intellectual property. Basically, it's a license. Take
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.080]   what you want, leave the rest. That's that's not it. No, it's
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.280]   not flexible access. This was this year. That was like last
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.000]   year. Oh, okay. Yeah, that was last. There it basically lets
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.160]   you design. They you take the blocks of memory and you can
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.720]   actually design and allocate. You're actually designing your
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.440]   core.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:50.040]   So if you have an architectural license, this is the Wikipedia
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:55.000]   article, you have to fully comply with the arm architecture in
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.760]   any cores you design. So Apple has that applied micro broad
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:05.120]   com, Marvel, deck, Intel and video call come in Samsung. So I
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.240]   would presume anything designed by those companies would be
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.120]   interoperable.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:15.040]   Yes. So so yes, those all have to run on the base. That's
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.320]   basically arms way of saying, Hey, any software that runs on
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.040]   arms still has to run on your machines. And that's true. That
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.120]   is the architecture license, you can change some things, but you
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:29.320]   can't change it so it doesn't work. That's yeah. But what
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.920]   they're doing is they're they're fine tuning like they're L2
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:38.360]   cash and right there. They're creating like software that'll
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:43.560]   create a fabric on the chip and so maybe Paul misunderstood what
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:48.400]   windows on arm their compatibility level because if if
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:54.160]   it's designed to run with a Snapdragon, a Qualcomm chip, it
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.600]   should be compatible with any other arm architecture license
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.200]   ease.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.960]   I don't know what he I just don't know what he's talking about
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.440]   and I don't know how I'll have to find out. I never cared
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.840]   about those. I'm sorry. I don't either. But I do care about
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.440]   Apple and I'm curious because it would be a big deal if windows
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.480]   would not run at all on Apple Silicon. All right, let's move
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.040]   on.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:27.160]   So my my Twitter feed went crazy for about an hour today with
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.600]   the report that Twitter is looking to hire someone to work
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.680]   on subscriptions. Oh, what is that people want nuts for like an
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.520]   hour? Then it died off. It was the hottest thing going and
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.640]   Twitter stock went up. And would you pay for tweets? Or is it
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.800]   a Patreon? All of this because it's just a job listing.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.360]   That problem, I guess, is that it's probably part of the
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:54.360]   Twitter open platform working group thing. And it's an
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.520]   infrastructure they need.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:01.040]   It's a stock where we'd love to 10% 10% Yes. Ooh, new
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.600]   revenue stream. Ooh, ooh, yeah, money. Does Twitter it can
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.240]   make money? Right? I mean, it has made money. Yeah, yeah, not
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.560]   on a regular basis.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:17.080]   Have you ever promoted a tweet? Paid to promote a tweet? No,
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.320]   can you? Yeah, I mean, Facebook, I know it's their business
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.840]   model. That's it. Oh, I thought there was advertising. There's
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:27.400]   no, that is the other side. Oh, okay. I see. Pay to promote.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And this is promoted, of course. Yes.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.040]   No, I haven't ever done that. Maybe you might have. I don't
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.640]   know. People do things around here. I have no idea what
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.640]   they're. I've never seen a Twitter promotion, but I was just
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.200]   curious if they were effective or I get you know what I get? I
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.000]   get Twitter ads all the time on the New York Times. Oh, well,
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.640]   good. I'm glad it's going somewhere. It is going somewhere.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.080]   Yeah, it's just like kind of like, you can save your money on
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:59.400]   me. Is that funny? I don't ever see those. I get furniture ads.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:06.640]   So I tell you what, I like the idea of a subscription not
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.520]   because it's a revenue stream for Twitter. But if you had to pay
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:15.080]   even a dollar that would eliminate 90% of the bots, wouldn't
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.800]   it? Well, I wouldn't imagine it's for all of Twitter. I would
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:23.200]   imagine it's for Leo's Stacy Stacy on IOT's premium Twitter
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.440]   feed. What would that be? Is it a sub stack? Is it a sub stack
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:30.560]   or a free? You know, but I don't want to create. I mean, what
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.040]   would that mean? What was my marketing engine? I don't want to
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.040]   like limit the number of people who see my tweets. I don't
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.240]   know. I mean, this is all guess. This is all guesswork is just a
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.440]   job list. I was going to say my tweets are not worth anything.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:48.400]   Really Stacy Stacy, fuck up here. Have a higher view of your
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.720]   personal worth. Your tweets are valuable. You are valuable.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:55.920]   I am valuable. My work is valuable. I'm just looking at my
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:59.960]   last two tweets or something. And I'm like, they're basically
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.480]   marketing for my thing, marketing for my thing, stories,
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.600]   sponsor. I'm waiting. I'm looking for like basically the
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.400]   Stacy tweets that are like, I am sad because it's reading. I
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.760]   tweeted a dog that was wearing a mask. People don't need to pay
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:19.320]   for that. I pay for dogs wearing masks more than I would
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.400]   anything else. You're like more than all your stories.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:29.480]   I don't care. Okay, that's interesting. So what is it?
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.360]   So what do you do? I don't know if okay, so you still have a
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.280]   free Twitter. So what do you get? If you're gonna have to. So
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.480]   what do you get? We don't know because it's just a job
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.360]   listing. This is so spec, specular as hell. Okay, but it
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.800]   could be like something could be like something stack or it
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.360]   could be like Patreon. Those are the two speculations going on.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.360]   So you pay out of the goodness of your heart. You paid. That's
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.400]   the Patreon. You paid you pay to have a relationship with a
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.880]   writer. You pay a subscription. So sub stack. And I've talked to
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.640]   them actually about doing subscription based content for me.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:05.920]   And basically it's yeah, people pay to get articles from me
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.960]   because they think I'm in my opinion is worth $6 a month or
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.040]   whatever. There is a possibility raised by the chat
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.960]   room that the word subscription does not mean what you think it
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:23.040]   means because oh, Twitter also has a subscriptions page where you
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.360]   can view product subscriptions. And so there's something there's
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:32.160]   some other subscription stuff. The stock market went up on
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.040]   something no one understands. Yeah, isn't that funny? Well,
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.120]   what the stock market assumed was Oh, revenue.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:42.640]   Revenue. Yeah. It doesn't seem like it can really cap it's not
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.480]   doing a great job capitalizing on its potential. I think that's
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.360]   what they're doing. They could they do a subscription to their
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.840]   API feed that could help you like see things coming. That is a
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.200]   good idea. That's a great idea.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.760]   Well, the whole Griffin thing. I mean, what Jack talked about
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.840]   how long ago now nine months ago now was that that it's not
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.080]   like the WordPress model where you have an underlying open source
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.080]   thing and then you can build on top of it and Twitter can build
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.720]   on top of it. But others could be I could build a curated
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:15.760]   Twitter on there where I guarantee to find you only smart
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.400]   tweets. I find you the best tweets there are. I just find
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:25.520]   the golden platinum tweets there are and you want my tweet
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:30.160]   curation. Is that worth money? Or as Stacy just said, the data.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.560]   Is there data they have to sell that I can like and subscribe
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.960]   to? That's interesting. Alerts. Yeah. I mean, Twitter is like a
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:41.520]   massive sentiment analysis pool. Oh boy. Yeah. People people
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.240]   right now everybody's down.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:49.160]   Well, I'm excited. I bought a house. Yeah, good for you. There'd
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.520]   be a lot to get out of it. You're right. We were I remember
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.280]   in the early, very, very early days. Twitter had a feature
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:00.160]   called track. Do you remember that where you could track a
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:04.800]   topic and it would notify you the topics are back. No, you could
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   track it. You could set a tracker and you would get notified
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.760]   if somebody was talking about something you were interested
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.320]   in. And they took it out. And in fact, this was a this is I met
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.240]   Steve Gilmore this way. There was a bear hug camp where they
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.960]   wanted to to a lot of people involved in this to try to get
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.880]   track back because that was really one of the most valuable
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.080]   things Twitter was doing. So you didn't have to read the stream.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.880]   You could just say, Hey, let me know if somebody's talking about
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.120]   something I'm interested in. Maybe they that I paid for that.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.400]   Yeah. And I actually remember because when they had that we
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:43.000]   tried to set up a ambient notification or stories that we
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.640]   wanted to follow. Right. You know, so if anyone's tweeting
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.640]   about arm, yeah, I'm sure I'm sure I'm almost what was all over
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.520]   it. Yeah, actually it was me you.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:57.040]   Nice. My idea to tie it to a light bulb. I was gonna say, did
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.080]   you have a little glowing orb that would turn red when they
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.120]   were talking about arm?
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:07.000]   Possibly. There was a device. I had a this was early days. Yeah,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.720]   long time. Little printer. No, there was a little glowing
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.640]   orb that you could set up right to light up in different like
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:17.240]   if the weather was gonna rain or like the price went somewhere.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.360]   What was the name of that? I don't know. But you haven't
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.160]   there probably somewhere in the studio. Yes, you had it would
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.800]   be if we hadn't probably threw it out in one of the great
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.000]   purges. Today you could do that with a hue light bulb and
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.360]   an API call. It's true. Like expo exactly their APIs more
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.760]   accessible. Yeah, it's easy. Yeah. Yeah. Let's take a little
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.960]   break. Lots more to talk about. I'm gonna let you guys choose
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.080]   though, because there are so many stories to pick something
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:46.120]   you're interested in. Maybe Uber buying Postmates or Twitter
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.680]   says the last one. So the next one's on the stage. Twitter
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.960]   says it's going to add an edit button to tweets when any when
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.280]   everyone wears a mask. That's pretty much all there is to say
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:03.760]   about that. And actually, I think a big story that's gonna be
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.680]   bigger all the time is what happens to the academic year?
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.400]   And since we have an academic with us or fake one, a phony
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:17.760]   if a poser epidemic. Hey, you got an endowed chair, man. That's
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.480]   the best way. Why are you fake? Just a journalist professor
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:28.040]   doesn't count. You don't do it. I'm tenured. Yes. Well, do you
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:33.880]   publish or do you perish? Both both. Anyway, we'll talk about
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:40.200]   that. And Bill Gates says it's all social media's fault. But
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:48.720]   first, a word from sign. Our sponsor. Melissa, Melissa is my
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:53.160]   new best friend. Remember the mask fiasco we had a few weeks
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:57.320]   ago where we had a we've changed stores, but our Twitch store
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:01.160]   had these beautiful masks. And the company who was selling them
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.320]   and I won't name names. I want to embarrass them somehow mailed
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.280]   almost all of them to Florida instead of the actual states they
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.800]   belong to had they had Melissa they would have immediately said,
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:17.240]   no, you got your address date is all wrong. It's not unusual.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:22.480]   30% of all customer data goes bad every year. It's like, it's
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:26.360]   like the carton of milk you gotta you get to get fresh milk.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:30.800]   Your customer data is going bad. Melissa, that's their job.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.920]   They've been doing it for 35 years. What's happened over time
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:38.360]   is their data has become richer and richer and richer. And they
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.400]   are able to do all sorts of great things. You can verify
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:45.080]   addresses, emails, phone numbers and names in real time. So
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.320]   people make mistakes. Customers enter incorrect data, human
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:52.360]   error records get duplicated. The Melissa and there's a lot of
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.040]   ways to use it. You can do it on-prem as a web service. You
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.520]   could have it secure FTP to upload it. You could use software
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.280]   as a service. There's an API lot very commonly, for instance,
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:08.240]   customer service centers will have the Melissa API running. So
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.000]   when they're entering addresses as the customer tells them it
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.560]   auto fills it. And that saves huge amounts of time. And make sure
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.520]   everything is accurate. Another example is in a shopping cart.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:25.960]   You know, typo, you say a Tallahassee instead of Tennessee,
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:29.960]   Melissa will find it and correct it. Plus, you can add
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.120]   demographic information to your records, property and mortgage
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.800]   data, marital status, social media handles, Melissa fills in the
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.720]   gap by adding emails and phone numbers. You can identify current
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.160]   customers, which allows you to find new prospective customers
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:49.000]   through Melissa's prospect database. Incorrect error costs you
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.680]   money and could cost you with a customer. Match and consolidate
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.480]   your records. They're matching into duplication tools help you
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:02.000]   uncover, merge and purge hard to find duplicate records for an
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.720]   accurate 360 degree view of your business. Their flexible
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.360]   deployment options mean you can set it up to use it any way you
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.720]   want. In fact, the best thing you could do is go to Melissa
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:18.600]   me, lissa.com/twit and try the developer portal. You could try
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:23.520]   the API directly live 24/7. The sandbox is there so you get a
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:28.080]   sense of what Melissa can do. It couldn't be easier. And I want
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.040]   to assure you that they constantly undergo independent
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:36.080]   security audits to make sure that your data is safe, that their
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.960]   data is safe. They are committed to data security, privacy, and
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:43.920]   compliance requirements. They have the utmost dedication to your
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.120]   data security by implementing strong controls and safeguards
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.480]   while they're processing your data. Over 10,000 businesses trust
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:56.200]   the address experts you should to bad data is as bad as sour milk,
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.400]   you got to get rid of it. Trust Melissa to be your foundation
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.880]   for data driven success. And another nice thing during the
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.960]   COVID crisis, Melissa is offering their service free for six
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.360]   months to supporting communities and qualifying essential workers
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:15.440]   you could find out if you qualify by going to Melissa.com/twit.
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.920]   Don't put up with sour customer contact data. Try Melissa's
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.360]   API is in the developer portal. It's easy to log on, sign up and
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.760]   start playing in the sandbox 24/7. By the way, get started today
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:33.560]   with 1000 records clean free at Melissa.com/twit. Melissa.com/twit
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:41.000]   thank Melissa for supporting this week in Google. So Jeff
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.600]   Harvard's announced that they're not going to have a school year
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:49.920]   next year. The president has announced that yes, we are. Oh,
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:55.720]   yes, we are. I think there's a at least in our local schools
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.120]   here in Petaloma, but I guess this is nationwide. I'm sure it's
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:02.480]   happening in Washington state and in New Jersey. The local
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:06.120]   schools are completely perplexed. They have all the
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:10.320]   kids. It's it's it's if it's the third Tuesday of the month, and
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.120]   the full moon is out. The kid will be there in the morning, but
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:19.120]   not for lunch. If it's just it's confusing as hell to people
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.400]   that's that's that's that's that's elementary school. And how
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.440]   we plan to work. I don't know.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:31.080]   Yeah, my daughter's school sent us a 30 minute YouTube video, an
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:37.960]   11 page PowerPoint, and then like a 20 page document to explain
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.960]   the first half of the plan. And I'm just like,
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:46.560]   And then of course, there's the teachers who those the people
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:51.200]   are most worried. Are the teachers. Oh, yeah. And they just
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.320]   get sloughed off and forgotten. Well, you know, the teachers
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.680]   unions are making sure that they're not going to get sloughed
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.720]   off and forgotten. Because you got to get the union consent
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.640]   before you do this. I wonder what's going to happen. And
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:11.560]   professors at Georgia Tech have launched a revolt over reopening
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:14.240]   in the fall saying the current plan threatens the health well
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:19.360]   being an education of students, staff and faculty. Because
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.880]   Georgia Tech is not going to require the wearing masks. Oh,
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:26.360]   it's all about masks. All about masks. It's it's it's the
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:30.640]   anti science anti-inluxralism. Georgia Tech can't be anti science.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.960]   I'm sorry. Tell me. I know. But there's a and so we're all in
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.320]   solidarity with Georgia Tech. What's their mascot? Anybody
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:40.840]   know? We are all we want to say little dogs. Yeah, I want to
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:47.720]   say bulldogs. Yeah. Wow, that's interesting. Now, at least
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:52.120]   here in Petaluma, and I bet you it's we are all buzzes. What's
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.560]   what kind of what kind of mascot is that a bug? The yellow
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.960]   jackets. They're the yellow jackets. University of Georgia
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.920]   is the bulldogs. Oh, it's Georgia Tech is the yellow jackets.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:06.880]   So they go. Well, we are all buzzes. We stand in solidarity
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:11.800]   with the yellow jackets of Georgia Tech. It's it's got to be
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:16.360]   crazy. Here in Petaluma, similar, they've got you know,
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.000]   mainly what the schools are saying is we don't know. And
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.200]   we're going to in fact, they've just said now we're going to be
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.200]   online until it's safe not to be online, which is that's
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.360]   reasonable. None of us know we don't know. We're totally
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:34.640]   it. I mean, we have to adapt to what we're we have to adapt to
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.360]   the situation you're in. The problem is it's become
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.560]   politicized, which is really too bad. On all the more so
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.080]   today after Pence was up there saying the schools will open.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.440]   Yeah, that's Donald Trump's fault. Trump says it's a
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:51.920]   democratic plot. Well, how dare you had you?
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.240]   Politicize the school reopening, he says,
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:59.920]   we're a plot to stay alive to stay alive. So I don't I just I
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.840]   worry. I mean, this is actually not the first time we've
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.680]   talked about was it Jay Roseners was somebody who was
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:10.080]   talking about this is going to be a crisis come this fall. And
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.320]   he was saying this in April come this fall for for higher
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.000]   education.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.760]   It is and it's all over the map. A lot of schools are insisting
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.480]   that everything's going to be fine. And that students are less
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.480]   susceptible. Of course, the age of the of the hospitalizes
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:30.600]   going down. At my school, I think we don't have an official
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.680]   word at all yet. So we're still in our own. We don't know what
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:37.640]   to plan. But my presumption my knock on would hope is that as
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.560]   few people as possible on campus.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:45.520]   Now Bill Gates. Yeah, Bill Gates says it's all social medias
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.200]   fault. Oh, F me.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:53.400]   Bill, man, but no, can the social media companies be more
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.320]   helpful in these issues? What creativity do we have? Sadly,
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.000]   the digital tools probably have been a net contributor to
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.440]   spreading what I consider crazy. You know, we need well, he's
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:08.800]   no wrong about that. We need Corona clippy. But he's not
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:13.720]   clippy. He's not wrong. He's I see you have a virus. Can I
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.000]   help? I was like, I see you're trying to leave the house.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:22.040]   Yeah, yes, exactly. Exactly. But it is the case. It's perfect.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:25.000]   You can do it. Isn't it the case that every conspiracy theory
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.640]   finds fertile ground on Facebook and Twitter and all these
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.160]   other things? Shall I remind you which trials?
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:37.400]   Okay, well, hold up the which let's not go back to Salem, but
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:42.120]   they were on the internet broadly. I mean, Reddit is Reddit
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:46.080]   social media. Yeah, I'll include Reddit, YouTube, Twitter,
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:50.440]   actually a little bit less so Facebook for sure. You know, and
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.800]   you can also see it anytime people get together in the real
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:57.600]   world. I mean, my dad's office is like a it's like a conspiracy
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.920]   water cooler. I swear these people know, I agree, but that
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.280]   would be a localized phenomenon just like the which
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.520]   president of the United States is out there telling you not to
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:10.200]   wear masks. And how can you then bill say that this is all
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.440]   social media's fault? It's on Fox News. And you've got the
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.320]   Karens and the Kins out there having the three theatrical
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:25.480]   fits in in Costco's and Wal-Mart's. It's out there and
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.120]   it's gonna happen. It doesn't it wasn't caused by social
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.920]   media. We have a larger problem with cognition and
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.680]   education. I agree with you actually.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:39.520]   Well, I think most people don't I mean, I am educated. I am
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.320]   willing to think through and challenge my beliefs and change
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:46.480]   them when they're proven wrong. But I will say that I find
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:51.040]   absent good government guidance. That's really what to do.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:56.560]   There's a vacuum. And read my. I do wish. Yeah, I do read
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:01.320]   your. Well, I do, but that takes a lot of time and effort.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:06.320]   Well, also, science, there's no consensus among scientists
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:10.080]   either. Well, yeah, that's why you need you need. I mean,
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.120]   that's what a public health agency is for is to say, hey,
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:17.440]   this is what we know right now. This is the best practices
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.480]   in government in the government officials should then say,
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.440]   okay, I'm the governor. I'm going to take their educated
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.840]   opinion and distill it for people because that's what
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:29.840]   leaders do. Yes. And we don't have that right now. So we're
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:34.800]   all like trying to distill things. And we don't have all the
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:39.840]   tools to do it. In some places, though, are but Stacy,
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:43.200]   the problem is that you have like Andrew Cuomo does just that,
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:46.880]   right? My governor Murphy does just that. But then you have
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.400]   the governor of Florida who says, no, no, no, no, we're fine.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.360]   And Floridians go around the country spreading the terms.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:58.560]   And that's that's why it's sad. Yes, it's so frustrating.
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:02.080]   It's terribly frustrating. People are now going nuts today
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.480]   about the CDC because because we're getting more of the
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.480]   political than we are on the show. But hey, we started with
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:11.200]   water softers, we can do anything. And by the way, water softers,
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:16.720]   a liberal hoax. They put fluoride in your water.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:20.640]   Nothing wrong with the water. I don't have fluoride in my water.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.400]   I'm very upset about that. I know. You can't get fluoride
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:28.640]   treatments, however. Oh, oh, the worst thing. I got three times.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:32.560]   I got it and I got sick. The goo they put on your teeth.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:36.160]   Really? Who won your teeth? Oh, yeah. And and I got sick.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.520]   We don't have in the waters.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:41.760]   Nothing. Now podcaster, another source of bad information.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.560]   Let's add that to the list, Bill Gates.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:49.360]   Sorry. So I forget what I was saying. I forgot to.
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.920]   We got distracted. Oh, you were going to say CDC.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:55.120]   What's the latest? CDC. So it's the latest. So Trump said,
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.360]   I don't like their guidelines. They're too tough.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.240]   So the CD said, Oh, okay. We'll redo them.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.680]   And all my all the people in my feed, like Greg Gonzalez at the
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:08.640]   at Yale are having fits and said the CDC is worthless now and they're playing
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:12.240]   on the WHO. Is this it's this institutional hatred we have now?
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:15.120]   Yeah. Well, and but you see the consequence.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:23.040]   If if you turn your back on expertise, then you more people die very simply.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.640]   Yeah, you're pretty much rudderless then.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.760]   Yeah. And well, if you turn it, yeah, if you turn your back on expertise
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.560]   and expertise is required, boom. Yeah.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:38.880]   People will die. And unfortunately, politicians have other motives that,
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:44.640]   you know, definitely the really the real irony of all this is nobody really liked
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:50.880]   Governor Cuomo. No, no, no, no, but nobody really likes Governor Newsom.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:56.320]   They both have 80% approval ratings because they took some leadership role.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.520]   Yes. If the president really had wanted to get reelected,
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.720]   I'm beginning to think he doesn't because if he'd really wanted to get reelected,
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.000]   it would have been simple. It would have been simple.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.760]   Just take a leadership role. Just say,
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.680]   I'm a little guy. Where am I? Yes.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.960]   Yes. Manufactured. I'm going to bring the power of the office.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.200]   Simple. You wouldn't even have to do anything.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:21.920]   No, just say it. CDC recommendations actually say politicians shouldn't deliver these messages
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:26.400]   because the worry that it will be politicized. And in the countries that have done very well,
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:32.240]   like New Zealand, Jacinda stepped back, their prime minister stepped back and the briefings
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:35.120]   were held by scientists, by by other people,
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.320]   apologists, same with, well, Germany is now coming surging a little bit.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.680]   They're coming back up a little bit. That by the way, that's the other side of this is
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:46.800]   maybe even if you follow best practices, this is a nasty as virus.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.480]   Oh, oh, oh, you know, it's going to come back. But the thing is you can then control it in a
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.760]   different way. Right. Yeah. Right. Two British ladies came to New Zealand. They had it,
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.200]   but they know the British. How do they know who she talked to you? You deal with that.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:05.680]   Yeah. Yeah. But we're really so far past. What's sad to me is if you had a good policy,
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:12.560]   including cloth homemade cloth, face masks, our economy would not be in such bad shape that you
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:22.160]   could open, you know, things. And so it that's the irony of all this is just the slightest sense.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:26.400]   He would have an 80% approval rate. He would sail the victory in November.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:30.800]   It's almost as if he's doing everything he can not to get elected.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:36.720]   I mean, he's pissing off old people. Don't piss off old people.
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.200]   Hey, vote. Jeff and I vote.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:46.720]   If you listen to Rachel Maddow last night, which I'm sure to some people is, but fine. I like her.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:52.320]   The Mary Trump book, she was just in prime for.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.000]   Did she read it? Is it out now? Can you read it?
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.360]   No, it's not out yet, but Rachel will want to read it.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.080]   I kind of just give you the answer. It feels like it's the extra out.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:06.080]   No, it this one feels very different. It feels like she's a clinical psychiatrist,
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:11.520]   psychologist. And it feels, yes, there's there's family stuff she's dealing with.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:17.040]   But no, it feels like it's actually a fairly level-headed view.
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:22.720]   Facebook has a fan subscription program. Is that?
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.680]   Yes, they do. You got that.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:33.200]   This is if your creator, they saw this last two years ago, you can charge fans a $5 monthly fee
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:38.080]   for exclusive content and a fan badge. Maybe that's what you think that's what Twitter is.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:44.240]   They can. That's interesting. I wouldn't do that, but I can see influencers would love that.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.880]   And celebrities. I don't know if I would do that.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:51.600]   No, but we're not that kind of people. No, we're not the cynical nasty.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:55.680]   We're not that nobody pay five bucks. I'm not cynical or nasty or old.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:54:01.760]   No, I actually would pay five bucks there to put a little Stacy badge on my Facebook feed.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:06.720]   Oh, Jeff, how dare you? What about a gift of me?
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:08.080]   Happy dance.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.480]   I want your noise. I want the Stacy noise.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:20.080]   You know, I first heard Leo LaPort's name when young Jake Jarvis wanted to give who's
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.000]   this Leo LaPort? You want to give money to?
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.040]   Oh, he want to give me money?
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:26.400]   Yeah, he does. He joined. He did their brief time.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:29.120]   You did the thing. We still have that. We just don't promote it.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:32.480]   Well, you didn't know you did kind of a membership thing. It was like five dollars a month or something.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:36.320]   No, no, no, no. It was a tip chart. I was never we never got anything for it.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.080]   Which was probably the big mistake we made.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:43.840]   No, I'm bad at self promotion.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:48.960]   And I felt really guilty having advertising and asking for money.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.160]   So we just we have a tip chart, but it's hidden. We hide it.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.000]   If you really want it, you're going to find it.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:00.240]   Let's see. What else? What else? Did you read?
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.600]   I wanted to do. I wanted to do.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.520]   Oh, yeah. Your turn. Yeah. She had her choice.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:03.920]   Your turn.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.080]   That's OK. I talked forever about Google.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:09.760]   I actually really enjoyed the Bezos future thing for.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.120]   That's what I was going to bring up.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.080]   It wasn't that interesting?
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.840]   We're on the same way.
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:17.920]   So this was a super interesting.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:22.960]   Yeah. By Nathan Robinson, who is, I think he's an editor there.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.240]   I should go look at the buy one.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.840]   He's got a long opinion.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:30.320]   And basically, he talks about the whole world.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:33.600]   Like, do we want the world to look like Amazon?
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:38.000]   Right. Do we want Amazon to basically get its goal of continual growth?
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.960]   And then he says, and plus, why is Amazon doing this?
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:45.280]   Why is Bezos so into growing and making more money?
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.200]   It's because he wants to set us all into space.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:53.040]   And the parallels to the early kind of Christian,
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:56.800]   damn, the earthful speed ahead to the afterlife kind of perspective,
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.120]   were so obvious here.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:02.880]   It's like, oh, Bezos is just like one of those people who,
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:11.680]   in the late 1800s, late 1900s, early 1900s, who were like,
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.360]   who cares about the earth?
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:14.240]   Who cares about this?
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.000]   We will all meet in the afterlife.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:16.480]   Right.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.840]   Except the afterlife for Bezos is colonies in space.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:25.360]   He wants, he says, imagine humanity spread out throughout the galaxy.
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:29.120]   There'd be a thousand Einstein's because there'd be so many of us.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:33.200]   And the problem with this is if you are a true,
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.600]   then I don't know if Jeff's a true believer in this.
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:36.880]   I mean, he talks a lot about it.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:38.400]   This is being his, you know,
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.480]   He's doing a billion dollars a year towards it.
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.200]   You know, he has a lot of money.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:44.080]   That's for him.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.280]   And that's not, you know, that's like us giving a thousand dollars to a cause.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:53.680]   He apparently got this bug when he was a kid.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:57:00.560]   And the threat, according to the author of this piece in current affairs,
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:07.680]   is if you believe that the only future for the human race is off planet,
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:11.280]   then you'll do anything to achieve it, including,
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.840]   send, you know, who cares about the environment because we're going to get off the planet.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:20.560]   I'm not paying any taxes because every penny that I give the federal government is wasted
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:23.280]   compared to my plan to bring us into space.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:29.680]   And I don't know if this is, I don't think this is what Jeff Bezos
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:29.840]   know.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.440]   No, this is ridiculous.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:38.560]   But it is, it is the case that what he's, what he's doing, you know,
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:41.520]   is essentially saying, I want to control all commerce.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.560]   I want all commerce to run through me.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:50.080]   And I think that's a reasonable thing to say.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.840]   We don't know why he's obviously already infinitely rich.
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:55.200]   It's a good business.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.720]   Yeah, but he doesn't need the money.
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:00.240]   We don't know why he wants to do this.
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:04.960]   The good of these guys who I know what makes, what makes, I know what makes Sammy run.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:05.680]   Standard oil.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:11.680]   The good news is Walmart's going to launch a Amazon Prime competitor in July.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.720]   I want to see, I think the best thing we could hope for.
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:19.680]   I mean, I, I like Amazon, but what we could really hope for is a, is a challenger.
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:24.000]   Well, some of the things that they're saying about Amazon, five to eight,
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.960]   eight to eight, eight to 10 years ago, we were saying about Walmart.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:27.200]   Right.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.120]   I mean, nobody looks at Walmart and it's like, yeah,
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:31.040]   their labor practices are amazing.
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:31.680]   No, that's true.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.200]   Good point Stacey.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:34.640]   They were going to take over the world.
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:35.520]   They were evil.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:36.080]   Oh my God.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:38.080]   And now they're the salt, they're the white knight.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:39.920]   That's all that's all we got left.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:44.640]   But it's part which was, but the competition will keep Walmart in line and
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:46.800]   Walmart will keep Amazon in line.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:52.160]   I mean, there is absolutely true that Bezos's labor relations are not great.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:52.880]   I mean, they suck.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:53.280]   They suck.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:58.640]   He wants to basically suck every bit of juice out of his employees and doesn't
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:58:59.120]   much care.
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:00.240]   They're disposable to him.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.000]   Listen, while I go to pieces.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.200]   Go ahead.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:03.520]   Sorry.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:03.680]   Go.
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:03.680]   Go.
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:04.160]   Go.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:07.360]   No, I was going to say he's optimizing for growth and he's done what I think is
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:08.160]   frightening.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:12.320]   And this is actually something I think about a lot because of IoT because it allows you to
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:15.920]   make to really drive home efficiencies and optimize, right?
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:21.600]   But he's optimized for lowered costs to the end consumer and
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:28.480]   higher revenue, not margin, revenue for Amazon.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:33.280]   And he is managing to squeeze every ounce of that out of the system.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:40.080]   And it's kind of frightening because when you do that and technology gives you the ability to do
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:46.400]   that so efficiently that you can win at that game, right?
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:50.320]   You can eke out to the very last tenth of a cent if you want to.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:52.000]   You just won't care about anything else.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.600]   And that's terrifying because other companies can do the same thing.
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.400]   And a lot of companies emulate Amazon in this way.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.080]   So we're going to see.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:06.720]   I think the real issue, it's easy to make Jeff be the stalking horse for this.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:12.720]   But honestly, this is what this is the capitalistic way is infinite growth.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:20.080]   And I think that we really, especially now, given that we've seen the consequences of
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:27.680]   untrammeled growth environmentally, not to mention in labor practice and other things,
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.840]   we need to really kind of rethink this.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:33.200]   This is going to be a difficult conversation because everything we do,
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.840]   certainly in the Western world, is designed around this notion that you could continue to grow.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.680]   What's your GNP?
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.880]   If it's negative, that's bad.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.520]   It's got to be the highest number possible.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.560]   And that's not, I think, sustainable on the planet.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.840]   We just can't.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:57.280]   So there actually are a lot of movements towards either zero growth, no growth,
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.960]   sustainable growth, that kind of thing that I think it would really be nice
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:07.280]   to look at these and maybe rethink this kind of worship of eternal
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.640]   summer growth is good and necessary.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:11.680]   It creates jobs.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.240]   It creates wealth.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:18.720]   But the issue is how you then distribute that and what the limits are to that.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:25.280]   And so do you end up with the Carnegie Corporation and do you end up with the Bezos
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:28.720]   Foundation and the Zuckerberg Chan Foundation?
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.920]   And that's how the money gets redistributed or you do it through taxes.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.120]   It's basically your choice.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:38.400]   And I think there's more and more call now to redistribute wealth through taxes.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.000]   And I'm well for that.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.360]   That's government's job to do and it's politically unpopular.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.320]   And that's the issue.
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:49.520]   But it's politically unpopular because the Republicans did such a good job in the
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:53.200]   late 70s, early 80s in demonizing government.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.080]   And so here we are.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.440]   And and taxes with them.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:57.760]   Yes.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:02.560]   I just also think though there is there is a case to be made whether government taxes
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:03.280]   are not.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:07.360]   You cannot just continue to grow resources run out.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.520]   It is it is not possible.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.560]   What if you take and this is this is my I grew up reading science fiction
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.920]   brain speaking.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:18.800]   But what if we took a different approach to resources?
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.960]   Like we're seeing things like, you know, there's renewable energy.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:30.160]   There are if you think about using things like CRISPR to grow building materials,
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.800]   for example, that are strong and flexible.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:35.200]   But we don't actually invest in that sort of thing.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:42.080]   We don't we have a we have the same innovators dilemma as as a country as researchers.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.520]   We don't want to like undercut what we've always done, right,
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.400]   which is extraction based mining of resources, right?
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:55.600]   So I feel like more so than just saying, hey, we need to think about taxation,
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.160]   which we do.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:02.800]   We also need to think about the resources we elect to use and how we're trying to
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:08.800]   use what the world has made available to us.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:16.640]   And if we can if we can take that shift and start shifting some of our R and D and some of our
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:23.840]   creativity into taking advantage of harnessing, not extracting what the natural world offers,
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.760]   I think there could be some really cool.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.280]   And Bezos is investing in that, right?
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.880]   Bezos says he's put what is it?
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:34.640]   A hundred million dollars or whatever it is toward investing in that.
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:40.400]   He's promised that the company is going to be fully on renewable energy by 2025.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.120]   I think it was.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:47.440]   You know, so that's why the theory that he wants to destroy the earth to get off of it.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:51.040]   No, but he's got business reasons to do it.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:54.960]   A hundred million is nothing to that man.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.400]   I mean, like they said, he's got a hundred.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.160]   He sells a billion dollars worth of stock for Blue Origin every year.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.800]   He, you know, a hundred million is nothing.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:10.480]   And by the way, the company had full disclosure as I have some Amazon stock,
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.800]   which I have this close before.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:19.360]   But damn, it's heading toward, it could be the first two trillion dollar company.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.800]   It's now in the trillion and a half.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.240]   It's ridiculous range.
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:22.800]   Subserts.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.840]   It's unbelievable.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:24.400]   It's problematic.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.840]   It's just been unbelievable.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.800]   It's problematic, I think.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.320]   That's the market.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.320]   I'm not going to be the poster boy for steady state economy.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.040]   I believe in it.
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.320]   I think it's the right thing to do.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.440]   I don't think it's going to happen.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:41.520]   But if you want to read more, SteadyState.org is the center for the advancement of a steady state economy.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.760]   And I think it's a lot to read.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.000]   I think it's really, really good information.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.400]   And this is a discussion to have.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.240]   Is this larger discussion?
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.240]   It gets us away from more panic.
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.960]   Yeah, because it's not just Jeff Bezos.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:00.720]   Jeff's just doing what every single person in an economy like ours is trying to do.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.400]   Infinite growth.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.920]   But it's not sustainable.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.400]   And unfortunately, Jeff's gotten very good at it.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:09.040]   So he's kind of the poster boy for this.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:13.440]   But so there were two pieces in the rundown today that I thought were very sensible in this way.
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.920]   One was, we just mentioned them both.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:20.000]   And this guy's one was Politico saying that the ad boycott fine,
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.760]   but let's look at what costs the past.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.800]   Really, it's virtue signaling.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:27.120]   And it's going to turn out, Facebook's going to be better off.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.800]   This is what's happened in the past.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.880]   It's a game that they're both playing.
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.320]   I thought was very sensible.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:38.640]   And then Casey Newton's piece about that it's not really
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.680]   the press versus tech.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:47.680]   It's really about employees versus managers, which I thought was also very interesting take.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.720]   That we're seeing fundamental shifts here.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:55.200]   And what social media does allow now is it allows employees to gang up on
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:02.880]   to find each other and gather together and then act and put pressure on their managers.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:08.240]   And that to your point, Stacy, and your point, Leo, about what creates the pressure to change
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.120]   the rules of the game.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:12.800]   That's a new factor here.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.880]   And it's interesting to see how it's playing out.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.080]   So I thought they were really interested in it.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.920]   They no longer played Tech as Evil.
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:25.440]   They looked at the underlying dynamics of companies and economies and communications now.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:32.000]   If Tech's only evil because they've gotten so good at exploiting their advantage,
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.200]   but it's an advantage everyone would explain given the chance.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.880]   It's just the rules of the game.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.040]   So I agree.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.560]   It doesn't to assault Tech or attack Jeff Bezos.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.440]   I thought it was a great article and raised some interesting points,
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.280]   but it doesn't really get to the fundamental flaw.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.720]   I think that's going to go on forever.
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:54.320]   But as somebody in the chatroom says, this is a pointless conversation
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.360]   because we're like the paperclip factory.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:03.120]   We're just going to keep making paperclips till there's nothing more to make paperclips with.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.320]   You know what I'd like to do right now?
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:08.000]   To kill the humans so we can make more paperclips.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.600]   More paperclips.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:14.320]   There's a lot more to talk about.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.480]   I do want to get the Google change log in if you don't mind.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.320]   So Jeff, would you do the honors?
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:22.160]   The Google change log.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:27.760]   That's JB Rockman at the controls.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.360]   Thank you, Jeff Rockman.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:33.920]   Rumors flying that forget the Pixel 4a,
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:40.080]   get ready for the Pixel 5, maybe contributing to that Google has now and they admit it.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.880]   Discontinue the Pixel 3a.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:46.400]   And it's Big Brother the 3XL.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:51.200]   Still no release of the Pixel 4a, which a lot of people were hoping would be like a
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:56.320]   success to the 3a, which was a less expensive but yet very nice Pixel phone.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:02.720]   There does seem to be some evidence that maybe the 4a is not going to be released.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:06.320]   There's got to be a warehouse somewhere with millions.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.840]   Is there a warehouse for them in boxes?
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:08.640]   Yeah, it has to be.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:18.400]   So I don't know what's going on at the Goog, but there's one piece of information
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:20.080]   as we get closer to something.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:24.560]   You know, if they wait too long, they might as well just jump to the 5.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:30.960]   They might as well just jump to the 3, 4a's for everybody.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.920]   Is Google Voice back?
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:38.240]   JR Raphael writing a computer world.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:45.280]   He's a big Android guy pointing out that in fact, Google Voice may be back.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:52.800]   For one thing, Google has released it from the Fi bonds that we're tying it down.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.520]   Now those of us with Fi can continue to use Google Voice.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:00.400]   You don't have to give up your Google Voice number to get Google Fi.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:05.440]   And there's now a Google Voice optional G Suite add-on.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:10.960]   So maybe Google Voice, maybe Google's decided to bring Voice back.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:17.440]   I don't, it's a strange thing, but you can now, if you are a Fi subscriber or Google Voice user,
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:20.080]   you can now coexist peacefully.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.880]   Good news, because I think Google Voice is one of the best things they ever did.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:29.040]   One of the things I don't know if they are really important or not, but the balloon-powered
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.760]   internet or Google Loon is not dead yet.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.480]   A commercial deal.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:41.600]   It's a business, a commercial deal in Kenya is the first application of balloon-powered
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.520]   internet in Africa.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.240]   And of course, this is potentially a very big market.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.520]   It is the continent with the lowest internet penetration.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.800]   There is a loon balloon.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:55.280]   They're high-flying stratospheric balloons that bring the internet.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.440]   They started delivering internet access to Kenya yesterday.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:02.400]   Didn't they deliver it in Puerto Rico?
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.440]   And I want to say...
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:06.400]   They did during the, after the hurricane, yeah.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:06.880]   Okay.
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.360]   I was like, I really thought that...
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.880]   It's not their first deployment.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.760]   After Maria...
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.600]   No, they used more per perinage.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:14.080]   Yeah.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.120]   But this is a commercial.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.640]   This is the first kind of...
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:22.080]   It's ironic because of course, Elon Musk's Starlink is now starting to get a little
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:22.400]   ground.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.920]   They've got a lot of satellites up there and they say they're going to launch this year.
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.000]   So I don't...
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.120]   We'll see.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:32.160]   We'll see.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:35.920]   I just want internet on every square inch of the planet.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.600]   I don't care how we do it.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.240]   Well, so do they.
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:39.600]   So your interests are aligned.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:40.240]   There we go.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:40.880]   We agree.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:45.840]   There's plenty of people who do not want internet on every square inch of the planet.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:45.840]   Who's that?
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:46.880]   Just a reminder.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.600]   Dictators.
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.800]   Oh, well, those people definitely.
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.400]   And all the EMF people, the people who are burning their 5G.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.480]   It causes COVID.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:02.320]   Actually, Project Loon balloons have been spotted recently over Virginia and the Carolinas.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.560]   That's what that thing is.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.080]   They're bringing COVID.
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.640]   You know, I shouldn't even joke about something like that.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.680]   It'll end up being a mean.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.200]   Somebody else say, yeah.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:16.640]   They fly at 50,000 feet, which is pretty...
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.720]   That's higher than a commercial jet airliner.
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.520]   Well, it better be.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.320]   I don't want it to fly.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.040]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:21.120]   It's true.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:21.680]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.000]   It's really at the edge of the atmosphere.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.400]   So maybe, I thought we said Loon was, you know, dead, but I guess...
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.160]   No, remember we were talking about...
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.480]   At the end of the year, was it the end of the year show?
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.760]   Where were like the Google things that should go away?
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.840]   We played the game where that will be killed.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:40.080]   Right.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.680]   Loon is living.
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:42.800]   Loon's alive.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:43.920]   As is Google voice.
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:47.920]   How would you like to get some traffic lights in your Google Maps?
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.880]   Apparently on Android, you will.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:55.760]   Oh, well, I think I always assumed they knew where the traffic lights were,
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.520]   because you always see the slowdown right there.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.440]   Also, stop signs.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.440]   Now, the real reason this is important is for self-driving vehicles,
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.840]   because they don't necessarily see those stop lights or...
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.080]   Traffic lights or stop signs.
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:10.400]   So that's my guess.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.440]   That's what that's all about.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.120]   Because you know when you get to that intersection,
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:13.920]   there's a light there.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.360]   You don't need a map to tell you then.
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:18.240]   Maybe for planning?
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:18.640]   I don't know.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:24.240]   My mom actually optimizes her routes to avoid traffic lights.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:24.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:25.200]   Actually...
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.880]   Yeah, that's a thing.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.480]   Yeah, that's a thing.
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.760]   And she will run stop signs.
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.600]   Well, that's not a thing.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.640]   That shouldn't be a thing.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:33.840]   She's hell on wheels.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.480]   Don't do that.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.120]   Stay away.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.240]   Go to that.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:36.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:38.320]   You know what else we thought was dead?
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.200]   I'm not dead yet.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.040]   Google Fiber.
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.880]   They announced their first new market for years.
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:45.760]   The...
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:49.440]   Megalopolis of West Des Moines.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.040]   Not Des Moines.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.480]   West Des Moines.
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.520]   Des Moines, Iowa.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.200]   Okay.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.640]   Well, good for them.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:57.360]   Why not?
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.240]   Let's bring it back.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.840]   I don't know what's going on in this world.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:02.640]   Everything is new again.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.080]   Have you...
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.360]   Well, maybe they had a really good option.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.920]   Like maybe the city contracted them or there was...
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.200]   I don't know.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:11.680]   I don't know.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.200]   Or maybe they've changed their strategy.
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.240]   We just don't know.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.320]   For the work of 57,000 people.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:16.640]   Oh.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:19.280]   But boy, you're lucky if you live in West Des Moines.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:19.840]   You're happy.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:21.760]   Boy, are you happy, man.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:27.360]   Just downloaded the new beta 2 for Android 11.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:30.560]   Android R is available if you're in the public beta.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:35.360]   Now, they call this the platform stability milestone,
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:40.640]   which means that beta 2 should carry the final system behaviors
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.800]   as Google approaches a release candidate.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.000]   I found Android 11 beta...
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.120]   This is the third release.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.520]   So there was a beta 1 release after the original Android 11 release.
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.880]   And I found it to be very stable.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.720]   Works really well.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.400]   Some have complained about audio distortion.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.600]   That's gone.
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.440]   The recent apps screen now works.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.960]   Screenshots are supposed to work correctly.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.280]   Screenshots sharing in text selection.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.560]   I haven't seen any of these problems.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.600]   It's worked quite well for me.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.200]   I actually really like Android 11.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:12.320]   And we showed earlier in the show,
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.680]   in case you're just joining us,
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.320]   that the power button now does some home automation stuff.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.320]   You press it for a second.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:20.960]   So that's good.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.880]   That's the new Android 11.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:28.480]   Now, that's all the good stuff you Google's doing.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.280]   Here's the one that's pissing me off.
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:35.600]   YouTube TV is now $65 a month.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.040]   People were upset.
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.400]   Kevin was upset.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.840]   Yeah, a lot upset.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.680]   So it started at $35.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.360]   Went to $50.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.840]   Now goes to $65.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:48.720]   So they've been the second...
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.400]   Another $15 price hike.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.000]   This because...
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.560]   They say the higher costs are programming.
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.800]   The channels they carry are going to cost more.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.800]   But don't worry, because you're going to get such great channels
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.200]   as the Paramount Network,
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.320]   MTV, VH1, and TV Land,
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.880]   they're adding more Viacom CBS channels,
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:13.680]   14 of them.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.320]   And they're going to do that immediately,
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.480]   which is over 85 channels in their base plan.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.800]   And then later, they're going to add MTV2,
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.680]   MTV Classic, Nick Jr.
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:27.120]   All stuff I don't really care about.
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.640]   Apparently they're too...
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.880]   But you're not watching Nick Jr. on the rec?
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:31.600]   I should be.
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:32.240]   I should be.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.280]   What is MTV?
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:34.480]   What is it anymore?
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.880]   It's reality shows.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:39.040]   Do you have...
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.640]   Each of you, do you have cable TV?
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.200]   Yes.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:44.960]   I haven't had cable since 2006, 2008.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:46.080]   Wow.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:48.480]   Leo, how many channels do you watch in a month?
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:51.200]   I don't know.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.360]   I'm not counting.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:56.640]   Basically, I pay for every possible service,
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.480]   every possible form of content,
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:02.320]   and then watch a handful of shows.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.520]   But I want to have the choice.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.840]   I want to have the choice.
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:10.800]   So, honestly, we probably could turn off the cable.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.360]   Except for news, I need news, news channels,
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.680]   local news.
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.520]   What else?
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.520]   Lisa watches the local news in the morning.
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:22.240]   Yeah, not that many.
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.240]   We need Disney Plus.
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:24.960]   And that's all.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.400]   Disney Plus for Hamilton.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.040]   Gotta have it.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:27.840]   Yeah, I'm gonna have it.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:28.880]   Not just for Hamilton.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:33.200]   Every night my daughter watches like 30 minutes of a marvel
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.640]   that he just to feel happy.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:39.280]   We got YouTube, I canceled YouTube TV when it went to $50.
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.600]   And then Lisa said, I can't watch my football games,
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.480]   so I got it back.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:46.720]   But now I think she says it's okay to cancel it,
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:49.280]   'cause she's pissed that it's 65 bucks.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.000]   Now, and the only reason I had it is I was trying it,
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.280]   so I could report on it.
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.880]   Although the DVR is really nice,
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:57.920]   makes it really easy to record shows.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:03.920]   Steve Gibson says he's going over to sling TV.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:09.440]   They're still 35 bucks for kind of not quite as deep and offering,
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:12.240]   but they promise they won't raise their price for a year.
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:13.360]   But this is exact.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:13.680]   You know what?
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.280]   We've seen this.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.640]   We've seen this story before.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:17.680]   This is cable TV.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:19.120]   This is what happened.
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:20.080]   This is what everyone warned us.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:22.960]   I mean, this is what everyone said would happen when
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:26.720]   when we started doing streaming.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:27.760]   Do we like look?
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.280]   Do we like disaggregation?
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.760]   'Cause we're going back to re-aggregation.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.400]   Do we really want Alacart TV?
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.280]   Don't we want that?
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.440]   The challenges?
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:43.520]   Because companies, just a few companies own so many channels,
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:44.960]   like Viacom owns so many.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.840]   So they're like, you will buy all of our channels or none.
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:48.320]   Right.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:51.520]   Which makes total sense from their economic point of view.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:51.840]   Sure.
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:54.640]   I think honestly,
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:59.600]   if I were worried about the spend and I am at this point,
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:03.440]   I think the best thing to do is get Netflix, Amazon Prime,
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.960]   maybe Hulu if there's something you want to see on that.
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:11.280]   The couple of over top services, maybe HBO Max.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:15.120]   I have, I subscribe to some weird ones like the Criterion channel
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:19.120]   and Britbox because, you know, those are interesting.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.280]   But honestly, you could narrow it down.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.560]   And I have to say, I think I bet you this is going to hurt.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.640]   They say they have 2 million subscribers.
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.880]   I've heard a lot of pain, a lot of howls.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.040]   That's a cable subscription.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.080]   Right?
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:36.000]   So there was a story, I just put it in the rundown,
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.320]   that Pennsylvania town had crappy internet access.
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:44.160]   So they built a tower to beam it into the homes.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.840]   And I thought that's exactly how cable started in Pennsylvania.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.520]   Because people couldn't get access.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:53.200]   So they built the community access TV, CATV.
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:59.120]   And so there's a ying yang here that the community tries to step up
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.600]   because it wants something, then the company takes it over,
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:07.280]   then the company makes it awful, and then tries to imprison you.
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.880]   And so YouTube thinks we're imprisoned.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.720]   Disney thinks we're imprisoned.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:11.680]   We're trapped.
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.240]   We're--
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:12.880]   But are we really?
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.920]   I'm going to do Disney+ for one month.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.400]   It's worth it for Hamilton.
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:20.160]   That's what I want to see Hamilton, but that's it.
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.520]   Seven months, yeah.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.200]   It's actually a good deal.
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:28.000]   Because the movie would cost you twice that to go see it.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.280]   There's--
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:31.600]   I mean, Disney+ is not terrible.
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.640]   There's some good stuff in there.
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:33.120]   It's not for me.
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:34.000]   I don't have any kids.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:34.640]   So I don't--
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:35.200]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:35.360]   Right.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.640]   Thank God.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:37.840]   I don't have to watch that crap.
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:40.000]   You're saying that because it's so much better than Barney.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.320]   You're OK.
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.040]   I've been wrong.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:46.400]   You're still at that phase.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:46.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:47.680]   You'll be talking about that stuff.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.400]   No, I will watch it.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.240]   I like Marvel movies.
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:50.880]   I like--
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:51.440]   I guess.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:52.480]   I guess.
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:53.280]   Yeah, there's stuff.
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:53.840]   Start, Rick.
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:56.880]   We watched The Mighty Ducks the other night.
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.400]   Never seen it.
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:58.880]   Mead.
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:19:59.360]   Never will.
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.560]   We've never seen The Mighty Ducks.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.360]   We've never seen it.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:02.160]   We're not going to do it.
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:02.320]   No.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.280]   All right.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:03.920]   Not see--
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.520]   There is no possible reason for the--
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:05.920]   I watched--
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:05.920]   For the--
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:06.880]   I watched--
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:07.600]   To watch the Mighty--
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.960]   I watched Brief Encounter with Trevor Howard last night.
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:11.600]   So there.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.560]   You are so classy.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:13.600]   You are such a--
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:14.320]   David Lean.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:17.840]   That's why I get the Criterion Channel.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:18.880]   Because they have--
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:22.160]   It's like having an art house movie theater in your house.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.360]   You know, my dumb thing is--
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.720]   Which is what everyone wants.
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:25.680]   Yeah, nobody wants.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.240]   I know.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:26.720]   I know.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.080]   I do HGTV.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:28.960]   And I do--
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:32.960]   I love watching the building Alaska shows
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:34.400]   and the building off the bridge shows.
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.600]   I don't know why I love that.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.480]   I enjoy that too.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.120]   Like fantasy.
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:37.680]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:37.680]   I love it.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.200]   I want to live off the grid.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.360]   I enjoy--
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.160]   And I'm ashamed--
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:42.880]   I guess you know--
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.960]   He's leaving Facebook and he's going to leave electricity.
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.840]   I can't wait.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.640]   I can't wait.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:49.600]   Lisa and I are getting a little--
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:55.600]   It's a greenhouse, but it's a self.
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.640]   It's aquaponic.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:57.760]   It's a self.
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:59.680]   You put fish in the bottom and then--
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:00.560]   It's a biosphere.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.760]   You're a little biosphere.
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:05.760]   It's a little biosphere where we can grow our microgreens.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.800]   Our microgreens.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.200]   That's it.
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.280]   That's all we're going to live on for the rest of our lives.
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.720]   It's going to be so awesome.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:13.120]   With our well water, we're getting the Tesla battery,
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.000]   power wall so I can get off the grid.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:16.880]   It's going to be awesome.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.680]   Oh, wow.
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:20.000]   OK.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.600]   It's a new show.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.120]   I'll play for the Leosphere.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:27.200]   That's it for the--
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:27.840]   That's it.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.280]   Basta on the change log.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.640]   Play that thing.
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:36.960]   I was--
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.240]   I don't know--
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:38.560]   OK.
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.320]   I actually--
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.160]   A lot of times I read articles and I go,
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.760]   Jeff Jarvis--
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:45.680]   I want to know what Jeff Jarvis says about this.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:46.800]   And actually, Stacy too.
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.440]   Did you read about this clubhouse thing?
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:51.680]   Oh, yes.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.720]   I didn't care about it.
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:53.360]   I didn't care.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:53.360]   I didn't care.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.160]   I tried to avoid it.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:54.720]   I didn't either.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.000]   I tried my best to avoid it.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.440]   I ended up having to look at it some--
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.960]   I--
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:06.080]   It's some whiny Silicon Valley power brokers saying,
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.400]   "I don't like journalists and that Taylor Lawrence.
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.120]   She sucks."
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.040]   And meh, meh, meh.
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:13.200]   I listened to the recording for like five minutes.
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.200]   I thought, "Oh, this is terrible."
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:16.800]   And--
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:17.600]   But who cares?
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.120]   These are people just--
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:20.000]   They're not a hurricane.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.760]   Because she was mad at the head of a way
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:27.200]   who's employees are mad because she's mean to them.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.960]   So everybody's just mean to each other.
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.400]   And I blame Twitter.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.360]   It's all--
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.600]   Twitter turns you into mean people.
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.160]   No, it doesn't.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:34.960]   Yes, it does.
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:35.840]   No, I--
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.440]   I think venture capitalists just in general are thin-skinned and mean.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:40.560]   Some of them aren't.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:41.200]   Yes.
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.640]   There are thin-skinned--
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:43.920]   And they know--
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.040]   I mean, he can say,
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.360]   "Oh, I wasn't bullying."
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:51.600]   But they know when they complain about someone who is--
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:54.720]   And you know, the other thing is,
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.000]   I would say nobody behaved awesomely here.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.400]   Like, Taylor Lawrence probably should not have taken to Twitter on this.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.080]   People should just stay out of Twitter.
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:04.880]   I'm telling you.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.280]   Yep.
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.280]   She can't because that's her job.
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.600]   Well, yeah, she--
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.240]   But to just ignore that--
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:16.720]   To attack the CEO on Twitter, not in the story was right.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:19.200]   And the head of--
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.480]   What's her name in the head of a way?
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:22.160]   Said things on Twitter.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:22.880]   It's just--
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.160]   It brings out things in people.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:27.360]   So related to this Harper's letter.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:30.000]   Oh, I'm just going to disengage right now.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.480]   On open-- on justice and open debate.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:35.760]   No, we're going to suck you in, Stacey.
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.120]   You just wait.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.560]   You're going to be going after it.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:39.680]   So Mike Masnick--
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:43.520]   So this letter is a whole bunch of names,
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:44.400]   many respected--
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:46.160]   Very, very respected names.
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:49.040]   All complaining about cancel culture.
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:52.560]   And basically, you know, Bennett at the New York Times being fired.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:55.760]   And they put no specifics in here, but that's what they--
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:57.520]   They don't even mention any of those things.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:59.520]   They just say, you know, getting free speech.
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:01.280]   Or free speech is good.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:05.520]   Just how can we-- without a free exchange of information and ideas,
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:08.000]   the lifeblood of a liberal society,
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:12.240]   we can't have a good idea.
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:12.800]   A good idea.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.880]   You know me, I'm all Mr. Free Speech.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.360]   But free speech includes editing.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:20.320]   It includes the right to choose what you put up and not put up.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:23.360]   It includes not having speech forced upon you.
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.440]   So there's been a lot of great responses.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:29.760]   And the brilliant Mike Masnick in here only last week,
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:33.600]   we wrote a really good piece about this, just tearing it apart.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:36.080]   And there've been a lot of other threads
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.840]   that called this part of me, Stacey.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.120]   This is how I'm going to draw you in here.
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.400]   But it wasn't me who said it the first time.
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.520]   I'm just going to let you know.
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.560]   Moral panic.
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:47.200]   Josh Benton at the even lab at Harvard just immediately said,
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:48.160]   this is moral panic.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.040]   It's not really happening.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.480]   It's not really a problem.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:51.600]   And people are making stuff up.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.040]   But I didn't say it, Stacey.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:53.520]   He did.
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:56.160]   She doesn't care.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:56.800]   She just doesn't care.
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.080]   Harper, I love Mike's headline.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.280]   I'm not engaging.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:02.240]   Harper's gives prestigious platform to famous writers
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:04.080]   so they can whine about being silenced.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:07.440]   All of whom-- or many of whom are at all.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.600]   Many of whom have tried to silence people in turn.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.320]   Right.
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.720]   But so JK Rowling signed it.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:18.400]   And of course, she's been accused of anti-trans-centiments.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.080]   And I have to say, again, I'm on blame Twitter.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.840]   It's all Twitter, man.
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:24.240]   It's stuff.
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:27.120]   People say stuff on Twitter that our hot takes.
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.320]   They're off the cuff.
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:29.920]   They're arguably dumb.
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:33.280]   But they should be treated as temporary.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.800]   You can argue the opposite.
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:35.440]   And they're not.
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:36.880]   They're kept permanently.
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.000]   So it's a criminal record.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:38.960]   Go ahead, Stacey.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:39.680]   If you did it.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:43.840]   So one of the interesting things I found about the whole JK Rowling
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:47.840]   and the turf comments was that there is a culture in the UK
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:50.720]   that that's normal.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:53.680]   And what's interesting is I would have had no idea of that,
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.360]   just because it's something I don't think about.
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:59.520]   But by having a global platform,
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:04.160]   we're coming to some sort of agreement on what's okay
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.640]   and what's not between the two countries.
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:09.120]   And JK Rowling is bearing the brunt of that.
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.200]   But at the same time, maybe it will force some people
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:16.480]   over in the UK to reevaluate how they feel about trans women.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.080]   And that can't be anything.
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:21.840]   We actually kind of--
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.160]   I'm curious to see, because we haven't talked about this,
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.680]   but like TikTok getting banned,
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:30.320]   we could see some things like we're seeing cultural aggression
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.160]   from a cultural aggression.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.520]   That's probably a silly thing to say.
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.560]   That's good.
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:35.920]   No, that's good.
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:36.960]   That's a book.
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:40.640]   In terms of values and that sort of thing being pushed
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:44.160]   with like TikTok, and we're pushing back against that.
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:50.400]   So in some ways, yes, this is gutting and hard,
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:51.440]   but it's also--
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.000]   It's cool.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.400]   It's like what happens when you get different people in the room
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:57.520]   and you start talking to each other.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.320]   You're like, you think that?
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:26:59.040]   That's wacky.
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.120]   Yes.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:08.240]   This is society relearning how to have a conversation with itself
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:10.400]   after 600 years of Gutenberg.
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:10.720]   OK.
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:13.200]   I'll give you that.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.320]   Oh, rolling.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.440]   Rhyme's with bowling.
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:15.840]   Thank you.
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.600]   Oh, I said rowly.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:18.080]   Oh, really?
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:18.960]   It's rolling.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:19.280]   OK.
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:19.760]   Rolling.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.000]   Oh.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.600]   The lady who wrote the Harry Potter books.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:23.920]   Yes.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:27.600]   But Masnick, I just wanted to just want to hear from Masnick,
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.760]   because I'm a big fan.
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:32.240]   I've never met him, but he was on the show last week,
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.360]   and we love you, Stacey.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:34.720]   But we also like Mike.
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:36.240]   And so it was nice to have him here.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:36.800]   Oh, no, I love him.
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.680]   Yeah, I wish we got to have you and him on the same time.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:40.800]   I'm back, absolutely.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:44.240]   And so he-- but he goes off of these nice little--
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:48.240]   so Mike comes off as all rye online, right?
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:51.520]   And on the podcast, he was just an incredibly nice guy,
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.320]   right?
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.080]   Very easygoing, very smart.
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:55.360]   And he said, yeah, people think that about me.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.160]   I don't know why.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.800]   But there's one paragraph.
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.120]   He said, with so many famous and serious authors
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:03.840]   signing on this letter, I have to call out the use of the word
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:04.640]   "sensorious."
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:07.760]   This word is commonly misused and misunderstood.
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:10.320]   It does not mean as many assumed pronus censorship.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.600]   That is sensorial.
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:14.800]   Sensorious actually means hypocritical of others,
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:16.480]   not trying to force them into silence.
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:19.120]   That's a Mike Masnick moment, right?
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:19.520]   I love it.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:20.880]   He just tosses that in.
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:21.520]   He's good.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:25.440]   He knows his words, and he has lots of--
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:25.840]   He does.
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:32.560]   I liked this story.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:35.840]   If I can find it.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.680]   The house approving $50 for broadband spending?
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:40.880]   No, that's a good story.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:41.520]   Really?
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:41.840]   Wow.
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.440]   When did that just happen?
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.520]   That's good.
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.840]   Now, the Senate has to approve it,
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:48.320]   which won't happen.
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.840]   I was just saying, it's just the house,
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:50.320]   but the house--
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:51.840]   It's infrastructure week.
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:53.680]   It's just infrastructure week.
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:53.920]   Right.
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:56.880]   It's the $1.5 trillion infrastructure.
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:57.920]   I love this story.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:58.960]   $100 billion for broadband.
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:00.480]   That would be lovely.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:01.680]   In the Wall Street Journal,
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:04.080]   who is the mystery shopper?
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:09.360]   Leaving behind thousands of online shopping carts.
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:13.280]   And it started with various online merchants
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.880]   compared notes and said,
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.960]   "You know, this guy, John Smith,
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.720]   he comes in, he buys a bunch of stuff,
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:19.920]   loads it up in his cart,
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:21.680]   and never comes back, doesn't buy it.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:23.680]   Doesn't pull the trigger on it."
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:26.640]   And yeah, that's been happening to me.
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:27.920]   This guy named John Smith,
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:28.560]   he comes in,
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.520]   the email addresses don't match.
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:36.000]   In fact, when they mail the traditional,
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.680]   "Hey, you left some stuff in your shopping cart.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:39.600]   If I give you a 10% off, would you buy it?"
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:40.880]   Bounce back,
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.640]   because they're not real email addresses.
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:45.040]   It's a great mystery.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.960]   But it's also a problem,
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:49.520]   because a lot of these companies
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:52.400]   pay attention to what people put in their cart
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.240]   and use it for analytics
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.120]   to decide what products to continue to sell,
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:57.840]   things like that.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:00.640]   It's screwing up their analytics
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:03.360]   that this John Smith's coming in all the time,
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.320]   messing things up.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.880]   Quite a mystery.
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:10.480]   Until Google admitted,
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:12.240]   "Oh, that was us."
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.760]   "Our bad."
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:14.960]   Our bad.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:19.120]   So Google apparently is part of Google shopping,
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:22.160]   because sometimes you have to go to a store
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:23.360]   and put something in the cart
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:25.360]   before you can see the final price,
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.520]   or add the shipping and handling price.
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:29.760]   So you can't really tell what something costs
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:32.080]   until you go through the process of buying it.
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.720]   So Google has created bots to do that.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:38.640]   Name John Smith,
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:42.400]   and creating email addresses at Gmail Forum.
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:47.760]   And it's just the way they collect price data.
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:51.680]   So the mystery solved.
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:54.240]   Google says the company's looking to clarify
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:56.000]   how those automated systems
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.600]   will work with merchant websites
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.000]   in the future to avoid confusion.
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.920]   What a mystery.
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:04.000]   You know, I started reading this.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.680]   I thought, "Why is the Wall Street Journal
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:07.280]   writing about this?"
[01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:09.920]   This is just a weird story.
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:11.280]   Oh, it's a head-
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:13.520]   "Ahead story, that middle story."
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:14.160]   Yeah, A-head.
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:15.360]   Is that a word?
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:15.760]   A-head.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:17.200]   What does that mean?
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:17.840]   Isn't that what they call it?
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:18.240]   A-head?
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.120]   Yeah, it says A-head.
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:19.920]   What is A-head?
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:22.080]   It's the middle column in the front.
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:23.600]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:24.800]   I thought you were asking what it is.
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:25.440]   I am asking.
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:25.840]   I don't know.
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:27.920]   You guys are pressmen.
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:28.640]   Oh, Chase, he's right.
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:29.040]   Go ahead, Chase.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.640]   You're all about this stuff.
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:31.920]   Oh, well, Jeff, you were also right.
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.040]   What is it?
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:34.480]   It's the front page of the...
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:36.400]   You know how the front page of the Wall Street Journal,
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:38.720]   the middle story is always a featurey,
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:41.280]   fun kind of story.
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.720]   Oh, and they call that A-head.
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:43.280]   They call it A-head.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.520]   But Jeff is telling you why it's called that.
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.320]   Why it's also-
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:46.880]   It just was this...
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.960]   It's that kind of story.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.640]   Always it went under that sized headline.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:52.160]   Oh, I get it.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:55.280]   So it's really the head, sure for headline.
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:56.560]   It's the size of the headline.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:57.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:58.880]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.800]   That's hysterical.
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:02.560]   I didn't even know that.
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:07.120]   So these are all the interesting stories.
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:08.800]   Yeah, they're the fun...
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:12.160]   I mean, when I was starting out,
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:13.360]   I had to read the Wall Street Journal
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:16.240]   because I was covering bonds in the trading market.
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:19.040]   So I would always be on the boring pages,
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:21.520]   but on the way into my job on the subway,
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:22.320]   I would be reading...
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:22.800]   You would stop.
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:23.760]   Well, like this story...
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:24.000]   ...the E-head.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.640]   amusement parks are reopening,
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:28.720]   but because screaming is dangerous.
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:31.200]   In Japan, they're saying,
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.440]   "You may ride the roller coaster,
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:34.880]   but you cannot scream."
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:38.800]   And stop there right there.
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.080]   So the line is,
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:42.240]   "Please scream inside your heart."
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:44.400]   So everyone on Twitter right now was saying,
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.600]   "That's exactly how I feel."
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:48.880]   We're all screaming inside our heart right now.
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.960]   I got to see the video.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:53.280]   This is a video of two executives
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:55.120]   from the...
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:56.640]   We'll turn on the sound,
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.240]   from the amusement park,
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.280]   riding the roller coaster.
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:00.560]   This is how they suggest
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.040]   you ride the roller coaster.
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:05.200]   I would say that if you have a mask on,
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:07.040]   you could scream quietly.
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:09.120]   Here they are,
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:12.560]   riding the roller coaster without screaming.
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.640]   This is just my palm drawer.
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:20.080]   I don't like roller coasters either.
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:21.520]   Uh oh, they're going up.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.360]   They're very stoic.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.360]   They're like,
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.880]   "Come a Kazi, pilots.
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:27.920]   They're about to descend."
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.000]   Is that bad?
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:30.720]   Is that considered...
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:34.800]   Well, it was a thing Japanese people did.
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:37.040]   I know, but it's not a good thing.
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.640]   Not something we should bring up.
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:40.000]   I don't want to offend anybody.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.480]   Just 'cause...
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.280]   Two, eight.
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.760]   [Laughter]
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.120]   Way too late.
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:49.200]   Honestly, you know, we went to the Kama Kazi...
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:51.280]   In Japan, we were in Japan,
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.720]   they had the Kama Kazi Museum.
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:54.480]   And they were talking to that,
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:55.600]   "These guys, here's the stuff."
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:57.040]   I said, "Yeah, I don't know.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.960]   I don't know if I've got the chips that they
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:00.640]   dive bombed into."
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:02.400]   I don't know if they really thought they were heroes.
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.880]   I'm just making me nervous.
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:06.160]   They're almost to the top.
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:11.440]   They really are quite stoic.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:14.400]   Now, seriously, I mean, like...
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:16.480]   You're girding yourself.
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:18.400]   You're starting to sweat on his forehead a little bit.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:19.360]   I see a little sweat on him.
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.760]   See, just 'cause you're a amusement park executive
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:24.000]   doesn't mean you actually ride these things.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.600]   I think Japan it does.
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:28.240]   Does it?
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:29.120]   You're required to?
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:30.640]   I think they're very much a...
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.720]   This is a salaryman job here.
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:33.040]   Okay.
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:36.720]   He's just looking around.
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:38.400]   Yeah, this guy's like, "Shill,
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:39.600]   but they're not going fast yet.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.560]   They haven't dropped."
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.160]   Okay, now they're going down.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:42.480]   There is it.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:43.120]   Oh, here it goes.
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:46.480]   This is how you're supposed to enjoy a roller coaster.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.960]   Mask fell off.
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:50.160]   Hold that mask.
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:51.200]   It's a mask.
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:51.920]   No screaming.
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.440]   No enjoying.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:56.000]   Scream inside your heart.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:56.800]   You don't?
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.240]   Do you lift your hands off the barn?
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.360]   No.
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:02.080]   I just don't scream.
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:03.840]   I just don't think I'm loud.
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:09.680]   This is the most anticlimactic roller coaster experience.
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.480]   I think I've seen.
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.360]   Weird video.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:16.000]   Actually, do you think it would be...
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.520]   You'd feel better about a roller coaster
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:18.400]   if you didn't scream,
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:19.920]   if you just screamed inside your heart?
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:21.040]   Well, I'm about to do it.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.800]   Are they sanitizing each thing?
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.960]   Because this guy has touched his face mask
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.560]   like a gajillion times.
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:26.720]   Yeah.
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:27.920]   And I want that thing sanitized.
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:30.720]   This is why I'm not going to the amusement park anytime soon.
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:34.720]   What keeps falling off his nose?
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:35.280]   I am a fan of it.
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:36.960]   There's a lot of velocity happening there.
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:39.680]   I bet my mask wouldn't fall off.
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:42.720]   He's trying to be good.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:43.680]   Keep it in the masking place.
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:44.880]   He's keeping the mask in place.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.240]   Maybe that's what he's demonstrating.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:49.680]   And the other guy who has a properly fitted mask,
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.680]   he's just screaming in his heart.
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:36:00.720]   Do you think there's a camera operator in this first car?
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:02.160]   Because the camera is moving.
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:02.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:03.200]   Yeah.
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.120]   Imagine having to do his backwards.
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:07.040]   He's not screaming either.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:10.000]   Wouldn't it be funny if at the end they go,
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.440]   they have to shoot it all over again.
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:16.720]   This is going to be excellent COVID artifact right here.
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:18.320]   It is so weird.
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:20.320]   It is so weird.
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:20.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.640]   Do you think I think that all the time COVID artifact?
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:25.280]   That was exciting.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:25.920]   Yep.
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:27.440]   Is this hair is this hair must?
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:27.760]   Nope.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:32.480]   All done.
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:36.400]   So I put up in the bottom of the other on the rundown.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:39.280]   Mike Masnick reacting to this because everybody's recognized.
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.760]   And she was basnick again in the Masnick fan club.
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:42.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:44.800]   So I was going to say, I'm like, I can leave Jeff.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:45.680]   I know.
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:46.080]   I know.
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:47.280]   We're going to get a room.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:51.840]   So he put up a great thread, which I just read.
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:54.640]   Oh, he's shaking.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:54.960]   Shake.
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.240]   His hands are shaking.
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:59.040]   That's so weird.
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.360]   So we're Mike as a nipper.
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:03.200]   Heated roller coasters wouldn't do it.
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:04.880]   Dispised it.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:08.480]   And his friends on this summer camp like thing
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:09.280]   kept bugging at me.
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:11.280]   He said, OK, if I ride this one, you'll leave me alone.
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:14.480]   And then he said, OK.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:15.840]   And so they dragged him to it.
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:20.400]   And they told him you're going to you're not going to be afraid.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.960]   If you scream and he screamed and he felt better.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:24.800]   So now you can't.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:28.240]   I'm screaming in your heart.
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:28.960]   Actually, that's true.
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:31.760]   I the times I've been tricked into roller coasters.
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:35.680]   I scream as loud as I can the whole time.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:37.040]   And that does seem to help a little bit.
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:41.360]   Makes you I couldn't because I would be passed out and dead.
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:43.600]   Well, don't do it.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.240]   Coronary.
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:50.960]   Fraunhofer has created a new video compression codec.
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:53.280]   VVC.
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:55.760]   Now this is geeky.
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:57.280]   This is good.
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:58.320]   We haven't found it on my show.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:37:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:37:59.120]   Good.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:37:59.440]   See.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.880]   So you know, I said you're geeky.
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.800]   Fraunhofer can create the mp3.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:05.360]   They created h.264.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:08.640]   They created h.265, the high efficiency video codec,
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:09.920]   which is in wide use right now.
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:14.720]   Their new codec VVC, which is h.266.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:23.040]   They say is can get files shrunk by 50% more than h.265.
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:24.560]   That's pretty impressive.
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.960]   There is an issue and this does relate to Google.
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:30.080]   Because Google won't use it.
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:32.800]   Yeah, they have their own standard.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:38.720]   And they don't like the h.standards because they're patent encumbered.
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:39.840]   There's a licensing.
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:42.160]   Oh, does it say they have to pay for an on-hofer?
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:44.400]   Well, yeah, there's actually so remember
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:50.880]   the there was the MPEG alliance was handling the license originally for all of this.
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:56.880]   The new license organization is Media Coding Industry Forum or MC-IF.
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:01.280]   Companies including Apple, Ericsson, Intel, Huawei, Microsoft, Qualcomm,
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:01.920]   and Sony.
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:08.160]   They say front offer says it'll be friend licensed, which means reasonable,
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:09.920]   but still you got to pay, right?
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:17.600]   So it's brand stand for fair, reasonable, and oh, something else.
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:18.560]   I don't remember.
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:23.520]   But the idea is that it'd be, you know, you wouldn't go for the jugular that you'd
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:24.720]   charge a fair amount.
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:28.400]   And I don't care reasonable.
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:31.200]   And I'm just going to try.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:31.680]   We Google.
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:33.600]   We Google at the same time.
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:36.720]   Who needs a brain simultaneous Googling.
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:38.240]   So that's good.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.720]   I used to actually cover licensing for an IP publication.
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:43.040]   But see this so you won't see this on YouTube.
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:48.720]   But you because they have their VP9 codec and they're their own Google codec.
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:53.680]   So that's not good actually that there's a schism in the video codec world.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:00.240]   I think I'm pretty much done at all anything you missed in here.
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:01.200]   Well, no, I got to see.
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:02.880]   I think I had some fun thing or two.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:03.840]   Let's see what it goes.
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:06.880]   If it has to do with Facebook, I see we skip it.
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:09.120]   Fine with me.
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:09.840]   Fine with me.
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:12.880]   We could talk about the oversight board is going to be around until the fall.
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:15.280]   People are having some fits about that, but we're not going to talk about that.
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:16.240]   This case, you don't want to talk about that.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:16.960]   Mike Pompeo.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:23.440]   Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State, says the US is looking at banning TikTok.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.400]   TikTok.
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.320]   Oh, yeah, that's what I was referencing with our.
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:26.640]   Wow.
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:31.440]   Well, India has banned it and 56 other Chinese apps.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:37.600]   But I wonder what would happen if the US government tried to ban TikTok.
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:40.720]   And the story said it's an empty threat.
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:41.280]   They can't.
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.160]   They're not going to.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:43.520]   Well, they could.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:45.200]   Under what?
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:45.920]   Under what?
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:48.560]   How are you going to get Apple as a First Amendment issue?
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:49.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:50.800]   They couldn't get Apple and Google to pull it.
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:53.360]   But they can put pressure on them.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:00.160]   So it's a big problem in India where a lot of influencers who use TikTok and make money
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:02.960]   with TikTok are very frustrated.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:08.400]   One guy said, I've spent two years building a career on TikTok and now it's gone.
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:10.720]   This is why you own your own platform.
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:11.360]   Right.
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:12.400]   And of story.
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:13.120]   Lesson learned.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:15.120]   TikTok.
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:16.640]   TikTok.
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:22.800]   Oddly, which is a Chinese company, is quitting Hong Kong.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:28.880]   Because they don't want to be used to surveil activists.
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:31.680]   Which sounds very odd.
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:33.120]   That's odd.
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.440]   Yeah, when other companies just said, we're not going to give you data,
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:37.120]   but TikTok pulled out of Hong Kong.
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.240]   I couldn't interpret that.
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:41.280]   Maybe because they couldn't say no.
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.400]   Oh, they can't.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.040]   But the Chinese government.
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:44.000]   But can they pull out?
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.400]   Well, they tried.
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:46.960]   They did.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:47.440]   I guess they did.
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:49.520]   I mean, we'll see if that's what they're going to do.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:50.000]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:50.560]   Get back in there.
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:56.080]   Uber is going to require drivers and passengers to wear face masks.
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:57.280]   Good.
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:58.800]   They didn't before.
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:00.240]   I know.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:01.040]   I'm amazed at that.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:02.400]   Mary Jo.
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:07.360]   Now we're going to have the Karen and Ken Uber videos.
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:12.240]   I feel bad for small businesses that try to force people to wear masks.
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:13.120]   And the people say no.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:15.200]   I just don't.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:16.640]   I'm grateful.
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:19.120]   Very grateful to the businesses who then escort those people out.
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:22.000]   But the thing is, if you take the Walmart's and that,
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.920]   those people wore masks to get in.
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:26.400]   Once in, it's all theater.
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:26.800]   Right.
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:28.000]   It's anger theater.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:28.240]   Right.
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:30.400]   They decide to have a fit.
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:30.640]   Right.
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:34.960]   I have two quick stories that I want to mention.
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:35.200]   Yes.
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:37.920]   One is Gina, Japan.
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:40.800]   I don't want to make Stacy feel.
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:41.520]   I don't.
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:42.560]   I like Chita.
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:45.200]   I have plenty of eco-chief.
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:46.240]   I don't.
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:48.800]   I didn't even say I know that.
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:49.840]   I don't think we're going to say that.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:50.880]   No, I said that anyway.
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:57.520]   So way ahead of our time, there's a story about how document creation now
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:59.920]   is finally doing what wave was intended to do.
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:04.160]   And dear Gina wrote the book on wave and then it got killed.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:05.760]   But it's true.
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:09.360]   A lot of document companies, Notion, Kota, Airtable
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:14.880]   are really putting together the whole idea of dynamic and collaborative
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:18.560]   and inserted element document creation.
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:20.560]   So they left out Rome.
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:22.480]   Rome researchers is another really good one.
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:24.400]   I use Notion.
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:29.280]   In fact, this is my Laport family notion, but I use it for planning shows.
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.280]   We have show rundowns in there.
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:34.160]   I think Notion is really, really cool.
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:36.640]   All of these can be public web pages.
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:39.440]   You can embed content.
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:42.560]   I use it to prepare a couple of shows.
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:47.040]   We also use it for iOS today to produce the show together.
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.680]   I've created pages like this.
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:53.360]   This is my COVID-19 page where I have a lot of information.
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:57.280]   For instance, I made a big page on mask making as I was doing the research.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:01.920]   You're able to embed videos, content, text, modify it.
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:06.320]   When I traveled in the good old days, that's when I started using No.
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:10.080]   I started using it for a travel blog because you can make this a public web.
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.280]   Canceled and canceled.
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:12.240]   Canceled and canceled.
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:13.520]   This is where we would have been.
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:16.560]   And it's nice because when you make a page,
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:20.320]   you can embed all sorts of content maps and images.
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:21.920]   You can have a calendar.
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:24.960]   You can look at your calendar in a variety of views as a calendar view.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:28.800]   But you can also have a card view.
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:32.640]   I love Notion.
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:38.240]   There's a free version that allows you to have up to a thousand blocks of data.
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:42.000]   There's also a cheap to pay for.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.200]   I think it's $40 a year for unlimited use.
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:46.720]   I do everything with it.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:49.360]   I keep my hardware inventory in here.
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:52.000]   I have system setup scripts in here.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.040]   So when I set up a new device, I have all the information I need.
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.040]   Card you are so organized.
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:02.640]   This is a great view of Leo's brain.
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:05.120]   Well, that's the idea is this is Leo's brain.
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:07.760]   This is all this is getting out.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:10.640]   I would have thought Stacy would be just organized, but you, I wouldn't expect.
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:13.280]   Here's something movies I want to watch in quarantine.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.720]   Oh, babe, piggyness.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:17.760]   I know you'd like that.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:21.040]   I know you'd be on a light.
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:22.400]   Yeah, that's a good movie too.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.520]   Yeah, these are I've seen babe, but a lot of these I haven't seen.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:26.480]   I've seen cloud atlas.
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:31.520]   So yeah, yeah, this was from some an article somewhere.
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:36.240]   So that's another thing when I'm trying to remember books I want to read or
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:39.120]   quotes I want to keep track of or.
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:42.880]   You know, that kind of thing, my car shopping.
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:45.280]   This is these are my list of requirements.
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:46.320]   So much that going to be out.
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:50.400]   Well, supposedly I'm supposed to get an email that I can order this thing.
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:53.840]   Now, but I haven't.
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:57.120]   I haven't gotten that email.
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:59.040]   So supposedly it's going to come out very soon.
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:02.160]   Like probably in the next couple of months.
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:04.240]   So it's nice.
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:05.920]   I love that.
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:06.400]   That's good.
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:07.200]   So the nice story.
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:09.920]   Yeah, and you know, wave was this.
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:16.320]   I would rather use notion or air table, which is similar, although tabular, more focused tabular.
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:19.360]   I use coda as well.
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:21.760]   I would prefer to use those and wave the problem with wave.
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:22.720]   It was just kind of.
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:25.040]   It was early complicated.
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.000]   It was early.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:31.600]   It was it was it was it was a notional thing to explore the idea and they were they were on top of it,
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:34.400]   but they couldn't turn it into something quick enough for them.
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:36.960]   I don't think we're at the end of the line.
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:43.760]   I think this is just the beginning of rethinking what a document is in a way that is divorced,
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:48.400]   finally divorced from paper and fold, millennial folders and things like that.
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:51.600]   No, it's because, you know, we are past Gutenberg.
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:53.040]   We are past Gutenberg.
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:57.280]   So I tweeted the gene it was way ahead of her time and she just said,
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:01.760]   Oh, so the other storage I want to mention because I found it fascinating.
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:03.440]   I read the whole thing really quickly.
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:06.720]   I want to go back to read it again.
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:09.120]   New Yorker piece on cloud kitchens, ghost kitchens.
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:15.760]   This is the this is really, I think one of the things I've been really finding interesting is
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:21.760]   how the COVID crisis is going to change how we live after the COVID crisis.
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:22.400]   Yes.
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:27.680]   And one of the things that seems clear is that restaurants no longer need to have dining rooms.
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:33.360]   In fact, it may be not just need to it, maybe a horrible waste of
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:37.120]   Yeah, real estate and unfortunately labor.
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:42.160]   So there are a lot of I ghost kitchens isn't the term I've heard before I came
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:47.280]   around with the term is, but there are a lot of gay basically kitchens that don't have dining
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:48.720]   rooms, but you get takeout.
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:51.920]   So the delivery guy comes picks him up brings it to you.
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:53.920]   You eat at home and they.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:54.320]   It's fast.
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:58.560]   So this company called reef is a huge owner of parking lots.
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:03.280]   And they're so they control parking lots and they started by
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:06.320]   having a parking lot reservation.
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:08.000]   They're talking food trucks then.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.760]   But yes, so they put truck they really parking lots are going to need to be repurposed.
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:12.560]   Oh, interesting.
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:16.720]   And they can put trucks there and that truck can be 20 different restaurants.
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:18.560]   Well, you know what?
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:21.440]   Walmart's doing movie drive-in movies.
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:22.400]   Parking lots.
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:24.320]   So I think there's a real interesting play there.
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:26.880]   So yeah, I think restaurants will change.
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.960]   But also it was I was talking about this on Twitter.
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:31.840]   I think Lisa wanted to talk about this last week.
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:32.800]   I think it was on Twitter.
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:40.640]   Lisa wanted to buy a bad mitten set and we could have ordered on Amazon would have come five days later.
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:44.160]   But she realized, oh, Dick's sporting goods over here.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:47.040]   And the pickup process was amazing.
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:47.760]   It was so easy.
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:49.520]   She ordered online paid online.
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:53.200]   You give her the they give you give them the car model and information.
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:55.280]   And when she drives up there's slots.
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:57.600]   They put it in your car and you drive off.
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:58.400]   Yeah, like that's fine.
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:00.240]   And it makes me yeah, a lot of stores are doing this.
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:04.400]   It makes me really think that maybe also the future of retail that these big stores
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:05.680]   might just be warehouses.
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:10.240]   And the advantage they this is where the advantage they have over Amazon is you can pick it up right away.
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:16.720]   So it's all the advantage of e-commerce without Amazon might buy JCPenney's or right by Vases.
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:17.040]   Right.
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:17.840]   They might need this.
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:18.320]   Right.
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:18.640]   Right.
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:20.560]   So it's and so it's not just restaurants.
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:23.200]   But what the idea is that you could you can do that and.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:30.720]   And I just found it absolutely fascinating because it changes the economics completely.
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:35.520]   Now that goes into what's McCallen having been bought by Uber.
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:39.600]   What was you had the story or postmates.
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:40.480]   Personally, thank you.
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:41.280]   Right.
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:47.440]   So yes, your point is it changes the use of this real estate immensely.
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:49.120]   Right.
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:52.640]   What about so this is I've also been thinking about this with higher education.
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:58.240]   Our son has been going to online high school for a couple of years now anyway.
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:00.560]   It's accredited.
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:03.520]   It's actually free because it's public school in California.
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:07.280]   They get paid just like any public school that's using the charter school system.
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:13.440]   He gets a state curriculum, proved curriculum, gets a high school degree like anybody else would.
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:17.840]   And it turns out he was very well suited for the quarantine because he was doing it before the
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:18.640]   quarantine.
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:23.440]   And I wonder how many students so I you know I found this.
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:25.040]   This is the University of the people.
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:26.000]   I don't know what you think of this.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.840]   But they're good people.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:28.480]   Yeah.
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:36.080]   The whole idea is this is a nonprofit American accredited tuition free online university.
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:43.120]   And I love the idea that anybody wants to go to college can do it while they're working a job at home.
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:46.720]   And I don't know how good the curriculum is.
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:48.800]   I've read pros and cons.
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:50.320]   It's maybe kind of middle of the road.
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:54.320]   But I think this is really interesting.
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:54.960]   So what happens?
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:56.880]   I wrote about this in what we Google do.
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:50:58.080]   The Googly University.
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:03.760]   And if you separate the fun and so you have students complaining about missing the experience of
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:04.080]   college.
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:06.800]   Well, I've been on a hundred of these tours as have you Leo.
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:12.000]   And soon you will go Stacey where they're selling you the dining hall and the food court
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.760]   and the dorms and the sports arena.
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:14.960]   Oh, I used to give those tours.
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:16.640]   I think we have classes too.
[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:19.120]   You were at the University of Texas Austin, right?
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:26.560]   I did it as part of a program designed to attract a minority and underrepresented students.
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:27.760]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:32.080]   See, even then Stacey, you put your spin on it right there.
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:34.160]   Extra caring spin.
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:40.160]   So if you separate out the functions, right, the education is one, certification is one.
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:40.960]   Do you get a degree?
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:42.800]   Socialization is one.
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:45.360]   Research is one, right?
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:48.960]   The problem is that when you disaggregate all of that, which I think is going to happen,
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:52.720]   I agree, and education and even social education and socialization,
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:53.680]   we aren't going to go together.
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:55.600]   I don't think any more because of COVID.
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:57.200]   What happens to research?
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:51:58.400]   Right.
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:51:59.920]   What happens to expertise and research?
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:02.240]   Who's going to pay for that?
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:03.600]   Government's not going to.
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.600]   There's not enough Bell Lab jobs in the world.
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:06.880]   That's what.
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:10.320]   Well, it doesn't govern and pay for most university research.
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:11.440]   No, no, no.
[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:18.160]   You know, that actually is part of the conversation at Harvard because,
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:22.720]   I know, Carson should weigh on this, but when you get a Harvard education,
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:26.880]   how much of it is the classwork you do and how much of it is hanging out,
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:32.000]   you know, in your college and the dining hall and the people you meet and the experience of being
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:32.480]   at Boston.
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:35.840]   I think I'm going to take over the social graph myself, but that's mine.
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:36.800]   What are you going to take over?
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:37.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:42.320]   I don't think Mark Zuckerberg, what he got at a Harvard, had nothing to do with the courses he
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:43.600]   was taking, you think?
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:48.400]   Oh, so that is, you make an excellent point.
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:49.920]   I mentioned this before.
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:53.200]   My dad was a university professor for years, he's now retired.
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:57.680]   Said really the notion of a college in the early days was collegiate,
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:01.680]   was a place for scholars to get together and discuss scholarship.
[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:06.960]   As much as it was, you know, not like a high school where you have a teacher in
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:10.560]   classes and you take exams, it was really more about getting together.
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:12.000]   It was about the social experience.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:17.600]   And maybe that's, you know, in a library, of course, and maybe that and some expertise.
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:22.480]   So you have, so then you have Melrose Place Apartments, where you have your socialization.
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:22.720]   Yeah.
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:23.680]   Right.
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:29.360]   And then you do your classes online and then you take a test somewhere to get certified
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:36.240]   that you've done your work and you can, you got a big program with, I think was at Taylor Lawrence
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:39.280]   on Twitter over the notion of a gap year.
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:42.320]   You said it's a privilege thing to be able to say.
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:43.520]   It was not just her, it was a few people.
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:47.520]   It wasn't Taylor Lawrence and I couldn't, I was trying to make a simple point and I found
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:49.600]   myself mansplaining, so I, I, I grew back.
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:56.080]   The argument, I said that Beatriz are privileged or a side of privilege.
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:58.880]   And people said, well, no, no, no, they can take a few courses at community college.
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:03.920]   And I said, well, no, because a lot of these colleges don't take those credits.
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:06.480]   I hate to tell you, it's just like AP credits doesn't work so well.
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:07.520]   Well, they can get jobs.
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:09.680]   I said, well, we have, have you heard, we got a depression going on.
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:11.280]   There's not jobs to be had.
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:14.560]   People trying to, trying to support their families or taking any job they can get.
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:17.280]   So, well, then they say money.
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:20.000]   I said, well, no, they, they still end up spending four years.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.720]   If they went to college this fall online, they save on room and board.
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:29.520]   Then if we're back to normal, they've got three more years, they've had a net savings.
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:33.600]   And I couldn't get that argument across to her or to anybody.
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.760]   But, you know, the gap year is a wonderful thing.
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:36.640]   I wish I'd had one.
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:37.440]   I was stupid.
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:38.000]   I didn't take it.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:38.800]   I'm not against them.
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:44.880]   But the, the, the stick out there now is, well, after Harvard announced, well, if I were
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:47.040]   in college, I'd just take a cup here and I wouldn't go.
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:50.960]   Well, that's easy for you to say, but you presume that.
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:51.600]   Well, you don't have to.
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:57.360]   I mean, if Harvard would defer your matriculation a year, you don't have to,
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:58.960]   it doesn't have to be a question of privilege.
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:00.000]   You can work for a year.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.840]   Well, the issue, well, number one.
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:05.280]   So, so that presumes you got a home that you can go sit in for a year.
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:09.760]   And you work, you get a job and you work and you live like a normal person.
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:11.200]   We got the direct depression on.
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:14.000]   We have 15% unemployment.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:14.240]   Right.
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:15.680]   There aren't jobs to be found.
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:17.680]   My daughter got a job at Trader Joe's.
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:21.440]   There maybe aren't appropriate jobs to be found, but there are jobs out there.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:27.200]   Um, so I always say, so I, so I, my students, as somebody just getting a high school,
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:31.920]   taking a year off before they go to college, I think there's probably sufficient things they
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:34.400]   could do to support themselves.
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:38.160]   As, as a colleague of mine said, CUNY, when we have our CUNY students, then you're going back
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:42.720]   to an apartment with three generations and probably going to get COVID and you can't find a job.
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:44.240]   Well, it's not, and look at that.
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:45.440]   That's not going to be able to get your work.
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:45.920]   That's not going to be able to get your work.
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:48.400]   That's not going to be able to get yours or college, that's life now.
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:51.280]   It does, but if you have a college and you have the scholarship, there's going to be a lot
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:53.680]   more scholarship money this year than there is going to be in two years.
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:56.080]   Okay. That's the first time you want to go to hard call online.
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:57.280]   That doesn't sell much fun.
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:55:58.720]   What's the goal of going there?
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:01.120]   The goal of going there in the end should be education.
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:01.920]   No, not at all.
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:04.640]   Oh, no, no, the goal of going there is networking with all the
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:06.320]   fans, people who have connections.
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:07.520]   What's wrong with that way in Dublin?
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:10.160]   That's where, that's where, that's where, that's where, that's where,
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:11.360]   I mean, that's where, that's where, that's where, that's where,
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:13.920]   Carson was not some fancy kid.
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:17.760]   He was a kid from Montana at Good grades, was a smart kid, got into Harvard.
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:20.080]   I don't know what his scholarship situation was.
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:22.160]   Where he landed now, well, that worked well, Carson.
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:22.960]   It did work well.
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:25.760]   He got his first job, because he, what do you say?
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:27.120]   He said it in the chat room.
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:31.760]   He got his job from his college best friend's ex, girlfriend's new boyfriend.
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:37.600]   It's the people you meet, actually, Yale helped me not one way.
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:38.560]   I know a way to take it back.
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:41.760]   Yale did, because I got into radio, because I used the campus radio station.
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:43.120]   But it wasn't about education.
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:44.240]   It was about the scene.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:45.120]   It was about being there.
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:45.440]   The problem.
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:48.560]   Honestly, college really is just a halfway house for kids who are not
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:50.400]   yet ready to enter the real world.
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:53.040]   Well, that's what I'm saying is we're going to separate those functions, I think.
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:56.560]   You're going to go move to the Melrose place and get socialized.
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:57.040]   Yeah.
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:00.320]   And you're going to get your degree separately, you're going to get your certification separately.
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:01.120]   And then...
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:02.640]   Why do you keep saying move to the Melrose place?
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:04.080]   I don't understand what you're talking about.
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:07.520]   The socialization, there's a socialization of a apartment building somewhere.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:07.840]   And so it's...
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:09.600]   Oh, okay.
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:10.880]   Well, Melrose, do you want to show?
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:11.760]   I'm just like, what is it?
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:12.720]   It was a TV show.
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:13.120]   It was a TV show.
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:13.600]   It was a TV show.
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:16.240]   It was a TV show where they were all young people, and this is where they socialized.
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:17.680]   All right.
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:18.560]   Oh, Jesus.
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:21.600]   Stacey, you just make me feel so F and old.
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:22.640]   You just...
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:23.200]   I'm so sorry.
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:24.000]   No, I just...
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.080]   That may just be a reference I just didn't get.
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:26.880]   That's what it was.
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:28.160]   Okay.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:29.200]   I barely got it.
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:29.760]   I never...
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:30.400]   Oh, no.
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:31.360]   He's a former TV guy.
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:32.000]   I'm just like, what?
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.120]   He keeps using these words.
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:34.560]   I'm like, I got a thing.
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:37.520]   You can't expect to understand what he's talking about.
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:39.680]   He comes from a different place from you and me.
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:40.240]   I do.
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:40.720]   I do.
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:41.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:43.360]   Someone pointed out Jeff was a TV critic.
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:43.920]   Yes.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:44.640]   See?
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:45.440]   That's what it was.
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:49.360]   I stopped watching television with like 21 Jump Street.
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:49.920]   Like, that was...
[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:50.400]   Like, there was a...
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:53.440]   There was like a 20-year gap in my television history.
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:59.360]   Coming up next, it is time for our picks
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:00.080]   of the week.
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:03.920]   This week on the show, I think,
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:05.200]   because Stacey hasn't been here.
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:07.200]   Let's have our pick of the week from Stacey.
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:08.800]   Yeah, I'm gonna go get it.
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:09.360]   Hold on.
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:10.960]   Oh, she's gonna go get it.
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:12.640]   Oh, play the jiggle.
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:14.240]   Play the jiggle.
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:14.880]   Play the jiggle.
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:22.960]   We're getting some mileage out of that.
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:25.680]   Stacey.
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:26.080]   Stacey.
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:29.520]   Stacey.
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:30.000]   Stacey.
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:33.520]   Stacey.
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:33.920]   Stacey.
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:41.840]   I love G.
[01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:47.280]   And now Stacey's pick of the week.
[01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:50.240]   Pick of the week, which is also just Stacey's.
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:51.600]   For the next couple of weeks, you guys,
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:53.200]   you're gonna be part of my pick of the week.
[01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:55.280]   We'll be Stacey's to-do item of the week.
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:55.680]   Oh, good.
[01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:55.920]   I like it.
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:58.800]   This week is installing the huge
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:58:59.600]   U-feed doorbell.
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:02.400]   If you listen to my show, you can skip this,
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:04.800]   because I'm gonna talk about why it shows this.
[01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:05.040]   But-
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:08.320]   U-feed is an anchor brand badge, right?
[01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:08.800]   It is.
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:09.280]   Yeah.
[01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:10.000]   Terrible name.
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:10.960]   Is it U-feed?
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:12.000]   No, it's U-feed, I think.
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:12.640]   It's terrible.
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:15.280]   It's some other language, probably.
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:16.800]   But anchor makes great stuff.
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:19.920]   So I think if it's U-feed, it's got to-
[01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:21.840]   With a name like U-feed, it's got to be good.
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:23.520]   It's got to be something.
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:26.160]   So this is their doorbell.
[01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:31.280]   And my house had a Vivint doorbell,
[01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:33.360]   but I didn't want to pay for the Vivint subscription.
[01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:36.560]   Even though the Vivint video doorbell is quite good.
[01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:39.520]   So without a subscription,
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:42.880]   the Nest doorbell, which is what I wanted to get,
[01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:44.320]   is pretty useless.
[01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:47.200]   And my husband was adamant he did not want to pay anything.
[01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:48.560]   So I was like, okay.
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:50.560]   And the next step was Arlo,
[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:52.560]   because that actually is a pretty good doorbell.
[01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:56.560]   And they also had a subscription.
[01:59:56.560 --> 02:00:00.640]   So U-feed, or U-feed, did not.
[02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:03.840]   And they also have an external security chime,
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:04.880]   because for some reason,
[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:08.240]   my doorbell does not connect to the doorbell transfer.
[02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:09.520]   The ring would do that too.
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:11.920]   So you plug this in and it connects via Wi-Fi.
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:12.240]   Yeah.
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:14.960]   So I'm not going to be complicit with ring at this moment.
[02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:16.240]   No, I think ring is-
[02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:16.800]   I couldn't do it.
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:18.000]   Ring is on the outs.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:18.320]   Yep.
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:22.240]   So this is what I purchased.
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:25.280]   It was $100 and I think $59.
[02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:26.320]   And $0.99.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:28.080]   And $0.99.
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:30.880]   And oh, he did the wrong part.
[02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:35.040]   So it doesn't put the video up on the cloud.
[02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:36.560]   It does.
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:38.240]   It has local storage.
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:40.640]   It does not put it on the cloud.
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:41.440]   So but you can-
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:42.000]   Well, there is a cloud option.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:46.560]   Can you go back in time and see what happened earlier?
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:50.800]   So for instance, when we were on vacation last year,
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:52.960]   somebody drove over our mailbox.
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:55.920]   You know, one of those rural route mailboxes on a post.
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:57.520]   It's outside on the street.
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:58.640]   Somebody crushed it.
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:03.600]   I was able to go look at the video from the doorbell and see who did it.
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:06.960]   Well, because I was able to go back in time.
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:08.640]   Did you get there?
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:12.080]   Well, it turned out I figured out who it was.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:14.480]   It was the lady who delivers the newspaper.
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:17.680]   And because I can see she was folding the newspaper and not paying attention.
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:21.440]   And she in slow motion to rope right over my mailbox.
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:26.800]   And to her credit, I also saw her come back later that day on the doorbell,
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:27.680]   trying to find us.
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:29.920]   And again, the next day trying to find us.
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:31.440]   So she was very honest.
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:34.080]   And I said, oh, please, we were going to get a new mailbox anyway.
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:35.120]   Don't worry about it.
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:35.920]   You're such a loser.
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:36.640]   Yeah, she wanted that.
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:37.440]   She went pay for it.
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:37.840]   I said, no.
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:38.960]   How much did she make?
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:40.080]   How much did she make delivering this?
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:40.640]   Delivering this.
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:42.640]   No, I can't let you do that.
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:45.440]   That, you know, we're going to replace it anyway.
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:48.000]   So it's nice to have what my point being.
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.440]   It's nice to be able to go back in time.
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:50.640]   Can you do that with this?
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:52.960]   Um, I don't remember.
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:57.120]   It's a bit of crazy.
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:57.440]   You'll find out.
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:01.200]   Because that's really what you pay for on those subscriptions is the storage of the
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:02.160]   historic.
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:02.160]   Right.
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:04.800]   Really, we just needed a doorbell that would ring in the house.
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:05.840]   That was our priority.
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:06.080]   Okay.
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:07.440]   Um, is less.
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:09.760]   It does say 24/7 monitoring.
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:10.160]   I can't remember.
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:12.000]   You probably pay for that, right?
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:12.400]   Later.
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:13.600]   Yeah.
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:14.720]   I think there's an option.
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:15.600]   Is there an option?
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:16.880]   I can't remember.
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:18.080]   Just ignore me.
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:21.440]   This is a terrible pick of the week just because I don't know enough yet.
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:24.880]   Um, no, it's good to say we're.
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:28.240]   What's nice is when rings started, it was really ring and skybell.
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:29.760]   And skybell was terrible.
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:30.240]   Ring, skybell.
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:31.920]   I loved skybell.
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:32.320]   Really?
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:34.720]   It was actually better than the first ring, believe it or not.
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:34.720]   Yeah.
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:35.760]   It had better.
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:35.760]   Yeah.
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:38.240]   I bought a skybell and was so unhappy.
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:39.200]   I looked for something else.
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:40.160]   That's when I got a ring.
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:42.880]   Uh, but now there's a lot of competition.
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:44.240]   Yeah.
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:46.960]   In August had one and that was, that was the worst.
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:49.040]   Anyway, so if you're interested.
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:52.320]   So they encrypt the data.
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:56.480]   They actually have storage on the doorbell.
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:58.000]   So that's probably how they do it.
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.400]   And it's encrypted and then you can get it on your phone.
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:03.920]   That's pretty, actually that's a pretty slick way to solve that.
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:06.800]   Your four, your recorded footage is stored locally
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:08.480]   and transmitted only to you.
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:11.440]   So no police department, no, nobody else.
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:13.440]   Although I presume at some point you could share it.
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:16.160]   If you had some reason to share it with a police.
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:20.480]   Oh, you can also record and set up three instant responses.
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:23.200]   So you can press a button and says,
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:26.160]   I'm in the, I'm doing a podcast.
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:27.760]   Leave it the box.
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:30.320]   Which is something like that.
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:34.000]   The water, the water filtration system is under the stand.
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000]   By the way, if you want, it doesn't mind the dog.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.720]   Kind of as a benefit of your employment here at Twit.
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:40.320]   I'd be glad to record that for you.
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:44.640]   I'm doing a podcast.
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:46.080]   Leave the box.
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:46.880]   There you go.
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:48.400]   We'll send you a single recording.
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:49.760]   Oh, okay.
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:51.120]   They'll be like, this scene is there.
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:52.560]   This guy sounds vaguely familiar.
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:55.520]   And he'll be like, he sounds so friendly too.
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:58.720]   Are you saying that I would not sound friendly?
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:03:59.760]   It's a smile at his voice.
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:01.920]   Oh, he's professionally as a smile at his voice.
[02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:05.840]   Hi, I'm busy doing a podcast right now.
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:10.720]   But if you'd like to leave that package box or tank on my front porch,
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:12.400]   I'll compensate you later.
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:19.040]   Nice, Yuffie.
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:22.320]   It's actually less than all the competition too, right?
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:24.080]   160 bucks is pretty good.
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:24.640]   It is.
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:26.720]   And next week after I install it,
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:29.520]   because this is on my to-do list, I will tell you.
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:30.480]   I'll show you the app.
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:34.000]   Do you not have those wires that lead to the door?
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.320]   I have the wires that will offer power.
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:38.560]   They just don't go to the trans...
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:42.240]   Well, the transformer is in the doorbell chime,
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:44.000]   so I don't really understand.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.280]   Yeah, we have a separate transformer that the wires go to,
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:49.520]   and then the wire from the transformer goes to the chime.
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:50.560]   That's interesting.
[02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:51.680]   Yeah, so we'll see.
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:54.960]   So the previous owners apparently didn't want any visitors.
[02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:56.960]   Well, no, they just had it.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:01.840]   I think they had the Vivint app that went to their Vivint alarm panel at Rangon.
[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:02.880]   Oh, so they had another...
[02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:04.880]   They had their own home automation.
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:06.480]   Yeah, they had a whole Vivint setup,
[02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:08.720]   but I'm not paying for the whole Vivint setup.
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:10.720]   [MUMBLING]
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:13.840]   Jeff, do you have a number?
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:15.360]   Barely.
[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:21.040]   So, Benedict Evans, I mean his fan club too,
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:21.840]   like the Mike Nesdak-
[02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:23.040]   Me too, Benedict Evans.
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:26.720]   And I'm in the Stacey IoT fan club, just to be absolutely clear.
[02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:27.280]   It's up to you.
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:34.240]   Push, so he has a revised of his annual State of the Economy,
[02:05:34.240 --> 02:05:36.160]   which we talked about on the show a few months ago,
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:38.160]   redone with COVID.
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:40.400]   We're about to say there's nothing to do with that,
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:42.160]   but it's a good presentation, always is.
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:45.360]   But slide number 18 just gave me a factoid I didn't know,
[02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:46.800]   so I thought this was a number.
[02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:48.640]   I didn't know that in 2017,
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:50.080]   not exactly up in the minute here,
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:54.480]   40% of heterosexual couples in the United States
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:55.840]   met online.
[02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:59.680]   40% or 40%.
[02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:00.800]   Holy moly.
[02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:01.840]   I found that amazing.
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:03.680]   Because I'm an old fart,
[02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:05.280]   and I didn't...
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:06.560]   We didn't have it that way.
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:08.160]   We had to do it the old-fashioned way,
[02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:09.600]   and go into the wreck's hall and say,
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:11.520]   "Hi there, can I share a coke with you?"
[02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:15.200]   So how did you meet online, Stacey?
[02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:17.600]   I mean, how did you meet your husband, Andrew?
[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:18.960]   You didn't meet online, obviously.
[02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:20.240]   You met at the University of Texas.
[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:21.600]   We met...
[02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:23.280]   We were both RAs at the dorm.
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:24.320]   So you met at a dorm?
[02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:26.160]   And Jeff, how did you...
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:26.720]   Oh, you were...
[02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:27.280]   How did you actually...
[02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:28.080]   Cleaning up beer.
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:31.600]   You were both on your hands and knees,
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:33.200]   saying this is a crap job.
[02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:35.840]   I don't like this job.
[02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:37.440]   But I like you.
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:39.520]   You spoil little brats.
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:40.720]   We got to take care of it.
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:41.200]   All right.
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:42.560]   How did you meet your wife, Jeff?
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:44.480]   Working at Time Inc.
[02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:46.160]   Yeah.
[02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:47.200]   How did you meet your wives?
[02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:50.560]   Sorry.
[02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:52.800]   I couldn't resist.
[02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:56.560]   Well, let me see, wife number one.
[02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:57.760]   We worked together.
[02:06:57.760 --> 02:07:00.480]   Wife number two was a setup.
[02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:03.680]   Wife number three, we worked together.
[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:07.440]   Wife number four, I met on a mission to Mars.
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:10.560]   Wife number five, I met on Mars.
[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:13.360]   Wife number six, I met in prison in Mars.
[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:15.760]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:16.960]   Oh, thanks, Jeff.
[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:17.520]   Sorry.
[02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:19.040]   No, but that's really one thing that's changed.
[02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:20.800]   I can't believe it's such a big number, 40%.
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:23.280]   And that's three years ago.
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:24.240]   That's amazing.
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:26.400]   There's a woman I met some years ago
[02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:28.400]   who did a blog I really quite liked.
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:31.120]   Japan was like Japan's shoes blog or something.
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:31.840]   She was really good.
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:34.720]   I was going to start a blog company at the time,
[02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:36.640]   and I didn't, but I talked to her for that.
[02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:37.840]   She returned from Japan.
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:39.040]   She was in Japan for a boyfriend.
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:40.720]   They broke up whenever she came back.
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:42.640]   She'd been over there for like six years.
[02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:45.840]   She said the biggest change when she came back was that suddenly,
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:48.000]   everybody was fighting their dates online.
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.240]   When she left, nobody did that.
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:52.640]   That would be creepy.
[02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:54.640]   Everyone's going to come back was just everybody.
[02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:55.200]   You know what though?
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:55.920]   It's interesting.
[02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:58.560]   So initially it was probably match.com
[02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:02.160]   and, you know, E-harmony and the traditional dating things.
[02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:05.680]   I bet you by now it's more than half Tinder.
[02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:08.080]   And it's really...
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:09.120]   Yeah, I bet you it is.
[02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:13.600]   Every kid I know, everybody under 30 I know uses Tinder.
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:14.960]   Wow.
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:15.120]   Yeah.
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:17.040]   I mean, people use it.
[02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:17.360]   Are they...
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:20.320]   Do you use Tinder to find your...
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:22.720]   You use it to meet people?
[02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:23.040]   Sure.
[02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:25.760]   Well, no, it's not just a hookup app.
[02:08:25.760 --> 02:08:27.600]   I mean, I'm sure there are a lot of hookups,
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:29.360]   but I think that's how people,
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:31.920]   they look for somebody attractive and they say hi,
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:34.720]   maybe I'm sure it could develop into a relationship.
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:38.720]   I bet you much more than the formal dating apps,
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:39.680]   but I don't know.
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:40.160]   I don't know.
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:42.080]   Well, we'll have to check in with...
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:43.040]   I really need some donuts.
[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:47.280]   Okay, I'm not gonna ask.
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:48.800]   I'm not gonna ask.
[02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:51.360]   We're just talking about dating and I'm like,
[02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:54.640]   you know what would be great if I had some donuts.
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:56.800]   Is this an old...
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:08:58.000]   Did you go on donut dates?
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.720]   No, this is just me.
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:01.920]   Like you were talking about dating,
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:03.920]   I have no interest in dating because you know, I'm very...
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:04.400]   Oh, I see.
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:07.120]   None of us are dating.
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:07.760]   None of us are dating.
[02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:11.120]   All right, then you might be interested in our newest feature on the show.
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:15.360]   Carsten Bondi's Mask of the Week.
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:19.600]   Now, I thought Carsten,
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:24.320]   we were gonna actually go to Carsten Cam and show you wearing this mask.
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:27.520]   I guess we can't because this is a mask he got for his father.
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:30.160]   So his father has it now.
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:35.040]   This is a mask that actually looks like dad's face apparently.
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:37.520]   Lady Gaga was wearing one of those.
[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:37.840]   Yeah.
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:40.400]   Yeah, that's...
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:43.280]   Well, I wonder does face recognition, Carsten,
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:44.560]   does it work with that?
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:48.000]   Or can you sign into your phone with that?
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.760]   All right, that's not the only one.
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:52.160]   Well, like Andrew Hayward, the former president of CBS News.
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:54.480]   And here's another one.
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:57.200]   This is, I guess this is it.
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:09:59.440]   Custom face mask, upload your photo.
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:04.560]   You get a reusable cloth mask with a filter, only $18.
[02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:07.040]   Creepy.
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:08.080]   I might do that.
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:10.320]   So you want something related?
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:11.360]   Yeah.
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:12.560]   Where can I put a link?
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:20.160]   Microsoft Research is actually looking for people to fill out surveys about mask fashion.
[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:22.880]   So here, I'm just gonna stick it.
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:27.680]   Oh, I can just Google Mask Fashion Survey.
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:29.840]   I bet you if I do that.
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:32.080]   It's at the very...
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:34.480]   It's at Line 202 in our show notes.
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:37.040]   It's from Microsoft Research.
[02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:39.280]   Yeah, the very bottom.
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:44.400]   Mr. LaPorque Stacey is on Line 202 for you.
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:46.320]   Are you a designer making face masks?
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:47.120]   Yes, I am.
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:51.280]   The emergence of PPE development and fashion.
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:53.360]   I just thought that was really interesting.
[02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:54.960]   I'm gonna do it, because I am a designer.
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:56.400]   And it's wise to what Carsten's doing.
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:56.560]   Yeah.
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:57.760]   Yeah.
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:01.840]   So Carsten's gonna be doing this on a regular basis, his mask of the week.
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:06.240]   But Carsten, next week I want Carsten Cam and...
[02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:10.640]   Well, maybe I guess we can't, because you would have to actually have the mask.
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:12.640]   And I'm not spending a penny on this feature.
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:14.400]   So never mind.
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:15.120]   Forget I even...
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:16.080]   So my wife got me...
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:21.440]   So we have some of the square medical-like masks.
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:22.400]   We got a box of those.
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:23.120]   I'm using that.
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:25.440]   My wife tried to go on some...
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:27.120]   I have a big face that appears.
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:32.080]   Go ahead.
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:32.800]   This is my pick.
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:34.960]   I can't stop it.
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:36.960]   Just turn it down, Jeff, for a minute.
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:37.760]   Go ahead.
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:38.080]   Go ahead.
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:41.360]   So my wife got me and she got a box of 10 heens masks,
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:46.160]   which made me a little odd, because it reminded me of Leo's tidy whitey mask.
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:48.960]   And...
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:49.440]   Do they fit?
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:50.240]   They won't fit.
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:50.800]   Oh...
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:52.160]   My face is too big.
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:54.160]   Try swaddle knee designs.
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:57.600]   They have a large mask.
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:11:58.080]   Or a diaper.
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:11:59.600]   No, no.
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:00.800]   They make blankets.
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:05.680]   It's a nurse in Seattle who actually makes swaddles for kids,
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:08.400]   but they retooled their factory to make masks.
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:08.960]   That's cool.
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:13.520]   I'm telling you, masks are going to be the next big thing.
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:14.560]   So Lynette says,
[02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:18.560]   "I converted my baby blanket factory to Seattle to making masks."
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:20.560]   How cool is that?
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:22.080]   So do I click this?
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:26.000]   He's also a former nurse, so you just got to find the masks section.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:26.880]   Yeah, here it is.
[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:30.960]   Aww, they're baby blankets.
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:31.360]   It's not all of the...
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:32.400]   Oh, there's some nice ones.
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:33.120]   There's denim,
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:34.400]   chambre.
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:39.040]   The size large, Jeff, is fairly large.
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:40.480]   If that helps.
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:40.640]   These are pretty.
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:41.440]   Is it my nose?
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:42.160]   Is that the problem?
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:43.280]   I don't know.
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:44.720]   I can only wear a size large, too.
[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:45.520]   I have a big face.
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:47.360]   Honestly, I don't like the ear loops.
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:47.840]   I'm just like...
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:49.920]   I don't like the ear loops and make my ears stick out.
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:51.520]   I understand why everybody wants ear loops.
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:55.920]   She had some that had a head topper thing, too?
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:56.640]   Head topper.
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:58.800]   It was like a three...
[02:12:58.800 --> 02:12:59.840]   I don't know if he's called that.
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:00.560]   It's called a head topper.
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:04.080]   Oh, you need my bulk?
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:04.720]   That's nice.
[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:05.600]   Turn to 20 bucks.
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:08.320]   You can get 40 cotton fabric.
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:09.360]   That's nice.
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:10.080]   And these are fine.
[02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:11.840]   These are exactly what you want.
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:13.360]   Double layer cotton fabric.
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:14.880]   They're not medical, but...
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:15.200]   Yes, yes.
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:18.880]   So they're not taking it away from any physicians that need them.
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:19.840]   That's why I make mine.
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:22.640]   I make mine with quilting cotton and silk.
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:25.520]   But see, I like this attachment system,
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:26.320]   because it really...
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:27.120]   Oh, that's nice.
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:28.000]   It seals it in.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.440]   You pull it tight and it seals the sides in the bottom.
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:34.320]   But I'm working on the newest iteration.
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:35.680]   Oh, have you gotten it?
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:39.920]   Yeah, I'm waiting for them to 3D print my mask fitter.
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:41.760]   As soon as that's done, stand back.
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:44.640]   Because I'm gonna have a mask for the ages.
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:46.480]   My Lord, I just went to Etsy.
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:48.320]   If you go to Etsy, you can click on mask.
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:50.160]   Oh, yeah, a ton of masks from Etsy.
[02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:50.560]   Oh, yeah.
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:51.760]   Oh, my Lord.
[02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:52.720]   It's never ending.
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:54.560]   It's great.
[02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:55.680]   Shall I show you the...
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:57.520]   Okay, Lisa, if you're watching, stop.
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:00.720]   This is the mask I just ordered for Lisa.
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:04.240]   'Cause you're animal face masks.
[02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:06.160]   That's adorable.
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:06.880]   Isn't that cute?
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:12.240]   So, since she really likes our black and white kitties,
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:15.760]   isn't that sweet?
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:16.800]   That is so sweet.
[02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:17.440]   But they're also...
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:19.120]   Oh, I like that too, yeah.
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:21.440]   You get corgi, all kinds of animals.
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:22.400]   These are gators.
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:24.320]   So, again, they're not perfect masks.
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:25.280]   But you know what?
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:27.360]   Folks, any mask is...
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:29.280]   Is better than the mask being the one...
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:29.680]   Is better than the be the one...
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:30.640]   So, not wearing a mask.
[02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:33.280]   Isn't it being the one that's not wearing a mask?
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:34.960]   These are...
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:35.840]   And gators are really...
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:36.800]   Lisa loves gators,
[02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:37.840]   'cause they're very convenient.
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:38.800]   You wear it around your neck,
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:42.320]   and you pull it down when you're not masking.
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:45.840]   Which, of course, is only when you're inside.
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:47.280]   Oh, I might get that one.
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:47.920]   It's a little pee.
[02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:51.040]   So, my...
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:52.880]   Excuse me, my pick of the week,
[02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:55.200]   you heard it in the background.
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:58.160]   So, this is a really cool...
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:14:58.880]   It's relaxing.
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:14:59.920]   Ambient sound.
[02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:02.080]   It's called Project Audio for GitHub,
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:03.360]   github.audio.
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:08.560]   And what you're actually listening to is the GitHub API.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:11.680]   So, when somebody does...
[02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:15.040]   The chimes are...
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:16.080]   There are three types of sounds.
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:17.440]   The...
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:22.400]   The bell represents push events.
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:26.240]   The string plucks represent issue events
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:28.000]   and issue comment events.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.760]   And the swells represent pull request events.
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:34.480]   So, he's hooked into the API.
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:39.360]   So, this is actual in real time activity going on on GitHub.
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:41.280]   Either people pulling,
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:43.280]   which means they want to take a project
[02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:44.880]   and start working on it.
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:47.920]   Issues, which means they're reporting bug reports and so forth.
[02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:51.840]   And then pulls or pushes, I guess,
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:55.360]   which means they're actually pushing an update to a project.
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:56.640]   That's the little high ones.
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:57.920]   So, it's very pretty, isn't it?
[02:15:57.920 --> 02:16:01.200]   Brian Eno meets an API.
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:01.600]   Yeah.
[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:02.080]   Yeah.
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:02.640]   Yeah.
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:02.960]   Nice.
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:05.520]   There's actually a number of...
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:08.960]   Things like this.
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:11.040]   Once I found this, I found a bunch of other ones
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:12.800]   where people tie...
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:15.440]   But none of them is quite as pretty as this one.
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:17.280]   This is github.audio.
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:22.080]   But this is showing how much activity is going on
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:24.160]   in the open source space all the time.
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:28.560]   Does it get more at midnight?
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:29.520]   You know, I don't know.
[02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:31.360]   I haven't left it on long enough.
[02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:34.080]   I bet you there's more as the evening goes on, don't you think?
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:37.120]   I would guess, but I don't know.
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:38.800]   It's also got a beautiful visualization.
[02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:42.160]   You're a simple, but attractive visualization.
[02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:44.640]   So, I thought that was pretty cool.
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:48.720]   Brian Eno meets an API like that.
[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:53.920]   Folks, that concludes our thrilling gripping edition of...
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:56.160]   By the way, this is the other thing I like about this.
[02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:59.120]   This is music that I can play without getting pulled down on YouTube.
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:01.680]   It will never sound the same twice.
[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:04.480]   Thank God, I found something like that.
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:10.880]   We do this show every Wednesday afternoon, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2030 UTC.
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:13.760]   You can watch us do it live at twit.tv/live.
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:15.440]   That's where the live audio and video streams are.
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:17.040]   If you do that, check in with the chatroom.
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:18.320]   I see that twit.tv.
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:20.640]   They're all watching live at the same time.
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:22.160]   Jeff Jarvis is...
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:24.880]   See what I got here?
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:25.840]   What do you got?
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:26.800]   What do you got?
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:27.920]   Publish or perish?
[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:30.640]   I've had this since I got out of college.
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:33.360]   Before you before, publish or perish?
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:33.920]   And I forgot.
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:37.680]   I brought with me before we close off the show.
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:40.560]   This is the bar scanner we were talking about.
[02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:42.240]   Oh, the dash one.
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:44.400]   The dash one that they're discontinuing.
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:47.680]   And I was going to play what it sounded like for you.
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:51.600]   Scan some, scan some codes.
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:57.920]   Well, there's a problem.
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:17:59.760]   Let's see if it'll record.
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:02.400]   I brought some food stuffs from our snack.
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:09.680]   It's already discontinued.
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:10.560]   It's stupid.
[02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:11.040]   It may be.
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:12.560]   It may be.
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:14.240]   It worked the last time I tried it.
[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:15.440]   It might be already discontinued.
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:19.120]   Because it's dead.
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:23.520]   So this is the thing that you press the button and goes,
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:24.480]   "Bong, swipes."
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:30.240]   It adds them to your Amazon shopping list.
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:31.600]   It doesn't do anything else.
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:32.720]   It's totally stupid.
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:34.800]   I had one.
[02:18:34.800 --> 02:18:35.120]   Yeah.
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:37.600]   And now it's discontinued.
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:38.800]   So you had a dash one.
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:40.320]   I did have a dash.
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:40.880]   You weren't on the show.
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:42.240]   I guess we were talking about it.
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:43.280]   No, I don't think you were.
[02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:48.160]   So I had promised Jeff that I would bring it in.
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:49.600]   But now I think it's officially,
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:52.640]   they must have just ended.
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:54.080]   They said they were ending support.
[02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:56.480]   July 21st.
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:18:57.920]   Well, maybe they did.
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:00.880]   Maybe nobody noticed the name of it sooner.
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:06.640]   Stacey Yegenbotham is at StaceyOnIOT.com.
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:07.840]   That's where our podcast is,
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:09.040]   that she does with Kevin Toffle.
[02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:10.080]   Don't forget her newsletters.
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:10.960]   It's free and it's great.
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:13.120]   And your next event, what's that going to be?
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:16.880]   It's going to be about what happens.
[02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:20.240]   Okay, the idea is that every product you sell now is connected.
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:22.080]   So it's called Everything is Connected.
[02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:24.880]   And we're doing a couple panels on what that means
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:26.480]   for a business perspective,
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:30.640]   how you sell the product.
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:32.640]   And then it's not online yet.
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:33.200]   Oh, okay.
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:34.560]   Y'all are hearing it first.
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:34.880]   Nice.
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:38.000]   And how to build a project designed to work.
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:39.520]   How to technically build a product
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:41.840]   that's designed to fit into an ecosystem.
[02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:43.280]   So it's going to be super fun.
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:48.800]   I've got people from Intel, Honeywell, OpenPath,
[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:51.440]   a couple of other Microsoft, other companies.
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:52.560]   So, yay.
[02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:52.960]   Nice.
[02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:54.720]   Very nice.
[02:19:54.720 --> 02:19:56.160]   Nice.
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:58.000]   Mr. Professor.
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000]   Where did I put your...
[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:00.480]   Oh, here it is.
[02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:01.680]   You already did me.
[02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:02.960]   Oh, I didn't do this thing.
[02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:09.360]   Jeff Jarvis is the Leonard Tao Professor for journalistic innovation
[02:20:09.360 --> 02:20:13.520]   at the Craig New York graduate school of journalism at the city,
[02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:16.000]   University of New York.
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:20.160]   He has published and is therefore a full professor
[02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:24.720]   with all the honors and rights do thereof.
[02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:26.720]   You did not perish.
[02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:27.680]   I love that.
[02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:28.560]   Is that on your desk?
[02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:30.480]   It used to be.
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:31.760]   So I've got a book shelf now.
[02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:32.000]   That's...
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:33.040]   Literally, I've had this for...
[02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:36.160]   Was that a gift from somebody when you grabbed one from...
[02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:39.680]   No, I just thought I was amused by the phrase, so I made it.
[02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:39.920]   Yeah.
[02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:43.040]   My God, I lived in the publisher parish world.
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:46.000]   My dad became a full professor at a very young age,
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:47.600]   so I didn't have to work.
[02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:50.080]   But I remember vividly him working on those papers,
[02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:51.920]   working on those books.
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:56.960]   Folks, we will be back next Thursday, but you know what?
[02:20:56.960 --> 02:20:58.320]   Our next Wednesday, but if you...
[02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:03.600]   And if definitely not next Thursday, but if you...
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:08.400]   If you would like to get a copy of this show or any of our previous editions,
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:14.880]   those are all online at twit.tv/twig or subscribe in your favorite podcast application.
[02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:17.520]   If you do subscribe that way, you'll get it automatically.
[02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:19.840]   You don't have to think about it, and that's a nice thing.
[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:21.280]   So we'd appreciate it if you do it.
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:23.920]   We are doing our traditional...
[02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:30.960]   After hours again on Friday, 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern time on the live stream.
[02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:35.360]   This week, what are we doing, Carcenite?
[02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:36.640]   They told me and I forgot.
[02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:38.240]   It's going to be fun.
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:41.360]   It's not... It's a game of some sort.
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:45.040]   Anyway, tuning in, it's always a lot of fun.
[02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:48.560]   And I think Shira will be with us, and I think Florence, I...
[02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:49.680]   It should be a lot of fun.
[02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:51.040]   I'll be back on Saturday.
[02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:52.240]   The tech guy is back on.
[02:21:52.240 --> 02:22:00.160]   We took a weekend off for the holiday weekend, but I will be back Saturday and then Sunday,
[02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:01.840]   a brand new twit episode.
[02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:02.640]   Clue, that's it.
[02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:03.600]   You decided to do a clue?
[02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:04.160]   Good.
[02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:06.000]   They're going to be playing the game of Clue.
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:07.040]   That should be a lot of fun.
[02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:09.760]   It says here that...
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:11.360]   Is it connected to the Wi-Fi on the studio?
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:12.960]   Does it need to be near your Amazon thing?
[02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:17.200]   I used it... I used it like two days ago right here, sitting right here on this thing.
[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:21.600]   It does seem like it's not connected, doesn't it?
[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:23.200]   But it worked.
[02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:26.640]   I put batteries in and everything and it worked, so I don't know what's going on.
[02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:28.080]   I don't care.
[02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:32.720]   You've done it.
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:33.520]   You've done the whole show.
[02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:34.000]   It's over.
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:35.440]   It's over, I don't want to go over.
[02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:35.600]   I don't want to go over.
[02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:37.120]   It's over.
[02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:43.680]   I'm going to say it's Miss Scarlet in the living room with the electric pencil.
[02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:44.400]   That's my guess.
[02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:45.680]   Thank you everybody.
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:47.440]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[02:22:47.440 --> 02:22:48.560]   Hey folks.
[02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:53.200]   I am Mike Asargent, co-host of Tech News Weekly right here on the Twit Network.
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:53.600]   Yes.
[02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:57.200]   Tech News Weekly is a show we do every week, Jason Howell and myself,
[02:22:57.200 --> 02:23:00.560]   where we talk to people who are making and breaking the tech news.
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:00.960]   That's right.
[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:06.800]   It's journalists, it's inventors, it's app makers, it's everybody who's bringing the
[02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:08.320]   tech news in a given week.
[02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:10.240]   It's all the stuff you want to know about.
[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:14.160]   In bite-sized chunks in a fantastic package.
[02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:17.440]   So be sure to subscribe to twit.tv/tnw.
