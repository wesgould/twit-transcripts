[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Jeff and Gina are here, joined by Matthew Ingram from GigaOM.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   We're going to talk about the new Motorola phones, the new Nokia phones,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   the stock market's disappointing reaction to the Nokia phones,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   and maybe a 3G Nexus 7. It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Are you ready?
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Well, this is Twig. This week in Giggle.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I'm going to call it that because people got mad at us last week because we talked about Google enough.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   So it's this week in Giggle.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   But it could be about Google, the cloud, anything that Jeff and Gina want to talk about basically.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Gina Trippani is here, smartrword.org.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Think up half.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   An expert Giggler.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   She's an ex, she knows all about Giggling.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I do.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I practice Giggling.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   I do.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   We both, well you and I both like to laugh.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   We do, we do.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   I think that's good.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Don't notice he left me out of there.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Jeff is not a big laugher.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Wow.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Jeff, you don't laugh a lot.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   You scowl, you grimace.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Jeff is rage face of the group.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Jeff Jarvis, a jolly old elf.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   He is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York, the author of Public Parts,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Great Book, about living in public.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And both Jeff and Gina are our regular hosts joining us this week.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   From GigaO, Matthew Ingram is here, senior editor at GigaO.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   It's good to see you Matthew.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Hi.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Welcome.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Where are you based?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Toronto.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Another Canadian.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I like it.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   We're everywhere.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I like it.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   We have more Canadians on this network and it's not by choice, it's just it happens that we do.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I don't know why that is.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   They're nice people.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   They're nice people.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   They're nice people.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   You're nice, nice people.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   They're vegan.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   We're nice.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Now Matthew covers the internet.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   As he says, doesn't cover anything that breaks when you drop it.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   But we are going to cover something that breaks when you drop it.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   So your opinion is welcome, Matthew.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Because there's a new, there's a new droid in town.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Actually, I should probably start with the kind of interesting news that Google is activating.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Let me see if I can get along.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   This is from Eric Schmidt, ever the leaky sieve who says that this is at the Motorola on display
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   event.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I think the most interesting thing announced at that event.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   The one point, is this your number, Jeff?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I hope I'm not.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.760]   1.3 million Android devices are activated every day.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.280]   Of that number, 70,000 are tablets, which is a pretty hefty number.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.240]   That's 210,000 tablets a month.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.000]   That's decent.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   It's up considerably from last December, it was 700,000.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.360]   I just saw a figure somewhere.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.520]   I didn't say but unfortunately, but in some market, I think it is maybe here.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.000]   The Samsung was out selling the iPhone.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.600]   That's correct.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   But that I think is not to be given too much credit.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.320]   Given the timing of the iPhone.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.920]   The iPhone comes out next month.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.400]   The consumers are actually smarter than some people give them credit for and are absolutely
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.440]   not buying the iPhone because they're waiting in C. Whereas the Samsung Galaxy S3, which
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.480]   did in fact it for the first time last month.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.400]   Or could be by the S3 while you can since it's got added to the Apple suit.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.760]   It's interesting because we saw a variety of, did I get the number of tablets wrong?
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.040]   70,000 a day times 30.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.120]   200, isn't that 210,000 tablets a month?
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.120]   Am I wrong?
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.400]   No, it's 2.1 million tablets a month.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.720]   That sounds better.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.280]   That's a lot of tablets.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.480]   That sounded like too big a number.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.480]   Wow.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.200]   2.1 million tablets a month.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.720]   Android tablets.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.640]   Most of those have to be kind to us.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.640]   I love one.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.960]   I'm not kind to us that one.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.960]   Nexus 7's.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.960]   Nexus 7.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.960]   Don't ask me about numbers today.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.480]   I'm not good apparently.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.640]   So Motorola at the same event announced the new Motorola Razr family, the Droid Razr
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.560]   Ultra Thin, the Droid Razr Max.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.880]   Those have already been out for a while.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:20.880]   Now the Droid Razr Max HD and the Droid Razr HD, basically bigger CRISPR displays longer
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.880]   battery life.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.880]   In incremental improvement.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.880]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.120]   I wasn't then they had the Droid and they had the Razr and now it's the Droid Razr.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.960]   And Razr was some of the old-fashioned phones?
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.120]   Yes.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.040]   They took the name Razr from the old Razr and put it on Droid.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.200]   I'll get it.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.560]   Because it was such a successful phone, the Razr.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.360]   Well, it was for a while.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.520]   Well, like forever ago though, they need to ditch both those names.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.520]   Like come up with something new.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.880]   Droid is a terrible name.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.720]   Razr's a RAZR is a table.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:59.840]   So 4.7 inch, I'm sorry, 1280 by 768 display.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.760]   You know, this is the Verizon flagship phone.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.800]   But I have to say, I don't think these are that impressive.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:19.280]   1.5 gigahertz snap dragon, gigabyte of RAM, ice cream sandwich, but they will be upgraded
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.520]   to Jelly Bean by the end of the year.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.520]   They'll be their LCH.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.520]   Oh, shipping with ICS.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.520]   Yeah, shipping with ICS.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.520]   That's so amazing.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.600]   It's a Google company and they can't get their act together.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.840]   Yeah, that's a good example of what the hell.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.160]   Motor Roll has stopped doing so much blur.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.540]   I just we reviewed yesterday and before you buy, we reviewed a new Motorola phone for,
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.540]   was it for Sprint?
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.200]   I can't remember, but it's not very blurry.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.080]   It is pretty much a vanilla Google experience.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.080]   So at least they're moving in that direction.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.600]   Big batteries on these guys.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:07:00.240]   I think probably biggest in class, the Razr HD 2530 milliamp hours, the max HD 3300 milliamp
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.280]   hours, that's I think even bigger than the Note 2.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.800]   So they say 27 hours streaming music, 10 hours streaming video, 32 hours mixed use time,
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.320]   21 hours talk time.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.600]   I saw the latest iPhone rumor is that the Apple iPhone battery will be 40% bigger and
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.600]   Mondo battery.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.440]   So I think we're in battery battles now, which is not a bad thing.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440]   We ought to be.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.400]   Yeah, yeah, we ought to be.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.560]   Although the hand can, it's all rumors.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.600]   We won't know till next Wednesday, but the rumored size of that battery is not big.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.280]   I think was 1750 milliamp hours, not big compared to the big batteries you're seeing
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.280]   on Android.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.840]   It is, but you want it.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.000]   What we're trying to do is get a phone that will last till we go to bed.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.120]   Yeah, we're not asking much.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.120]   Exactly.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.720]   It doesn't need to last all week, just till we go to bed.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.760]   And I have yet to find a good phone that'll do that.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.080]   The Nokia announcement today, this is announcement week.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.520]   Tomorrow will be Amazon's announcement.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.960]   We'll get that in a second.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:08.280]   Nokia announced two new Windows 8 phones, the Lumia 820 and the Lumia 920.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.320]   I think the thing most interesting about the Lumia 920, the top of the line, besides the
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.200]   fact that it's running the new Windows 8 operating system, Windows 8 phone, is that
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.480]   it's going to use a pure view camera.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:28.840]   This camera is similar to what is it, 41 megapixel camera that they're shipping in an Aged
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.080]   and being based phone.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:37.440]   But it has apparently good low light, more than 8 megapixels, a lot of capability.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.920]   If it lives up to its promise, it probably will be the best camera phone out there.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.360]   Is that enough though to get people to buy it?
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.360]   I don't know.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.840]   And where do you go do you buy that or do you buy the phone camera?
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.840]   Right.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.320]   The cameras with Android on them.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.220]   Right.
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.760]   That's kind of interesting too, isn't it?
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:02.760]   Nokia, is the, what's the biggest, is it the biggest company that went from number one
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.760]   in a technology field to near death?
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.400]   Well, I think there's so far on the history of the company.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.920]   IBM was pretty big at one time, not near death at any point.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.120]   But didn't really go near death.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.640]   Apple certainly got close to dying, 90 days of dying.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.040]   But it wasn't number one, not by a long shot.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.680]   No, it's a pretty big fall.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.120]   Big fall, but I just think that from being in such an evitable, wonderful position, through
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.480]   such a low position, in such a fast period.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.600]   Which is probably going there though, isn't it?
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.600]   Sagan?
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   Who?
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   I think Rym is going there though.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.600]   Rym is, Rym is too.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.600]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.600]   That's true.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.600]   Very single.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.600]   Sorry, sorry, Canadian.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.600]   Kodak?
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.600]   No, I don't think Kodak counts.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.600]   No?
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.760]   No.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:56.760]   I think that really what happened to Nokia was the rise of the smartphone.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.000]   And ironically, Nokia was one of the first companies to do smartphones based on Symbian
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.200]   and then they had Mimo and Migo.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.160]   Yeah, the Nokia Symbian phone was my first smartphone.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.520]   A mobile log and a flicker with that.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.240]   Yeah, text America, baby.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.240]   Good times.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.240]   The N95.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.240]   Yeah, I think it was the N95.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.240]   Oh, I'm glad.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.240]   It looked like a camcorder.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.280]   Actually, I have an N95 in my museum behind me.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.600]   I loved that N95.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.880]   That was an awesome little phone.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.880]   Mow blogging.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.880]   Mow blogging.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.880]   That was the Scoble special.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.880]   Yes.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.080]   I first saw it at a podcast Expo many years ago because I think it was Chris Markworth.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.080]   It was interviewing people.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.680]   Or maybe it was Father Roderick.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.840]   It was interviewing people with his N95.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.720]   Yes, Scoble loved it.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.360]   So that's a really interesting situation where a company was totally dominant.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.120]   And by the way, they still are, even then they were known for the best cameras, weren't
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.120]   they?
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.320]   But it's over.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.160]   And Motorola, apparently Google's selling off the set top box division.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.600]   I wonder, this Motorola acquisition, Google does not seem to have taken it in hand very
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.600]   well.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.880]   These are not impressive phones.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.320]   The real also rans.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:16.440]   They should be, shouldn't they be doing the Google experience phone for Motorola?
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.440]   When's that?
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.440]   Yes.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.440]   Wasn't there a quote today?
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.640]   Someone said, and I couldn't find it again.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.520]   I saw it run by on Twitter that somebody said, and so I could be wrong here.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:29.680]   It was very hearsay-ish that if you want a great Android phone by Motorola and somebody
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.920]   else said, "What do you want to Samsung?"
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.320]   And think of that.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.320]   It's not true.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.880]   Samsung is the Android phone to buy.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.880]   And I think HTC.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.880]   Now, HTC, of all of the companies, decided to wait till after Apple's announcement.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.920]   We'll see how that strategy works.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.560]   It can be like the days when we had newspaper on magazine, we had magazine covers and we'd
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.880]   make five or six of them and leave them by the press and decide which one to put on.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.880]   Oh, you think?
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.320]   Maybe they have different products and ready to throw out.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.320]   I don't know.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.320]   You think?
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.320]   Throw out that one.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.320]   Okay, that one is out.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.320]   We don't want to get sued over there.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.360]   You think it's worried about getting sued or not or being buried in the marketplace?
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.360]   Both.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:14.600]   Yeah, it's just surprising that the Motorola, well, is it too soon to say, "Mote, this
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.080]   is the new Google, the new Google Rola?"
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.080]   Maybe, right?
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.080]   The cycle.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.120]   Maybe next year or this time they'll have finally.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.640]   Still, it seems like they could have coordinated a little bit to ship with Jelly Bean.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.800]   The transaction closed in May.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.040]   So May, June, that was pretty fast to do it in three or four months is pretty fast.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.800]   And they're selling off the set-top box business.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.600]   So there goes our Google TV.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.160]   I know we had a whole strategy planned.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.160]   We did.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.560]   They would listen to us.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.360]   We knew what to do.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.360]   Dennis Woods...
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.880]   What you said last week, you stole our uleo last week, as I remember, that there will
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.880]   be no set-top boxes.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.320]   So why be in that business at all?
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.960]   Yeah, it's a bad business.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.080]   It's gone the way of the queue.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:09.120]   Little executive Dennis Woodside became Motorola's new leader.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:15.680]   He said on Tuesday, yesterday, "The merging of Motorola and Google will take mobile innovation
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.680]   in new heights."
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.760]   I don't know if...
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.240]   You okay?
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.240]   We have versus what?
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.600]   The droid at Razer HD is not new heights.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.640]   It's not new heights.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.680]   It's priced at what, a hundred bucks, I think?
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.680]   Verizon?
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.520]   You know, I don't even know why people bother talking about handset prices.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.000]   I guess consumers pay attention.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.280]   Have they not learned that really that's a fraction of the total cost of the phone,
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.920]   that it's the monthly fee that really makes the difference?
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.560]   Maybe not.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:14:00.400]   Anyway, Nokia's stock price tumbling 13% as a result of their lacklustre announcement.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.120]   $99 for the Razer M.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.120]   What's the M?
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.840]   I don't know what that is.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.760]   So basically phones made in cold places are headed down, phones made in hot places are
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.760]   headed off.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.720]   Ah, I think you've discovered a trend.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.080]   You've put your finger on it.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.080]   Always get it to the conspiracy.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.040]   The southernmost phone.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.560]   The great Robertson Davies said that Canada was not like America, it was like Scandinavia,
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.000]   so the Nokia RIM axis here has fallen.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Really?
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.400]   You said it was Scandinavia.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.400]   It is kind of like Scandinavia.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.400]   It is.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.400]   It is.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.520]   He argued culturally it was closer to Scandinavia.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.320]   Lots of fish.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.320]   Beer.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.320]   Beer?
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.600]   Just a quiet attitude.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.760]   Very interesting.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.760]   Sled dogs.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.920]   You could do worse than being like Norway now, the number two richest nation in the world.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.040]   Thanks to their oil reserves.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.040]   Nokia's down 16% now.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.040]   Sweet.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.440]   So that's an example of what buying on the rumor selling on the news.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.880]   The news was not enough to get the stock market excited.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.880]   No.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.920]   Shares a finished handset maker drop after company unveils two new flagship devices in
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.400]   make or break move.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.760]   According to the Wall Street Journal, it was a make or break event.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.600]   Yeah, this chart, this is an epic cliff.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.040]   Yikes.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:29.320]   Investors want to be sure the devices will be selling well ahead of Christmas for Nokia.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.320]   It's all about distribution now.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.320]   And we got no answers.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:38.160]   And when these new devices will sell and which US market operators will market them.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.360]   So that's key.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.120]   These are Christmas devices, but they don't have any deals.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.240]   Nokia's always go back to $95.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.840]   They always have problems doing deals with the phone companies.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.360]   A lot of experts think that that's actually what happened.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.080]   It was just merely that they did not have the US deals.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:59.240]   And so they were selling unlocked phone in the US and nobody was interested.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.600]   That was an analyst at the Swedish banking group, Sweet Bank.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.600]   Wow.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:11.160]   That I think it's 60% of its value in the last year.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:17.320]   We're going to have an interesting fellow on triangulation next week, not today, but a
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.800]   week from today.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:25.600]   This is Peter Brandmah, who I met in Norway at the Nordic Light Festival.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.480]   He does something interesting for Nokia.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.400]   He's a startup guy.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:38.560]   And the idea was that Nokia brought him in to fund internal development as if they were
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.840]   startups.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.680]   So if you've got an idea and you're a Nokia employee and you've got an idea, you go to
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.600]   Hans and say, "Look, I want to create a skunk work.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.200]   I want funding as if it's a startup.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   They have startup metrics.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.040]   You have to show a certain amount of growth, et cetera, et cetera."
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.440]   The idea being to bring this kind of innovation into a company.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.440]   I think it's a very interesting idea.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.760]   A lot of big companies try to do that, right?
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.800]   Microsoft does that a little bit.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   Google does that way.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.800]   Google certainly does.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   That's how Wave was structured.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:16.120]   I wonder if you can have the kind of urgency that an actual startup founder has around whether
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.000]   or not they're going to pay the bills inside a big company like that.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.840]   You can't unless your job is on the line, right?
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.520]   And I don't think they want to go that far.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.320]   But you have access to resources that you might not otherwise.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.640]   That's the key, I think, for him.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.360]   And also the accountability.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.520]   So you're accountable to these metrics.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.680]   You have to produce like a startup would have to produce.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.480]   Well, but do you get the upside?
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.480]   No.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.480]   You don't.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.480]   Well, I don't know.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.480]   Maybe.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.480]   There's corporate politics there.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.120]   You can do a fan of my equity.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.120]   When I started at an annual weekly, we were called entrepreneurial because this is God's
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.320]   honest truth.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:54.800]   We were outside the time life building one block away and that was considered.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.480]   If you had only raised a pirate flag to the roof.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.840]   Yeah, they were not close under their thumb.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.880]   And then we got phantom equity, which turned out to be quite a phantom in most ways because
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.840]   the accounting is always, it's like Hollywood accounting.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.080]   Well, no, we got a charger for the desk.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.080]   Phantom equity.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.480]   I had phantom equity in tech TV.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.000]   Oh, you were just the same.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.120]   It was completely phantom because it turned out that Paul Allen had to be made whole before
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.640]   we did.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.720]   And by the time he got his money, it was like, there's nothing left for anybody else.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.280]   We're going to work on getting Matthew back.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.280]   We've lost his signal.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.880]   You know, Rogers does this in Canada.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.120]   They just if they see you using Skype after 15 minutes, they go, you're done.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.400]   You can't know you.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.200]   No call should last more than 15 minutes.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.920]   Those Canadians, they're not so nice.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.960]   They only seem like nice.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.280]   Mr. Rogers is not so nice.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.040]   Are you on Rogers?
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.040]   What are you?
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.040]   What are you on?
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.040]   Matthew.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.040]   Yeah, Rogers.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.040]   See, I knew it.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.040]   Is there anything else?
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:01.240]   I'm contractually obligated to say that Ted Rogers is a wonderful man and tremendous service.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:06.760]   Ted Rogers is the Rupert Murdoch of Canada, which is the Norway of the North America.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.760]   So it's very confusing.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.760]   I'm all.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.400]   I thought we were Finland.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.400]   Are you Finland?
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.000]   No, Finland is not part of Scandinavia.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.120]   Finland is just completely different.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.440]   It's its own thing.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.800]   It's more Russian than Scandinavia.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.800]   I'm told.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.360]   We're going to take a break.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.280]   We got Matthew back, but I'm still going to take a break.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:30.280]   So there, this portion of the show brought to you by your friends at stamps.com.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.920]   Stamps.com lets you print US postage.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.040]   I know that seems like that should be illegal somehow, but it isn't.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:42.160]   In fact, the postal service loves it because you never have to darken the door again.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.600]   You can stay at your desk and print your own postage, mail your own stuff.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.000]   You can actually do stuff.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.320]   Everything you could do at the post office you could do at stamps.com.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.120]   For instance, give me one.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.120]   International mailing.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:59.280]   Good example used to be if you want to send something overseas, you'd have to go into
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.680]   the post office and there's forms and all this stuff and get an international mailing
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.680]   thing.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.920]   No, stamps.com, they'll do it.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.280]   They even fill out the forms for you.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.480]   Oh, I got one.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.120]   Packages bigger than 13 ounces.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.240]   I've actually mailed books with way two pounds.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.240]   You get them back.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.520]   The post and the mailman says you got to go to the post office because we got to look
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.680]   at you in the eye in this post 9-1-1 era.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.160]   Not with stamps.com.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.000]   No limit to the size of the packages you mail.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   You get discounts.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.600]   You can't even get at the post office up to 21% on Express mail.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.520]   Just a 15% of priority mail.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.520]   It's really cool.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.520]   Now, here's the deal.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.920]   I want you to try this so we got this no risk trial offer.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.400]   When you go to stamps.com, do you see it right there?
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.400]   That seems pretty tempting.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.400]   $80 value.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.520]   Do not click that.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.520]   Click that.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.520]   They're not going to like stamps.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.520]   It's going to be mad at me for saying that.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:59.600]   Click the microphone and enter the word twig in the promo code TWIG and then it's $110
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.600]   bonus offer.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.360]   What they do is they increase the postage coupons you get.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.560]   Coupons for up to $55 in postage.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.760]   You use them over a period of time.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.560]   It's not all at once.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.200]   But hey, it's a $55 free postage.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.200]   That's nothing to sneeze at.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.480]   And you get the digital scale for free.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.640]   You pay shipping and handling for that.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.840]   That's $5.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:22.160]   To pay you back on that, they give you a $5 supply kit and a four-week trial.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.280]   So you're making out like a bandit here.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.960]   This is a 30-day no risk trial.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.600]   All you have to do is go to stamps.com and use the promo code TWIG.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.280]   That's worth $110.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.840]   And you'll see why I love stamps.com.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.560]   We have two accounts here.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.240]   I love stamps.com and you will love it too because you just don't have to go to the post
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.240]   office.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.760]   The mail carrier comes to you.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:50.560]   stamps.com.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.360]   So let's move on from mode to roll.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:58.880]   Apparently Google is, according to rumor, going to release an X7 with 3G in it in the
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.560]   next six weeks.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.920]   This comes from the next web.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.600]   Actually, Paul O'Brien at Motoko had the original story.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.480]   So let's give Paul credit here.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.840]   The problem is that this is going to be a tough market because not only are you going
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.720]   to see Amazon, I think tomorrow announced new Kindle fires.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.720]   We're sure of that, right?
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.360]   Because they sold out on Amazon.com.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:31.280]   But in a week or maybe next month, depending on who you believe, Apple's going to announce
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.640]   a mini iPad in this market.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.000]   So the report on Amazon is it's going to be ad supported.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.920]   So they're going to break even the $200 line Google set.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.280]   So we see this incredible lowering.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.240]   And what does Apple do in that case?
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.880]   Apple doesn't go for price shrinkage.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.080]   How is it going to be so special that it's worth, you know, what, 400 bucks?
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.480]   It won't be.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.480]   It won't be.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:01.680]   I'm convinced that Apple, and I'm, and here's my reason I think this.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:06.720]   And I've seen a number of blogs that say really the mini iPad is an iPad two in terms of internals.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.120]   It's 1024 by 768.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.040]   It's a smaller screen with that resolution, but that's the iPad two resolution.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.200]   Same chip in there.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.720]   This is in other words, this is last year's technology.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.840]   And based on pricing, it is possible that Apple goes to actually sell us at 200 bucks.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.840]   Really?
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.640]   The advantage of course Amazon has is first of all, Apple was not going to do an ad supported
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.320]   device and Amazon's real purpose for the Kindle fire is to get you to buy stuff from
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.320]   Amazon.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.320]   Exactly.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:38.480]   I don't think Apple's always said we don't even make it money on the iTunes, you know?
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.480]   Apple makes money on hardware.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.720]   So can, but on the other hand, if they sell it for 400 bucks, it's not going to, it's
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.760]   a non starter, isn't it?
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.760]   I think so.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.760]   What's the price?
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.160]   It's in a world in a world.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:57.560]   You wanted me, Matthew Ingram, to do in a world in a world where Amazon is selling a
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:04.720]   tablet for $150 in a world where Google is selling a $200 tablet.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.320]   Can Apple sell what?
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.320]   250?
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.640]   I think they could sell to 50.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.480]   You know, far had, I think it was far had a far had module.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.480]   I think it's a great thing to do in that the Kindle wants to be free.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.600]   And I think if you look at what Amazon does, I mean, Amazon makes money on content selling
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.600]   content, right?
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.960]   They don't care about the hardware.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.600]   Apple's the exact opposite.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.520]   I love this.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.320]   The Kindle like it like information.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.320]   The Kindle wants to be free.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.920]   This is actually in the daily hair.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.720]   The daily hair.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.000]   Wow.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.600]   My record says far hard on the about Amazon's mixed it best.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.200]   Two summers ago, I guess that before the holidays, Amazon would cut the price of its
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.440]   cheapest Kindle, 99 bucks.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.040]   They did eventually, but just they didn't do it until this year or last year, I guess
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.560]   with a $79 ad supported Kindle.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.480]   I don't know about free.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.480]   How much?
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.480]   Close to free, right?
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.480]   I mean, subsidized for sure, right?
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.920]   But even a 200 bucks, it was subsidized.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.920]   All right.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.360]   So, so what you said before about the hardware price?
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.360]   Right.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.360]   That's not what they're saying.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.640]   They're about phones that everybody knows the prices and the price.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.640]   The same will be here.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.800]   It's just subsidized a different way.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.920]   If you buy enough stuff, if you join Prime, if you blubble, blubble, blubble, blubble,
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.960]   then you get a free device.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.880]   The device costs you nothing because.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.080]   I think Scoble said that.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.040]   I think Scoble thought that the fire would be free with a Prime subscription.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.040]   Before it came.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.040]   Maybe a Prime Plus or something.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.080]   You have to imagine that they're giving you a cash register.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.080]   I mean, that's what you have to think about it.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.680]   You have to think about this is a way for them to get money out of me.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.680]   Right.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.680]   I mean, I hate to be that cynical.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.880]   And, you know, and I love the Nexus 7 and I really love the Kindle as well.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:54.160]   But they're just giving you a cash register for you to perform transactions with them.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.240]   It's a tube they can dump content.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.520]   But the key here is that we were talking about that you've talked about this before, guys,
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:08.360]   that the Kindle was a emasculated, I mean, if that's sexist, but a gutted Android.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   Right?
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.360]   And it was terrible.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.360]   It was bad.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.680]   And that's why the Nexus, I've convinced that's why the Nexus 7 was so popular.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.680]   Same price.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   And it's really Android.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.680]   In fact, it's better.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   It's jelly bean.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.680]   Right.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.680]   So what does that do to Amazon?
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.720]   Amazon surely is watching that and saying this thing is actually good.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.120]   Jelly bean is actually good.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.000]   We're not really hurt horribly if we put some of those features in there.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.840]   We've got to have, you know, those computer-like functions of mapping and all that kind of stuff,
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:42.040]   a communication and email does this Kindle move beyond being just a content device to
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:47.440]   truly becoming a tablet computer or does it stay as a content conduit?
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.280]   And will people be satisfied with something that's just a big iPod as opposed to an iPad?
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.760]   Because the iPad's definitely moved into the content creation sphere.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.920]   It's a laptop, really.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:04.640]   Meanwhile, what happens to Barnes and Nobles and then also in Canada, the, the, the, the
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.640]   internet?
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.640]   Mm-hmm.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   Dead.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.640]   What's dead?
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.600]   Yeah, it's dead.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.400]   Who would, why bother?
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:21.000]   And in fact, what's really interesting, this is so different from the PC marketplace where
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.840]   you could have, you could have numerous incumbents.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:31.800]   What this feels like in the tablet market is really there can only be one, maybe two.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.640]   Why is that?
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.320]   Because it's a new market.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.320]   Will let shake out.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.920]   I mean, when, when IBM made the PC was just IBM, then it was IBM and Compaq, then it
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.760]   was IBM and a Julian other companies.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.960]   Maybe that's what's going on with tablets or is it really the case that right now there's
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.920]   only two, there's an iPad or there's an Nexus 7 and that's it.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.040]   There's only two phone operating systems.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.040]   We just went through that, right?
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.320]   Yeah, but there are multiple hardware choices.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.320]   Oh, I see.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.160]   I mean, manufacturers, it doesn't look like that.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:05.040]   I mean, you know, the cliff falls off, you've got iPad at the top, pretty far below that,
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:09.000]   you've got the Nexus 7, pretty far below that, almost to zero, you've got the Kindle
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.960]   Fire and then there's nothing.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.320]   You've got the Samsung 10-inch with the, with the right-o-dang, all that, that's, I think
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   that's niche.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.320]   I don't know.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.960]   I don't know how well those sell.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.720]   What did he say 70,000 a day?
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.560]   2.1 million a month.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:30.000]   I find that hard to believe that they're activating 2.1 million tablets a month.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.400]   Do you think he's including Kindle on that?
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.480]   Yeah, I wonder if he's including Kindle.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.720]   That number seems way high.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.680]   It just seems huge.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.680]   Didn't they project?
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:44.680]   Didn't they sell like 8 million Nexus 7s, which was way more than they projected?
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.120]   I thought I saw that number somewhere.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.240]   So, and the Nexus 7 has been out for months, just a few months.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.560]   So it must be, there's mostly Nexus 7s.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.560]   Mostly Nexus 7s.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:54.880]   Nexus 7 is pretty great.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.600]   I mean, the thing that makes the Nexus 7 so great is the Google layer for me.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.600]   Right.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:05.120]   Because I just, I use calendar and I use maps and I use Gmail and I use Google Voice and
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.320]   I want all those things.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.840]   I mean, you know, I want those things on my tablet, right?
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:14.000]   And you can't, and honestly, like, I love the market, the Play Store.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.400]   I think the Play Store is better.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.720]   Well, let's, let's say this.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:21.440]   I think the Play Store, the app situation in the Play Store is much better than Amazon's
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.440]   app store.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.800]   The developer's point of view or the buyer's point of view?
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   Wolf.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   I'd argue both.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.560]   What's better about it?
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.640]   Content-wise, Amazon has way better content.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.680]   Why, people would, oh, I see better than the Play Store.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:39.040]   Yeah, so like, so I think that the experience of buying apps on the Play Store is better.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.040]   Although, maybe I should make this argument because I don't have a Kindle.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.040]   I haven't installed the Amazon App Store.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.240]   I have, and I find it a very weak experience.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.640]   It's the only advantage they have is the free app of the day, but it's usually crap.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.640]   Right.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.120]   So the Play Store experience is better for the buyer, and it's way better for the developer,
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.120]   for sure.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.880]   I mean, the Amazon App Store, you just have to wait for approval, and you don't have
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.720]   control over your copy.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.720]   Right.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.040]   You know, it's just, it's, they just haven't developed it.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.040]   The tools just aren't mature.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.040]   They aren't as mature because they just haven't been around as long.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.240]   And it seems a little thing, but I have to say I love web install.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.240]   Yes.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.080]   It seems like a little thing.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.680]   Oh, it's great.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.280]   Okay, maybe it's not just me.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.360]   No, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, you have to go through with Apple,
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.600]   of downloading it and syncing and all that mess.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.600]   Mm hmm.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.600]   And, and upgrading things.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:32.520]   I think that it is a step stage ahead as an experience as, as an ongoing, you know, consumer
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.520]   experience.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.520]   It's too bad.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.520]   I'm curious.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.520]   Go ahead.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.000]   Would you, if given the choice now, would you buy this with 3G?
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   I think I would buy it with 3G.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   I would say.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   You have to say.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.880]   It's too geeky to use your phone in tether mode and the Wi-Fi in the 7.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.880]   It takes time.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.880]   It's a pain.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.880]   It's a pain.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.880]   It's a pain.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.880]   It's a pain.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.880]   It's a pain.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.880]   It's a pain.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.880]   It's a pain.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:57.880]   It's a pain.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.880]   It's a pain.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.880]   So really is a, it's a, it's a demerit not to have 3G.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:02.880]   It is.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.880]   And you know, those commercials where the dad and the son are camping in my car.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:06.880]   That was dumb.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.880]   I mean, that was just, I was such a, I feel like it's like they couldn't have picked
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.880]   a commercial that highlights the facts that you have to be a Wi-Fi more to the people who
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.880]   are going to buy the 3G version.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.640]   But yeah, I mean, this seems, this seems obvious that they come out with a 3G version before
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.640]   the holiday season.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:24.720]   Didn't somebody do a tear down and you could see where the 3G bits and pieces would go.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.600]   So I think that it's going to sell, I think it's going to sell well.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.600]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:33.320]   The people who already have an X7, I don't know if they're going to buy the 3G version,
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:37.000]   but for the, for the people who are serious tablet users who are going to be out and about,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.280]   I think a 3G version is a big, a good, good value, good offer.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.280]   Hmm.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:50.320]   Well, it's coming, they say, somebody says, "Modaka says soon."
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.240]   You're watching the convention, you're watching the Republican convention, the Democratic
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.240]   convention.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.520]   YouTube's very involved with both.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:04.000]   They're streaming a lot of it, although apparently YouTube flagged the Democratic convention
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.280]   video on copyright grounds.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:13.880]   I mean, at this point, like, isn't it so clear that these copyright bots are so badly implemented?
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.880]   It's terrible.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.880]   It's terrible.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:16.880]   It's like, terrible.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:17.880]   The situations where things get pulled out.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:23.320]   I mean, Leo, you deal with this pain every day in your day-to-day business, but yeah.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.120]   And I've been complaining about it, but maybe now so is the Hugo Awards got pulled down by
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.080]   used Trump for same threat, same thing.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.080]   Unbelievable.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:38.360]   The clips of Hugo nominated movies and the automated copyright bots saw it and disconnected
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.360]   it on you stream.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.720]   So the live stream of the Hugo, the big science fiction awards.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.720]   Right in the middle.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.440]   Right in the middle of it.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:51.800]   First lady, Michelle Obama's speech, live streamed on YouTube.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:58.520]   But then immediately after it finished, it was flagged by copyright claims from WMG-SME
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:05.080]   Associated Press, UMG, Dow Jones, New York Times, Harry Fox agency, Warner Chappelle,
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.280]   UMPG publishing, and EMI music.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.480]   Who should be bad about this, too?
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.400]   Is it YouTube?
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.480]   Is it the companies that supposedly complain through their bots?
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.640]   Is it the whole damn copyright system?
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.440]   Is it the parents who caused this?
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.440]   I vote ABC.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.200]   Yell of the above.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.200]   Unbelievable.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.200]   It's just terrible.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:35.160]   I'm mostly mad at Google for, well, for not writing a better pot, but also for not pushing
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.520]   back on these people and saying, you know, they've got to do a whitelist.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:43.880]   They've got a whitelist to say that we understand that you know what you're doing.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.480]   And if you don't, if you mess it up, you're going to go into the, you know, in the Shea
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.920]   Wood shed here.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.960]   But for God's sakes, TWIT is a professional organization.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.320]   It's not in your interest to get sued.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.000]   It's not in your interest to get in trouble with Google.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.680]   They should have a whitelist for you and a Democratic National Committee.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.680]   Look at this.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.040]   It's just the video is still blocked.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:07.040]   The DNC has made the video private because it's embarrassing.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.880]   I'm just, that's just wrong.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:18.280]   You know what concerns me is Google says that it's going to voluntarily push down on websites
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.200]   page rank based on copyright claims.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.480]   What concerns me is we're going to have the same type of bogus claim.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.480]   Right.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.320]   Except they're going to affect website page rank and you're not even going to know about
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.320]   it.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:38.360]   This is, yeah, but it's one factor and any system gets, any system can indeed get scammed
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.360]   and get gamed.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.360]   And so yeah, it will get game.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:44.200]   Perhaps the right Matthew, you will, but then I think we'll suffer from that and no fix
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   it.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.600]   But here we see the message, right?
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.480]   We're raised because we see a message saying it's been blocked.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.280]   We're never going to know whether a site should be higher in page rank or should be low.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.280]   It's just going to happen.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.920]   But the sites that are involved, the sites that are affected by it will now, and they'll
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:03.560]   like if it happens to Twitter, Twitter's going to put up a fit properly.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:08.960]   So, and we, the Twitter army will come in their defense and storm Mountain View with
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:09.960]   pitchforges.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:10.960]   The past two.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.960]   Yes.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:19.240]   It's just, it's just, clearly it's an, I mean, look at the list of people who are complaining
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   about it.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:27.240]   I don't even, the Associated Press, The New York Times, this, they don't, surely The New
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:32.240]   York Times didn't, isn't asserting that they have a copyright on Michelle Obama's speech.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:36.680]   No, it wasn't there some, well, there wasn't the video, it wasn't at the video that was
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.680]   blocked.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.680]   It was the video.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.880]   And so there's some automated thing that says there's an, I presume this is what happened.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.200]   There's an ID for the AP or The New York Times and something.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.760]   And it just, and they have their own bots.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.800]   And so it's, it's a complaint bot meets the copyright bot.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.400]   And I don't think, I think this is even worse.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:36:01.600]   I think this is something that we've seen frequently where it's reversed.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:09.040]   So The New York Times or Fox or a Harry Fox agency or somebody was playing the speech
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:12.880]   and they asserted a copyright on their news story with the speech.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.000]   And we've seen this happen many times.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.600]   The local news, does it take down this happened to the NASA Curiosity landing, the, the, that,
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.640]   which is NASA uncopyrighted material that every local news station ran.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.000]   And then the bots said, oh, it was on the local news.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.680]   So actually the local news owned the NASA footage.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.320]   So they killed the NASA video.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.160]   I wonder if this is that.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.160]   Yeah, I know.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.160]   I'll bet you're right then.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.160]   Okay.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.160]   But they're right.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   Because I watched that video.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.160]   That's not Hugo.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.160]   Hugo was clips from.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.160]   Hugo was clips.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.160]   Right.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.360]   It's just a mess.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:53.120]   And it's embarrassing to YouTube because YouTube is the official streaming partner of
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:57.280]   both the Republican and Democratic inventions.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.520]   Yes.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.960]   Unbelievable.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.960]   It's pretty.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.680]   This is where the white, somebody's got to build a whiteless functionality to say our
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.840]   friends don't get screwed.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.840]   And it's so, our friends are innocent.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.120]   People who can get like there's, you know, that like, I think they can't.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.600]   I think they can't.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.320]   I think they can't.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.320]   Why not?
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.320]   Why?
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.480]   I think they're worried about losing their safe harbor.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.320]   So they bend over backwards.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:30.880]   Because the worst thing that could happen to YouTube is to be seen as a publisher, not
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.760]   as a safe harbor protected.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:39.320]   So so if so if they start favoring certain people, they're not, they're not.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.760]   Yes, then they're not, then they're partisan.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.200]   I think making an active choice.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:47.320]   I think their lawyers are saying, no, dudes, don't do that.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.880]   The worst because it would put it put you too bad a business.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:55.720]   If it were, this is just collateral damage is collateral damage to the DMCA.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:59.000]   Well, it's dumb.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.840]   It's dumb.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:08.360]   This story from Wired.com says it was Michelle Obama's speech.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.800]   YouTube says it just briefly showed an incorrect error message.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.440]   But the reality is the video was blocked for hours.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:24.480]   Yeah, YouTube got it all wrong because YouTube's statement was after tonight's livestream ended,
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.760]   YouTube briefly showed an incorrect error message.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.160]   Neither the livestream nor any of the channels videos were affected.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:34.200]   But according to Wired.com, it's not clear what he meant by none of the channels videos
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.760]   were affected as the video was unplayable.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.560]   That's pretty effective.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:48.880]   What's funny is that when when contacted by Wired for comment late Tuesday, an Obama
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:53.000]   campaign staffer who works on digital outreach had no knowledge of the outage, asked the
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.200]   reporter for the URL and then upon seeing the takedown said, I'll have to call you back.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.280]   That's straight out of an Aaron Sorkin script.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:06.560]   Well, to be fair, they were kind of busy yesterday.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:13.520]   You see two things happening here at Cross Purposes because you see these absurd extensions of
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.520]   copyright.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.280]   We haven't even gotten to my friends in Germany and France yet.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:22.080]   On the other hand, you have Canada, since we have Matthew Hill, it's on our Canada.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:27.000]   Canada has a new copyright law that extends fair use or what is it fair, some or something
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.320]   what do you call it?
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.680]   Fair dealing, yeah.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.800]   And Matthew, do you know what the law, can you describe some of the new features?
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.480]   I can't go into it in any detail.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.680]   I haven't looked at it yet.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.080]   We'll have to get Michael Geist to explain it all.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.240]   I'm looking forward to the closing questions.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:49.000]   It's interesting because there's what the Economist wrote about this that there's a whole
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.840]   bunch of new efforts to soften or make more sense out.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:00.680]   Unless it makes more sense out of copyright and a few countries yet at the same time,
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.520]   of course, we have insanity going on.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.880]   Well, we keep saying it's the pendulum, right?
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.680]   We're just singing, except the pendulum seems to be really be stuck.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:14.000]   I think it hit really hard on one side and it got stuck because it hasn't swung in any
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.400]   appreciable way in the last as long as I've been around.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:22.760]   How long is how long is copyright now forever?
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.200]   All right, here it is.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.720]   Canada passed a law engine that sets a new standard of permissiveness at cap statutory
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.240]   damages if copyright is breached for non-commercial purposes.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.240]   That's a big F.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:37.840]   It expands definition of fair dealing, fair use in America, fair dinkum, as I'm sure
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.680]   what I'm calling it.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.600]   And creates exemptions for educational purposes and for parody.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.280]   Burmursman has the opinions about infringement to the person who posted the material rather
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.680]   than immediately take the content down themselves.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.880]   This contrasts with the practice in America and Europe where a web company alerted to
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.840]   infringement material must remove it.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:01.880]   This encourages knee-jerk responses to complaints here I'm quoting from the Economist, folks.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.800]   Written two plans to introduce internet friendly legislation this autumn at a review by Ian
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.800]   Hargreaves.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:13.760]   It will also recommend exemptions for non-commercial use, user-generated content, and so on.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:19.320]   Another innovation is an exemption for copies engaged in text and data mining known as big
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.320]   data.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.960]   The idea that if you copied something only to analyze it, you were creating a copyright
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.640]   violation as absurd.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:31.560]   You are now allowed under this notion here, not spread widely, but I think in Ireland
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:38.960]   and Australia, that you can analyze the data which advances knowledge and science and such
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.520]   and so forth.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.600]   But as the economy says, the tide is not all one way.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:50.440]   EU officials want to maintain rules whereby computers pay a small tithe on digital products
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.800]   to collection societies.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.480]   These fees are meant to go to content creators.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:02.600]   Meanwhile, my friends, the Germans, I'll just bet with one today, who have their "Lysdung
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.760]   Shuktz" which is the...
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:10.120]   We talked about this show before, the effort to extend copyright to make Google pay for
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.120]   snippets.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:16.320]   Now France, of course, is proposing the same thing through magazine publishers there.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.240]   That pendulum ain't coming back.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:24.840]   So I just went to the Barack Obama site and the day two is now up.
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.680]   So YouTube has either unblocked it or something.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.360]   But it looked like it was blocked for quite some time.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.480]   Is that the livestream or is that...
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.480]   This is...
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.480]   Oh, maybe that's...
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.480]   Oh, you're right.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.480]   This is now.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.480]   Yeah, that's the livestream.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.160]   Oh, never mind.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.160]   This is day.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.160]   All right.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.440]   Well, you should have just watched it on TV anyway.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.000]   That YouTube's stupid.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   Okay.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.280]   Who watches TV on YouTube anyway?
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.800]   What's the video on the web?
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.160]   It's for crutch shots.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.280]   Come on, let's get it right.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.280]   And Lady Gaga videos.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.800]   That's what YouTube's for.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.280]   Not politics.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:09.160]   Actually, it really is a problem if they want to make YouTube credible and reliable for news.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.560]   They've got to solve that.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.520]   What happens?
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.600]   NPR asks.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:22.040]   When a Kickstarter campaign fails, does anyone get their money back?
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.040]   No.
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.040]   The answer.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.040]   Maybe.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.040]   Maybe, really?
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:30.480]   Well, if this is a fun bid to get your money back, you never get your money back.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.040]   You never paid money.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:35.440]   But I have to say, I'm looking at all the stuff I spent money on on Kickstarter.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.800]   The only thing I ever got was a bra.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   So...
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.160]   Was it a man's ear about that?
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.160]   Well, no.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.640]   It's called the Joey bra.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.440]   And the idea was it was like a kangaroo.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.040]   It was a baby kangaroo called a Joey.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.840]   It was a bra with a pouch for your iPhone.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.800]   Did you try it?
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.200]   It was too small.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.680]   It was too small.
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.000]   So I got something, but it was too small.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.400]   So I've backed eight projects.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.120]   All of these I've paid for, except for one.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:12.240]   The space folk album on the moon did not get funded.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:17.120]   But everything else here got funded, included the Aspra, the Pebble Watch, the Cone Coffee
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.120]   Filter.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.000]   I just got the email telling me to put the address in with Pebble Watch.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.600]   I've gotten all that crap too.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.600]   I've never...
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.600]   None of this have I received.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.600]   I've got a different problem, Leo.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.360]   I've gotten everything, but I have real buyers remorse.
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.200]   Yeah, me too.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:34.880]   I got a little thing that revolutionizes video on the iPhone.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.880]   And it's this little plastic thing that fits over the camera so that you can just put it
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.840]   down and it'll take a picture with a...
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.720]   And I thought, why did I buy that?
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.720]   Now, how much was that?
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.880]   Oh, I think it was like six bucks.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:46.880]   But it was...
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:47.880]   Well, why did it?
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.880]   The worst one was...
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:57.640]   And you made fun of me for this already, but it's an iPhone case that magically copies
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.400]   basically all my credit cards and frequent shopper cards in the case.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.400]   That's a good idea.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.040]   And one card so I can use that card.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.040]   But it's a case...
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.040]   I don't want another case for my iPhone.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.040]   I know I have this thing.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.480]   I should sell it on a little bit.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.040]   And B, I can imagine going in the store and say, "No, really, that's an American Express
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:15.840]   card."
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.760]   So yeah, that's my problem is I buy stupid stuff.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.680]   Well, I don't know if this is stupid or not, but I haven't gotten it.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.120]   Go ahead, Matthew, sorry.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.000]   So Kickstarter's the new home shopping network.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   You just stay up late.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Look what I bought.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   Yeah, yeah, there you go.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   Now, that's it.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.880]   Look at the crap I purchased.
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:33.880]   It's digital capital Monte.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.560]   And by the way, Diaspora did do something.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.880]   I mean, I gave them I think 100 bucks.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.280]   That was my first experience on Kickstarter.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.160]   But now they've decided to move on.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.600]   So I think that one's...
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.080]   Well, they've thrown it open.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.080]   It's open source.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.080]   It's nothing.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.080]   Some of this is cool stuff.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.320]   I hope I get it.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.240]   I did get to Joey Bra.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.800]   Exactly as promised.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.840]   Did you fund the Tesla museum?
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.280]   No, you know what?
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.360]   I'm a bad man.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.360]   I think I did.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.360]   It's funny.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.360]   I meant to.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.360]   But they made the money.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.360]   They got the money.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.360]   What was it?
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.360]   Indiegogo.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.360]   Sorry.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.600]   It was just enough money to buy the land.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.600]   Right.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:16.400]   Now they need a lot more to build it.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.360]   That seems to me that yet another way to throw money away.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.280]   I don't know.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.280]   So what is...
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.280]   It's now...
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.400]   Is there going to be a backlash at some point on Kickstarter?
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.400]   I mean...
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.400]   1.2 billion dollars.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.400]   Well, you know what it is.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.240]   So they got 400,000 extra.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.240]   Good.
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:32.240]   350 extra.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.240]   Good.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.240]   They could put up a little shack.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:41.400]   It reminds me of the early days of even eBay or Craigslist or...
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:44.760]   You know, you go to buy something, you get ripped off.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:51.080]   I mean, all of those entities have had to institute something, some kind of protection,
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.920]   even Airbnb to some extent.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.360]   I think it's going to happen with Kickstarter.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.360]   Someone's going to say...
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.360]   But how...
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.360]   Matthew, I get...
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.360]   But how can they really?
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.360]   Right.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.360]   This is...
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.360]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.360]   It's not an investment, but it's an investment.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.360]   Where?
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.360]   Yeah, it really is.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.120]   You know, I think that you've got to...
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.560]   Some of these ideas won't work or there'll be problems with them.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.960]   Yes, there'll be some people who run off to Brazil.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.240]   But I don't know what Kickstarter can really do.
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.120]   I think there'll be a big celebrated one.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:23.520]   I mean, there've been a number of million-dollar-plus kick-starters.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:28.440]   All it takes is one of those for its recipients to go to Brazil.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.160]   And then we're going to see a little Kickstarter collapse.
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.960]   I've had a really good experience on Kickstarter.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.720]   I've backed 16 projects.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:41.280]   They have a new profile page if you go to kickstart.com/profile/teantrapanny.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.200]   And I think I had a bad experience with one.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:46.120]   I mean, one that didn't happen.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.000]   And the person emailed and said, "This didn't happen.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.520]   It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.680]   I got caught up with other things.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.680]   What do you want me to do?
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.400]   Do you want me to donate your money to charity?
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.880]   Do you want me to refund your money?"
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.880]   And this was just a guy who was just a good guy.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.120]   And I thought that not everyone's going to go through all that trouble.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.120]   But I don't know.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.440]   I think there's an art to it picking projects that are going to do well.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:11.040]   I tend to choose projects that are pretty popular already.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.120]   I'm pretty conservative, I guess.
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:15.280]   Have you received all of these things?
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.360]   I mean, the first one that I backed was my cousin.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.040]   My little cousin did an Apple.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.600]   The Home EP by Jenny O.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.600]   Jenny.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.600]   Yeah, that's cute.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.600]   Jenny's album is great.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:25.600]   It's in iTunes.
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.240]   See, that makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.240]   And those aren't a huge-- those aren't million-dollar projects.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.240]   Right.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.080]   A friend of mine wrote a book with a minefire book.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.080]   Scott Birkin, who's great.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.880]   And actually, you should have on Trangulation someday.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.120]   Oh, I like Scott Birkin.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.560]   I would love to get him on.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:41.560]   Another one's an iPhone app for my friend.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:45.080]   Does a website for Louisville, text adventures.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.080]   They Frank's the show.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.080]   I backed, which is great.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.040]   I mean, I just-- there are a lot of really good products.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:52.360]   There's a new public market here in San Diego that got funded on Kickstarter, which I'm really
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.560]   excited about.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:57.840]   They raised like $90,000-- oh, no, $146,000.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:59.240]   So I don't know.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.240]   This smart thing is just--
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.240]   Yeah, I've got--
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.240]   I've got--
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.400]   I've got some I haven't gotten yet.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.320]   But they're still-- that's OK.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.520]   The timing is within their window.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.880]   I think about it more as creative charity than anything.
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.280]   Well, if you look at it that way, then there's no loss.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:23.280]   The NPR example is a open source game box, I guess.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.080]   They've raised $8.5 million.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.080]   That's the one.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.720]   That's the one that-- if they don't do it or they took off--
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.720]   That's not a little thing.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:35.360]   I'm excited about the Uya.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.040]   That's the most successful Kickstarter project of all time.
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.440]   I did not actually donate to that.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.000]   I don't know why not.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   I am such a--
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:47.160]   I mean, I think the things that Gina's talking about or some of them, you know, you look
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.720]   at what Amanda Palmer did with her album.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:51.720]   Right.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.680]   And that's a direct connection with a specific individual.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:50:00.080]   And also a musician, an artist, someone who's doing something that you want to support.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:04.400]   And there's a whole nother category that's basically companies making products.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.880]   And I think in that case, if they just take the money and do something else, then I think
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.360]   you have a right to complain.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.720]   But I guess Kickstarter is saying, don't look for any help from us.
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.640]   I think a lot of these cases, these are not individuals, exactly as you say.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.720]   These are companies that are already kind of in the business.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:26.560]   It kind of-- it just feels a little-- well, what we're really going to get down to it
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.280]   is the Jobs Act.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.040]   When they figure out exactly how they can force it.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:35.200]   Come January, when we can invest in companies, it is an investment, it is equity.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.920]   But this is a hard business investing.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:38.920]   And people will make mistakes.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:41.560]   I listen to a wonderful BBC.
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:47.560]   Peter Day is just a great guy on the BBC with a business show, a wonderful podcast,
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:48.560]   I have this new all the time.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:51.960]   And he did the British version, which has been out for a year now, with tax benefits,
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.160]   by the way, to the investors.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:57.720]   And what one of the services there proposes that you should do is make a bunch of small
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:02.040]   investments across a diversified portfolio of startups, just like a VC would, on the
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:06.280]   hopes that you hit OK on a couple of them, knowing you're going to lose on most of them.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.280]   Right.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.640]   But most people will never do that.
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:10.640]   No.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:14.080]   And you still do better if you just bought index funds, no load index funds.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.640]   But all right.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:18.200]   Well, I'm struggling with this right now.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.640]   I have one of my students.
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.280]   It has a great business.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.440]   I believe-- I live a lot of my students' businesses.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:28.400]   There's one I was talking to today, I mean, who has been doing fundraising.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:29.680]   She's got a great proposal.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:32.800]   She's got a great business, I think, called ParcelP-A-R-C-E-L-D.com.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.960]   You can't find much about it, but there yet.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:40.160]   But it's going to change the relationship of brands to customers.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.520]   Let's put it that way.
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.520]   Right.
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:43.520]   So she's got all kinds.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.520]   She's been out there doing great presentations.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.200]   She's been talking to the rich people.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.800]   She's been trying to get that first domino to fall.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.800]   Right.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:53.360]   I've got another guy who's doing a really exciting business thing here in New York.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.400]   I mean, talk to him today.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.400]   He's got a great thing.
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.040]   He's been out there dealing with people and it's waiting for that.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.840]   Well, you find somebody to lead here.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.920]   I'll come along there.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:05.600]   It's an extraordinarily frustrating system for people.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.000]   And we got you.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.440]   And so we can have this discussion about VCs and Angel, but a lot of them can be really
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.840]   jerks, don't we know?
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.640]   And that's what's holding up innovation.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.760]   Now, of course, there's also a lot of really bad company ideas that don't deserve to be
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:23.760]   funded.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:27.040]   I think this is an area that is ripe for disruption.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.360]   Is the jobs act the right way?
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.040]   No, it's not going to do everything.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.600]   But I think that it brings in at least one more competitor to say, okay, to heck with
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:38.760]   you, I'm going to get funded my way.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:39.760]   I agree.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.800]   I just, yeah, I agree.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:47.160]   And there's lots of neat Kickstarter stories.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:52.960]   You know, Kickstarter responds to the NPR thing saying, since Kickstarter's launched
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:57.640]   in 2009, 30,000 projects have been successfully funded.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.880]   That merely means they got money, by the way, successfully funded.
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:05.040]   By more than 2 million people, these projects include documentaries, albums, arpeggola.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.680]   The number of creative projects that have been funded and produced on Kickstarter in
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.520]   the past three years is enormous.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.800]   But they never say how many delivered.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:15.800]   Do they even know?
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.120]   I don't even know if they know.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:19.120]   No.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.720]   They probably don't want to know.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:21.720]   Right.
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:25.560]   Because that's a number they probably would not like to report.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:31.960]   But there have been other efforts that do really good analysis of the data that is available,
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:36.560]   but no one's done that follow-up study, which an academic really should do as to what products
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:37.880]   actually got out.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:41.160]   And then, you know, the next thing that's odd to me is, all right, so fun.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.680]   There's products that I've seen on Kickstarter, I missed the time period, they're already
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.680]   funded.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:45.680]   I'd like that.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.960]   There's no place to go buy it.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:52.360]   Once the first tranche is delivered to the Kickstarter backers, is there an ongoing product
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:53.360]   there or not?
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:59.880]   What are the terms of use required creators to fulfill all rewards of their project or
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:03.960]   refund any backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill?
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:07.520]   We do hope that backers will consider using this provision only in cases where they feel
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:12.160]   that a creator has not made a good faith effort to complete the project and fulfill.
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:16.640]   Kickstarter cannot refund the money because we never had it.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:20.840]   Money's transferred directly from your credit card to the project, creators Amazon Payments
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:21.840]   account.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:25.720]   But I got to point out Kickstarter takes a skim on everything.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.360]   I mean, this is not a non-profit.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:33.600]   You know, when I back a Kickstarter project though, like I feel like what I'm buying is
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:38.920]   being a part of something early on, like more than the product itself, like the TikTok,
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:42.840]   which was the iPod mini watch band.
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.960]   I just saw that in the Apple Store last week.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.360]   I got that on Kickstarter.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.240]   I was one of the first ones to have one of those.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.480]   Yeah, it's in the Apple Store now.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:50.480]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.480]   That was really one of the really big projects.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:57.600]   And I feel like, oh, hey, I was a part of this or with the book or the albums.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:01.240]   I got a little thank you from the author or the creator.
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:05.240]   It feels more like just kind of being a part, I know I sound like a hippie right now.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.240]   I'm not an investor.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:11.960]   But I feel part of a creative movement and part of a community, people who saw something
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:14.920]   interesting before anybody else saw that it was interesting.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.560]   I can't wait to go to this new market in San Diego and be like, hey, I helped make this
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:19.560]   happen.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:22.120]   But you're the right person to be investing in Kickstarter because you have the right
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.120]   attitude towards it.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:26.280]   I just fear that there's a lot of people who think they're in a marketplace of that
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.280]   they're buying stuff.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:30.960]   Like I think there's a lot of people who think they bought a Pebble watch that is going to
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.000]   be useful and wonderful.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.880]   And A, there may never be a Pebble watch or B, there may be one and it's crap.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:41.920]   And people, you have the right attitude, but I don't know.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:46.520]   Maybe I'm wrong with a lot of people who use Kickstarter are really think they're buying
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:47.520]   something.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:54.760]   I think that's the difference between the Kickstarter's that are individually driven
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:57.280]   and the Kickstarter's that appear to be companies.
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:04.280]   If it's an individual and you're backing their dream and you buy into it, then you're willing
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.680]   to accept a little bit more risk, I think.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:08.960]   Maybe you're okay with feeling a part of it.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:12.840]   If it's a company building a thing and they say they're going to build a bunch of them,
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.520]   then you want your thing.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:15.520]   Right.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:20.000]   But I think that's a mistake to go to Kickstarter and see a thing.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.320]   But I think that's what most people do.
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:23.480]   They say, oh, the Uya is going to be great.
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.600]   I want to get it on the ground floor.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.560]   Instead of Gina's point of view, which is those people have a great idea.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:33.200]   I want to support them in their attempt to create this wonderful thing, whether they
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.520]   succeed or not.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:37.720]   Because that's really what you're doing.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:42.000]   But most, I think most people, certainly I noticed this in myself, I really want that
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.280]   coffee filter and those gaming dice and the headset that makes the world 3D.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.560]   I really want that thing.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:50.560]   Big mistake.
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.560]   I thought that's what I was doing, but I'm not.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:53.560]   Right.
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.560]   You're pre-purchasing.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:55.560]   I'm pre-purchasing.
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:56.560]   Not that.
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:02.680]   So does Kickstarter have an obligation to make that clearer or no?
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.600]   I don't know if that again goes to research.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.600]   What do people think?
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:11.080]   I mean, if I were an academic and I'm not doing a study, I think it would be a great
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.560]   study of funding.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:18.880]   As you go to the Jobs Act, I would look at micro-lones and loan platforms that exist.
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:22.440]   I would look at Kickstarter and Indiegogo and I would look at the Jobs Platform that exists
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:25.480]   here in the UK, Jobs Act.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:29.560]   And see what the delivery is and what the expectations are, what's the demand side
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:30.560]   saying about it.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.000]   It's a great area for study, I think.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:39.720]   I think it's in Kickstarter's interest or Indiegogo or whoever to just be as clear and
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.560]   repetitive as possible.
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:46.920]   Just to keep saying this is between you and the person or thing you're funding.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:51.840]   We're just connecting you to Craigslist or Airbnb or whatever.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:53.640]   You guys have to work it out.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.080]   I think you're right, Matthew.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:01.160]   If there are those big, bad cases that come out, there'll be regulation that comes.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:05.320]   There'll be Chuck Schumer, my Senator in New York, who loves the Saturday press release.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:10.120]   We'll call one on Saturday and I say, and I'm going to protect people by proposing a new
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:12.920]   law against these Kickstarter things.
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.560]   And that'll be a disaster.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.560]   Yes.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.560]   Yes.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:18.800]   So it's in their interest to be as open as they can be.
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:25.240]   So maybe it is in their interest to know those numbers and to face them.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:26.760]   And maybe I'll get my dice.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:33.880]   I think I'm going to get my pebble.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:38.560]   I know we'll get a pebble, but I want to underscore that I've seen a dozen of these
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:43.560]   things and they're horrible.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:45.520]   They're unusable.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:48.000]   And just be prepared.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:55.600]   And it's not, you know, for instance, Kiva, it's gotten a lot of criticism.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.440]   I think you understand what you're doing with Kiva, right?
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:03.760]   It's very clear that you're, you know, these are micro lending and you know, you're not,
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:06.920]   you probably not going to get, you probably get your money back, but you might not.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:10.000]   And if you do, you're not supposed to really take it out anyway, you're supposed to pay
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.840]   it forward and all that stuff.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.280]   And I think you understand what you're doing.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:20.840]   Yeah, Kiva is clearly humanitarian altruistic Kickstarter feels like a marketplace, which
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.480]   is probably not what it should be.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:25.480]   Build that.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:29.280]   The ones that I find fascinating are the ones like, I can't remember if this was a Kickstarter
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:33.840]   or not, but the bus monitor lady, you know, who got a great project.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:34.840]   Yes.
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:36.560]   Who got belittled by the kids.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:40.360]   Yeah, the Reddit, the Redditors raised, you know, 600,000.
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:43.280]   I mean, I'm in the go though.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.280]   That was Indiegogo.
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:45.280]   Okay.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:48.960]   Yeah, it wouldn't Kickstarter wouldn't, it doesn't apply with their guidelines.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:51.960]   But I mean, you know, 600 grand.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:52.960]   It's not great.
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:57.440]   I can't be the only person who thought, I'll just fill myself being humiliated some way.
[00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:58.640]   I'll get a half a million dollars.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.040]   I mean, she gets to do whatever she wants with that money.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.040]   I guess.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.560]   Just find that fascinating.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:09.400]   Everybody's mad at me in the chat room because I'm bashing Kickstarter.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.760]   It's a Kickstarter funding platform.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.840]   I mean, it's an investor, not consumer buy.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.680]   It's, well, you don't get over it.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:21.360]   Plus somebody said you the dice look like two prostate glands anyway.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:24.240]   Not deliberately, I guess.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.680]   I feel that part of my job is to be a consumer watchdog.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:32.720]   Now, the problem is that I talk to a variety of different levels.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:36.760]   Anybody watches this show is certainly more than aware of what they're getting involved
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.200]   with Kickstarter.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.760]   But I also think about all the people who listen to the radio show who think that the
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:45.560]   Internet is free via a thing called Lynxis.
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.840]   And it's for those people.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:53.840]   I mean, like fear.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:01:00.080]   And that and Kickstarter rejected us because we asked, we wanted to do a Kickstarter project
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.360]   for the studio and they said no.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.680]   Why?
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.680]   I don't know.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.000]   Because it was part of an ongoing business.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   Yes.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.320]   And I think it's a really specific guidelines.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:13.240]   Like their goal is to, for people to fund creative projects where there's something tangible
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:18.200]   that happens in the end, like an album or a documentary or a watch band or whatever.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.200]   Yeah.
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.200]   We probably should have gotten it.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.200]   Indiegogo.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.200]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.360]   That's why I thought it was interesting the, um, try to remember the comic site.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.360]   I can't remember the name of it now.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.360]   What they did.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.360]   Sorry?
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.360]   Oatmeal?
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.360]   No.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.360]   KXPCD.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.360]   I know.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.360]   I'm just throwing.
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.360]   I shouldn't go ahead.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:40.240]   We're going to remove all the advertising from the site if they were fully funded.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.040]   Oh, I'm going to find the name of it.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.720]   Did they do that on Kickstarter?
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.720]   Penny Arcade.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.720]   Wait.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.720]   Penny Arcade.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.720]   Yes.
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.720]   Penny Arcade.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720]   Awesome.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:50.720]   And did they raise the money?
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.840]   There was a lot of debate about whether they should be allowed to do that or not because
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.560]   it's part of an ongoing business.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:00.640]   But their argument was, well, it's basically you're just buying a sort of ad free version.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.160]   So it's a specific thing.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.960]   But I thought it was in a real gray area there.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.480]   And what was the final decision?
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.080]   Were they allowed to or not?
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.080]   They were.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.640]   They said they'd talk to Kickstarter about it and Kickstarter said it was fine.
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.640]   It's called.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.960]   It was the project was called Penny Arcade Cells Out.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:22.680]   They raised half a million dollars on August 15th.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.680]   And it was just basically to support.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.400]   See, I don't see how that's any different from asking people to help us build a studio,
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.680]   but I can see why there's debate, but I don't know who cares.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.680]   I don't care.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.680]   We did ourselves.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.680]   It says the chat room.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.680]   Well, now we know why you don't like it.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:36.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.680]   That's why.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.400]   But I actually got interested in the idea of using Kickstarter or something like it to
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.600]   crowd fund journalism.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.760]   Could you and I know there are a couple of journalism projects.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.960]   There's a magazine that Bobby Johnson's involved in.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.800]   There's a couple of other sort of one off research projects, but could you use that
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:59.080]   model to fund, you know, like Dave Cohen tried to do with spot.us?
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:04.480]   Is that a way that you could get your readers to support journalism?
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.480]   I like that idea.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:09.240]   One of my students, if you look up narratively.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.440]   They're on my list of things I've asked.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.640]   Oh, they're getting close there.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:14.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.840]   41,000 with 50,000 gold, four days to go, folks.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.080]   Look at how great people, a lot of people who write for the New York Times, New York
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:26.880]   Magazine, others really want to rethink how to do journalism in New York.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:31.520]   I think their price is a little high and they got to shove it in, but they could make
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.520]   it, man.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.520]   They could make it if you'll help them.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.120]   They need a grand narratively.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.240]   Yeah, four days to go.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.240]   They're close.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.160]   They're close.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.160]   What do I get?
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.160]   Do I get a T-shirt?
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.520]   No, I don't feel good.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:47.520]   I get to feel good.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.200]   See that one, they're not promising me any physical good.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.360]   I can't complain, right?
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.360]   How can I complain?
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:04:00.080]   I just feel good because I gave.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.080]   Do I get a subscription?
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.080]   Oh, yes.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.080]   I'll be a premium member.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:06.760]   You can become a member of the Inner Circle.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.480]   Hey, I gave 100 bucks to App.net.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:11.760]   I mean, I'm an idiot.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.560]   Certainly, don't use me as a...
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.560]   ...than anybody I say.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.560]   ...in the wrong.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.000]   Yeah, a broad that doesn't fit.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.040]   The other thing I gave to an Indigo Girl was Alexis O'Hennion's Internet promoting
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.680]   bus tour, which I think is a great thing.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.680]   Another good one.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.680]   No, there's good stuff.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.880]   At least I didn't buy Facebook stock.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:33.400]   Well, that's up today.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.400]   Is it up?
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.960]   Because Mark Zuckerberg, they wouldn't sell.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:38.960]   They'd be selling.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:39.960]   And they canceled their second...
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:40.960]   They're getting their buyback.
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:44.040]   There were million shares they're going to use to pay the taxes, which basically reduces
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.120]   the pool, so it's basically a goodbyeback.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.960]   So it's up 4.8% today to 1858.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:54.720]   I think yesterday it was down to 17-8 or something.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.520]   I don't think you can get mad at Facebook.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:03.000]   Mark Zuckerberg wrote a letter saying, "Hey, don't buy this stock."
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.960]   They effectively warned people that, "Hey, it's going to be a long time before we make
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.440]   any money."
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:13.280]   Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote a really tough column in New York Times.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.000]   Really tough taking the CFO on and saying it was all his fault.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.320]   And I think that Matthew disagreed.
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:23.880]   But I think that it was not off the mark in the sense of saying that it's about the price
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.880]   that was set.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.480]   They saw other companies like LinkedIn found the value went way up right after a certain
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.480]   price.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.600]   That meant that the company lost that money to speculators.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.520]   So they wanted to price this to get as much revenue to the company as possible.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:37.840]   The thing that nobody talks about here that I think really caused a lot of the problems
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:43.120]   for Facebook is that there was an artificial scarcity of the stock in a marketplace beforehand.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:48.360]   The fact that you can trade insider shares now, and there's a huge scarcity.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.400]   Nobody can get them.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.920]   That drives the prices way up, and it changes everybody's view of what the real value of
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:53.920]   the company is.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.720]   And that's why we knew the valuation of Facebook was absurd before.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.200]   But that was the valuation in an open marketplace.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.600]   Just a very scarce one.
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.360]   Well, Mark, there was a huge amount of hype.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:07.560]   I mean, let's face it, everybody thought it was going to be a $100 billion stock.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.920]   All the brokerage firms wanted it.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.240]   All the banks wanted it.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.680]   VCs were desperate to get out at X price.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.720]   I mean, none of that is David Ebersman's fault.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:22.320]   And if he accepts the advice of his underwriters about the listing price, that is also not his
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.320]   fault.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.320]   That's what they do.
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:30.760]   But his duty was to raise as much money as possible for the company.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:31.920]   That's Mark Cuban's point.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.720]   Mark Cuban said he did exactly what he was supposed to.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:37.200]   He got $10 billion bucks for Facebook.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:43.720]   He says it was not Facebook's CFO's job to protect investors or to worry about shareholders
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.240]   portfolio.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:49.400]   If they were willing to pay that, they'd be foolish of him not to take it.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.920]   But what's the impact now on the problem is there is clearly an impact now on the company.
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.640]   People wanting Zuckerberg's head, which I think is way wrong.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:58.320]   I sure wouldn't want the stock without Zuckerberg there.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.720]   That's a good point.
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:06.200]   You have this, it's the cootization of the company now.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:11.000]   And Cuban's response to that, by the way, is that companies can reprice options.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.400]   So unhappy employees can be made whole.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.760]   And you're right.
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:21.400]   I mean, Zuckerberg said, I am looking at this thing as a long term.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.400]   You weren't everybody.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.560]   So don't buy it if you want to flip it tomorrow.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.920]   And so a bunch of people bought it so they could flip tomorrow.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:28.920]   So they got screwed.
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:29.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.320]   Somebody wrote an article saying it's obvious.
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.720]   Nobody read the prospectus or Mark Zuckerberg's letter.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.520]   So it's not there.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.560]   It's like buying stuff on Kickstarter.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.520]   It's not your.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:43.560]   It's the RTFM tax.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.080]   Yeah, the RTFM tax.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:47.840]   I like it.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.840]   I like it.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:56.800]   Um, the Russian military.
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:06.480]   I like this story has removed the Google layer from Android tablets because Google is spying
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.640]   on us all as opposed to the Russian.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.000]   But that's true.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   Right.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.160]   The Russian Defense Ministry announced a stripped down encrypted version of Android
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.000]   does destined for government and military devices.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.360]   They'll also sell it to the public without Google's spyware.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.880]   And nobody else is going to spy on you on that device.
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:29.520]   No, I want it.
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:32.040]   It's called the Russian mobile operating system.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.040]   Ramos.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:36.760]   So we they're calling Google Maps spyware.
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.760]   Is that what's happening?
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:42.440]   Well, yeah, because Google gets information about where you're going.
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.240]   Because Google spies on you.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.240]   Yes.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.000]   First 10 inch tablets running a row.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.360]   Moss will be available later this year.
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.760]   Shockproof waterproof $460.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.000]   Assembled in Russia.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.560]   It's like buying those old Russian Soviet army hats and pins and things.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.800]   I got those when I was in St. Petersburg.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.800]   They were cheap.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.040]   I bought a bunch of those.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.560]   They were all legitimate.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.800]   Oh, you think they're not real?
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.800]   Oh.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.480]   You mean somebody's like making those?
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:14.480]   Yeah, because you could still get them today.
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.480]   Years after.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.480]   Oh, crap.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:17.480]   Always there.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:22.800]   It says the finished product will be mainly aimed at state officials and military personnel.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:23.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:26.920]   I actually am surprised that other governments don't do that.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:30.640]   First of all, you can because Android's open source, so you can make your own version
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:31.640]   of it.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.640]   And why not?
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.640]   I think that's smart.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.880]   I think our government should be doing that.
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:40.240]   Didn't they make President Obama ditch his BlackBerry and use some sort of crappy Windows
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:43.840]   phone 6.5 device that had all this encryption hanging off of it?
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.640]   It's like this shoe box.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.840]   Isn't that happened?
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.760]   Am I rock four years ago?
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.760]   I think so.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:51.760]   I think so.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:52.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.480]   I misread the headline and I thought it was they.
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:58.400]   They ain't Google Maps and called Google Maps spyware, like as if the Google Maps was
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.400]   covering over your house.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.040]   They are holding their own phone home capability.
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:04.040]   The hell layers gone.
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.360]   You're using their own GPS alternatives.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.360]   Yeah.
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.640]   Oh, clonats.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.880]   But they've had that for one.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:14.720]   In fact, my phone, the Samsung S3 and a lot of other phones support both GPS and GLONASS.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:15.720]   Do that.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:16.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:17.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.400]   Because you can't sell it, you can't sell it in the Russian and other markets if you
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.400]   don't have GLONASS.
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:26.440]   And it's a second GPS system, which is probably a good thing.
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.440]   Yeah.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:32.400]   So I want to talk about Twitter with you, Matthew.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.560]   We need to have a therapy session.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.120]   Apparently you both love it and hate it.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.120]   I do.
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.520]   I am with you 100%.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:44.640]   What do you hate about Twitter?
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.080]   I guess I hate, I mean, I hate little things.
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:52.000]   You know, I hate, I hate the fact that their apps aren't consistent.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.480]   So I can do some things on the iPhone app, but I can't do them on the iPad app.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.840]   You know, and I can't do them on the website.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:03.760]   I mean, it's those things are all infuriating and I hate the fact that I'm addicted to it
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.720]   and I'm just constantly on there and can't put it down.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:14.600]   But I guess the bigger picture stuff is I'm concerned about where the company is going
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.480]   and where the service is going.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:23.760]   And so as someone who's so attached to it, I'm concerned about where I'm being taken and
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.640]   whether I'm going to regret that at some point.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:30.680]   So it's the company that you dislike.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.880]   I guess it's some of their strategy.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.880]   I mean, I just don't know, you know, it feels to me as though they're, they just want to
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:44.120]   control so much of the content, none of which they create incidentally.
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:49.520]   But they want to control as much as possible of that in order to try and monetize it.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:55.160]   I mean, it was great when monetization wasn't a big deal, then you just let content go wherever
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:58.760]   and it doesn't matter and people can create their own apps and that's great.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:00.800]   But now, you know, the pressure is on.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.680]   You got to come up with, I mean, we talked about Facebook and its IPO.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:08.800]   Twitter might have thought it was going to go public at a huge valuation before.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.200]   They, I don't know if they're still thinking that now.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:18.080]   So the, but the pressure is on to generate cash that, that justifies the huge sort of
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.400]   private market value they have.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.880]   And so they have to monetize it.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.080]   So they're monetizing me and my attention and my content.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.560]   And so they're controlling it and that irritates me.
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:33.640]   I like this part that you said that you hate that it's becoming more of a broadcast network
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.680]   than, than someplace where you actually talk to people.
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.680]   And I think that that's true.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.960]   You know, I got, after we talked about it a couple of shows ago, I actually did get verified
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.960]   by Twitter, which is wonderful.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:43.960]   Thank you, Twitter.
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.640]   But when you, when you get verified, it's interesting.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:51.000]   Like by default, if you go to my profile, you don't see any of my replies to other people.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.320]   You only see tweets, which are not replies, which I think says a lot exactly what you're
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:59.000]   saying that, that Twitter wants us to be kind of a place, a broadcast medium.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   And this is the thing that I, I don't like about Twitter.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.400]   Is it all just feels like, it feels like we're all just sort of standing on the top of mountains,
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.520]   like shouting out into the void about ourselves.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:13.120]   It feels like, well, I mean, it also just feels a sort of like this ego, ego machine,
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:16.360]   but, but that it's, it's really difficult to, to have good conversations.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.440]   And I mean, there, my friends reply to one another a lot, but it's so difficult, even
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:23.480]   with the client tools, to just follow threads of conversations.
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.640]   I mean, that's why, you know, storeify is great, but you need to have somebody who is
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.240]   cares enough about the conversation to actually compile the storeify, you know, to, to keep
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.240]   the conversation.
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.240]   It would not be hard.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.240]   It's computer.
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.240]   It could figure that out.
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.240]   Yeah, it's, yeah.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.240]   It's true.
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:42.320]   Matthew, haven't you talked about how what you think said with Twitter and other posts
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:45.640]   you've written is that it becomes a promotional vehicle for TV?
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:51.360]   And I think, you know, I wrote one post about how two things that Twitter did in quick succession
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:57.200]   really summed up for me, the contrast and the tension and the sort of conflict between
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.280]   the two visions of what Twitter should be for.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:05.960]   And one was shutting down Tumblr, just, you know, you can't use our follower search tool
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.320]   anymore, period.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.800]   The same thing they did to Instagram.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.120]   So that's on the one side.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:15.200]   The other side was bragging about how well the Olympics went because it drove a lot of
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:17.200]   traffic to NBC's prime time.
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.200]   Right.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.240]   So, you know, you've got, here's what we don't want.
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:24.240]   We don't want you to be, you, the user to be able to do useful things with another platform
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.440]   that involves Twitter.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.920]   So stop doing that.
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:31.440]   And on the other side, our friends at NBC just love us because we're pushing eyeballs
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.440]   to prime time.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.760]   Well, that to me, you know, I, do I want to just be a vehicle that pushes eyeballs to
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:37.760]   prime time?
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.760]   I don't know.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:39.760]   I don't think so.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:46.160]   Twitter has become speaker's corner where a lot of crazy people get on boxes and shout.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:47.640]   Mm.
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.840]   Or it's become, let's go with metaphor here.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:56.280]   It's become a street where barkers stand out of their stores and scream at you.
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:02.200]   So my, my big problem with Twitter now is related as I, as whenever I look at the at
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:05.400]   replies, there's so much garage.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.520]   People use it to shout at me.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:11.560]   That is also an interesting, the consequence of being verified.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:14.840]   You get spammed way more, way more instantly.
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:21.160]   Did you get a bunch more followers when you got verified too?
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:25.520]   Because I'm wondering if the spam bots then, you know, no, no, you actually, you get added
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.640]   to or you get followed by Twitter verified.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:30.800]   So I think that they're looking at Twitter verified's followers to see all the people
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.080]   who are verified.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:36.000]   My followers actually state about the same rate of growth.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.200]   But yeah, you definitely get spammed a lot more, which is.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:44.280]   But it means that it's hard to have conversations because it's just, it's become a shouting match.
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:49.720]   And I think that's, you know, to some extent that's a natural phenomenon given the size
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:50.720]   of the network.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.320]   I mean, when, when lots of us started, it was very small.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:59.160]   And I think that's part of what people get out of, say, Google+, or app.net is that it's
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:03.040]   a small network and it's people you know or in some cases know.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.960]   And so it just feels smaller.
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.640]   I think the challenge for Twitter is they're getting big.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.600]   And that's great if you want to sell ads.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.400]   But to some extent it's degrading the user experience.
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:20.080]   And I don't think they're helping by threatening things like Tumblr and Instagram and maybe
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.080]   even Flipboard.
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:24.240]   You know, I just don't think that's for me as a user.
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:25.880]   That's doesn't mean.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:26.880]   I agree.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:30.000]   That was the really interesting conversation that then proceeded after that and you got
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.160]   quoted in it.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:36.880]   Mike Mckue warning that he fears that if Twitter closes down too much too fast, it really
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:37.880]   loses what it is.
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:46.320]   And Fred Wilson came back and answering kind of you both saying that trying to answer
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:50.960]   the question that you posed is can you be a business and be an open network?
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:52.840]   And he said he thinks that you can.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.200]   But the problem he argues for Twitter is that it started to open.
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.200]   Right.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.200]   Right.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.200]   But it's easier to start.
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:00.200]   Hello.
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.200]   It's like the online.
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.200]   It's easier to pay and then give it away free then.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.200]   Give it away for me then pay.
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.200]   Same.
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.200]   I don't know that I buy this.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.680]   But the argument here is that it's easier to be closed and then open up.
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:11.600]   But I don't know that you ever do witness Facebook.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:12.600]   But I think he's right.
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:17.120]   I think Facebook, it was easier for Facebook to do something like the open platform later
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:21.800]   after it had built this huge thing rather than start out wide open, which is what Twitter
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:26.480]   did and then try to close down because I would argue Matthew, but Twitter would never be Twitter
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:27.720]   if it hadn't been open.
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:28.960]   Well, that was my argument too.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:34.120]   I wrote a post today basically, you know, responding to Fred looking at what he said.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:40.120]   Twitter is trying to wind back the clock to sort of rewrite history and say, well, now
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:44.240]   we'd like to be the thing that we could have been if we weren't so open.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:48.880]   But the reality is they never would have gotten to where they are now if they weren't open.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:51.200]   That was what built the network.
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:56.480]   I mean, @replies and hashtags and retweets and everything that is unique about Twitter
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:59.040]   was created by users.
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.040]   They didn't come up with all that stuff.
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.040]   You know what I mean?
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:04.680]   So now they're trying to monetize that and control it.
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:10.760]   But the reality is it wouldn't have existed if they hadn't been open in the first place.
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:14.080]   Can, of course, the question Twitter is asking is, well, okay, fine.
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:16.160]   So let's pull up the latter.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.640]   Can they continue to maintain value or increase value?
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:24.200]   I mean, there's nothing, I understand that morally and ethically it feels bad to be open
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.320]   and then close.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:30.680]   But is it impractical?
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:31.680]   It's practical, isn't it?
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:32.680]   Aren't they going to?
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:33.680]   Sure, it's practical.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:37.920]   So the big question that I don't know the answer to is, and I think we're finding out
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:43.680]   the answer is when you try to wind back that clock and you try to close down or tighten
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:49.160]   down or however you want to describe it, shepherding the ecosystem, I think Jack Dorsey
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:55.720]   calls it, when you do that, can you maintain that value that you built by being open?
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:19:00.840]   Or does that, do you sort of kill the goose that laid the golden egg by trying to restrict
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.840]   it too much?
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:07.080]   Can we think of examples of open things that have closed and survived?
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:11.920]   Are there open source projects that became closed source?
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:12.920]   Are there...
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.920]   That's tough to do.
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:16.720]   I guess not.
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:18.160]   It's almost impossible, I think.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:19.160]   It's almost impossible.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:22.800]   Yeah, you'd have to go to every single contributor and have them agree to change the license of
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:23.800]   the code that they wrote.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.760]   Fork, a non-open version.
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:27.760]   What about...
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:28.760]   Okay, here's an example then.
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:32.920]   I think I've used this before, CDDB, which was an open database that people contributed
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:39.520]   to of music information, which basically sold and became a proprietary system.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.520]   It survived.
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.440]   In fact, it's probably very profitable right now.
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:45.160]   IMDB, same thing, right?
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.560]   It was originally created.
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:50.400]   All the data was created by users.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:53.560]   And then they basically went to commercial operation.
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:20:03.440]   You could kind of argue that Wikipedia is certainly still open, but it's way more difficult
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:08.480]   today to make Wikipedia edit than it was five years ago, just because there's so many
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:11.880]   controls in the computer communities.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:13.360]   So vigilant now.
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:18.280]   Delta F has sent me an article from TechCrunch saying that Oracle is basically trying to
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:20.880]   take MySQL closed.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:21.880]   Interesting.
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:24.160]   But I think they're going to have trouble doing that.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.560]   That's tough.
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:29.400]   I used it as an example in my Twitter post today.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:34.040]   It's a little like Wikipedia, not just closing down or becoming more restrictive, but doing
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:37.640]   that in order to appeal to large brands and sell ads.
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:40.240]   I mean, that changes the whole nature of the experience.
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.240]   But they've...
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:45.640]   Yes, and that would be no longer Wikipedia, and it would absolutely damage them.
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:48.160]   But I don't think Twitter is in the same position as Wikipedia or...
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.160]   I don't know.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.160]   I don't know.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:52.960]   I mean, it's clear that it's...
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.760]   You've got to dance with the one you've rung you.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.520]   It's unethical.
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.760]   It stinks.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.120]   But will users really rebel?
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.120]   I don't think so.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:02.120]   Well, here's the...
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.120]   Here's the...
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.960]   Let me try this example on you.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:08.360]   Moveable type.
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.760]   They were open source.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.240]   They were open and open source.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.240]   Came six apart.
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:15.600]   And then to make it into a business, which we understood.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:20.400]   They had to create a licensing scheme, and you could do that well or do that badly.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:23.320]   And I think that they didn't do that as well as they could have.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:30.720]   And it had a permanent impact on the company and opened up the door for WordPress, which remains...
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.720]   To other examples.
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.720]   WordPress is ingenious to me because...
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:36.880]   And I use this example all the time.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.880]   If you can...
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:43.960]   Who will maintain an open layer and become the first to build it on top of that?
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:50.080]   You will always benefit from it being open because others will contribute to it.
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:52.800]   And you reduce your costs and other things.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:56.680]   And yes, you'll have competitor's building, which is what six apart tried to prevent.
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:02.320]   That's why licensing was onerous because it tried to keep people from building a competitor
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:06.360]   who six aparts own hosted platform.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:11.560]   And I think WordPress learned from that and said, "No, okay, we'll create the open platform.
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:12.560]   We'll leave it open."
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:17.320]   And even when the VC's Polaris called me about this, I only echoed with the founders one of
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.800]   them, "I'm sure when I said no, leave it that way, that's genius.
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.880]   Build a for profit on top of that.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.200]   Be the first to know it."
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:30.400]   So you separate the two, whereas six apart ended up in channel conflict, in community
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.400]   conflict.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.000]   So people said, "Why am I going to contribute to this anymore?"
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.920]   And you're restricting my license horribly here, and I don't like this.
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:39.400]   At the same time, we knew it couldn't get you free forever.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:43.840]   And we agreed, I think as users, that they had to change the structure so that they could
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:44.840]   survive.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:48.600]   Because one of them survived, because we depended upon them because they were a platform.
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.600]   But it's a very tricky shift.
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:54.560]   The two examples that I like to think of are Dig and MySpace.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:23:02.880]   I mean, those were primarily communities, content related communities, but not platforms,
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:05.360]   not technology, not software.
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:11.080]   It was about the community, and Dig effectively ruined its community by trying to monetize
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:18.760]   in the wrong ways, by trying to answer to their VCs or whatever caused the problem.
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.800]   And MySpace arguably did the same thing, ruined the user experience in an attempt to try and
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:23.800]   monetize.
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:25.720]   I think those are the risks for Twitter.
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:29.120]   I'm not saying it's going to happen, just saying that's the risk.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.120]   Yes.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:37.840]   Dig is the poster child, MySpace, the poster child for what not to do.
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:43.320]   The Democratic Party platform includes internet freedom and cybersecurity.
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:47.960]   I know sometimes those might be at odds, I don't know.
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:52.400]   The Democratic platform calls for an internet that is secure and reliable and is respectful
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.800]   of intellectual property.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:58.680]   The free flow of information and privacy.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:07.240]   It's everything anybody would ever want, and then some.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:12.000]   Key provision in the Republican platform released last week was reducing regulations on broadband
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   providers.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   I'm not saying I have a dog in this hunt, but there you go.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000]   Moving on.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.600]   I'm not going to get too political here, but I enjoy those speeches that you two blocked
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.600]   later.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:39.000]   On the political end, there's the story there about why campaign reporters behind the curve
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.400]   is very long, but it's actually very good.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.040]   I liked it a lot.
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.040]   Right.
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:49.160]   Arguing that reporters, and we know reporters during the horse race stuff, this is stupid
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.440]   and ridiculous and wasteful and brings nothing.
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:56.520]   And I've complained about 15,000 correspondents at each convention reporting on absolutely
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.040]   nothing because nothing happens.
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:59.040]   It's all stripped.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:02.320]   It's all infomercial, heavy on the commercial light on them info.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:05.640]   Having said all that, even with all that is criticism.
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:08.880]   This piece argued by Sasha Eisenberg, right?
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:15.440]   Sasha S. Bric says that it's that it's in fact, it's worse than that.
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:19.480]   That the truth is we aren't even that good at covering the horse race.
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:23.760]   Oh, there's very sophisticated data going on to figure out that small portion of the
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:27.920]   population that actually is movable and that they're looking at the campaign within the
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:30.480]   campaign in entirely different ways.
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:32.600]   We're missing that story utterly.
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.840]   It's basically like gaming dig.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:35.840]   Yes.
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:41.120]   It turns out that the electoral college system is highly gameable.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.320]   We know that because I live in a state where it doesn't matter who I vote for.
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.280]   It's done.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:51.520]   So I could just ignore the polls because all of California's electoral votes will go to
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.240]   Obama no matter what I do.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.440]   But there are a few states where it really matters.
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:59.280]   Ohio, Florida.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:05.120]   And so those states, a lot of data is gathered about each individual in those states, much
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.640]   more detailed than one might imagine.
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:13.360]   It's not merely soccer moms or Latino voters.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.560]   It's really deep.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:21.480]   And they quote President Obama's chief pollster, Joel Benenson, who says, "Think of it as
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:23.600]   a level five player in chess."
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.400]   The press is a level five player in chess and a level eight player in chess.
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:32.600]   You have people covering campaigns who are at the mercy of the grandmasters of politics.
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:39.320]   The journalists just don't understand the big data that's going on now in political campaigns.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:41.720]   They miss the story completely.
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.920]   And I think calling them level five is being complimentary.
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.680]   Yes, I agree.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:51.840]   Breathless and often fact-free stories about data mining and micro-targeting soon became
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:52.840]   plentiful.
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:57.800]   But few journalists had access to any of the campaign's actual data or even much understanding
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:03.280]   of the statistical techniques they use.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.280]   It's a really good article.
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:08.680]   I tried to explain it on the radio show and did a miserable job.
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:13.280]   But if you're worried about the targeting and the marketing and the tracking cookies
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:16.520]   that you see day to day, "Hey, this is--"
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:23.480]   This stuff is being applied in political campaigns to great effect and the campaigns are using
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:29.320]   it in, you know, they're playing it like a grandmaster.
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:32.280]   It's very interesting.
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.320]   It is.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:40.680]   Sometimes you know I feel like these campaigns are moronic and sometimes I feel like they're
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:41.680]   very smart.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:43.480]   And I think they're both simultaneously.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:44.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.240]   Or they treat us like morons.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:49.280]   They certainly think we're moronic.
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:50.800]   But in the post-car--
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.160]   Well, you're in Canada.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.160]   I don't know.
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:56.880]   What is the Canadian take on the US election, Matthew?
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:59.880]   I must admit I haven't been paying attention to it that much.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:05.160]   Oh, you're just like an American then.
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:06.160]   But I haven't docked.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:09.800]   I've been following the convention chatter on Twitter.
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:15.240]   That's mainly the way I've been consuming the political news.
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:17.000]   Yeah, 140 characters.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.040]   That'll give you all the depth and detail.
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:22.320]   Well, there's links in there too.
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.320]   There are links.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:31.120]   I just feel like the two-party system, the Electoral College, it just makes it right for
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.120]   gaming.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:34.880]   And of course, all these computer tools are-- that's what they're really good at.
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:40.040]   And you've got a whole generation of younger people, Gena's age now, in there, who know
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:44.080]   how to pull all the levers, and they are doing it.
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.960]   So much of it seems like theater to me.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:47.960]   Do you know it?
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:50.720]   It's absolutely theater.
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:53.360]   And some of the actors are pretty bad.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:56.640]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:59.960]   Come back with your tips, your tools, your picks of the week, and Matthew Ingram, if
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:06.280]   you want to pick something or talk about something you like, you can do that too.
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:10.360]   But first a word from our friends at Toucows, the same folks who bring you Hover.com, which
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.920]   is that great domain name system.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:13.920]   Actually, you know what?
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.120]   I think Toucows, and I talked to Elliott and also CEO there, and I think what they've
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:24.920]   decided is, look, we're going to look for industries that are ripe for reinvention.
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:29.560]   Industries that are just run poorly that somebody who's smart and uses technology properly
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:30.560]   can transform.
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:34.120]   They started that with domain name registration at Hover.com.
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:37.520]   And now they're doing it somewhere where we really need it in the cell phone industry,
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:40.520]   the mobile phone industry, with Ting.com.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:44.400]   When he showed me Ting the first time, I just was so impressed.
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:47.520]   I thought, this is exactly what it should be.
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:53.920]   Big savings, no long-term contracts, billing clarity, so you know what you're paying for
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:57.400]   and you get exactly what you're paying for without the penalties.
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:01.520]   And just complete usability, ting.com.
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:02.800]   It's a belt on the Sprint network.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:07.560]   So if you have good Sprint coverage where you are, this is a very good choice.
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:13.160]   And just go to Ting.com and look at the plans and you'll see how it works.
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:16.360]   At first you might say, oh, this is like any cell phone carrier.
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:19.520]   You pick how many minutes and messages and data you want.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:21.960]   And then you have any phones you want.
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:22.960]   This is kind of nice.
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:25.080]   You pay $6 per phone per month.
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:29.040]   So as many phones as you want, great for families or small businesses.
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:33.760]   So let's say we're going to have four phones and I'm going to say, well, the four of us
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:34.760]   will share.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:40.840]   I'll share 2,000 minutes, say 1,000 text messages and three gigs of data.
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:44.920]   And that will cost for all four of us, 124 bucks a month.
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:45.940]   But here's the beauty part.
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:51.400]   If you don't use three gigs of data, let's say you use two, they'll rebate you the $18
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:52.400]   difference.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:55.960]   Let's say instead of 1,000 text messages, you do 6,000.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:56.960]   There's no penalty.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:59.640]   They just charge you the difference.
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:03.400]   So you're paying for exactly what you get without penalties.
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:06.720]   You are credited or to charge the difference based on actual usage.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.120]   That's what you get billed.
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:12.320]   You always get four free voicemail, picture and video messaging, three-way calling, caller
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:16.640]   ID, tethering and hotspotting.
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:18.440]   So that's all built in.
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:19.920]   They are not blocking you.
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:22.400]   Now they've got a broad variety of devices.
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.360]   They even have ways you can bring your own devices.
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:25.840]   It's a little more complicated.
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:27.240]   So you got it because it's a sprint network.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:30.200]   They do have the Galaxy S3, which is very nice.
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:33.840]   The Photon Q, and even feature phones.
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:35.600]   So you can save.
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:38.360]   They also have, and this is really good, dated devices.
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:46.760]   So you can use their 3G and 4G networks at the same affordable, straightforward pricing.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:47.920]   I am really a fan.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:55.320]   If you go to ting.com/twig, play with the online savings calculator, you'll save $50
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:59.960]   on your phone, $50 right off the top.
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:06.320]   Well I want you to discover this because this is the beginning of how I think using technology,
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:11.960]   appropriately, modern billing systems and so forth can really change the cell phone industry.
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:15.560]   Folks of two cows are doing a ting, another nice Canadian company.
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:18.240]   It's funny, they don't offer this in Canada yet.
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:23.280]   I think the system in Canada doesn't work that way.
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:28.960]   But it's interesting that working with Sprint as an MVNO and Sprint is very interested and
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.880]   very supportive of what they're doing.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.560]   No contracts.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:38.320]   Ting.com/twig.
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:39.880]   I like this.
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:40.880]   Moms ride free.
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:48.160]   If she uses her phone once a month, like my mom at the airport, you just get her a phone,
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:54.760]   like six bucks for the phone and her minutes and stuff, you know, are pooled in with yours.
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:55.760]   So she uses it once a month.
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:58.040]   It's six bucks a month.
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:32:59.040]   I'm not being bought a boom.
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.280]   I actually got to do that for my mom.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:03.360]   I've been reading this for months and I didn't even think of that.
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:04.440]   I love it.
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:07.200]   No overage penalties.
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:11.480]   You can use as much data as you want by the way.
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:15.000]   And it's consistently linear billing.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.880]   You get credits on light months, multiple devices on one plan, great for families and
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:22.760]   small businesses, no fees or limits on usage.
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:25.760]   Just exactly what you see is what you get.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.560]   EasyWig cell phone service.
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:28.920]   It's a revolution.
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:33.840]   Ting.com/twig, say 50 bucks on your phone.
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:41.440]   And thank you, Elliot Nossen, two cows for trying to make sense out of this crazy business.
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:43.880]   Gina Trapani, your tool.
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:45.680]   I'm sorry, tip of the week.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:46.840]   Tip of the week.
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:51.760]   Google spreadsheets added in line discussions per cell.
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:53.880]   So you can right-click on a cell.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:54.880]   I don't know about you.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:55.880]   I use the spreadsheets all the time.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:59.600]   If I'm my co-founder and I are always making spreadsheets for our business.
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:05.760]   Now you can leave comments on a sheet before, but now on a particular cell you can, if
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:11.440]   you right-click on it and choose insert comments, you can add comments, you can reply to comments.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:16.040]   And you can even, like @ment plus mention someone, I should say.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.440]   Do you do plus their email address to give them a mom?
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:19.440]   That's sweet.
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:22.560]   Does that share the spreadsheet with them?
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:25.880]   I think it's for people who the spreadsheet has already shared with.
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:31.160]   So you can, because they get a notification that they have a comment.
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:35.440]   So yeah, just a little kind of upgrade, but I was excited about it because it's nice that
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.760]   you can kind of...
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:39.760]   Oops.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:48.080]   She got disconnected right at the very last word of her tip.
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:49.080]   And now here...
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:56.080]   We'll get her back.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:00.080]   You remember that happens, I think it's my connections right now.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:02.080]   There she is.
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:03.080]   No, that's all right.
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:04.080]   Skype crashed.
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.080]   Skype crashed.
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:06.800]   I couldn't handle the Google spreadsheet action.
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:08.720]   It was too good of a tip.
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:11.080]   It was too hot for Skype.
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.080]   Yeah.
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.840]   Sorry about that.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:15.000]   So Royal Kingdom.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.960]   I don't know how big this survey is, but they looked at demographics of various social networks.
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:22.520]   Unfortunately, Google Plus is not included.
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:25.640]   And some of it, obviously we're going to know in terms of ages.
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:29.080]   55% of Twitter users are 35 or older.
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:33.360]   79% of LinkedIn users are 35 or older.
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:38.680]   Turning it around, 58% of Reddit users are 35 or under.
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:39.680]   And so on, right?
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:42.280]   Orchid, 83% are under 35.
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:43.280]   Okay.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.280]   So that's fine.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.240]   What's not needed me was the gender distribution.
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:53.080]   I think we still assume that the net and the geeks here on are male.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:57.440]   But in the services they looked at, most of them are majority female.
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:04.120]   Pinterest, Goodreads, Blogger, Tag, Tumblr, MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, WordPress.com, Yelp,
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:11.320]   Flickr, StumbleUpon, LinkedIn even, LiveJournal are all majority female.
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:17.220]   Quora, Reddit, orchid, GitHub, Stack Overflow, Hacker News and slash.
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:18.920]   None of those is a surprise.
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:26.120]   So this is not the domain of testosterone anymore.
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:27.120]   Interesting.
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.920]   Or should I say, interesting.
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:29.920]   Interesting.
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:34.480]   BuzzFeed just did that piece about app.net and medium and subtle being mostly white male.
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:35.480]   I don't know.
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:37.800]   So I guess that those are kind of newer apps.
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:38.800]   They're developers.
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:39.800]   It's developers.
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:43.600]   Just like Stack Overflow, Hacker News and slash.
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:48.160]   GitHub, orchid, orchid, Reddit.
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:51.760]   DV and art is more female than males.
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:53.440]   That surprises me a little bit.
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000]   But not much.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000]   The biggest one has been dressed.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.360]   That doesn't surprise me.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:00.360]   No.
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:03.360]   Blogger is big female.
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:06.480]   Tumblr, big female, MySpace.
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:07.480]   I like this.
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:09.920]   It's interesting.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.120]   And it makes sense.
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:22.800]   That's a png, png, royal.pngdom.com, P-I-N-G-D-O-M.
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:27.320]   I hesitate to do this as my tool of the week, but I'm going to anyway, just to make people
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:28.320]   angry.
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:30.480]   Oh, Leo's trolling.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:31.840]   I'm trolling.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:37.360]   Have you ever used Bing on your Android phone?
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:38.600]   So it's funny.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:41.400]   Actually, this kind of bugs me when Google does it too.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:46.480]   Bing widget looks just like the Google widget as if you could type something in this field.
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:49.440]   It's got Bing and then it's got a field and then a microphone.
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:50.440]   You can't?
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:51.440]   No.
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:52.440]   You can't with Google either.
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.600]   You tap it and it just opens up the thing.
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.640]   You could make the widget a lot smaller, gang.
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:59.800]   That's a lot of wasted white space up there.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:04.440]   But it does have the voice thing, Gina Trappani.
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.480]   It does a pretty good job.
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:11.760]   I have to say it is a very, very easy, nice interface.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:17.440]   The official website, Wikipedia, Google+, Smarterware, Twitter.
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:20.320]   It does everything you'd expect it to do.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:24.200]   It's got the pretty Bing pictures, images, videos, maps.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:27.560]   You know what?
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:32.560]   If you want Windows Phone on your Android phone, just put this on here and you get all
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:36.440]   the benefits of Windows Phone, including Bing searches.
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:38.520]   Big game is search and all of that stuff.
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:42.240]   You know that widget thing, that's an Android widget design thing.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:44.800]   When I was building a widget, it's so funny.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:46.800]   There are all these over and over and over.
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:47.800]   You have to do that.
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:48.800]   Like filled with questions.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:50.280]   Like how do I put a text input field in my Android widget?
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:51.560]   And the answer is you cannot.
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:53.760]   You cannot put text input fields in your Android widget.
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:56.560]   The ones that have them are just a launcher.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.800]   It's a lie.
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:05.440]   But the thing is this could be a lot smaller because I know it just...
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:06.520]   I have a resize thing.
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:09.120]   I wonder, let me see if this will...
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:12.680]   Maybe I could just do it unofficially resize it.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:13.680]   Make it...
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:14.680]   Oh yeah, I could.
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:15.680]   There you go.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:16.680]   That's what it should look like.
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:22.360]   It reminds me of those early web banner ads where it looked like there was something you
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:23.760]   could type into a field.
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:24.760]   Right.
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:25.760]   All they wanted you to do was click.
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:26.760]   Yes.
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:27.760]   Click.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:30.160]   So, you know, Bing is free.
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:33.160]   You know, it's just one more thing you could do whatever they want.
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:34.160]   They could do whatever they want.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.160]   I just think...
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.160]   I think it's kind of...
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:37.160]   I kind of like it.
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:38.160]   I put it...
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:39.680]   I just thought I'm going to be really, you know, counter...
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:44.400]   Instead of having the Google thing at the top of my Android phone, I have a Bing.
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:45.640]   Just why not?
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:47.680]   Give Microsoft some love, you know?
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:50.160]   They've been feeling lonely lately.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:52.160]   Out there in space.
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:53.160]   Bing.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:54.160]   Bing.
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:58.640]   That's very contrarian of me.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:39:59.640]   I love that.
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:00.640]   But it's good.
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:01.640]   You know what?
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:02.640]   It's actually a very good search.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:04.800]   Some nice features to it.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.280]   I use Dr.Ko, so...
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:07.280]   Yeah.
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:08.280]   They don't have a widget.
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:13.000]   Let's give Dr.Ko some love.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000]   Matthew, do you have anything?
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.600]   A pick, a tip, a number?
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:18.200]   Anything you'd like to share with us?
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:24.200]   Just one thing on what Gina mentioned about Google Spreadsheets, I saw that if you use
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.800]   this, then that, you've heard of that.
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:27.800]   Love IFT.
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:29.320]   F-T or whatever it is.
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:35.920]   So you can actually program things to insert stuff into a spreadsheet in Google Drive automatically.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:36.920]   Oh.
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:37.920]   Yeah.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:40.360]   Oh, Riley wrote something about it today.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:41.360]   Oh.
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:42.360]   Oh.
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:43.360]   Wow.
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:44.360]   Which I thought was really interesting.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:46.400]   That might be the most exciting thing that's happened to me all day.
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:48.880]   You can use that because you know why?
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:49.880]   Yeah.
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:51.120]   You know why Chad's so excited about that?
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:52.120]   That's the spreadsheet.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:54.200]   Pinboard works in with, with, if this and that.
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:55.200]   Right.
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:58.840]   You share your links and then you could populate the spreadsheet automatically.
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:00.760]   Literally, this made my day.
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:03.400]   You just gave Chad eight hours more a day.
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:04.400]   That's my question.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:07.760]   I will send you links throughout the week, Chad, that end up on the, on the rundown.
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:08.760]   That'd be great.
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:09.920]   Yeah, we can do that.
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:10.920]   All right.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:11.920]   Let's all coordinate.
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:12.920]   Okay.
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:14.080]   There'll be an email coming out.
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:17.560]   Maybe I'll make a Google Doc about it and then we can share some links to it and then you
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:21.240]   could, you know, you could, for instance, monitor Jeff's Twitter feed and if he put hashtag
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:25.200]   twig, then you would take that and put it into the spreadsheet.
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:26.200]   Right.
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:27.200]   Boo.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:28.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:33.760]   So as Matthew Ingram says of giga home, senior writer at giga home.
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:34.760]   Great to have you, Matthew.
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:35.960]   Thanks for having me.
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:37.040]   Really love having you on the show.
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:39.120]   Are those boxing gloves on the door behind you?
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:44.240]   They sure are just in case things get, you know, a little heated in here.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:45.240]   Wow.
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:46.240]   Wow.
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:47.240]   I'm impressed.
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:48.240]   Nice to have you.
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:53.480]   Jeff Jarvis, city, university of New York, buzz machine.com.
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:55.480]   Great to have you.
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:58.040]   He's so quiet.
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:41:59.280]   I was looking up.
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:03.320]   I just wanted to note here another, another number of the Glee premieres on September 13th.
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:05.720]   The award-winning fans.
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:10.160]   Wiz, Wiz, special guest star.
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:13.880]   Oh, I didn't hear about this.
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:16.360]   I can't remember, but it was good.
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:17.360]   Uh oh.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.320]   Who's on, who's on Glee?
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:21.800]   I saw the promo for it.
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:24.160]   I can't remember who it is now.
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:27.960]   If you search Glee season premiere, I think you get the promo.
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:31.840]   This is a bad sign because the chatroom's not jumping in.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:37.080]   Oh, Britney Spears is definitely going to, I think they're going to do a Britney episode.
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:38.080]   They did that.
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.080]   They've done that before.
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:40.080]   They did it before.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.080]   Is it Kate Hudson?
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:42.080]   I don't think that's it.
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.080]   Uh, just go to a fox.com/glee.
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:45.080]   It has a video there.
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:46.880]   I don't know what it is.
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:49.560]   I thought it was somebody more interesting than that.
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:50.560]   I am.
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:51.560]   I'm very honest.
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:52.560]   She's a dancer.
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:53.560]   She's a dancer.
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:54.560]   All right.
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:55.560]   Anyway, Kate Hudson.
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:56.560]   Sorry.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:57.560]   Sorry.
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:58.560]   Thanks a lot.
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:01.120]   He's derailed the conversation.
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:02.120]   I got to say it.
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:03.120]   I specialize in that.
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:04.120]   I delight in it.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.600]   You know, aren't they all like 40 years old now?
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:08.200]   They're all like in college.

[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:13.120]   They're getting out of medical school.
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:17.200]   They're too old to be teenagers.
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:22.680]   Uh, Gina Trapani is that, uh, I like, I like how she writes it in her, uh, in her
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:23.920]   Twitter bio.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:27.520]   I think I got to go back to that now.
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:30.360]   Cause I was looking at it and I thought, and by the way, where did you get that great
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:31.360]   picture of you?

[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:56.640]   Thanks.
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:59.720]   We did it.
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:03.520]   We do this show every Wednesday, one PM Pacific, four PM Eastern time.
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:09.200]   Two, two, three, two, one, 12, 13, 2000 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:12.920]   You do do watch live cause then you could be in the chat room and yell at me.
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:17.800]   And if you decide, and if you decide not to watch live, well, you can also download the
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:22.640]   shows after the fact we make on demand audio and video available at twit.tv/twig and you
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:25.040]   could yell at me then.
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:27.840]   But you know, it was interesting because we were discussing yesterday and our B.E.D.
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:32.400]   the executive committee was meeting and we were discussing thinking about changing the
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:38.120]   theme song and we came to the conclusion that however, dopey, our theme song is, it
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:40.480]   is our theme song.
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:42.400]   It's true.
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:46.960]   So we've decided not despite, well, somebody submitted a fun theme song, but I listened
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:49.400]   to it and I thought it's just like every other theme song.
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:50.800]   We have a unique theme song.
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:51.960]   It's dopey.
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:52.960]   It's recorders.
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:53.960]   But it's us.
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:54.960]   It's ours.
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:57.120]   So we're going to keep it.
