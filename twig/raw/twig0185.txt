[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:58.760]   I want to say that right up front because I don't want you to be disappointed when we actually mentioned things like Twitter, Facebook and other stuff.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.760]   Gina Trepani is off this week but we've doubled up.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.760]   We've doubled down.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:11.760]   Jeff Jarvis is here, Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York, the author of What Google Do and his latest public parts.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.760]   Hi Jeff, good to see you.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.760]   Hi there, thank you.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:22.760]   And Jeff invited us to replace Gina just for today with Lauren Weinstein who is wow.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.760]   Lauren is, let me say this up front.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.760]   Lauren is, I'm glad Lauren and I finally get to meet here but he is my favorite person on Google+ period.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.760]   Full stop.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.760]   It's a master of the form.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:47.760]   You have people like Elgin who do really well writing and posting that kind of stuff but Lauren uses Google+ I think perfectly for linking conversation, adding value and he's really smart and has a great history and that is all kind of stuff.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.760]   So I've been dying to meet Lauren one way or the other because we often also agree a lot and so just a way to meet finally.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.760]   Hello Lauren.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.760]   Welcome.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.760]   Very nice finally meeting you and I think I should leave now.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.760]   It's only downhill.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.760]   And also, I mean when I said double down I meant it.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:16.760]   We also have Kevin Marks joining us, former Googler, former Apple employee, one of the guys behind QuickTime and early proponent of podcasting who is now working for Salesforce.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.760]   It's great to have you Kevin and your crows.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.760]   Adley, a stag twig this week but Gina we'll be back next week.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.760]   Yeah, we don't.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   We're gender blind here.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.760]   We don't know what's under the table.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.760]   We don't care.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.760]   Could be anything.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.760]   Are you talking about my prostate again?
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:49.760]   I'm walking in the door and I'm thinking today I'm thinking I think at some point I crossed this Rubicon I am now entering old age and I thought the only person I know who would understand when I say that is Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.760]   Thanks a lot.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.760]   I'm going to make you lunch.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:05.760]   I'm walking a little slower and then I find myself wearing the kind of hat my grandfather would have worn and I thought when did I get to be an old man? When did that when that exactly that.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.760]   We're not going to be good in the kind of commercials we get on CNN at all.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.760]   No thank God we're not there yet.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.760]   Good news.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.760]   Good news.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.760]   Our commercials are all stuff young people would be interested in.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   Let's start talking about the news.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.760]   There's quite a bit to talk about but I think with Lauren here there'll be a lot of discussion about a free internet.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.760]   Here's my hat.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.760]   Thank you.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.760]   I want to see this.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760]   So there's two ways I can go with this.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760]   I got this in Nolens.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.760]   There's two ways I can go the Hunt's Hall Leo Goresy Bowery voice look.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.760]   See only Jeff knows what I'm talking about there or I can do the snap brim and then I don't know what I am.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.760]   I'm an old man.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.760]   You are.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.760]   Well isn't this like a breaking bad thing now?
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.760]   Well it's not quite you know it's interesting you should say that because he wears kind of a jazz hat with a narrower brim.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.760]   It's very similar to telescope brim called a what's it called I can't remember now.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.760]   Pork pie.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   Pork pie.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.760]   Thank you.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   He wears a pork pie.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.760]   This is not quite a pork pie.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.760]   So I got a pork pie.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.760]   Leo Leo how many drinks did you have before you bought that?
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:24.760]   I had a number of primary colored beverages named after weather phenomenon.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.760]   Chief leader.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.760]   Chief leader Hurricane I believe there was a tornado a lightning storm a hail storm.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.760]   I don't know what the hell I was drinking.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.760]   It is fun in Nolens.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.760]   That was a lot of fun.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.760]   I'm glad to be back though because that's hard work.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.760]   The Google Reader Pocalypse is upon us.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.760]   Google Feed Reading Service Unusable.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.760]   It's working fine for me.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.760]   Since Sunday this is what TechCrunch says.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.760]   I didn't have any problems and I used to toss it.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.760]   I think it does this every now and then it has little burps in posting lots of things that are new.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.760]   But obviously Sarah had trouble with it.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.760]   I didn't have trouble with it at that point but I see this now and then.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.760]   I get the same thing in my blog.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:13.760]   There's some blog that links to me in my, in it's from its sidebar which means every post they post shows up as a comment on every post on my blog which is kind of annoying.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.760]   So Google has kind of not paid a lot of attention to Reader.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:24.760]   I think some of the experiments with sharing in Reader made it to Google+.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.760]   But do people really do people still have a standalone news reader or they still?
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.760]   No, I use Jashik Reader every day but I'm old and weird.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.760]   So the thing with Reader is that it doesn't have many users but it has huge numbers of intensity.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:47.760]   When I was at Google, we had weekly stats meetings for Marissa and one of them was,
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.760]   "Oh yeah, Reader has the highest number of pages for users but no users."
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.760]   [laughter]
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:07:02.760]   Every day, every week along with Orkut has the highest number of page views in search which was one of those things that everyone.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.760]   What do you do with a product like that that has a small number of highly devoted fans?
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.760]   It's kind of like Twit.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.760]   Well, it depends who you are.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.760]   If you're a startup, then you say, "I'll charge them 10 bucks each and you're fine."
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.760]   That's how pinboard works.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.760]   If you're Google, you're like, "Well, this is mass marketing for us.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.760]   We'll take the engineers off it and make them do something else."
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:30.760]   It's the way I follow the news all the time but what I worry about more is that more and more sites are dropping their RSS feeds.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.760]   So RSS dies, then Reader follows.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:40.760]   It's the other way around is that Reader is also used as a back end by lots of people because it's hosted by Google and is reliable.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.760]   So lots of sites use it for feed sync.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:53.760]   I've forgotten his name, the guy who wrote the original Mac feed reader where the poster said, "Warning, when this falls over, a bunch of things are going to stop working because..."
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.760]   Or in Brickter or somebody else?
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.760]   No.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.760]   I'm getting old.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.760]   Okay, so that's our team today, the old fart show.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.760]   We can't remember stuff because we put it on the computer and now it's gone.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.760]   Do you, Lauren, does it bother you?
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.760]   I see it.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.760]   I see it.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.760]   It's a social network that's been discontinued.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.760]   Certainly some sites don't do RSS.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.760]   More of those sites don't just do excerpts on RSS.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.760]   Don't put the complete article on there.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.760]   Does that bother you?
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:28.760]   It doesn't bother me so much as long as there's enough there for me to find out whether I have an interest in the article or not.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.760]   And then you click and go to the site.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.760]   And then I click on it.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.760]   I'm perfectly happy to give people clicks.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.760]   I mean, I don't object to that.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:41.760]   And there's some sites that don't include the whole articles just because they're afraid no one will ever visit the site if they see it all RSS.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.760]   I don't have a problem there.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.760]   One of the worst is if there's just a headline, that's a problem.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.760]   Fox News does that, but of course there's no good reason to ever.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.760]   Well, and the headlines at Fox News are deceptive.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   I mean, you just can't tell what the article's going to be from the headline.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.760]   And that's why they only put headlines.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.760]   Right.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.760]   You might want to click this and find out what we're really talking about.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.760]   Well, that's sort of what that, you know, that's what RSS started out as.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.760]   And that's, and then we grew it into like long form posts.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.760]   You know, it was originally a thing for sending headlines around.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.760]   Oh, really?
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   It was originally built for Netscape for the Netscape homepage.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.760]   And you could put a feed up and it would give you a little sidebar of things to click through to.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.760]   That was the very first version of RSS.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.760]   And then.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.760]   Really?
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.080]   And then Dave, Dave Weiner picked it up and said, oh, this goes with this blogging thing that
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.760]   we're trying to make sense of.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.880]   And, and, and evangelize that and got everyone else to adopt it.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:41.120]   And then blogs were for a long time, these pages that you basically had a page a day.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.120]   And it was a set of links.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.120]   And it looked like tweets.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.120]   Right.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.680]   If you go back to the archives of, you know, old blogs, they didn't have titles.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.320]   Like waxy links and stuff like that.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.520]   Waxy links and like the old scripting news, if you look at them and days point if you want
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.200]   it was, I'll edit this during the day and end of the day.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.000]   I'll have it and start a new one tomorrow.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Right.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.200]   And then I think it was moveable type that came up with the one page per post thing.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.960]   And that meant that you had a presumption of a headline and a story.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.720]   Or was also a permalink, the permalink as page.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.200]   Permalink is page.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:21.040]   Yes, as opposed to permanent as, what do you call it?
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.040]   Hashtag.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.040]   Hashtag.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.040]   Hashtag.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.040]   Hashtag.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.040]   Hashtag.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.040]   Hashtag.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.040]   And it's a very cool thing within a time based page.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.040]   Right.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.960]   You know, it's funny because hacker news has always bugged me because they're one of the
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:37.200]   sites that only puts the headlines in, you know, here's an interesting thing, Leo.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.480]   I love hacker news.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.920]   I wish I could see excerpts.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.920]   There's a company that I work with called that has a product called repost.us that makes
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:52.400]   articles embeddable like a YouTube video traveling with brand advertising analytics and
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   links.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.400]   Very, very interesting.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.640]   One thing they've found is that there's very little overlap as a rule.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.160]   They work with companies like Ojon's France Press and NJ.com where I work with, and there's
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.440]   very little overlap in the creators audience to the embedders audience.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.720]   So you get new audience.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.080]   Here's the interesting thing.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.280]   You have the full article there with your own ads and your own brand and everything else,
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.280]   right?
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.440]   And you don't lose any SEO.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.600]   The click through rate from a full article to the originator site is running five to seven
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.600]   percent.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.880]   It's very high, which says that your content is your best ad.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.360]   If you read the whole article, you're more likely to click through than if you just read
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.360]   a snippet.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.760]   That's bizarre because you've seen the whole article.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.760]   You might, what you're saying is, gee, you got a sister like this.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.560]   I want to see more.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.560]   Right?
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.560]   Right.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.160]   And so you have in, here we go, folks, get ready, get ready, get ready.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160]   We have in Germany the Leistung Schutzrecht.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.240]   Where is the reggae when we need it?
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.240]   I know.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.880]   Where they're trying, you got to have Fred from the Howard Stern show already.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.800]   Where they're trying to argue that snippets are too much and snippets are theft and all
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.800]   this kind of stuff.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:06.240]   What you find out from repost on us is that the whole content is a better cause or of
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.240]   links.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.240]   And we found that out in the RSS days.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:16.120]   We're putting out your whole feed, sounded ridiculously illogical, but we found that,
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.960]   you know, in blogs and the Guardian and places like that found that putting out the whole
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.840]   feed was actually better for you.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.840]   Right.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.320]   Well, there's a sort of corollary here, which has been striking me continuously for a while,
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.800]   which is that citation used to be, here's a compact way of referring to something so
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.760]   you can go and look it up somewhere else.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.280]   And there's a long-going debate about how you do citation on the web, which is in the
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.520]   hyperlink, how you cite things that don't have URLs for a long time.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.960]   And it's now become very, very clear that the way you cite something reliably is to
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:53.000]   quote it, because if you search for the quote, that's unique enough you'll find the original
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.880]   and the other people who posted it too.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.240]   So there's this sort of weird thing where the citation becomes the quotation and vice
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.240]   versa.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:06.920]   Do it, is it really important to maintain RSS feeds in Google Reader in an era where
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:13.000]   people are using Twitter in a way as their feed, their link generation?
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Isn't that why RSS is kind of...
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:22.280]   I think there needs to be some way to have a feed that comes direct from the source.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:28.840]   And what kind of it does, if I follow the economist on Twitter, it's more of a curated
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.600]   feed from the economist.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:36.720]   Right, but if we're concerned that headlines are too short and a whole article is best,
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.840]   where does that leave us when you have 140 characters to work with?
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.160]   Well what if Twitter starts putting excerpts to the articles or maybe that thing you were
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.360]   talking about, Jeff, in line in its website?
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.360]   Yeah, they are doing that.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:53.120]   But here's the other thing, RSS, a lot of services that like Newscred or Daylife before
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:58.320]   it, they use RSS as the means to get alerted that there's a new headline and to be able
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.040]   to take the content not for display purposes but for analytical purposes.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:09.920]   So you can do things like then cluster articles into stories like Google News does.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.040]   I don't know how Google News, they probably scrape because they're good at scraping.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:19.360]   But a lot of other sites use RSS as a means to get a true feed for back-end purposes too.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.640]   It's funny, after...
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.400]   There are many ways of doing that right.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.200]   We have H. Adam, which is a way to mark up your web page to say this is the structure
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.560]   you would expect from a feed with classes.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.440]   We did a microformate for that five years ago.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:38.400]   And there are new things in the latest HTML5 spec that are designed to make it easier for
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.600]   you to do that.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.520]   But the tension is you don't always want people to pull your content out without taking the ad.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.520]   So there's a sort of...
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.120]   The HTML5 you can mark stuff as nav and aside.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:55.040]   And there's now main and then there's a whole series of section and header things that you can do
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:00.240]   to make your page easier to parse for things like feed readers and readability and stuff like that.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:05.440]   But the challenge is there's a tension there between, no, I want you to take my ads too,
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.760]   please stop trying to deconstruct my page.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.800]   So there's always a back and forth between the two.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.040]   But if you actually want parsability, we've got H. Adam, we've got HNews,
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:20.160]   which is an extension of H. Adam with focus on news publishing.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.720]   So it has bylines and it has datelines and the things that you need for news.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:32.560]   It's perfectly possible to do this, but the debate is on the legitimacy of parsing a web page
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.760]   with something other than a browser.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.320]   And that's the thing we're kind of losing.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.520]   When Google started out, they could write a web search in because the present was,
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.280]   you could crawl the web with anything.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.400]   And if you try and do that now, it's actually very hard.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.440]   If you try and crawl Facebook with something that isn't a browser,
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.040]   it says go away and get yourself a browser.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.320]   You're using something we don't support.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:02.480]   And many sites now have robots.txt setups that only allow Google bots and not other crawlers.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.640]   So if you're trying to build something like, I bought a technorati or
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:12.720]   spinner of built or a bunch of these, or any kind of public web crawler,
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.160]   it's much harder now than it was 10, 15 years ago.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.480]   Because the sites are now explicitly have a very different world view.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.200]   And they're trying to make the web not as callable as they were.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.960]   The good news is Google says, as of last night, users began noticing issues with the Google reader.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.120]   They have now been resolved for everyone who was affected.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.880]   We apologize. And you're right, it's all working.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.680]   And then I went to Google Reader, I thought, oh, I forgot how great this is.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.160]   It started scanning articles.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.760]   The other thing Google Reader is really good for, and this is the subtle thing,
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.800]   is the search box at the top is a search that's constrained to the things that you followed,
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.080]   which is really useful for the, I read that thing, where the hell was it, type searches.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:58.000]   Well, the truth is, I used to have, I still have, in my reader, a huge list of feeds,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.480]   probably 80 or 100. The truth is, I use it for number one, my ego searches.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.680]   And number two, three or four feeds of things that I go to regularly.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.800]   And I've reduced immensely my use. What about you guys?
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:16.560]   I have a folder called Top, underscore Top, in fact, that there's a bunch of things that are
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.720]   up, not very often, that I want to make sure I catch.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:25.360]   And I have a bunch of comics that I, you know, I check in every day and read the comics,
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.240]   XKCD and Dilbert and questionable content, Calvin and Hobbes.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.760]   And then I have a bunch of other blogs that I want to know when they update,
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.560]   and they're in my top list, then the rest of them are in another folder, which I don't read,
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.000]   but it's there so that when I try to, I want to try and, so that,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.920]   I want to remember where I read something, it's got all the tech news sites and stuff.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.400]   So I can use Reader Search to find the story, because we just search the session.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.280]   Lauren, you're, you're, you're, you're, this is me off, but you're off on the head of me,
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.080]   and finding a headline that I want to link to too. And so I like to you,
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.200]   where are you finding the stuff? What's your habit?
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.880]   Most of the Google Reader.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.320]   Interesting.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.760]   I have a real long list, and I've gotten real good at scanning through it fast.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.600]   I probably miss things from time to time.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.400]   And I just start starring, and then I go back, and when I see things that are interesting,
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:22.000]   I pull them out. But I'd say probably 75% of those kinds of items are coming from Google Reader.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.040]   I find it amazing that Kevin Marks, Google Reader, still gave me
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.600]   him new Calvin and Hobbs episodes. I really want to, I need that feed.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:35.840]   They're old ones, but they can't round again. There's enough Calvin Hobbs episodes that I'm old enough.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.560]   Can I have a comment?
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.520]   I'm about to come back.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:44.160]   We're going to take a break. We're going to come back with more. We, what a good panel.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.040]   I, you know, chat room, if you've got some stuff you'd like to talk about,
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:53.360]   Lauren Weinstein's blog is fabulous. Lauren, L-A-U-R-E-N.Vortex.com.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.200]   And we could just go through the articles here and find enough to talk about
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.760]   for this week. But anything.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.560]   And Google plus feed too, you get good stuff.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.680]   Yeah, I started fine. Lauren, you don't have a header. You just have a blank in your Google plus
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.360]   at the top there. It's just a white space.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.440]   Right. There's no, there's no photo there.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.160]   That's intention.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.080]   It's a photo of white.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.320]   Yes. In fact, when I click on it, that's what I get is,
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.120]   is it something about snow? What's going on?
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:27.120]   It's emptiness. It's emptiness. But, yeah, I mean, one day I'll put something there,
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.120]   but I like it. It's just a big blank. And when you click it, you get blank.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.080]   Yeah, it was harder to set up than you might think, actually.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.720]   Was it? Really wants you to put something real in there.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:42.480]   Yeah, they do. I was just wondering if there was something, you're making a statement with that.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.440]   It's not terribly cosmic. No. It's just like white space.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.080]   It's either that or some kind of obnoxious animated GIF, I guess.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.120]   Yeah, that's the problem. What could you put there that would be?
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.280]   The New York Times. You know, this great, the great
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.400]   Twitter account, NYD on it.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.120]   Yes. Which finds all the trends stories one minute ago.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:10.400]   Guys, GIFs are very popular on the internet. And the times is on it.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.800]   [laughter]
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:19.120]   We are going to come back with more in just a bit, but first a word from our friends at Citrix.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.760]   They have a new product they want to let you know about. Actually, company they recently acquired
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.240]   that really does. The more I use it, the more I like. The problem is, it's very difficult to
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:35.200]   describe what it does. So really, the message here is sign up for PODEO for free, PODEO.com,
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:41.920]   create your first workspace, and start playing with it. The idea is to use a central spot on the
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:47.760]   web that combines all the information that you need in your work. Things like files, email.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:54.400]   You could even have a feed that's kind of like a Twitter feed, a company feed. I'm going to log
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.720]   into our PODEO account here for the Twitch network. We've been using this more and more. We just
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:04.320]   really like it. You can sign in with Google plus Facebook, Twitter, of course. It will incorporate
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:13.040]   your Google information like contacts and so forth. It just becomes a very wonderful repository
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:19.280]   of information. We have a Twig account in PODEO. We have this week in Tech Account. I've set up,
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:24.720]   and we're going to start inviting people to our editorial advisory board inside here in PODEO.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:30.640]   The PODEO is, again, hard to describe, but it's all the information that you currently have in a
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:35.680]   bunch of different places in one spot. Your Google documents, including word processing,
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:43.760]   spreadsheets, email, combined and managed. You've got great back and forth instant communication,
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:49.200]   better than email. Workflow is managed. Completely can customize it. They have workspaces for every
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:55.200]   possible team and project. It's not exactly a project manager either, although you could use
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:04.160]   it for that. I think it's something you would just use day in, day out. PODEO.com. The activity stream
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:10.400]   is a really nice feature, by the way. It shows what's going on in the workspaces and what's happening.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:16.720]   We have a workspace called Make I as Join PODEO. One of these days.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:27.280]   Tom Merritt is the lead I as enforcer. You can use it for silly things too. PODEO.com. Get in there,
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.520]   sign up. It's free. Create your first workspace. Invite your team to get started. I think you'll
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.600]   be impressed with what you can do with PODEO. Share your PODEO experience with me. Let me know
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.880]   what you're doing with PODEO so I can show this on the air because it really is fantastic.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:51.360]   PODEO.com. Do you have Google now yet, Jeff, or is it still not now?
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.040]   I always had. It doesn't do that much. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:02.400]   Now there's more in now. Look at your now. In order to use Google now, of course,
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.680]   you have to have a jelly bean funnel. I don't get any of the fun stuff.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.520]   Give me the weather, which is fine. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.960]   They've added Fandango. They've added a whole. Go ahead.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.480]   You can make it do more if you want to share more cards. You can do that.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.400]   I know I've done that. I've signed up for every one of them. I've said he's got some weird
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.600]   thing going on. I've given the words or something. I've said everything.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:36.080]   In other words, you're coming up irrelevant. Apparently he's not relevant.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:42.400]   Apparently it's Tom Morris's birthday. Facebook's at 1.94%. It's 61 degrees and
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.040]   centa's eight. That's what it says. That's not great. You need more than that.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:51.440]   They've got rotten tomatoes, reviews in here. Fandango tickets and Zillow real estate listings now.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.520]   But I don't know. Is that mean if you- It's really sad. It turns out what your house is worth
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.680]   every day. That would be depressing. Let's see. I've got all the birthdays from Google Plus.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:05.280]   That's kind of a- Let me see here. What else? Harlem Shake videos? How did they know that I was
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.560]   into that? You think Google search did it? I must have searched for it. Netflix is up another
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:16.640]   eight bucks. What's going on? Netflix almost- It's at 186 bucks now. I love this. These are
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.080]   all my packages. This is all the people who like House of Cards. They're buying Netflix stock.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:25.520]   It's- That might be it. House of Cards has really done well for Netflix, hasn't it?
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.800]   And the weather report, my next appointment- What's it all about? You've got- Look at all that.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.840]   I've got a ton of stuff in here. Lauren, are you on Android?
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.080]   Yeah. Yeah. What do you get? What do you get? Next to Seven and a Galaxy?
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:40.240]   Yeah, I love it. I get Google Now stuff, but not all that much. I mean, maybe- Well, maybe-
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.640]   Not as much as I would like to see. Maybe I just do it. I do so much surfing.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.920]   Now, I just- I- I wish- There's all kinds of things I had to do. I had to go to my Google Apps
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:55.920]   account and say it was okay. The "I" as administrator had to say it was okay that I as Jarvis was
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:02.400]   allowed to put the history in front of all that. But we're hearing more and more that Google Now
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:09.920]   is starting to be part of more of what Google's doing. I mean, it looks like Google Now is-
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.000]   It's going to get into notifications. It's going to be- I think it's critically important.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.880]   It's- My argument around media is that media treated us all as a mass and it has to treat us
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:22.960]   as individuals. And Google Now is all about treating us as an individual. And yet this is the
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.200]   ultimate in creepiness, isn't it? Isn't this what others-
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.600]   Now you can specify your mode of transportation for your commute. You could say,
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.040]   "I want to know what public transit is not driving." You can't- You can't say
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.640]   bike bicycling. You can only say public transport or driving. It's- No, no, it's-
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:44.240]   No, no, that you get the update, dude. Driving public transit, walking or biking now available.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.960]   Oh, I changed the press in. No, the problem is I want biking plus public transit because that's
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:54.960]   what I do. Yeah, you need to- All four years are so complicated. We're too complicated for Google Now.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.200]   I bike to the couch, right? Yeah. The public transport is really easy. There's one thing.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.600]   It's called "countrain." You bike to that. That doesn't take-
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.600]   That's San Francisco and then you bike. Yeah, you're right. Do you bring your bike onto the
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:13.840]   train? Or do you have a bike waiting for you? No, I have a bike that I take on the train.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.400]   Is one of those fold-up bikes? I don't know. This is a couch train. He's setting it. I'm so
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:25.600]   sorry. He's setting it. According to- According to Netflix executive speaking of House of Cards,
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:30.560]   it is now the most watched thing on Netflix right now showing that Netflix-
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:35.840]   in their $100 million gamble, this was a smart move. You may remember Netflix started doing
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:40.160]   original programming on Netflix. They said we're going to bring back Arrested Development.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.200]   They're doing House of Cards, which is a Kevin Spacey
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.560]   production, a remake, American remake of a British series, which if you've all watched
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:53.920]   apparently and loved, and it is very hot right now, and I'm not surprised. It's really good.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:59.120]   Not giving any numbers though, are they? This is at the All Things D dive into media conference.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:04.800]   He did not share any specific audience numbers. There was a good article in the Atlantic about
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:13.120]   how this $100 million thing makes economic sense. In fact, Netflix with $7.99 a subscriber
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:18.480]   is doing a little more profitable than HBO, which makes about $7 per subscriber,
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.840]   and has roughly the same number of subscribers, around $30 million. Pardon me?
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.480]   That has to make more stuff. What's interesting though to me is that we have the
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:33.680]   synchronicity of being able to watch things together on Twitter that's blown away.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:39.200]   Yeah, but that's old school now. I think the new way is to watch a series all at once.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.440]   What that means is this idea of the shared experience once again gets bored.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.760]   Well, no, the thing is it's become a bi-modal thing. You form to one bucket or the other.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.240]   You're either all watching the Grammys or the Super Bowl or something together,
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.760]   or you're catching up with it. I suspect there's a-
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.760]   All the bread of giving spoilers.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.200]   What's interesting here is that you're fine. You could have watched it on average.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   You can't really tweet it, can you? Because it's a big, yeah, you're right.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.480]   Well, no, so there's-
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.280]   Don't tell me about the Facebook.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.320]   Ask you if there's a service here, which is my friends' tweets
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.720]   synchronized with the program I'm watching so that I can see the jokes as they say them.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.160]   The challenge is constructing that as a service.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.600]   But you think- I remember how in conversation with David Weilberg about this,
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.840]   a Weilberg, which was where you sit there and wise crap with your friends while you're
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.320]   watching something. We did it for the State of the Union or something like that a few years back.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:40.160]   And then what you want is that same thing, but for watching pre-recorded media.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:45.920]   So as you're watching House of Cards, you get your friends' wise tracks time to that episode.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.840]   I know.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.160]   Sunjj-Dak was going to build that app, and I wish he had.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.800]   Yeah, and then there's people like me who would throw the data off completely because I'm watching,
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.480]   you know, old Hammer Horror film.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:03.120]   You can go online forever and there just aren't a lot of people who are watching that at the same
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.400]   time, typically.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.080]   More in French-
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:05.080]   French-
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:05.080]   French-
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:05.080]   French-
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.280]   Yeah, but that's the point.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.480]   You see, if you don't have to watch it at the same time, if you could have like,
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.840]   Mystery Science Theater 3000 from your friends that shows up.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.720]   So as you watch it, you're adding to the commentary on that episode.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.760]   But it'd be great because you want to outdo each other with your quips.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.640]   Right.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:27.360]   So then you go back and go, "Okay, I've just thought of the joke.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.720]   I can go back and rewind and put the thing just in here."
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:35.600]   It becomes like the Rocky Horror Picture Show script, which is the sort of refined,
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.200]   you know, 1970s version of this, where people thought of the jokes that went with the movie
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.240]   and wrote them down and then they go along and say them to the playback.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.800]   You have the little Android robots and everything.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.960]   With the antenna sticking up into the screen.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.680]   Rocky Horror Picture Show is a service.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.080]   There we go.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.680]   They're talking about making Google Now a widget.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.760]   Technobuffalo says, "Your Nexus may have a Google Now widget."
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.320]   Well, yeah, I also, there was a new screen here where I have been failing at this.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.840]   I need Gene here to help me.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.600]   Hold on a second.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.200]   A Google Now screen saver?
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:09.680]   Find of it.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.000]   What it was, it's called Dash Clock.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.400]   It was done.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.080]   Didn't you see that, Lauren, on Google Plus?
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.280]   It was done by a Google order.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:26.560]   And it's a widget that puts all bunch of data into your lock screen.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.080]   But I can't get it to become a lock screen.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:28.800]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.720]   It says, "Move it to the right," and I don't know what to do.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.360]   To do the lock screen stuff, I think there's a,
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.040]   you have to enable that specifically, or you can't get the data,
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.480]   they can't get the data in there at all.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.760]   I haven't played in the lock screen.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.440]   Yeah, because you can slide between lock screens.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.880]   Hang on.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:48.400]   And we did mention last week in the Google change log that notifications,
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.880]   there in Google Now will come to your notifications.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.440]   I like this.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.040]   I think that's a big deal.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:57.280]   But with Microsoft going after Google with this new Scrugled campaign,
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:02.880]   don't you think that Google's got to be a little careful about admitting how much it
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.000]   knows about people?
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.560]   And Google Now kind of lets the cat out of the bag.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.040]   Oh, no, I think they say the way around.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.640]   I think the Scrugled campaign, you're like,
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.320]   "Swed, why is this a problem?"
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.840]   When you see the,
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.720]   I actually saw one of those, my son was watching hockey,
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.920]   so I was seeing ads on TV.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.160]   They're putting ads on TV, which surprised me.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.440]   The original Scrugled was just like a web campaign.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.880]   Now they're actually putting ads on TV saying, "Google's reading your mail."
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.800]   Is that, well, the Scrugled campaign.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.160]   But it was the wife who was looking at every show,
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.480]   just saying, "Why have you got ads of bankruptcy in your Gmail?"
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.280]   Right.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.840]   And he said, "Oh, because I made a joke about mortgages."
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.800]   It's like, "Right."
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.120]   You don't understand that Google is slightly subtle than that.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.240]   But also it was...
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.320]   Oh, there is a Google Now widget.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.280]   When did you get this jab?
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:43.840]   It was kind of broken.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.840]   All you have to do is update the search app, and then you get it.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.120]   So that's a nice little widget.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.120]   It's actually Paramore's birthday.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.680]   It's 59 degrees in Petaloma, and you're going to the gym at four.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.240]   Exactly.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.520]   The floor has been writing about the Scrugled campaign a lot.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.560]   The Scrugled campaign.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.600]   Let's talk about Scrugled.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.160]   It's a new one.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.920]   It's really pretty dismal.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:09.600]   What's really fascinating is it shows that people just don't care about the pitch
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.280]   that Microsoft is trying to make now.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.400]   They launched that campaign launched a week ago,
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.680]   just about, I think, this evening.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.040]   It won't be a week or just, you know, a process.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.000]   Isn't this even about, wasn't it?
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.920]   Yeah, or within a day, I think.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.760]   When they actually launched a campaign per se,
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.880]   when the site went up, when they modified the actual site.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.000]   The original Scrugled was going after Google's shopper.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.840]   And I think this was not illegitimate, saying,
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:37.280]   "Hey, what was a search engine showing shopping results is now all ad-based?"
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.920]   That was not unreasonable, but this one's ridiculous.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:40.880]   What is going on?
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.160]   Of course, Microsoft always had, you know, they have paid shopping ads too.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.520]   Yeah, but they didn't make a site of all paid shopping ads.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.240]   It used to be a site of unpaid search results.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:56.080]   So now what happened with the new campaign, they went after Gmail on the basis.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.280]   The Gmail is reading your mail, which of course, you know,
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.440]   we've known all along, just like ISPs,
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.720]   scan for spam and fishes and things.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.560]   Google is, you know, machines are reading mail in an automated way
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.000]   to do the ad display.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.720]   And you can turn that off, because there's an ad preferences manager,
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.440]   if you want to not deal with that.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.800]   So they launched this new campaign.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:21.600]   So this petition is bogus that says, it's legit, but the thing is,
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:26.720]   they in a week, they had a target of 25k, and they've got,
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.280]   when I looked at it a little earlier, it was 5428.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.680]   They only have 5,000 signatures.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.520]   Nobody cares at all.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:38.080]   And what's worse is they have a Facebook page that they launched at the same time,
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.360]   which as far as I can tell, they've removed the link for from their main
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.920]   scrugal page, because it's just so awful.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.840]   And it's gotten up as of today to 194 likes.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:55.840]   And virtually all of the comments are anti-Microsoft and from Gmail.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.000]   So I can see why that link probably wasn't serving for--
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   It's not on that page anymore, you're right.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.840]   Yeah, it's gone as far as I can tell.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.760]   So I think most people, they understand how this works.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:10.960]   And I just think this is not hitting a chord for Microsoft in terms of going at this way.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.480]   And I think it's seen as mean-spirited too.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.680]   Plus, it's oxymoronic to say that you like Microsoft.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.760]   I don't know. I think Microsoft's probably smart to say, hey, we're the new underdog.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.760]   Not a bad bitch.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.880]   Nobody buys that.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.160]   Well, I think get somebody to buy it.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:30.640]   It's good.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.240]   I mean, I think everybody knows Microsoft's also reading your email,
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.320]   just not tying it to targeted ads.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.360]   They're not as smart.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.440]   I mean, any service is doing--
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.000]   Well, the thing is, if you got an outlook, you can't even read your own email.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.200]   They'll learn the Microsoft reading.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:54.720]   It has ads in it, because they call it spam filter.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:55.280]   Right.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:55.840]   Right.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.920]   Google, they take out other people's ads and they put in their ads.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.840]   I'll take the trade off.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.160]   I've got an outlook mailbox.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.040]   It's horrible.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:05.840]   It works.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:11.840]   We should mention, Lauren, you are doing some consulting for Google right now, right?
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:16.000]   Not involving anything like this, but, you know, definitely full disclosure.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.840]   Oh, for purposes of full disclosure.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:25.760]   A financial analyst affirms Google is paying Apple--
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:33.200]   this is hard to believe-- to be the default search on iOS, 1.3 billion--
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.320]   Oh, they're getting the total revenue.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.920]   One estimate is 1.3 billion.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.800]   And of that year--
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.280]   A year.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.240]   A billion.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.080]   Oh, so the total revenue is 1.3 billion.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:42.080]   $3 billion.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:42.160]   $3 billion.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.120]   $3 billion.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.800]   So the $300 million is just like affiliate payment kind of thing.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.480]   To Google.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.040]   To Google.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.600]   Google keeps $300 million and pays Apple $100.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.000]   I get it.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.280]   That's what the report says.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:55.840]   All right.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.160]   Okay.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.600]   And that's an estimate.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.960]   That's not an official number, right?
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:58.960]   Right.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.600]   Absolutely.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.040]   It's Morgan Stanley.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.720]   I'm not sure if Google breaks that down, but they--
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.680]   Does that seem reasonable?
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.400]   Google gets greater value in that because--
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.280]   There's a lot of trust.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.360]   I always say Google wants to know people.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:16.080]   So it gets direct revenue from the ads on Search there,
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.520]   but it also has a hook into us as people.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.480]   And I think that matters.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:25.920]   So this is one of the ways Mozilla--
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:30.080]   In a primary way, Mozilla makes money is through fees from Google
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.720]   for having Google Search on the Mozilla toolbar.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.280]   And we always presumed that Apple was making--
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.480]   that Google was making some money--
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.920]   that Apple was making some money from Google,
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.720]   but not this much.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.000]   It shows how much it's worth to Google is what--
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:44.960]   I guess what we're saying.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.760]   Well, it also shows how good Apple has been as--
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.560]   taking a big chunk of the Search,
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.640]   of the using of the web.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.840]   That's the point.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.800]   This isn't like--
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.120]   That's right.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:55.520]   --that's not a flat fee.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.360]   This is a payment for usage then.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.320]   For usage.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.080]   And it's ramped up enough that it's reached a significant amount of money.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.640]   Because Apple has a lot of people who use their phones for searches
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.760]   and their iPads for searches.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.240]   There's a debate over whether this is revenue sharing
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.560]   or a straight fee per device.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.560]   One of the analysts thinks Google is actually paying
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.440]   Apple $3.20 per iOS device.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.440]   And--
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.360]   Which wouldn't be unreasonable at all.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.720]   Is the lifetime value or the annual value of those users?
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.360]   So the rumors that Apple might try to boot Google from the
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:35.840]   Safari Search bar is bogus then, right?
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.480]   Because a lot of money--
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.160]   And Apple works so well with maps.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.680]   Yeah, who they're going to go to.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.000]   Bing.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.080]   I mean, I don't think-- I think, you know, come on.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.720]   Yeah, when I go to Facebook and do a search and it comes back with Bing,
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.160]   I just-- I laugh every time.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.760]   Funny.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.720]   Well, it's a good name.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.440]   Makes you laugh.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:57.280]   Ned Ryerson.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.960]   Google-- OK, so anything more to say about that?
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.840]   That's-- we all agree.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.200]   That's probably the case.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.400]   And it makes sense for everybody.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:04.960]   All parties--
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.400]   You know, it's one of those things.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.840]   Google wants people to use Google.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:12.240]   They'll happily pay you that and they will have done some like--
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.280]   For you?
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.280]   Careful measurements of whether it's worth it for them.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:15.520]   Right.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.640]   And they'll be paying the money.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.000]   If it wasn't worth it, they'd stop.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.600]   It's interesting that the "Scrugled" campaign is getting so little traction.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.080]   Do you think that that's because--
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:30.560]   and I tie it into this because Apple users probably don't care that Google's paying Apple.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.800]   They want Google on their iOS device anyway.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.920]   Do you think--
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.520]   We like Google in the UK.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.520]   Basically, people are not afraid of Google.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:42.560]   No, and we've had this anti-tax campaign in the UK trying to go after Google and Amazon
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.000]   and Starbucks.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.680]   And it's heard Starbucks quite a bit, but people just like Google too much.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.320]   Interesting.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.440]   Why is that?
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.000]   It gives us value.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:54.880]   It gives us value.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.000]   It's not a question of trust.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.640]   Do you think it's because we actually get value for our--
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.760]   It's because they're actually good at the feedback loop.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.880]   You know, they are very good at making the search give you what you want.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.000]   And so when you go and try something else, it feels slightly off.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.480]   You know, Bill Gates was on Reddit this week.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.840]   Did he do an AMA?
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.800]   Yeah, that's critical.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:20.160]   As far as I can tell, the Bing is better than Google.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.080]   And it's like, well, it's better than Google for you probably.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.880]   And it may be--
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.880]   They're running those ads, by the way.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.560]   Downtown-- now it's in downtown San Francisco where they offer you an Xbox.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:38.880]   If you do a search and you choose Google over Bing, and of course they edit the ads to only show
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:43.120]   people who chose Bing, we don't know what the real--
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.760]   I wonder how many Xboxes they've given away.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:52.960]   That sounds like a rash thing to do in San Francisco because it's very easy to spot,
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.760]   which is which because you can just look at which one has one boxes.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.520]   Are they even say it in the ad?
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.520]   We came to Google's backyard
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.880]   to challenge Google.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.720]   And they have a-- if I could find it, they have a Google--
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.080]   But the far-right thing is--
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:08.880]   This is Bing's site.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.440]   Yes, it's a big battle.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.520]   The importance of search to Google, of course, is still great,
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.160]   but all the new frontiers are about mobile.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:23.280]   It is interesting that Microsoft is spending so much of its ad dollar and attention on Google,
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.720]   like competing against Google.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.960]   Well, because Google was very--
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.560]   Google was very stealth about competing with Microsoft for a long time.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.480]   I thought Microsoft might just come and squish them.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:36.320]   And then at some point, they got to the point where they didn't care anymore.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:42.080]   Was it when they pulled the EAS server support for Windows Phone that did it?
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.840]   It was-- I think it was a bit before that.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.000]   I think it was when Android actually took off.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.480]   Android was the thing.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:55.520]   I think that the Mary-Mika Sloane--
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.080]   It was long.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.720]   You should look at the Mary-Mika set up from December
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.920]   that she put out.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:05.920]   She's an analyst who does this nice overview of the state of the web
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.840]   with actual data and looks back to sources.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.960]   And the graph that she shows is the Asymco one,
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.440]   which says, what is a dominant operating system?
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:19.440]   And it goes back 30 years and it starts out with all this Apple and Commodore and Atari and stuff.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:23.280]   And then it's like, "Wintell for the 15, 20 years."
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:23.600]   Right.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.560]   And then suddenly it goes--
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.120]   Because Apple and Android are taking off.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.880]   And it's iOS.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.840]   It's broken down by a manufacturer rather than actual operating system,
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:39.040]   which makes it a bit of a weird one because it counts iOS and Mac together.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:45.200]   But the original Asymco one was like, "Microsoft's in trouble.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.560]   These guys are up to 25%."
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:51.840]   And her, when she updated for 2012, when it was like, they're up close to 50%.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:56.480]   And she said, "This quarter, the crossover is happening where the majority
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:01.120]   of machines on the net are Android rather than Windows."
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.000]   That's happening this quarter.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:04.800]   This quarter.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.160]   And that really is all about mobile.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.760]   And Apple is still a big chunk of that too.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.720]   And it is about mobile because we have mobile devices,
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:17.440]   we have more mobile devices than we have laptops and desktops now.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.440]   We're running out of words for this, which is just the other weird thing,
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.200]   because it's not just mobile, it's tablets too.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:26.400]   But mobile versus tablet used to actually mean mobile versus iPhone.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:31.920]   Because iPad was the tablet market until the last half of last year,
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.000]   where suddenly all these Android ones start appearing.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.640]   And now there are loads and loads of them,
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.520]   but they don't show up in all the stats because they're being used for old things
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:44.160]   and their kindles and their nooks and their strange things in China and so on.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.120]   But there's lots and lots of these showing up too.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.880]   And the slightly weird bit from my point of view is that
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:56.880]   from Android's fragmentation problem has been this sort of thing that
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.640]   people have used against it for two years.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.480]   But actually that hasn't been true.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.520]   What's happened is if you write for Android, you learn that,
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.000]   "Oh, these things can be this big and they can be this big,
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   they can have lots of pixels, they can have a few pixels."
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.360]   It's like, "Okay, whatever."
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.800]   I understand there's a domain here, I'll write some code that is about domain.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.280]   Whereas on iOS, it's like, "Well, we've got one that's this big,
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:19.200]   we'll free that this big, and we've got two that are this big."
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.240]   I know I've got one that's this big.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:26.240]   So on iOS, you either build an iPhone app or you build an iPad app,
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.920]   which means that half the time you've got an iPad app,
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:35.040]   if you're an iPad, you download an app and it's got black bars that take up
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.880]   three quarters of the screen because it's an iPhone app and they've decided not to
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.320]   anything intelligent about it.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.480]   Yeah, I want to get this printed from my wall.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:47.520]   This is Mary Meeker's slide, "Reimagining of Computer Operating Systems."
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.320]   That's the one, yeah.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.280]   It goes from 1975 through last year.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.720]   The blue, the big blue thing is Windtell.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:44:00.320]   There is Atari and TRS-80 and Commodore in there, they all disappear.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:02.240]   Is CPM in the other?
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.720]   Other is probably CPM, sure.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.280]   That's a game of games.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:11.200]   But really, from 1993 to 2007, it's Windtell and Macintosh,
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.560]   Red is Macintosh, blue is Windtell, dominant and that's it.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:20.720]   Android appears in 2007 and climbs, as does Apple because of iOS.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:28.240]   And now the combination of Android and Apple easily is 63% or so of the total market.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.840]   Windtell is down to 35%.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.040]   Yep.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.720]   Huge.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.800]   I think the sum of this is...
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.040]   I think the Android becomes one-fidgeted percent now.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.720]   Go ahead, Lauren.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.520]   No, I was just saying, I think some of this is kind of intangible too.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.280]   I mean, we're talking about why people feel this way.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.320]   And I don't know whether you're talking about...
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:49.760]   Microsoft, of course, has a long, long trail behind it.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:56.720]   And I don't think it's that easy to have people forget about that.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:57.200]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.560]   Do people really have memories?
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.200]   Do they really?
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.560]   I think the people who are influencers in a lot of this, we do.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.040]   And they're the ones writing reviews.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:07.200]   Right.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:07.600]   So...
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.080]   That's true.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:12.800]   When, for example, Surface came out right at the beginning,
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.320]   there was sort of a built-in...
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.040]   You know, without addressing, you know, how good or not it really is.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.720]   I think there was sort of a built-in bias among many people against it,
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.240]   simply because it was from Microsoft.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.080]   I'm not saying that that's a good thing or a bad thing.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:28.080]   I think that's just the reality of how the perception is among a lot of the people
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.240]   who write those reviews and look at this initially.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:36.400]   I admit, you know, I have to work hard to overcome anti-Microsoft bias.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.280]   But as when you look at graphs like this and you realize they're the underdog,
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.200]   you start to root for things like Windows Phone
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.960]   to give Microsoft some traction and what is clearly
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.680]   the move from desktop to mobile.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:48.800]   Really?
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.320]   That's what this measures.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.160]   And Microsoft just doesn't have a mobile presence.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.480]   Well, it's not just mobile, but it's tablets too.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.760]   That's the other heart.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.280]   I include tablets as mobile.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.000]   Yeah, but you're right.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.040]   Yeah, but that's the thing.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.880]   They're used as computers now.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.840]   This is kind of what I was getting at, which is that,
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.640]   which is where the Apple thing has led us astray,
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.240]   because we think of them as distinct,
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.840]   which is the iPad is something you're sitting on the couch
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.160]   and the iPhone is something you use during the day.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.800]   And if you actually look at the usage stats, that's backed up.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.280]   The iPad has this sort of big spike in the evening
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.200]   when you're sitting at home, just looking at reading stuff.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.000]   Because, you know, these things are heavy.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.520]   They're that big and you've basically got to rest it on your leg after a while.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:31.520]   Mary Makers' next slide actually shows that at 2010, it flipped.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:37.040]   If you look at red and blue, red is desktop PCs, blue is laptop PCs.
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.960]   And if you look at green and yellow on this graph,
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:43.440]   smartphones and tablets, in 2010, desktop and notebook PCs
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.800]   outpace smartphone and tablets.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:49.200]   And every year thereafter, smartphone and tablets have just dominated.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.280]   In fact, desktop PCs have dropped slightly.
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.760]   It's not even so much that they're losing ground.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.160]   It's that tablets and smartphones.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.360]   So this is, it's not that people are giving up their computers.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:03.760]   It's the growth of tablets and smartphones is outpacing them.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.840]   Yeah, but the PC is not dead.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:06.400]   It's not dead.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.120]   It's just stagnant.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.560]   It's stasis.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:14.880]   But I mean, the thing is we're running out of useful subdivisions,
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.160]   discussion subdivisions here.
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:16.320]   Yes.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.080]   Because we keep doing like desktop versus mobile,
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.560]   where actually most of the desktop became laptop a while back.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:24.320]   And a lot of this is like standing up versus sitting down,
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.440]   one hands versus two hands.
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.000]   There's a bunch of different affordance break points here.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.720]   So, you know, one of the big pushes we've been doing at Salesforce
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:37.120]   is about bringing staff to people wherever they happen to be working.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.680]   So our example is Virgin Atlantic.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:43.680]   We want them to, we want all their employees to be in touch with each other
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:46.080]   and being in touch with the customers to keep track with what's going on.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:49.760]   And there's challenges there because some of them are in the air and aren't actually connected.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.440]   But the rest of them are sitting in the airport,
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:58.320]   and they don't have access to connectivity and desktops and keyboards.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.560]   And there's always the one person there who's sitting there with the keyboard
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.880]   changing the flights and the rest of them are running around.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.120]   But they can have phones and they can have tablets in their pockets.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.880]   And if you actually hook the stuff up to that,
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.800]   suddenly you can connect to all your employees all the time,
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.240]   they don't have to check in with people.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:13.680]   And this is this sort of transition we're seeing in business a lot of the time,
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:18.480]   where it used to be that they had a data entry model that was,
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:22.400]   there is this one terminal where you keep the business up to date with the statistics,
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:27.600]   whether it's the cash, or just store, or whether it's the thing you have in the back room,
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.040]   where you keep track of stuff.
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:34.480]   Whereas now you can say, I have one of these, or I have something slightly bigger
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:39.280]   that has a bit more information on it, and you can both read the information of what's going on
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.520]   and update what's happening all the time.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:47.360]   And this is crept up on business because they're used to having these very sort of monolithic systems.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.880]   And it's come in from the edges where if you look at things like Square,
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:56.240]   where you can have a small business that has a very good handle on what's going on,
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.320]   because every employee has a little reader like that.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:05.600]   But it's moving now to such that anyone who's working for a company can keep in touch with
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:09.680]   everyone else working for that company at the same time and help them out without all the
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:13.040]   run around you had to do before. And that's a huge change.
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.240]   This is a wonderful deck. I'm going through it.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.840]   She talks about the reimagining of everything.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:26.080]   And but what is very clear, and I guess we've seen this so many times in media transitions,
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.720]   if you want to mention Gutenberg, Jeff, this would be a good moment to do so.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:38.000]   Is that the old media doesn't die. It doesn't, in fact, PCs are still pretty much stasis
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:44.160]   in terms of number of units in use. It's that there's these new things just take off.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.000]   Well, but that's what that's.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.680]   They don't replace it. Well, you know, I'll go back to this graph.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:56.960]   Desktops actually it's pretty holding pretty steady at 750 million desktops in use from,
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:04.160]   you know, here's the graph installed base of desktops in 2009 was about 750 million.
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:10.240]   It's slightly lower now, maybe 650 million notebooks have grown, but not at the expense
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:15.840]   so much of desktops is and tablets and phones have grown again, not at the expense of notebooks
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:21.360]   and desktops. So and I think that's what you see, right? Is that the old media doesn't go away.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:25.200]   It just gets subsumed by the massive growth of this new stuff.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.480]   Actually, what did go away is the encyclopedia protect.
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:34.640]   Creation, if you're, you know, if you're doing writing, you're not going to be doing a lot of
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:40.080]   writing on a typical tablet, I guess not, or a phone. But those people are, there's not more
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.520]   writers, I guess, reading. They're not, they're not writing. They're more readers.
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:49.200]   Yeah. Well, I was going to say this because, um, what I found is,
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:57.600]   I found is that with the, with, with Swift key on here, I can actually type pretty, pretty
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:02.720]   quickly on this. I wouldn't necessarily, you wouldn't write a blog post there long form report.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:08.160]   But I can, you know, I can, I can live tweet as quickly on this as I can on the keyboard.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.920]   I can keep up with stuff like that because the auto complete works well. The other thing I've
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:17.440]   seen is that I was at our company offsite last week and all my colleagues in sales have iPads,
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:22.080]   but they now all have those little Logitech keyboard things as well. So they, they pop up the iPad
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:26.160]   into that, they want to take notes and they don't carry a laptop as well, which was the new last year
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:30.320]   they had a laptop in their bag. They want to take notes, they bring that out. And they had the
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:34.160]   iPad to keep track of what's going on. And now the iPad has become that. So,
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:39.840]   this is, this is the supposed surface market, but the surface has lost it because the iPad is there.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:46.400]   So if you have a Bluetooth, this is a Bluetooth keyboard I use with the Nexus 7 mostly. But if you
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:51.440]   have a full size keyboard with a tablet from a functional standpoint, then you're getting back
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:56.320]   to, to a laptop. I'm going to take a break. When we come back, I want to talk about wearables
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:00.160]   because that's the other big thing Google of course has its form of wearable Google glass and
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:04.400]   then the big report in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and now others, including
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:10.480]   Bloomberg confirming Apple is moving big into an eye watch. Could that be? We'll talk about it in
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:15.840]   just a bit with our panel. Kevin Marks is here from tumblevision.tv and salesforce.com
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:22.640]   from the City University of New York and the buzz machine.com. It's Jeff Jarvis and Lauren Weinstein
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:30.160]   from Google plus and Lauren dot vortex.com. We're talking about trends really. And by the way,
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:37.360]   if you want to test whether Bing's better than Google, Bing it on.com. Just go there, do a search.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:45.440]   You be the judge. You know, it's so obvious, which is which I don't maybe I don't it seems to me.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:50.560]   And there's I don't know it's interesting to search for this. A seat of a
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.960]   medicine. A seat of a benefit. Is that a good one? Yeah, because Google will give you the
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:53:04.000]   the let me let's try it. That's good. I want a C E T O M E N A P A C which one does the best
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:12.080]   suit who fixes the spelling. Yeah, I guess I got it right. Does it not show you the cards?
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:17.040]   I don't get cards on well, Bing is you know what? This is a Microsoft site. Maybe they're
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:20.880]   stripping the cards out. Yeah, that would be a big. What's the so what they doing is that
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:27.600]   showing the API results? Yeah, that sucks. I guess they're saying, oh, if you're, you know,
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:32.240]   then that would make it very obvious who is whom. Let's do it. Yeah, see, they're they're
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:37.000]   taking out this stuff on the right the card. Yeah. So they're doing a 12th link
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:44.160]   comparison, which is in it. That's not a fair slide. We have a collection of antique typewriters
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:50.720]   here at CUNY. Yeah, what is called the Bing? Because when you when you when you hit the carriage
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:57.920]   return, many people don't know this. But when you what I remember thing, we'll be back in just a
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:05.040]   bit. But first, a word from squarespace.com. This is blogging for the 21st century websites for
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:11.600]   the 21st century. The latest technology on the best hosting together. This makes a great platform
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:16.560]   for your next website. I want you to visit squarespace.com and try it out. They've got mobile
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:23.440]   responsive design automatically. That means whenever you put a image on the site that creates
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:27.440]   seven different versions, the correct size will load for whatever device you're looking at.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:33.600]   One site serves all beautiful templates with 100% drag and drop functionality as you customize.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:38.640]   But if you're a developer and you want to use CSS or JavaScript, they've got a developer platform
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:46.240]   to with a with a colored so syntax code editor and all of that. It's so easy to build a site and
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:50.880]   yet so powerful. And of course, because the software is running on top of the server and
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:55.280]   they're tightly integrated, you get some real benefits. The servers never go down with the most
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:55:02.400]   reliable and not only just reliable, but also they handle bandwidth very well. So if you suddenly
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:06.960]   get hit, they've got it automatically so that you get more bandwidth as you need it. You just
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:13.760]   can't bring a squarespace site down by with traffic. And of course, the software is always updated,
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:17.840]   always secure. You don't have to worry about that. You can automatically import sync and
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:23.760]   publish to and from social media with a few clicks. Automatically pull photos from Instagram
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:27.360]   right onto your site, for instance, or instantly sync pages and galleries to Facebook.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:33.360]   Auto publish your new blog entries right to Twitter. Let people know social media buttons
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:37.680]   connecting you with all the services you love Facebook, Twitter, Google+, yes, Instagram,
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:43.920]   four squared dropbox LinkedIn Pinterest stumble upon and on and on and on. A beautiful design's
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.800]   great functionality and servers that just never go down. Try it free for two weeks. You don't need
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:55.040]   a credit card. Just go to squarespace.com. But if you decide you want to buy and I wouldn't blame
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:56:00.480]   you if you did, look at the pricing, the basic plan $8 a month when you buy an annual plan.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:04.320]   But I think you're going to want to look at the unlimited plan. Now $16 a month when you buy a year,
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:08.960]   look what you get unlimited pages, galleries and blogs. Great for a photographer or designer.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:13.120]   You can have galleries for every client, for instance, unlimited bandwidth. You get slash
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:18.560]   dotted. Don't worry about it. You're on hacker news. No problem. We mentioned you on Twitch.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.520]   It's not going to you're not going to get a bandwidth bill. You've got unlimited bandwidth,
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:26.480]   unlimited storage, unlimited contributors. And when you buy an annual plan, they'll automatically
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:32.320]   register a new domain name for you and hook it up to the system for free. Squarespace.com. If you
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:38.240]   decide to buy 10% off your first purchase on new accounts, monthly or annual, although the
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:45.520]   annual plan gets you better savings. When you use our offer code twig two, T W I G and the number two
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:53.920]   squarespace.com. I think it was the times Nick built in writing and the times it said at first,
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:57.600]   the Wall Street Journal immediately piled on. But Bloomberg has a lot more information,
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:04.080]   including they named some names of executives involved in this new I watch initiative. And they
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:09.280]   say Apple has a hundred employees working on this is more than a prototype, it sounds like.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:16.480]   Yeah, Dick built what off about it was it was frankly a bit of an odd tangent about how
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:22.240]   Google is getting close to our eyes. And that's more problematic than being on our
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:25.840]   wrist. He was a little too psycho analyzing the world. They're just different things.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:30.480]   Both of them seem like solutions for a problem that doesn't really exist. But maybe that's just
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:34.560]   because I'm not hip and we did it. But they're very, very different, I think, just because they
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:39.040]   happen to wear them. The Google Glass has come to a couple of things, right? One is it can record
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:42.640]   anything in your vision and two is it delivers information. Yeah, the watch doesn't do that,
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:47.680]   obviously. The watch, it'll give you sound and all kinds of stuff. The watch, it becomes
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:53.200]   another piece of access to your computer. But to me, where this really goes, I think,
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:57.440]   is it the watch in the long run should be your computer and everything else communicates with it.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:02.400]   That's what Apple, well, at least that's what Nick said, Apple is thinking of it as a digital hub,
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:07.680]   not a peripheral. No, right. That's the key so that so that you are always carrying your
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:11.680]   computer with you, you're wearing your computer. Wow. That makes sense to me. And then
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:16.880]   everything else is a peripheral, right? Every screen, every keyboard, everything else
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:20.000]   goes a peripheral. That makes sense to me as a model. I'm not sure that's where Apple's really
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.640]   going. I don't know, but I don't know if that Apple yet wants to put the entire computer
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:29.280]   onto your wrist because that reduces a lot of value. But if anybody's going to disrupt themselves,
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:34.240]   it's Apple. So who knows? Mary Meeker calls it always on. She says,
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:39.440]   "How many of you will be wearing a wearable in five years? Is that the next big thing? Wearables?
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:45.360]   Or is this just grasping on the part of Google and Apple trying to find the next big thing?"
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:50.000]   I can't wait to see you wearing five computers, Leo, because you'll be wearing them all.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.360]   You know, it's funny. I just love the idea of carrying a computer in my pocket with my smartphone.
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:57.840]   And I think that we've all embraced that.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:06.000]   Always connected, always on is really powerful. Always having access to the internet is really
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.400]   powerful. I don't know if a watch or glasses are not convinced.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:16.720]   What do you guys think? There's going to be different use cases, right? I mean,
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.120]   there's going to be people from whom it works and people that it won't work for.
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:25.360]   For the really small wearables, what I always worry about is batteries, right? Because as these
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:31.200]   things get smaller, if you are going to migrate more of the capability, especially the radio,
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:37.200]   you know, anything other than short range like Bluetooth, the battery requirements go up and up.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:42.720]   So you don't want to end up with a big bulky thing on your wrist. So a lot of this is kind of
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:48.480]   waiting for technology. And battery technology didn't catch up with what could otherwise be done.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:52.640]   We've been telling that story for years. Battery technology is basically stuck 20 years ago.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:57.040]   Including in Boeing jets and Tesla. Apparently.
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:03.360]   Exploding lithium ions and frozen lithium ions are not a what about I mean,
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.520]   somebody working on kinetic energy as a way of keeping.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:13.280]   I saw Nicholas Decker potty today. There's a lot of really good videos up at solveforx.com
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.100]   for Google solve for that. Yeah. And Nicholas Nick Nick Nick Nick Nick
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:20.000]   probably said, you know what he said? No, no, no, come in the floor and say, Oh, wait,
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.520]   hold on a second. I ran out of power. Shake. You were saying? You could do that right now.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.040]   Why is anybody doing that? Because you have to shake really hard for longer than that.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:32.960]   But I presume that we could get better at that.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:41.040]   Vetic body heat. My current mechanical wristwatch never has to be wound as long as I wear it.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.440]   When I'm walking around, there's enough kinetic energy to keep it going.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:49.360]   That's been around that technology's ancient. I also know the requirements are going to change
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:55.840]   because as you have a denser, denser radio grid, they can do low power communicate with it is
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:00.240]   going to go down too. So, so the infrastructure effects, what your requirements are also, but
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:06.720]   that's not going to happen instantly. Right. So do you buy it? Is Apple actually putting 100
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:14.960]   people on the job? Are we going to see a Tim Cook keynote in six months? And now we bring you
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:20.800]   the eye watch. We haven't seen anything really shocking new in a while from Apple or from the
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:24.880]   matter of the Android world. You know, I think it's time for everybody to shock us in the next
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:28.720]   couple of months. I got a shock for you. Eric Schmidt selling 42% of his stock.
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:39.040]   Larry and Sergey just face pawned. It's an all time high. Market cap of 255 billion.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:46.480]   Shares hitting $775. And Eric Schmidt says, I'm going to share a sell about 3.2 million shares.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:49.360]   So what do you think? I mean, you know, there was one there's gossip online as to whether
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:55.360]   another divorce is involved. But I think he's going to invest in something or go to philanthropic.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:00.800]   Oh, that's interesting. It's a it's worth about two and a half billion dollars.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:06.720]   He still has another two and a half billion. He still has another. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:12.160]   He sold last shares were sold a year ago. He got a billion and a half out of that.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:18.080]   Uh, see, Kevin. Can you hear me? No, I can't hear you.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:22.640]   I'm just going to mute it. Just fix it. We fixed it. We had we had pushed a button.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:28.080]   Sorry about that, Kevin. Okay. That's good. I've never had a guest do that. He was holding
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:35.040]   up a smartphone. You do like Swift key. Only Kevin Ross. What program was that? That was good.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:41.680]   He programmed the whole thing while you were. He wrote some, he wrote some Java code.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:46.000]   It's an ancient ugly ugly house app I've got called called Flash it, which is designed for
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.120]   communicating with people in bars. So most of the most of the different measures like
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:56.000]   dance. Hey, baby, you can customize them. Flash it. Flash it.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.560]   Dance.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.520]   I got to get that. That's an Android app worth keeping.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:09.760]   Yes, we can hear you now. I'm wasted. That's one of the three canned responses.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:14.400]   This is very tuned to the certain demographic, but I found it useful every now and then.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:20.240]   I'm wasted. Wow. What's it called? It's called Flash it. I'm kidding it.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.680]   There's probably so many has probably written a better one since I've had this about three years.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:29.040]   Hey, it does everything you need, including asking us if we can hear you.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.520]   So what did you want to say? I've forgotten now.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.480]   What were you talking about? There was something interesting.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.720]   We were talking about Schmidt selling his stock, but we could go past that to the watch.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.880]   Oh, the watch stuff. The wearables. Yeah, wearables. Yeah.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:50.880]   So the challenge of digital hub is something that was an apple strategy from a while ago,
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.520]   which was the presumption was you have all these gadgets and the Mac was a place where you made
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:00.000]   sense of them. Right. And the problem. They even used the phrase digital hub as I remember.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.360]   Yeah. There was in Steve Keeneau, it's everything. And that was that was the
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.560]   presumption was you would like one place to manage all these gadgets from.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:10.640]   And that was when iTunes was the, was the, you know, would actually work with everything,
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.880]   which wouldn't just work with Apple devices. You could use it with any phone and any,
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:22.080]   any, any three frames on. And they, that constrain them a bit too long. And they were
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.600]   stuck with this iTunes at the center of everything. Things the point with people got crossed with it,
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:30.480]   because you had to use plug your iPhone into iTunes to actually move things around.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.720]   And they realized that doing that for the world was better eventually after Google sort of showed
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:40.640]   them that you might want to do this. But they're still wrestling with the iCloud as the center
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:47.280]   of things. And I think what we're, what we're moving towards is not, I have this thing on my
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:52.560]   wrist that is my universe, but I have this thing on my wrist, which is one copy of the stuff that
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:55.920]   matters to me. But actually things. Or is it just your identity?
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:00.000]   But as a just your identity, what you're saying is you don't need a process.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:07.120]   You don't need a process as much. Right. You don't need to have, also you don't need a
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:10.400]   data store there. You don't actually want your entire data store to be something on your wrist
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.840]   that you can fall into a swimming pool and lose, you know, there's that.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:20.880]   So the problem is the same problem as like phone as, as second factor ID, which is, oh,
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:25.520]   we'll send you a message to your phone to confirm that that's what you meant on your computer.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:30.000]   Well, that works until you drop the phone in the toilet or it works until you're confirming
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.840]   purchase on your phone and you need to buy a new phone. You know, there's there's there's
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:37.440]   there's structural problems with it. And actually people lose their phones at hell of a lot more
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:41.680]   than than you would think given that people are using them as a second factor of authentication.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:48.560]   But I think another another issue is you it once you've got, you know, there's there's like zero
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:55.200]   one many thing going on here. And we're going from the one to the many part where, and Google has
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:01.280]   this with Chrome and with with Gmail, lots of the things. If I get a notification from Gmail and I
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:06.880]   read it, it's marked where on every other Google device I have. If I get a notification from Twitter,
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:11.440]   and then I go to any one of the devices, I've still got that notification from Twitter because
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:19.600]   they're not actually having a shared red flag between them. If I if I browse to something in Chrome,
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:26.640]   any other browser that any other Chrome browser I'm using on any machine will have that history
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:31.920]   and I can click through to it. Whereas if I'm on iOS, every every app has its own browser history
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:37.840]   in it. If I if I click through a link on Twitter on the iPad, it's in the Twitter browser history.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:41.280]   It's not in the main browser history, and it's not in the Facebook browser history.
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:45.520]   And it's not in the for square browser history. It's in that, you know, it's you have to remember
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:50.480]   how I got there to find that same thing again. So I think there's that is the tension that's
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:55.760]   that's that's being going on here. It's it's it's kind of the pocket versus the cloud, but it's
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:00.640]   it's making sense of both of those things at once. And that's that sort of affordance we're
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:06.000]   working towards with the screen big enough so you could show it across a bar on the iWatch.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.320]   That's what I want to know. I have downloaded you know it turns out there's three of I'm sorry.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:16.640]   You were saying something really deep and profound, but I'm busy playing with Flash It.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:22.880]   There's love. There's bar. There's three different flashets. Oh, they're on. Oh, they've got a whole.
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:29.760]   That's a this is a whole flash ecosystem. There's a whole flash ecosystem. There's
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:36.960]   love flash it bar flash it. And then what's the third one? Oh podcast flash it. No,
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:42.400]   I don't know. I can't find the other one. But anyway, this is a Christian flash it. There's
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:49.440]   Christian flash it. Is there really? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Jesus loves you. Amen. Luke Luke 719.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:54.800]   There was something about the you're having data on your on your wrist having all your data on
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.640]   the rest that I think is important here, which is which is yeah, you don't want to lose all your
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:03.840]   data if you drop your wristwatch into the toilet, obviously. But we do that all the time. I mean,
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:07.200]   people do that all the time. Yeah. But the other reason you don't necessarily want to have all
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:11.360]   the kid on your wrist is the way laws have been going at least here in the US. Please can just
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:15.520]   take it. They can just you know, sometimes without a warrant, they just take take the thing off your
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:19.040]   wrist. And if all your data is there, they can you think you've got encryption on it, but it's
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:24.880]   probably weak encryption. They can just dump it all. If it's in the cloud, the laws are not
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.760]   optimum. And there's problems with those too. But it makes it more complicated for them than just to
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:33.760]   be able to take, you know, if you have your whole life's worth of data right there on your body,
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.960]   that they can just physically grab. So that's something to keep in mind. I do think Lauren,
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:40.800]   we have demonstrated effectively that nobody really cares anymore about privacy or
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:45.200]   learning this stuff. And we're just all full speed ahead. Give me the convenience.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.680]   And I'm going to put on my wrist and I don't care. The day will come at some point, I guess,
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:57.600]   where we put stuff in safes and say our data is locked up. Well, it really comes to a matter of
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:05.120]   legal rights. You got SISPA coming back after SOPA PIPA and we have the fear. It's got to be on
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:12.560]   level of principles to say that you're you have privacy, you have in your data and in your email.
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:17.040]   And I keep on saying government keeps acting like it's the protector of privacy. It is the worst
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:23.280]   threat to privacy. Yeah. It's the same thing going on in the EU. I mean, you constantly have
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:29.440]   governments that are saying, well, for example, if the EU that went through this whole rigamarole
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:34.000]   for cookies, right, they had all their sites with these big banners saying, you know, do you
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.560]   accept our cookie policy? And now that's all falling apart because in the process of doing that,
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:44.800]   they broke so many sites. But these same governments at the same time are pushing all these government
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:51.280]   data retention systems and tapping the tapping of communications and all the rest now. So they're
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:55.680]   very hypocritical. So like Jeff is saying, you know, if you're believing that government is going to
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:00.880]   protect your privacy rights or other rights in this context, you're going down the garden path
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:07.680]   because they're the first ones that are going to be going after it. Speaking of Fox News headlines.
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:14.000]   So have you ever read to Gary Doctorow's new novel, "Homeland yet?" No, I got it on my desk.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.120]   Is it good? Yes, it's very good. It's the sequel to "Little Brother." Yes. Yeah.
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:24.240]   That's great. But it covers a lot of these like cybersecurity things and people surveilling you and
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:32.080]   quadcopters and the cops and it's well done. When Dick Cheney says, I approve of President
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:39.680]   Obama's drone program, then we know we got problems. If you ask me, shimmy Christmas.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:45.040]   Here's the here's the yeah, I just got this. We got to. But now is this a young adult or
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:49.040]   because "Little Brother" was for young. Is this the little brother? It's the same characters.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.960]   It's it's set in San Francisco burning man and it's you know, it's it's sort of explaining the
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:58.640]   node world of San Francisco to to young kids across America, which is a great thing to do.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:05.280]   It's the 60s all over again. Oh crap. I just bought the wrong flash. September. That's lousy.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:15.120]   It's flash cards. I'm wearing French. That's boring flashes. A dollar and I said, yeah, no,
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:20.480]   these are all free. These are all free. Well, I learned that. Yeah. What does this mean? Is this
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:28.480]   mean something? Yeah. That means I love you. Yeah, I forget how you get there, but it's a Howard
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:34.640]   Stern. I know I learned that from Howard Stern show. It's probably dirty. No, it's it's like the
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.720]   it's the whatever letters of the alphabet or I don't know what it is.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:48.640]   That's another thing from the Howard Stern show. You are sexy. No, I don't. These are fun. These are
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:55.440]   good. Another another Fox News headline. Google is building its own airport. Actually, this is one
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:00.320]   of those classic news journalism headlines. They have their own airport already. They got the
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:06.400]   NASA runway. Yeah, that's basically it. So down at San Jose, it's different. It's going to be flying
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:15.840]   over you, Kevin. It's an $82 million facility in San Jose. So they're going to have like a terminal
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:20.640]   at San Jose airport. Well, no, it's going to be a private aviation and their upgrades and others
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.960]   will be able to use it to between the three of them between Larry, Sergey and Eric, they have eight
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:32.240]   jets, eight jets. And that doesn't include Google's corporate fleet. That's their personal property.
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:36.400]   What are the what Marissa use it? The problem is that that there's been some
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:41.680]   well, they were using NASA Ames or Moffat Field, I guess, and they're in there and they're in
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:45.840]   their and they're in the, you know, Congressman Grassley and others have said, you know, they're
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:49.760]   only paying 3.7 million a year. This isn't right. So Google says, all right, fine, fine,
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:58.080]   we're going to build. We're going to build our own 29 acres. Each private plane would be a property
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:03.120]   tax generator, says San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed, the proposed Google port.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:11.120]   Will include its own executive terminal, multiple multiple hangers, ramp space, aircraft, parking lot,
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:18.480]   retail shops. So you're putting 10,000, D it. What time would G I suppose it sounds like?
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:25.200]   It's like building a new terminal. I like San Jose airport. I live in San Jose. It's your
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.680]   airport. I get there quickly. But also, is this like little airport? So you go through the terminal,
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:35.840]   the terminal is like 30 meters deep or something. You go in, you go out the other side, you go out
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:40.960]   on the runway and you walk up a staircase to it to a plane. It feels like you're, you know,
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:45.120]   you're back in the jet stage. It's the old joke that you have one gate, but you change the sun.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:53.520]   It's actually quite a nice airport now. Did anybody watch President Obama's fireside hangout?
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:14:01.200]   Man, this is like tomorrow. So tomorrow. Today, today Leo, big of the interns, the internship,
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:06.160]   I put it on the bottom of the house. Hasn't Howard Stern done that? It interned hangout?
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:14.400]   That's a different kind. Well, the great thing was they revealed the intern trailer
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:20.640]   on Google+ today. And then tomorrow, as a following act, the president doesn't hang out.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:27.760]   That's it. I put the link to the trailer. It says it is Google related on the rundown.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:32.320]   Google's got to love this. Oh, yeah. I mean, is this good for them?
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:35.760]   Well, they did. But already, right? Yeah, he's not.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.280]   Hey, you know, Bob, you know, you thought the first one he did another. He did one earlier.
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.760]   Yeah, he did it. Facebook too. Mark, Mark, Mark, and.
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:47.920]   Yeah, but I don't know. Okay, let's look at the intern. Oh, here's the direct link on YouTube.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:51.360]   The internship trip. This is what to be an intern at the White House.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:57.280]   I thought Google. Oh, Google. Oh, this is the movie with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:03.360]   Okay, let's skip the. Today, the ad. I love it how they put ads on ads now.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:08.000]   Yes. Well, it was so meta because they did a hangout saying they were going to do the hangout.
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:13.520]   So this was the movie that they shot at the Googleplex.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:20.160]   But there are adults that have.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:25.600]   They didn't tell you that. Your company is closed.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:30.320]   You closed the company. Everything's computer. John Goodman.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:35.200]   People have a deep mystery. You know, this is ironic. They're trying to sell a wristwatch.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:40.720]   It's funny. And the company went out of business because everything's computerized now.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:48.320]   Hey, Hollywood knows. Or two or three or four. This summer.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:57.520]   Google. Google. Not a job job. It's an interview for an internship that could lead to a job.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.600]   Nick, this might be the last chance that we got.
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.280]   You got to come in here. You got to come in closely.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:04.000]   You want to see those sales all the time? They're doing a hangout.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.680]   We can see you guys. Okay, good. You got us. Hi, my name is Billy.
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:10.880]   We can hear you fine as well. Oh, great. Oh, boy.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:15.680]   Welcome to Google. This will not be your average internship.
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:19.360]   We're looking at some sort of mental hunger games against a bunch of genius kids. We're just
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:23.360]   like a handful of jobs. That's a sharpie, by the way, genius. That's my fault.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:27.360]   Smile. One of the two managers is telling me.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.280]   Yeah, normally just putting a fist at without the words is all that's necessary.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:35.120]   Come on, bro. Fist me. Get up in there. Yeah, that's definitely not right.
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.560]   This is terrible.
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:40.080]   Yeah, yeah. Yeah, with it. He's so old though.
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:44.240]   I thought you were important. Sometimes the long shots pay off the biggest.
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:47.440]   That seems a joke. You guys got to start believing.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:50.480]   This reminds me of a little girl from a steel town who had the dream to dance.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.520]   I'm sorry. I'm not going to ever go see this movie. This looks like the worst thing I've ever
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:58.400]   seen in my life. I think we're required to go see this movie.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.520]   Do you know the Google Beanie? It's a Newgler's hat, right?
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.200]   I want to go there and work for one day so I can get one.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:09.840]   Yeah, I'd love to have a newgler hat. Does it say it says "nugler" on it, right?
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:12.800]   It does, yes. And they made even you an adult wear it?
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.200]   You always it's a... You want to. You're glad to.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:26.880]   Google is based on going to Stanford. That's what it's like. It has a US university feel to it.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:30.880]   Because that's all that the founders know. But it's Microsoft did the same thing and I think
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:35.920]   it's partly to attract college age kids to make them feel at home.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:40.640]   So this was part of the... When I was recruiting Google, it was that, it's like,
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.880]   "Hi, do you realize how old I am?" So I kind of get some of that joke because
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:50.720]   their recruiting process is tuned was then tuned for people who were coming out of university
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.600]   with a computer science degree. And you're saying, "Well, I have been doing this for 20 years.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:18:00.080]   No, I never can be used to it." And I've had friends who were called in for interview and were like,
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:07.120]   "Really? Will you make me do this?" Did you have to solve a Rubik's Cube?
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:14.000]   I did not have no. But they say, "Here's some writing code on the whiteboard."
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:21.120]   They've tuned the process a bit since then, so they're actually able to recruit people who have
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.400]   done stuff before. But there's fairly well-documented stuff of this going wrong previously.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.800]   So I can see the joke and I can see that the Googlers would get the joke and finally amusing too.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:39.680]   But it's also, every time your culture gets focused on by mass media, you realize,
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:43.600]   "Well, they got that really wrong, but they must be getting everything else right."
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:46.240]   This is the running joke with mass media is that they trivialize everything.
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:54.400]   That there was all this outcry about Bravo's startup Silicon Valley.
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:19:01.760]   That was horrible. It was horrible. But if it gets somebody somewhere else to consider a career
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:09.040]   in tech, I'm happy with that. So you think this is a good advertisement for a tech for STEM?
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:14.560]   I take it as a marker that this weird shit we've been doing for a long time is now becoming
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:17.200]   mainstream. It's mainstream. It is mainstream. Otherwise, you wouldn't have a show.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:21.920]   And it's too bad it's not funny. It would be nice if it were a better script.
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:28.560]   This was the frustrating thing that frustrated me about the social network movie.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:35.760]   That was a marker for it going mainstream, but it was also such a weird macho, bro-ball-shit
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:42.640]   movie that all the women were hookers or- Oh, the social network.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:52.800]   But that was a framing narrative for a couple of years where the people
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:57.280]   will come to San Francisco to do startups. So I like startups Silicon Valley as kind of
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:01.120]   balanced that because it means we may actually get some women who are interested in fashion
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:04.960]   coming here and trying to do startups because that's the demographic that Bravo appeals to.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:10.320]   And they found people who would fit in with the Bravo movie. I'm not necessarily saying it was a
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:14.960]   great success or a great representation of Silicon Valley, but it was encouraging to see different
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:18.240]   narratives around technology and technology going to the mainstream thing.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:23.680]   The show is actually good. It's the good wife. I hear that's very good.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:27.600]   Very sharp script team there. They actually pick on real issues. And because it's a courtroom
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.840]   drama, they can have extended discussions of it. So that's structurally that one's quite good.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:36.480]   But that was the- So one of the things I was at this week was the
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:42.320]   patent office roundtable at Stanford yesterday where the patent trademark officers came here to
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:46.880]   say, "Okay, we hear that some of you- I'm not that happy with software patents. Do you want to come
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:53.520]   and talk about this?" And that was interesting to me in that I think they're feeling mainstream
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:21:00.240]   cultural pressure because this American life did an episode on how bad patents are.
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:08.480]   It's become a sort of a trope in the TV series of the law firm TV series. There's a bunch of them.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:14.560]   I hope that's the case. I hope you're right. Patent lawsuits are a way of ripping people off.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:19.520]   I think that was a good wife episode. I think there might have been one in suits as well.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:24.160]   People are becoming aware of it. Here's a link to a request for comments and notice of round
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:28.800]   table events for partnership for enhancement of quality of software-related patents. Let's just
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.640]   get rid of them. Don't prove them. Don't kill them. Get rid of them.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:40.400]   The interesting thing was that the people who were speaking were- most of them were lawyers,
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:43.360]   but it was a mixture of- This was yesterday.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:51.360]   Very, very nerdy people speaking as well. They had EFF people. They had the developers alliance
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:58.320]   guy who was really good, who basically said, "This was organized after the LODSIS patent went
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:07.440]   after all the iOS developers." He said, "When I represent these people who are building applications
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:12.560]   and their view of patents is entirely negative. If you can't reach those people, you're clearly
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:18.240]   doing it wrong." Another guy stood up and said, "From my point, if you as developers,
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:24.720]   a patent is the last place we go and look for technology. We have plenty of places to look for.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:30.000]   I want to build something and have someone done this before. The patent office is
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.600]   absolutely not on our radar. Clearly, you're not fulfilling the purpose you were set up for,
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:42.080]   which was to disseminate technology." That was fairly hard truths for the patent people.
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:46.960]   Then the EFF stood up. Julie Samuels, who's great, she's now the
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:50.480]   Cuban chair of getting rid of stupid patents.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:58.880]   That's the actual title, by the way. She's got business cards with that on her. She's stood up
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:03.840]   and said, "If you're going to get a software patent, you need to put code in your patent.
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:07.760]   Then we can have a discussion about whether that's patentable or not. As long as it's big,
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:12.720]   fluffy ideas and then some random example, and then you sue people on the base of the idea,
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:16.400]   you're doing it wrong. The patent office is doing it wrong to allow that."
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:23.840]   But do they understand what a huge cost this is? It's a tax on innovation. It makes small business
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:30.720]   people reluctant to do things. Keep people out of the technology business as entrepreneurs,
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:35.200]   just because the risk is so high, it's inevitable that you will get sued by somebody.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:40.240]   They're starting to get that. That was the... There's another one of these roundtables in New York
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:46.080]   on the 27th, I think, it's on that page. They're also asking for written submissions.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:51.760]   There's a link there to say, "Email us and tell us what you're supposed to. I'd encourage
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.680]   everyone watching Twig to contact the patent office and explain why this is a bad idea."
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:01.920]   Because their problem is that they're public servants. They don't want to destroy the economy.
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:07.360]   They don't know accident. They're trying to work how to fix this. They don't necessarily have the
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:12.880]   ability to change the law of the stroke like Congress does. But they want to understand what
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:17.600]   they've been doing wrong. If you can give them evidence of that and explain that to them, that
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:22.000]   will help them change their procedure. I'll be glad to. It might be too late for us.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:29.680]   One of the things here is that... Let's face it, that techies traditionally have not really been
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:36.320]   interested in participating in the legal side of this and the political side of this. So, by default,
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:44.080]   we've handed all the marbles to the side that has traditionally controlled this area.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:49.760]   So, until we have people wandering around in the halls of Congress, grabbing people by the lapel
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:54.400]   and saying, "Hey, this is our side of this," this is what we would expect to have happen.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:25:01.040]   Now that's gradually starting to change. But up until now, it's been so lopsided and so skewed that
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.480]   it's completely understandable how we've ended up with patents being just an enormous disaster
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:13.440]   for software and also in business method patents also or a similar kind of problem.
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:22.800]   But the... From my point of view, I went back and looked at this. The history of patents is,
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:29.920]   patents came out of a law that was passed by King James, King James, the first of England
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:35.200]   who of King James Bible fame. His parliament passed the law abolishing monopolies because
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:39.280]   Emily 8th and Elizabeth and him had been issuing too many of them to their friends
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:43.040]   and they wanted to stop this happening. But they wrote a loophole which is, "Well,
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:47.840]   if you've actually invented something, you can have a monopoly for 14 years as long as it
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:53.200]   doesn't disturb trade too much." They had some well-written clauses around it because they
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:57.760]   realized it's a problem and they've written a law to abolish monopolies. At some point,
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:02.960]   somebody said, "But they could... There's some good to this and patents grow out of that loophole."
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:08.240]   And over time, people that monopoly keeps growing again, you need to know one of these
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:10.880]   monopolies acts to throw them away. And we had that with the showman-
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:14.560]   - So you're just cutting it. - Yeah. But if you actually look at it,
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:21.600]   these things grow up and they actually expand when companies are in decline because they
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.960]   start looking for ways to fight other people off. They start looking at the world as a zero
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:28.000]   sum game rather than the growth game. In the growth game, you don't need the patent because
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.480]   things are going so well, you're busy selling things to people and making more. But once you
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:36.240]   come to this point where, "Oh, wait a minute, we need to stop other people catching up with us
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.320]   when you're on the other end of the intervention." That's when you start finding patents.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.400]   That's why IBM and Kodak have all the patents.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:48.640]   Of course, if you're going to get these occasional adjustments to bring the patent system back
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:53.520]   into line with something a little closer to what the original idea was, you have to have a functioning
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:27:00.960]   political system to start with. And what we can't even agree on basic issues in Congress right now,
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:05.920]   trying to push things that involve highly technical areas and patents and things is going to be a
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:11.760]   really tough poll because you just can't get anyone's attention and you need a lot of money
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.200]   just to get in front of their faces.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.200]   So the--
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.400]   - I'm not going to say anything.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:25.280]   - But the thing for me is that we have built alternative structures. So the goal of the patent
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:31.520]   system, after the monopoly thing was done, the US version of this was, "Well, this is to get
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.680]   you to disclose your invention so that after you've had your limited monopoly, other people wouldn't
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:42.400]   use it too." Or guess what? We fixed that. In the software field, we have GitHub, we have the IATF,
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:48.400]   the day 3C, we have all these standards bodies that publish how to do stuff and you can search that
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:53.920]   and find it. So if you're going to start a project now, the first thing you do is not,
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:58.800]   "I will write some code from scratch." It's, "I will go and Google some keywords and see what code
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:02.400]   exists. I'll go and search GitHub and see how much I can build out of existing things."
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.600]   So if I want to set up something, I will go and find some infrastructure and reuse that
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:11.840]   and build all that stuff. And then at some points, like, "Okay, now the bit that I wanted to do was
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:15.440]   this clever thing combined with these two things. I don't have to build it all from scratch."
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:24.640]   So we have a beautiful functioning system that shares inventions independently between companies.
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:30.240]   If you want a concrete example, just look at the web on your phone. If you're doing that,
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:34.400]   you're running WebKit to a first approximation unless you work for Microsoft and have a Microsoft
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:41.760]   phone. And you are running software that was started by Apple, is now contributed by Google,
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:46.400]   by Nokia, by everyone who's building phones, even operated at a just picked up WebKit.
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:50.640]   You have an open source project that all these companies who are suing each other and fighting
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:56.640]   compete in the market are actually cooperating on. So Kevin, go to Lauren's point. Go to Lauren's point,
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:02.000]   right? So we get the sense of this, even if you convince the patent office people of this,
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.880]   it's still going to come down to courts and legislation, and that's where the big money is
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:09.920]   still going to come in, right? I mean, the fact that you're sharing the truth.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.760]   If you're sharing the truth. Shared code or something doesn't mean you're not going to get sued.
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:18.480]   All you may be doing in some cases is buying your way into being sued along with the people
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:24.480]   that wrote the source code you're now using. Right. So the point is, so, yeah, when I was
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:29.520]   had a patent lawsuit 91, it was this was kind of hard to say, but there's a better way of doing
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:33.760]   this. It is no longer hard to say that. We have this massive existence proof is that we have a
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:38.960]   better way of doing this knowledge sharing because this is how we actually run the computer business
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:43.920]   now. The guy from the business software Alliance stood up and gave his sort of yes,
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:48.240]   patterns of wonderful speech and had a little slide up that was a grid of logos.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:51.360]   And I looked at the logos, it was like, do you realize that none of the companies in the business
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:58.000]   software Alliance were founded this century? It was this sort of iconic example of this is a thing
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.920]   that big old companies to defend off competition, whereas the smart new companies aren't doing this.
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:07.360]   The thing is that those are the companies that have a fair bit of money and they can lobby now,
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:11.120]   they can explain this, but also culturally, we can explain this narrative because
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:15.600]   when you say to something, so that phone you're using, do you realize that that's an open source
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:23.120]   operating system, but that's an open source browser. That is something that we are. This is now the
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:27.680]   infrastructure of what we use every day. It is no longer this corner thing that was, you know,
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:31.280]   Linux, which was only used on servers and you said, oh, yeah, you're using open source,
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:35.280]   you use Google, but it was, you know, you can now say you're using open source, you use
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:43.360]   Android, you're using open source when you use, yeah, yeah, iPad, you're using open source
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:47.520]   with pretty much everything you touch now. So I don't think the trolls really care. I mean,
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:50.800]   when you're talking about some of the big companies, the big companies showing after each other's
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:54.960]   one thing, the trolls don't care. They don't, they don't, they don't, they don't, they don't
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.360]   agree. So we need to stop and they'll get enough out of it.
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:04.960]   So we need to stop enabling the trolls. The problem is that the way the panel system is set up at the
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:14.080]   moment, because the cost of litigation is so high, you can, you can get a BS pattern and then go and
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:19.680]   threaten people without even finding lawsuits and extort money from the cost of going so high.
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:22.000]   We're looking at one and a half to three million dollars.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:29.360]   Right. So the, and for the troll, they don't want to go to court either, but there are, you know,
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.120]   there are a bunch of lawyers. Law is a cheap at the moment.
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:35.840]   The employment. Well, it's also cheap for them to file multiple lawsuits because they, the
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:39.920]   rough, you know, when they file one or 50, it's roughly the same cost. So what they do is they
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:45.280]   file massive numbers of law. All we need is the courts to, I mean, the first step is, and we've
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:49.920]   seen a few cases of this where the courts have said called BS. Yes. Well, we're starting to see
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:55.040]   that, but so the first thing we need is the cultural understanding of the realization that this is
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:32:00.880]   going on and its exploitation. So that's where the media staff, this American live, you know,
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:07.600]   stuff on TV, when that is the narrative, that's good. You know, like, then you need to have court
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:11.280]   decisions and then you need to say, okay, patent office, you can do these things with
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:15.840]   regulations, Congress, you can do these things by passing new laws, it will make you popular.
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:18.480]   Remember that's a super thing. All those people would love you if you did this.
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:25.920]   You know, we can make this stuff happen, but it is this political thing of explaining that the
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:30.960]   consensus has changed and making that clear to people. So, you know, that is assuming a level
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:35.360]   of rationality, you know, in the way Congress addresses technology issues, and I'm not sure
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:39.760]   that's really a good better. It's it's it's emotionality. It's not necessarily rationality. It's them
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:44.880]   understanding that they look bad when they do this. Politicians have, you know, a good at that.
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:48.240]   That's that's what they that's what they elected. They're good at understanding when people,
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:53.280]   I love Kevin's optimism today. He also said that that the Bravo series was going to bring
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:54.240]   more women into programming.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:33:05.760]   Because you're out the sun. There is one happy story and that's the new egg story. They
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:12.320]   they were sued for the shopping cart patent. And and by the way, this company that sued had already
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:20.960]   received quite a bit of money from other companies, including Amazon, Home Depot, Nordstrom, Macy's,
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:28.160]   Radio Shack, Kohl's, a new egg decided they were going to fight and they won. But, you know, I think
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:32.000]   I don't know if they would ever recover their costs of fighting either. I mean, I
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:38.480]   Well, so, you know, we had the same thing with the ELS. So the ELS patent was a patent on browser
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:45.040]   plugins. Yeah, terrible, terrible patent. And Microsoft paid them off. Yep. It was cheaper to pay
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:50.320]   them off regardless of the merit of the patent. And then last year, probably through last year,
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:56.080]   somebody fought it. Tim Berners-Lee went out to Texas and stood up in court and said,
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:00.000]   this thing was completely obvious at the time they filed the patent because of these other
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.880]   six things and the jury decided. So, you know, the other half of this is explaining,
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:10.880]   explains the people of Texas that they are being used by these companies to rip people off.
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:14.560]   And that may involve going to Texas to testify and finding some desk cases.
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:22.640]   And but also applying the media pressure that, you know, Texas is being messed with or something,
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:28.240]   you know, I'm not an expert on Texas. These are mostly in East Texas, these lawsuits. And a lot
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:34.320]   of these patent trolls have dummy offices in Beaumont, Texas, you know, just doors with signs on
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:38.400]   them, nobody behind it. And the reason I've been told there are a number of reasons, but one is
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:42.800]   because they fast track these lawsuits. But the others because jury seem to be very pro.
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:49.280]   Yeah, well, there's a classic narrative which is little guy against big corporation. And if
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:54.960]   you're doing a patent troll lawsuit, that's what you say. Right. There was a, even the Wall Street
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:35:00.240]   Journal wrote a thing about this this week. And it said something like IBM and small business,
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:05.680]   small companies are against big companies like Microsoft and Google on this. And it's like,
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:09.440]   no, there's aren't small companies. IBM small company. Yeah.
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:14.560]   IBM is because they have a big horde of patents. They don't care. But also it was like,
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:18.720]   and these small businesses, they're not small businesses. They are they are shell companies,
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:22.800]   so that by lawyers to exploit these loopholes. They're not businesses at all,
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:26.320]   and except in the sense that they make money. So it's, you know, it's constructing the counter
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:31.200]   narrative that isn't small event against large company, but exploitative lawyers ripping off
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:35.120]   businesses, which is, you know, it's the same narrative, just a question of who's the
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:39.840]   hero and who's the villain. Yeah. Did you see the Wi-Fi one today? Speaking of troll? No.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:48.080]   The, I guess it was Cisco was trying to get Rico against a troll that's been suing hotels and
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:53.920]   motels for providing Wi-Fi. Rico's the racketeering. The racketeering.
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:00.400]   Wow. And the idea, the idea was, and what they've been doing is it's kind of different than what
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:05.840]   a lot of trolls do. They're going for very small payouts comparatively, like $4,000, $5,000 per site,
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:10.880]   but they're going after many, many, many sites. And the idea was that they could go after them,
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:15.680]   you know, using Rico and maybe that'd be a good way to stop it. And I guess a judge just failed.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:19.760]   It failed. Yesterday, threw that out. Yeah. Said you can't, you can't use Rico. Now that the case
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:25.680]   moves forward, but it just goes to show when they asked the trolls about this and said, well,
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:32.000]   why are you, are you going to go after homeowners using Wi-Fi? Their response was not yet. So,
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.720]   so, you know, there's, there's a whole world, a whole universe of ways for these goes, these guys
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:41.280]   to go forward unless there's fundamental change. And I don't really see how you get the fundamental
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:46.800]   change given the kind of structure we have now. I mean, it's nice to say, yeah, if this is,
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:51.040]   becomes part of popular culture and it's on TV and such, that's going to influence
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:54.800]   congressmen. But, but when you come right down to it, they're more, more influenced by who has the
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:59.200]   most money at any given moment to give to their campaign. But there is a counter narrative, which
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:04.080]   is that, which is that when, you know, the intermittent windshield wiper narrative, where big company
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:09.680]   steals idea from little guy and gets away with it, little guy, sues and wins. And that is the
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:14.160]   counter narrative, which is still quite successful. In fact, I'm looking at a article about the judge
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:19.840]   citing with the Wi-Fi patent troll over Cisco. The first common is big invention stealing
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:24.720]   companies have done a very good job of spreading the troll myth in order to cover the fact they're
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:29.280]   stealing on a grand scale. There is that belief that that's what's going on.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:33.920]   And that motivates Cisco now. This is, this is where Laura already might have some hope that
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:37.920]   when the big companies start getting hurt and they do have the money and they go in and say,
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:42.480]   enough of this, we've got to change the law that when the odosia just become aligned
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:48.240]   with with open innovators and big companies to go together to Congress, that's when you might get
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:54.240]   something. Yeah, and I think that's why the new ache thing was so encouraging also. They went
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:59.520]   after that very basic patent, even though they knew most likely they'd never recoup their costs,
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:03.440]   but they said, you know, hell, we're going to do it anyway. If we saw more of that from companies
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.200]   that had the resources and the gravitas to do it, we might actually get somewhere. I mean,
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:13.120]   we all a lot of smaller businesses like ours will be put out of business in the interim.
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:19.120]   We were wrong. We were talking about the Chromebook pixel. Remember that last week?
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:22.080]   Well, now, now another report yet. Is it real or not?
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:26.640]   I don't know. Another report came and said that there was some documentation found somewhere.
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:31.200]   I don't know. I think the video was made by a company called Slinky.me
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.560]   If had I known, I might have I might have been less likely to play it.
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:46.880]   I don't know. I still want one. The idea was it was a touchscreen Chromebook with Retinab
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:52.560]   plus resolution. It's a touchscreen bit that makes me suspicious because that stuff isn't there on
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:58.000]   Chrome. Yeah. Just because you make it the point being just because you made a video on YouTube
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.720]   said make it true. We're going to take a break. We're going to get a tool to tip a number
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:07.360]   and Lauren, if you want to give us a maybe a suggestion for something people should
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:13.280]   think about know about just a tip, we'll do that after the break. But first, a little word from

[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:47.840]   Kevin wrote Kevin Newmark's just jumped up and the table fell over. I need a special message
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:55.360]   here for Kevin. Let's see. Let's try that. Can he always is umbrella fell over? It looks like.
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:41:00.240]   Wow. 143 Kevin 143.
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:07.280]   This is the son of a boo. So let's make my own. That's quite all right. It's thank you for supporting
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:12.400]   the show. Legalzoom.com for more information. Legalzoom.com. And if you decide to buy $10 off
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:18.800]   when you use the offer code this week in Google, Twig actually is all you need. Normally,
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:23.840]   Gina Trapani would give us a tip, but you've already given us a tool Kevin Marks. I can't thank
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:30.640]   you enough. Flash it, the bar, the love, and then there's a third one, which I can't remember.
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:37.360]   Didn't download it, I guess. Any other thing else you'd like to mention? A tool, a tip, an idea?
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:46.080]   There's an idea that I just stuck in the chat room, which is it goes along with the web RTC thing.
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:50.400]   It's like suddenly the browser is getting control to do interesting things. And it's a technology
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:56.480]   proof, which is you click on this thing. It turns on your camera. It sees how far away your eyes are,
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:04.720]   and it makes the text bigger. And because that would be far too much trouble to hit command plus.
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:08.560]   Well, let's see how old my eyes are and thus make it there.
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:12.480]   All right. So here we go. So this is a. Do it on your Chromebook.
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:15.840]   Oh, well, if I didn't Chrome, would that be good enough?
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:20.400]   You'd Chrome would work here. All right. So I don't have a Chromebook, but I have a computer.
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:23.920]   Let me let me load Chrome here. Yeah. And then it says, I can see your
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:27.520]   look see it sees Chad, and it's making it much bigger because if you leave,
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:32.720]   whoa, if you leave, you get smaller. That is pretty funny. So the thing is, you know,
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:36.320]   there's it's kind of a joke, but this is actually important problems. So this is the
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:43.200]   this comes down to the problem of design for phones and tablets, which is that the CSS pixel is
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:49.200]   designed to be an angular measure of with an assumption that the screen is 28 inches away
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:53.760]   from you because it was designed. It was the spec was written where we were using laptops.
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:57.760]   Right. The thing is, I've now got something like this, which I normally hold here because I've got,
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:01.120]   you know, a good near point. And for that, I can read quite a small type on that.
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:07.600]   This works really well. Whereas I've got an iPad, which I hold a bit further away. And if you're,
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:11.600]   you know, if your eyesight's going, one of the advantages of the iPad is you're holding it at
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:18.320]   that length that you read in newspaper. And that was, you know, so I was beating on Apple for having
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:22.320]   just two sizes before, but that was because they'd sort of hit these two Swiss spots,
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:25.840]   which is I'm either holding something here and glancing at it, or I'm holding it here and I'm
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:30.480]   reading it. But what you really want is this and they all have cameras in. You could do this.
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:35.280]   You could build this into the browser such that, oh, I'm reading this here. I'm glad to get it
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:40.560]   from a distance. Give me the big version. I'm looking over there. Give me that. Oh, I'm looking
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:45.840]   at the TV screen. I'm 15 feet away from it. Make the tight really big, please. You know, that,
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:51.040]   that, that, that isn't actually a useful use case. And it's about the using a bit of insight from
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:55.360]   the machine to understand what you're trying to do. So this is a sort of a precursor of how this
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:59.840]   stuff is likely to go. And it comes in with the, the wearableness. And it'll be, you know,
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:04.640]   it'd be true for the, you know, uncle, a little tiny screen here. It'll better make the type
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:09.120]   right for me looking at it at infinity. And yeah, it's not a book to me. You can't recognize
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:13.360]   your face when it's on your face. It's the only problem. Samsung, some of Samsung's phones
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:17.760]   start to do that with they at least look for a face detection. And then if you're looking at the
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:23.680]   phone, they don't turn the screen off things like that. So we're almost there. We're getting to that
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:27.440]   point. I like this idea. You don't want it to do too much because you don't want the size of the
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:31.040]   font. No, no, I mean, it's more of an example of, you know, you don't actually want it
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:35.040]   swishing around all the time. Right. Right. But you know, you could do it at the point when you open
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:39.280]   the page and you're running your queries is like, okay, how big is this screen and what's going on?
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:43.520]   Doing it at that point will be useful. So you can just get some sense of which domain you're in.
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:47.600]   And if you actually look at when you build responsive sites now, you have break points. You say it's
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:50.800]   either this wide or it's this wide or it's this wide. But you're doing it on width, you're not
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:54.720]   doing it on any of your width. And then you've got this multiplier, which is the pixel ratio,
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:58.320]   which is hidden for you by the browser and is usually quantized to one or two,
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:03.840]   because that's, you know, there's an assumption of you are this far away. In effect, those settings
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:07.760]   are telling you how far away to hold a particular screen. We can actually reverse this and measure
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:16.720]   it. So I think that was a cute demo. And the other link that I'm saying you should go to is
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:21.920]   eff.org/patent because when we're talking about the software patent stuff, that's a discussion of
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:24.400]   this. And it has a bunch of calls of action and things you can do there.
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:31.120]   Please do. It's funny that Mark Cuban is behind this. And then you have on the other side, Nathan
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:37.040]   Merevold, the Microsoft billionaire who's decided he decided, hey, I'm going to go out and become a
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:41.600]   bat and troll. Somebody hypnotized him? I don't know why. This was the same Mark,
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:46.480]   the same Mark Cuban who had originally said that the PDP should be completely outlawed.
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:52.480]   Your cube is an interesting case. It's interesting that he donated money to do this sort of fund
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:56.160]   this seat, this chair. Yeah. And and notched it. Notched of mine.
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:01.280]   Of mine. And notch. Good for notch. Good argument about why patent trolling is bad.
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:08.160]   eff.org/patent. And there's also information there about what you can, how you can get involved.
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:11.920]   And I've also put a site called fix patents.org, but I haven't actually finished building it yet.
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:16.160]   Oh, good. Oh, Kevin. What? I'm right on.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:20.400]   And pay. And the hashtag fix patents is a good hashtag.
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:25.120]   Fix patents, please, everybody. Lauren, is there anything you'd like to share with us?
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:28.400]   Lauren's blog is Lauren dot vortex.com.
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:35.200]   Yeah. Well, I think one thing would be an Android app that I use.
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:40.240]   Great. Constantly now. So there's something that actually be useful that I can that I like it
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:47.440]   impart here. And that would be it's called a moon plus reader pro. And that's become my go to.
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:50.880]   It's really going on. I don't know it. I want down money for really good.
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:57.120]   You know, typical formats like ePUB and FB two and and those and the pro version of it has really
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:04.560]   nice PDF integration in it very fast. And it uses the same user interface that the rest of it uses.
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:07.760]   Now they had a problem recently, which was some company in Russia.
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:13.600]   Talking about trolls, complained that they claimed that they had a pirate link in them
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:18.880]   somewhere in their network library. So they actually got pulled from Google play briefly.
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:24.160]   And they were very upset about that as we all would be. And but that's they came back now.
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:28.720]   They're back on. So they're having a 50% sales. It's like two forty nine right now.
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.920]   And that's really what I use. I there it doesn't. They go by that I'm not using that extensively.
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:40.000]   And so when you're not using the Google play for the books that are in that domain,
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.920]   for everything else that you're using in terms of ebooks that's it's not DRM.
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:49.680]   I really like that the moon the moon plus reader pro and they have a free version too that's that's
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:55.120]   saves you the two forty nine. But I'd say support the developers whatever you can search for reader
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:00.400]   pro. You think I'm having a hard time finding it with moon plus you have a moon plus moon P.U.L.
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:08.320]   U.S. it's moon. It's moon plus sign. Moon plus sign. Yes. Oddly, the play store search is not very good.
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:14.480]   Yeah. Did you mean? Yeah, it's not finding it. Well, only because it sucks.
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:21.040]   Laura's right. It is very good. I had problems doing an e-pump and I went through about 10
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:25.520]   different apps trying to get it to work and finally got that to work and then found that that using
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:30.560]   PDFs within it is why I should just do it on the web. I keep forgetting I can install from
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:35.360]   the browser and it's much easier than trying to do it on the on the plus what you want to install
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:40.960]   it on the 25 phones you own right. Yeah, I can install it. I wish they were installing all phones
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:45.360]   but I wish there were two. I also wish there were a function that says when I get a new phone just
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:51.680]   go ahead and move everything in this phone. You can kind of do that. Can how? Well, it's supposed
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:58.240]   to do that. I use the app brain sometimes to do that. Can't you get a list of the apps you have
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:02.160]   installed? I think you can somewhere. You can't. You got it one at a time. You still have to do
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:06.960]   one at a time. That stinks. Titanium if you're if you're root titanium is great. Yeah. If you're
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:11.440]   rooted you have more more ways to do this. Titanium if you're rooted is really good. You can basically
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:15.760]   pick up everything and dump it to another phone that won't always work the way you might want
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:19.920]   but it's a lot better. It'll take settings to and save games and stuff like that. Yeah.
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:26.880]   That's a titanium backup plus another great tip. And I'm downloading Moon Reader, Moon Plus
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:32.160]   Reader Pro. Our number of the week, Jeff. Remember the week I got a few. I'm going to start here with
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:39.760]   BitShare has a nice, you know, data vis thing, data never sleeps. How much happens in one minute on
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:44.640]   that? But it's a great compilation. Right. One minute. You know this one 48 hours of new video on
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:54.560]   YouTube 204 million emails sent. Wow. Two million search queries on Google. 648,000
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:50:01.280]   shares on Facebook. We spend 272,000 on e-commerce. God knows whether how much this is real or not.
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:06.080]   But it's really kind of nice to have a sense of this idea of I mentioned earlier in that
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:12.160]   wired piece the idea of the stream versus the library and it's really good. But I have to give
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:19.840]   you another number Leo just for you. 143 means I love you because there's one letter in I,
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:28.880]   four letters in one and three in you. There's also that could also be I hate you.
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:33.760]   God look at the negative side of you. You have to hang out with Kevin Marks more often. You look
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:40.880]   at the world more positively. I screw you. But it doesn't work with I patent you. So there you go.
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:46.960]   Thank you. Thank you for. I sue you. I sue you as one three three.
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:54.240]   Thank you Lauren for being here. Really great to meet you. Lauren Weinstein is at
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:59.360]   laurin.voortex.com and of course on Google Plus you should all circle him. Circle.
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:05.280]   Lauren take my words for you're going to like immediately W E I N S T E I N actually if you go
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:10.720]   to laurin.voortex.com there's a Google Plus button right there easiest way to do that.
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:15.680]   Thank you for being here. Real pleasure. Real pleasure being on. It's been great meeting you
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:20.240]   guys and I've been a big fan of the show for a long time. So this has been a real honor for me.
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:27.360]   Well we'd like you to come back. Now that you know the way. Is there any great
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:31.760]   ancient technology in that case behind love this component stereo behind you?
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:38.160]   Yeah well this is this is the this is probably the best one right here which is an old hardware
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:43.280]   MIDI. Wow synthesizer. I haven't used it you know in ages but it's kind of fun you turn it on you
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:48.640]   you press two buttons at once and it plays the demo tune. That's all I ever get on that
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:55.600]   thing's a demo tune. That's as far as I ever get. Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com that's his
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:01.040]   blog a great place to start in the getting into the world of Jarvis. He's also a professor of
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:04.640]   journalism if you're lucky enough to attend the city University of New York and the author of
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:10.480]   public parts which you must all read. Thank you Jeff. Thank you and Gina will be back next
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:14.640]   week she had a good family thing to do but we just do that. Yeah and of course if you're into
[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:19.840]   Android all about Android which Gina hosts along with Jason Howlin Ron Richards is a great show all
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:26.480]   about all about Android of all things on Wednesday nights. You're gonna Monday. Monday nights.
[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:32.800]   Monday nights on the Twit Network. Thank you Kevin Marks for being here.
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:39.360]   Thank you. Kevin surrounded by a murder of prose. Pardon me? There's only two left so it's an
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:47.280]   attempted murder night. Tuesday nights not Monday night. Tuesday nights. Oh you're right.
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:50.640]   All about it. Last night was Tuesday. Some of us get confused about what day it is.
[01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:53.920]   Yeah some of us work a little too hard to remember what day it is. I'll have exhausted.
[01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:58.880]   What day is this? Is it Friday yet? Yeah Wednesday night would be tonight.
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:02.880]   You know you all get Monday off because it's president's day but we'll be back here Wednesday
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:10.640]   every Wednesday 1 p.m. Pacific 4 p.m. Eastern Time 2100. I'm sorry 2200 now UTC on Twit.tv.
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:16.320]   Kevin Marks thank you for being here. Thank you Lauren. Thank you Jeff. Thank you all for watching.
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:23.760]   We'll see you next week. Next week in Google.
