[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   It's time for Twig this week at Google Jeff and Stacey are both here and of course the very first story
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.920]   We've got to talk about Facebook's plan to create
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:16.040]   Zuck bucks worldwide or is it called face coin? I'm not sure we'll also talk about the strange case of the cats
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.440]   On the Facebook feed in Pakistan. It's all coming up next on Twig
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.600]   Netcasts you love from people you trust
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.000]   This is twig
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.560]   This is Twig this week in Google episode 513 recorded Wednesday June 19th

[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.400]   This week in Google is brought to you by worldwide technology
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.160]   Worldwide technologies advanced technology center is like no other testing and research lab with more than half a billion dollars of equipment
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:10.040]   Including OEMs like NetApp and it's virtual so you can access it 24/7 to learn more and get insights into all that it offers

[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.740]   It's time for twig this week in Google the show we cover are all the
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.360]   Going's on in the Google verse not just Google but Facebook Twitter
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.960]   Journalism at large and that part of the reason is of course this guy right here who is our
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:37.360]   esteemed professor that the journalism or the large is the large journalist at the City University of New York the
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.720]   Craig Newmark School of Graduate School of Journalism
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.280]   He's the town knight Leonard somebody professor of German. I don't know. I don't have my
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.720]   Page in front of me anyway, it's Jeff Jarvis. We all know that be longer the title the less power you have yes
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.680]   Well, that's good TV blogger former TV guide critic
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.560]   Oh, I was a critic. I was a critic. I'm sorry. I have bloggers when he was young. Yeah, that's what I thought. Okay
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.320]   That's my bad that's the gig in Bathmar IOT guru in
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.600]   Her new abode on the west coast here with us. Hello Stacy
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.440]   Hello you guys. You happy in Seattle. I'm so happy
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.320]   I've been singing all day. It's been nuts. Oh, that's awesome. I think the weather is gonna be good for you. I
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.880]   Do too. Yeah
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.760]   It's gonna be bad for the earth but good for Stacy
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.160]   Well, I mean climate change hitting Austin was gonna be way more impactful
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.840]   Yeah, well, maybe not more impactful but in a more personal negative way anyway
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.560]   It is early to talk about this because it was only announced yesterday
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.520]   But it is to me maybe the most interesting and could be most important story of the year
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.880]   Wait, wait, can we guess yeah one two three Libra?
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.360]   Libra
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.200]   Yeah, Facebook's cryptocurrency
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.520]   and
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.080]   already
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.520]   France
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.720]   Hold on Zapp big boy
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.240]   Yo, not so fast
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.240]   Moc Zucklebog
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.240]   Has has the chair of the house financial services committee
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.640]   This is going to be a very
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.960]   Maxine waters. This is going to be a very interesting story. It's not going to happen till next year and
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.040]   It takes some understanding
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.840]   You know a little bit of research to really get what's going on
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.160]   I'm gonna refer because I think they are the smartest guys out there to the Wired article
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.080]   By a Steven Levy Levy and Gregory Barber the ambitious plans behind Facebook's
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.680]   cryptocurrency
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.680]   Libra
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.600]   The
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.520]   Deal is complicated first of all, maybe it's not even quite appropriate to call it Facebook's
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.440]   Because as Facebook will point out
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.160]   Libra is a
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160]   non-profit out of Switzerland
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.200]   Global coin the Libra Association there the Switzerland of digital coinage the
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.560]   Technologies open so sourced the control of the blockchain will be out of Switzerland
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:30.000]   The Libra Association will consist of up to 100 founding members of which Facebook is just one
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.000]   Each of them will put in ten million dollars to fund the association and
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.640]   receive interest earned off the reserve. It's an NGO another words
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:49.680]   Actually no, I'm sorry skepticism about this part, but keep going be NGO members Libra is not an NGO
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.680]   But it is a non-profit each member will be empowered
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.160]   I guess it is ultimately a non-governmental organization though
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.480]   in the most truest sense of the word because
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:06.680]   And this is what scares banks and scares governments it will be a global currency
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.800]   Not pegged to the US dollar but tied to the dollar the yen the euro
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.920]   Can I throw out a challenge just just down for just a second just just for as the discussion continues is
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.360]   To think about this as a Facebook or not mentioned at all
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.120]   Right to take that angle out of it and say
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.480]   Does this make sense is this a good thing for people is this a bad thing for people then we can add Facebook back in and there's
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.200]   Perfectly legitimate things talk about there is whether they're not there a proper you're right because Facebook kind of
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.040]   Tilt it if you say good. Why do you do that? I want to think about the
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.000]   theory of this too
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.160]   Go ahead say say okay, so we totally can but before you do that
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.480]   I want to bring up the fact that I have in covering technology. I'm sure you guys have seen this too. There are tons of
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.880]   independent standard settings boards or
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:04.640]   Organizations that have been created but are yet dominated by one member and I think it's important when we're talking about this
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.120]   To understand how much Facebook has here it does say that it eventually will step back
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.520]   But we have no guarantees there
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:22.000]   There's a lot of decision making that happens in these organizations and it's entirely possible for
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.600]   An organization with a hundred different groups involved to still be dominated by one or two major players
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.720]   That's all I want to say Fred Wilson, right? Maybe great investor Fred Wilson
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.920]   Says think of Facebook as the Satoshi of
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:44.080]   Bitcoin the creator of Bitcoin and Libra coin like Bitcoin in other words Satoshi
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.880]   Released it into the world Facebook came up with it technology and is open sourcing it. I think it
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:58.040]   It's also important to say that Facebook understands the value of this not being
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:05.800]   Facebook some of the articles out there have described as a zuck box. That's the frame phrase. I like and face coin
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.840]   If that if it's that it's dead in the water says
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.800]   Marcus, I'm not sure who Marcus
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   Is that is David is it David Marcus? Oh, he's the Facebook executive who came up with us. Yes, okay
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.320]   He was he was president of PayPal
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:29.120]   So here's how the Levy article begins near the end of 2017 on a Dominican Republic Beach with his family Facebook executive David Marcus
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.800]   wrestled with the question he'd been pondering since his previous job as president of PayPal
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:39.720]   How would you build the internet of money a friction free global digital currency?
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.920]   Would be a boon for many people with mobile phones, but no access to banking
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:53.520]   Which also coincides with Facebook's commercial interest because that's the the other billion or the next billion Facebook people right and who better to develop something
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.120]   Like this Marcus wondered than Facebook with its global reach and massive user base
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.360]   he was at the time had a Facebook messenger and
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.720]   He texted Zuckerberg saying it's time to talk about creating a cryptocurrency
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:14.280]   He wrote a memo the laid out his ideas and Zuck quickly endorsed the plan saying the approach synced with his idea
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:21.960]   They were thinking about this for a long time and with messenger Apple has kind of an in-in I messages payment using
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:29.480]   The path right the Chinese model that you can do everything
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:39.440]   Thank you, thank you, but this is where than that this of I think it would be a currency that messenger would run on Facebook
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:45.360]   But listen to the main so to your point Jeff. What if we leave out Facebook?
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.160]   But we mentioned the other partners visa mastercard PayPal
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.240]   coinbase stripe
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.920]   VC is like Andreessen Horowitz and thrive
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.480]   Kiva which is that micro lending?
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.680]   Non-profit the NGO even though this will not be a lending platform must be quick to that
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.000]   Yes, but there but there but maybe the lending would occur in global coin is the idea right women's world banking
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Vodafone
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.200]   eBay
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.400]   Lyft
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:21.600]   Uber so Spotify these are all partners in this no banks of course because if you're gonna pick one victim of this
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.000]   It would be banks. Well, the other one is not in there is and it's not a victim
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.080]   It's somebody who victimizes customers around the world is Western Union. Oh
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.920]   Yeah, this would totally replace that this this is this is that's what's one key to this
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:41.160]   I notice I notice M. Pesa isn't in there either, which is the African payment platform that is
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.480]   Basically widely used in lieu of banks, but stripe is in there
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:52.640]   Pay you is in there pay pal is in there. So there it's an interesting group mercy core
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.080]   Ribbit capital Union Square Ventures. It's a really interesting group
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:04.360]   Yeah, so there's a couple things about this that we should look at one is
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.440]   There's a lot of value in understanding what people are buying what people are spending money on and how
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.040]   Money flows around the world and seeing that in almost real time
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.680]   It looks like and again
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.320]   I don't know the math behind this but unlike something like hyper ledger
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.680]   It looks like the blockchain process behind this the math behind this will make that sort of information public
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:35.280]   So a company like stripes Spotify even be send Mastercard who actually already have access to this data
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.920]   It behooves them to have something like this where they can see what people are buying
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.720]   - Facebook says that none of the information would go back to Facebook
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:52.760]   Right, I'm not I'm not just worried about Facebook. I'm I'm curious what it means to make transactions public
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.280]   So I've talked to people in like the FBI and about
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.880]   Digital currencies and they love this because
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:05.400]   You can find out who owns what and see what's happening. So there's a lot of information and data being
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:12.080]   Available like if we're all excited about search data because that shows intent. This is like the next best thing
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:18.360]   No, it's the more best thing gosh. I don't know what to say there. So Stacy Stacy. Can you can you stay there for one second?
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.360]   Just so I understand what you're saying
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:25.600]   So because it's because it's on a blockchain all the transactions are
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.440]   Visible you can see all the transactions now there are ways to make a blockchain
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:40.240]   Private I don't know if that's been done in this case. So what I'm pointing out are things that I would be asking and looking for
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:47.360]   So it's a ledger. So it's necessary that there's some identifying well not public
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.520]   But they'll be identifying information with each transaction
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.560]   But it doesn't have to be connected to your public identity. It just lies with Bitcoin
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:00.800]   It could be an identity that you use it out. It can be enough. You can find out who people are behind bitcoins
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.080]   It's one of the yeah
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:08.160]   It's one of the things that surprised some people who thought that Silk Road and other places would be anonymous is that you can't I mean
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160]   I guess you can um
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:10.880]   so
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:18.760]   So going back another thing to look at is the fees generated like how are the participants going to earn money here and
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.840]   The reason I think about that is we're taking banks out of the equation in this particular example
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.720]   But someone like Visa or MasterCard is still going to want to have a processing fee, right?
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.000]   So how do you build this in and I think
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.760]   What we're looking at here and it's
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:43.160]   We talk a lot about digital currencies and I think one of the important things here is that it's going to be
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.760]   decentralized which is awesome and scary and
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.320]   Two you can do microtransactions, which we've been like oh my gosh. We can't do
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.360]   We've been waiting for this
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:05.040]   So right now we can't because they talked about this and I believe it was a Wall Street Journal article had some good Q&A
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   I think it was only this particular
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.120]   This could only do 1,000 transactions per second versus Visa's
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.160]   4,000 transactions per second. So obviously this is not up to scale yet, right?
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:25.880]   But if you got to that scale then you could look at something like or even greater than that you could look at something like
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:31.680]   Microtransactions being more feasible. So I think there's a there's a lot of things we don't know here
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:38.400]   And I think yes, it's probably safe to say that this is gonna up in something and it's disruptive and blah blah blah all the words
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.600]   But it's way too early and we don't know enough yet to say how it's going to be disruptive
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:50.520]   So I'm just thinking of the questions. I asked to figure out who's going to get me. Can I ask you a question Stacy? So
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:59.160]   Fees as I said, I you know, I've talked to people in and especially in African countries plus also Latin America
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:05.240]   Where the diaspora sends money back home, right and the fees and the conversion and the currency conversion both
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:11.800]   There's there's a Western Union problem question and others. Yeah is is fairly awful
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.960]   So one would hope and presume that this
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:22.120]   Does to that what what Craigslist and others did to the
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:29.120]   Horrible pricing of classified ads, but so they're fees in a simple Bitcoin
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.720]   Transaction now, what do the fees look like?
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.640]   Oh, you could set it to what you want
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:44.120]   Right, and the higher you set it the faster the transaction will occur because the transaction is done by the miners
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.880]   So if there's more money in it for them more coin in it for them
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.600]   They'll do it faster your prior get prioritized. You could set it as little as I can remember what it was
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.240]   But point oh oh one Bitcoin is a small fraction of a Bitcoin
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.640]   That's presumably how this would work as well
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.760]   Well, are there miners here? Well, this is back. That's for those ten million dollar
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:11.480]   Participants are they become I think they become the nose on the blockchain. I haven't read the way for yet
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.480]   I think that's the that's the idea
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:18.600]   It's so it's you know, I have you know, this was announced yesterday
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.480]   There is a law there is a white paper which I will read and I'm sure a lot of people who understand
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.440]   cryptocurrency better than I will I
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.560]   think it I think what's it so that and by the way
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.240]   France
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.280]   US and India has already introduced a bill that would ban it in India remember
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:43.880]   This is somewhat similar to Facebook's internet.org plans to bring the next billion people onto the internet through a special
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.880]   India went after and India said no
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:56.560]   They felt it was a lot of you know, I don't know if it's up to Facebook where it gets launched
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.840]   Well, let's put it this way supporting it on their platform for those users users in specific countries got it. I
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:09.280]   Mean because that's what Facebook if Facebook is truly independent from this
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:16.360]   That's what it offers is the fact that a lot of people are already there and Facebook will make it easy to convert is my assumption
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.760]   Facebook already has like my credit card information so
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:26.840]   Facebook's contribution to this at this point it seems to be kind of inspiring and providing the code
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:33.640]   But as Kevin Wile who was an engineer at Instagram. He was a product chief there
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:40.000]   Who left to work on the project said in the Wired article Facebook will have bought one seat on the council
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.120]   It oversees the foundations and will have no more rights no more governance
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.080]   That isn't exactly same as everybody else has
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.480]   So like I like Stephen Levy. He's a smart man
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:56.040]   But he also writes with access and he never jeopardizes his access
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.160]   So I always he is the friendliest of
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:05.320]   He is smart and he understands what's happening, but he is very friendly. Okay, so I
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.320]   Would there's other or like I'm gonna read the white paper. Yeah
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:15.440]   Yeah, the white paper of course is the most interesting thing and and also also this isn't happening till next year I
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:23.720]   Mean the reason I'm interested in it is partly because it looks like a grab by Facebook for extra governmental power
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.520]   You know, it's almost as if Facebook as if Mark Zuckerberg said well obviously I can't run for president
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.640]   What else could I do? Oh, I could be emperor of the world
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.720]   And and said well what about what about a global?
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.800]   I mean really isn't that interesting for Facebook a global currency
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:47.760]   But it doesn't look it's smart that Facebook is saying but we are gonna be one among equals we are not gonna be
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.600]   Running this show
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.920]   It is interesting for everyone. I mean I you know
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.140]   Except the banks, but let's get rid of the banks. I don't have a problem with that if we
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:06.920]   Exactly to be able to do transactions easily would be a wonderful thing hold up. Okay, so there's a couple things one
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.360]   This is backed by actual assets, right? That's
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.160]   not exactly unusual, but the
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:21.160]   The direct link to the assets is probably worth noting I think there I think they're really trying to solve the problems
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.160]   that they saw with Bitcoin
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.160]   right and
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.800]   With actual assets backing them up. This is predominant
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.200]   I mean this is a threat not just to banks but also to the banking regulatory
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.200]   Infrastructure and the protection set in place and and and state banks
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:44.080]   Yeah, well anything so like if you're the SEC and if I put my money in a bank for example and
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.600]   You know it is backed by up to a certain amount
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.440]   It is backed by the US government right or FDIC insurance in a bank
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.520]   If I buy bonds, that's backed by the US government. So if I'm
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.840]   Putting my money into Libra
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:07.560]   That's backed by the Libra association with bank with some bank deposits in it says short-term government securities
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:14.560]   With that we introduce a new buyer like on the the short-term currency or short-term bond markets
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.520]   for you know these assets we
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:25.560]   Kill that this is not a regulated entity at the moment. So there's a lot of potential for
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:33.560]   All kinds of things not just money laundering, but yeah now if he's in or just just a lack of understanding
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.120]   Which we see a lot in the tech community which is like oh we could totally do this better
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:42.480]   And then they're like la la here. We are with our you know trading basically our trading
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:49.840]   Pool of money and let's see what we can do with it and you know we've seen banks go astray with this
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.120]   But that's why the SEC is you know
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:58.020]   Changed rules about how much money you have to have and reserve if you're gonna do certain kinds of securities. So
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.040]   We'll see at this I
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.560]   Think those are
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.080]   More so and I am curious about trust and stuff like that
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:12.600]   But those are the kind of things where I think the the real story is going to be
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:19.880]   So lately all is quite point about the extra governmental piece here because I think that in the law whether or not
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:24.240]   This is the path that works or not. I mean before this we have blocked
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.800]   Bitcoin which is certainly extra governmental
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:33.440]   We have wars fought over data fought fought with cyber hacks now that is extra governmental
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.960]   We have wars in essence fought with this information, which is
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.280]   Can't is sometimes extra governmental sometimes not
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:50.080]   The challenge to government and all this also fascinates me. That's a huge just conceptually why you know
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:57.860]   So so what service what services do government provide? Well, they provided more security for currency which Bitcoin didn't have it was volatile
[00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.960]   So along comes this consortium saying okay
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.280]   We'll fix that and we don't need you government
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.960]   Now government is going to try to intervene, but at some point government's gonna lose
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.600]   Well, not necessarily. I mean they these guys may
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:18.200]   They may blow through all their cash and not be able to pay back people on their yep
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.200]   Yep, they may not be able to back their security basically
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.440]   I mean in some ways you're like you have a lot of faith would I buy Venezuela and are they pesos?
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.080]   I don't know I would not right now because that is right. No, I couldn't read more
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.200]   I'm not saying that this is gonna win
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.720]   I'm just saying that the challenges to government are gonna keep coming and coming and coming and coming and coming so there's two
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.920]   There's two parts of it one is the crypto part
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.720]   But the other part is just a non governmental currency
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:50.040]   Alipay in China is a non governmental currency that's digital payments across social platforms is in fact
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.080]   because it's Chinese
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:22:00.200]   Believe to be part of government surveillance there in fact it seems some say it's actually a critical part of their whole social credit system
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:06.680]   Is Alipay so there's always that potential crypto or not so I mean there's so many interesting fact the reason
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.800]   I think it's a story of the year is so many interesting facets to it and to watch governments which have pretty much ignored
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.360]   cryptocurrencies up to now
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.040]   Immediately step forward say whoo hold on
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.600]   Well the SEC has been regulating token sales for a while now, but they're allowing it. They're not there
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.320]   I mean what governments are saying now is no you can't
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.120]   well
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.360]   I think they're saying let's look into this. Yes. Yes. There are bills being proposed
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:39.520]   But I think that's a typical knee jerk thing. I think what's gonna happen is they'll use these as an excuse to understand and dig into this more
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.080]   And maybe they will and you know that is they're right
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:47.240]   Well, and also let's not forget banks spend a lot of money on
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.040]   Congress and they
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:56.600]   May act to defend the interests of the banks the banking industry is so powerful in this country
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:01.960]   What happened in 2008 remember all those bank presidents who went to jail? Oh, no, nobody did well
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.580]   Okay, the banking industry, but it's so intrinsic to our economy that they kind of had to do it
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.080]   So it's an interesting question
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.480]   I mean, that's what these blockchain guys are talking about as well. Does is it
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.520]   Intrinsic or is it just a 19th century way of keeping track of who has what money?
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:23.640]   Well, that's a really important thing to keep track of in a couple of days better way better decentralized way
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:28.280]   Well in we might this might provide it. I would say
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.720]   We're gonna have to wait. I'm sorry. So we're gonna go out on a limb here
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.680]   But you know well understanding I should have preface this with this was announced yesterday
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:45.480]   And we're all just scrambling to understand. Oh, yeah, what it means. I just think it's fascinating. Oh, there's
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:50.920]   And yeah, and you're and I think you asked a really important question Jeff when you said well
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:57.040]   What if you d took the word Facebook out of it? Then what would you say the problem is without Facebook backing it?
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.840]   It's not nearly as interesting. It doesn't have really the cloud. I mean well
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.360]   Hold on a second there. I mean, let's say two things one the internet has kudos right now with
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:10.240]   Government and media and Facebook has nuclear powered super kudos
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.080]   so
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.680]   You know, that's the timing is not great to do something
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:22.000]   Innovative and this is another conversation which I'll start after this about what is Facebook up to but go ahead
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.200]   Right, right, right, so so but so it's really almost impossible to take those two factors out
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.560]   Yes, but I'm just fascinated by the
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:33.440]   Structural question here about currency and what works and what's a better service for people?
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.800]   We've already talked about the international piece of this if you could take out all the middlemen to enable
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.880]   What do they call it when they when you send money back home?
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.840]   This award for
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.080]   Money orders. No, no
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.280]   Thank you, we're gonna since
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.560]   To make that smooth and and take out currency transfers and
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.520]   Other middle-end fees that's good
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.680]   Also to make people who don't have a bank account part of the economy
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:08.080]   Right, so this is all good except except we still like
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:13.480]   Yes, the banks do not serve everyone. Yes. There are crazy fees, especially
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:17.040]   internationally from rich companies going to poor companies
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:25.880]   But I will also say that in many cases like the US and other like Sweden places like that the
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.480]   Banks are trusted entities and they're backed by the government
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.760]   That's one reason why in the 2008 we didn't let them go under as is the US
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:39.400]   When you give that power to something else, which is fine
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.200]   You may be
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:48.840]   Dooming people who haven't had access to a bank account to using something like this without any regulatory oversight. Yeah
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.160]   Yes ultra now. Let's go to another level where
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.920]   What kind of you know just within the US let's say
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:04.680]   What kind of of commerce does this enable what kind of commerce does does we chat enable in?
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:10.040]   In China that we don't have here. What kind of new businesses can be started
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.600]   What does that look like if you have this kind of fluid currency and easy transfer?
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:19.800]   I don't know the answer to that question but to me those are the things that are soon before we get to the political issues of
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.720]   Internet today and Facebook
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.960]   And now Leo
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.560]   What's Facebook up to well? It's I think I think it's timing your
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:35.600]   Interesting. I think it's it's their messaging services trying to be Chinese messaging services
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.440]   That's my first thought well
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.880]   We know they want that and that actually is not in in compatible with Zuckerberg's
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:46.680]   stated plan to put an end-end encryption and privacy and all of that stuff in fact in
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:51.960]   This day and age making it that way would make it more palatable to people right? I'd be more likely
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.360]   I mean since you turn on Venmo
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.440]   I was talking to something about Venmo the other day
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.240]   Which is by the way widely used Henry uses my son uses it
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.920]   but as soon as you turn it on it starts broadcasting your payments publicly to everybody and
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:08.800]   You don't turn Henry you haven't turned that off. You know about it, right?
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.680]   You know that every transaction you do on Venmo is public right, but you never turn it off
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:18.000]   Yeah, I do because I don't want people to know what I'm buying why does your father's paranoid?
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.080]   There's a social aspect to it
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:26.880]   Yeah, and what is that social aspect? What is the benefit? It's fun because
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.880]   Yeah, you put in fake comments
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:36.560]   You you make Joe's put in comedy opportunity. It's a comedy opportunity is a lot of emojis in there
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:44.360]   Some of it's genuine though, you know, thanks for last night. Well, nobody labels their transactions actually what they are nobody says for pot boos and women
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:50.040]   Right except my son, but that makes me think that you're not doing that. Oh, no, right
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.320]   How to embarrass your son
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.280]   No, he never said that but but I but I you know
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.920]   I of course and I tell everybody when I tell him about them
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.240]   Oh, and don't forget to turn on the privacy switch because it's off by default
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.760]   But I know Henry knows that he leaves it on
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:14.040]   He leaves probably leaves his transactions public. So I think that's kind of fun. There's something there's a social aspect to it
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.760]   Well, there's also
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:22.200]   There was a couple probably about a year or two ago the Venmo transactions were being scanned by and I can't think of the name of the committee
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:29.120]   but the terror the anti terrorist group or anti terrorist banking committee because people were like for anthrax or whatever and
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.800]   They were like nope and people were getting their accounts to support anthrax
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:36.440]   Please I'm gonna use Venmo to buy anthrax
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.560]   Come on
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:46.920]   These were these were jokey comment. This was but this one was this yeah, this was accidental, right?
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.080]   No, this was somebody somebody went through and and
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:57.080]   scraped Venmo to because you can't just because you can yeah, I know that
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:03.600]   Just to show that hey, this is a computer science student who wanted to demonstrate to his peers
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.160]   Dan salmon
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:11.040]   That you know you should really think about what you're doing here. This has been going on forever
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.320]   This is not you know, I mean truthfully everybody knows that it's public
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.240]   Well, not I mean people are still flummoxed by this stuff
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.320]   I always think everybody knows that this is public everybody knows how this works. No one knows how these things
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:31.320]   Well, it goes back to the Facebook discussion of you don't have a your own presumption of privacy on Facebook
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.840]   Yeah, cuz you just shared things and everybody's having to fit about it
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:40.320]   But they're finally saying the true fact which is once you've shared things you can't resume, but it's private
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.080]   Wait, I got to tell you the best story because if you haven't read this Jeff
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.320]   Okay, this is gonna get into
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.920]   No, no, okay
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.480]   Pinboard I know
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.120]   And mache I love mache a Kclavski
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:04.360]   So did you read his story on my gosh ambient privacy because we should talk about that
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:10.240]   It's because that is in the list. I was really impressed by that and we came segue into this
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.220]   He is becoming by the way a great thinker. I am
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.120]   Really enjoying his blog
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:22.480]   In fact, I've been meaning to talk to him because I think he would be a great podcast host on our network
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.920]   But in any event this was a really interesting story
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.080]   About why privacy is important. I thought
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:37.240]   Go ahead and he put it up. He put into words what I have I and many people like me have been saying for like a decade
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:44.520]   Yeah, which is when you have computers and their awesome computing power and ability to retain information in ways that humans cannot
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:48.760]   They can hold and store information even tiny little bits
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:56.080]   They can analyze it and put it together in ways that normal people cannot and they will keep that information and build upon it for the next forever
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.320]   And it is searchable forever and he calls this ambient privacy
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.120]   Which is the idea that one by one
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:10.280]   Pieces of information don't matter, but most people are not aware of how that information gets aggregated
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:16.400]   Stored and then referred back to over time and that is where we're getting into
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.120]   That's where we're losing our privacy
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.560]   So Jeff you and I argue a lot
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:27.200]   I think because you're talking about privacy in the moment and I'm talking about this concept of ambient privacy
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.200]   So I was so excited to read this story
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.160]   Where is it going to run down a new rule or this there is it's I don't words
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:38.320]   I got it before I just couldn't fight it again. Yeah, so he says this is my I'll read a couple paragraphs
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:45.520]   Just because it's he's a great writer seen in this light the giant tech companies can make a credible claim to be the defenders of privacy
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.040]   Just like a dragon can truthfully boast. It's good at protecting its horde of gold
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:55.760]   Nobody spends more money than securing user data or does it more effectively than Facebook and Google?
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:01.240]   And this has always been the kind of disconnect we say Facebook isn't giving away your privacy. They're keeping it to themselves
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.600]   It's too valuable. He says the question we need to ask is not whether our data is safe
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:12.920]   But why all of a sudden is there so much of it that needs protection the problem with the dragon after all is not its
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.200]   stockpile stewardship
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.200]   but it's appetite and
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:22.440]   That's when he brings up the phrase ambient privacy understanding there's value in having our
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:30.920]   Just it's our trivial most trivial everyday transactions the smallest details of our lives up until very recently
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:35.640]   Would pass on remembered but all of a sudden everything's being recorded
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:41.280]   And he says not every conversation needs to be a deposition. I love that
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:47.200]   It's a really good post so two things one looking for a book of reading
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.280]   Before we got on the air call this air
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.200]   I
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.200]   mentioned to Leo that a
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.720]   Friend of ours in the technology world. I'm not gonna say who it is
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.160]   Because I don't want to violate the person's privacy
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:09.400]   It was a private communication, but said that this person had a fib and was wondering whether to go through an operation
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.120]   And I'm not a doctor
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:10.960]   Don't play one on TV
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:16.720]   But I share the reason this person could come to me and we could share information and I recommended the cardia
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.560]   And I told my my experiences because I have been public years ago
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:24.520]   2001 is when I got a fib and I wrote about it
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:29.720]   And and I haven't written about it hardly any since so is that ambient?
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:34.240]   Yeah, it's back there. It's out there. It's searchable and good comes of it
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:41.480]   So that's not I would argue that's sharing which is very different so well, but sharing can take me
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.080]   What what's 711 you walk into and when is not?
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:54.560]   Yes, so ambient privacy would be you walking into your clinic it being logged on your four square account
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:02.840]   And maybe a surveillance camera nearby in a computer somewhere putting that together and saying oh Jeff has a fib and then decisions being
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.720]   Made for that for the rest of your life based on that inference
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:10.120]   That is what I always argument to this is always is always
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.160]   I gain a boy taught me this
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:20.680]   You control the use of the knowledge. You don't try to control the knowledge in a free and modern society one based on a
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:28.880]   Freedom of information and thought and expression trying to control knowledge is a dangerous concept and one you can't really win at because
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:35.640]   The knowledge is out there. You know why I bought Cartier somewhere. There's a transaction that knows that my bank knows that my ISP knows that
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:41.560]   Tons of people know I bought Cartier so they can tell if they want to who has a fib because who else would buy Cartier
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.720]   Which by the way, it's a very good product. I recommend it to anybody out there if you want to have a quick and easy
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.040]   Night at dollar EKG. That's approved by doctors
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:54.680]   So right so so the issue there is not that that transaction exists somewhere in data
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:59.600]   The issue is what is done with it the the the regulation as I wrote in a post
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:04.480]   The last week about about regulation is this not about regulating the internet or regulating the technology
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.440]   It's about regulating human behavior whether that human behavior is a big company or an individual person
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.520]   That's what we've always regulated the law and we still need to regulate
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:20.920]   So the challenge I think that we've had in having these regulatory or in talking about this regulation regulations is we haven't
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:28.640]   been addressing this type of privacy we have been addressing individual one-off uses of hey
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.320]   Don't share naked pictures or hey
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:38.400]   We've decided that children are protected class and their data should not be floating around the internet. So I think
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:45.800]   By putting words to this and by by introducing the concept in a very a very good way
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:51.640]   I think he's helping drive a conversation that we haven't really had the words to have well
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.880]   He and he also points to a significant consequence
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:36:01.280]   To the loss of it now. Let me read another paragraph my own suspicion is that ambient ambient privacy this kind of trivial privacy
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:07.960]   plays an important role in civic life when all discussion takes place under the eye of software in a
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:13.080]   For-profit medium working to shape the participants behavior it may not be possible
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:19.880]   To create the consensus and shared sense of reality that is a pre-requisite for self-government if that's true
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:26.280]   Then the move away from ambient privacy will be an irreversible change because it will remove our ability to function as a democracy
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.880]   This is this is a symptom
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:33.640]   That I've been noticing that everybody's been noticing and I can I'm concerned about it
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.840]   I don't know if I accept his causal link to it
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.720]   and to the loss of ambient privacy
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:46.760]   But I feel like Joan Donovan has talked about this as well. Yeah, I think she probably thinks about it a lot
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:52.360]   I just want to be careful that there is and we've had this discussion a million times. I don't know how
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:59.840]   A productive it is to have it again, but but I will I will you've heard me say this before so there's only have so much to say
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.680]   But there is ambient data about things like health
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:09.760]   That could be useful and to cut it off. We don't know what we're cutting off
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.840]   And so on the presumption that something could happen
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.280]   I get worried about trying to erase all possible outcomes
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:26.000]   Because you also erase good possible outcomes as opposed to saying what could bad uses of this be what do we then regulate and forbid?
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.760]   Which I'm fine with I don't think it's the gathering of knowledge is not necessarily a bad
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:38.800]   You have to look at does the good outweigh the bad not that are there two sides to this you well
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:44.120]   You can't go you can't go educated guesses and we can say hey going forward this way
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.240]   Like I can tell you that I don't know
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.920]   Exactly what would happen if I built my house on the edge of a cliff and you know
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.320]   with certain
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:38:00.360]   Engineered parameters, but especially with climate change, but I can say hey, it's it's probably not good
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.240]   So it would be awesome to have those cliff sides he side views
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:09.880]   But the risks are a little high there and I think it's fair to say in some cases that yeah
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.320]   It would be awesome if we saved 10 people from dying
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:19.360]   But if it's a hundred million people losing their health insurance, I would say no
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:25.440]   Well, so let's let's go. Let's go. Okay now. I'll cue you in the rundown
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.640]   I put up a provocative headline under other
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.160]   Cue the moral panic or treat the ailments
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:37.600]   language on Facebook posts is more predictive of some diseases than demographics a
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:42.200]   University study from University of Pennsylvania school of medicine
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:45.080]   Found that language around
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:54.120]   Some obvious things mentioning bottles a lot and glasses and things like that probably issues of alcoholism, but mentioning
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.080]   They all I gotta find it get myself on the screen. It's farther down
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:06.640]   You brought this we don't have to go into depth on because you brought this up before I didn't bring this one up before
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:13.320]   Yeah, but I mean I will I think we all stipulate that there are benefits to this mass collection of data
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:20.280]   But there but I mean nobody's saying that there isn't value to the mass collection of data. Yeah, sure you can diagnose diabetics
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:26.160]   I didn't hear you say it now. Well, I think we don't stipulate we there there are goods coming from this
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.300]   But I don't know it outweighs the harmless and
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:34.280]   Know the harms or the good for quite a while
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:37.760]   I think we're in the smack dab in the middle of the harms right now
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:42.720]   But you're also in the middle of the goods and and the problem is the media panic going on right now
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.760]   Doesn't give any attention to that well
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.920]   I think it needs to be done now because it's gonna be too late pretty soon
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:52.080]   But then we then make a like it's a environmental regulation
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:59.440]   And I think that's a really interesting and telling I mean there's a point beyond which it's too late
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:04.780]   He says I believe mr. Pachay and mr. Zuckerberg are sincere in their personal commitment to privacy
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:10.760]   Just as I'm sure the CEOs of ExxonMobil and Shell don't want their children to live in a world of runaway global warming
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.800]   But their core business activities are not compatible with their professed values
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:20.920]   This is this is that's my mind that goes too far the core business values here also enable
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:24.920]   I'm gonna say it again. I've said a million times living well black me too
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:33.240]   Yeah, black lives. We all know that we all stick in big white-owned media that now have voices out there that now can speak
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:36.720]   That's part of their core value, too. That's connecting the world. Yes
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.380]   You have me and Mar which is a horrendous thing, but you also have living a lot of questions
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:44.040]   Thank you, and how can you now think that you have the hubris to balance all of that?
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:49.440]   Here's the questions. Mache says we should be asking our discourse around privacy needs to expand
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:55.920]   To address foundational questions about the role of automation to what extent is living in a surveillance saturated world
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.400]   compatible with pluralism and democracy
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:04.840]   What are the consequences of raising a generation of children whose every action feeds into a corporate database?
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:10.920]   What does it mean to be and this is the key one to be manipulated from an early age by machine learning algorithms that
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.280]   Adaptively learn to shape our behavior. I don't think that's
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:20.040]   Worth the benefits that you see that we will all stipulate. I just don't think it's worth it
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:23.960]   So in June 27, 1900 Mark Twain
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.600]   wrote a letter
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.560]   I won't read the whole thing because it's really good
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:33.360]   But he says all the world acknowledges the invention of Gutenberg is the greatest event that secular history is recorded
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:38.480]   Gutenberg's achievement created a new and wonderful earth at the same time also a new hell
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:45.040]   During the past 500 years Gutenberg's invention has supplied both earth and health with new occurrences new wonders and new phases
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.560]   Skipping to the end
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:51.480]   What the world is today good and bad it owes to Gutenberg everything can be traced to the source
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:57.720]   But we are bound to bring him hundage for homage for what he said in dreams to the anger at angel has been literally fulfilled
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:05.480]   For the bad that is his colossal invention has brought about is overshadowed a thousand times by the good with which mankind has been favored
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.480]   It took 450 years to come to that judgment
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.960]   Okay, so we're talking about global surveillance
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:17.040]   Not books. You're also talking about global sharing. You're also talking about global connection
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:22.600]   You're also talking about global empowerment of people who've never been empowered. You're talking about a lot of good things if you put it all in
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:32.720]   I don't think I think we can actually separate the actions of surveillance from a lot of the things that you're seeing is positive
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:39.540]   I think proactively sharing. Yeah, it's very different than passive collection of information. Christing. Go ahead. Mr. Harvard here
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:41.540]   Do you think?
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:47.200]   The the past two hundred years of democracy are worth the
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:53.500]   tremendous loss of life that occurred in the 200 years before that because of
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:56.320]   the Protestant revolution
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.280]   Reformation
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:04.520]   So when I was in German when I was in Italy at the that's the that's the that's that's the trade-off
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:10.800]   That's the trade-off or you could say or you could say the press that's a trade-off or could you say the rising standard of living in
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:18.220]   This country and around the world is worth destroying the planet that we live on would be another it's similar trade-off
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:23.740]   There is no simple one-to-one trade-off my friends. Well, I'm just saying life is not that simple
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:27.460]   I think you can say oh if we just shut off that and everything will be okay again
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:31.020]   And that's what I hear too often if we just shut off Facebook everything will be okay again
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:36.500]   We're not talking about shutting this off Jeff. We're talking about recognizing what this is
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:43.980]   What the natural repercussions of bringing all this technology into our lives will will mean for us
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:48.260]   And then say hear more about the goods Stacy. Let's I don't hear the good
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:54.820]   You want to go the regular regulators. I don't the regulators. Let's look what they've done already done to damage the Internet
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:59.820]   That's okay. I think you're being an apologist Jeff at this point. That's that's completely
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:06.260]   Interacting from the real question of the Internet the freedoms it brings no you're at this point
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:10.260]   You're not Jeff you're being a defender of surveillance capitalism saying well
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.820]   Yeah, but we got a lot of good things out of it
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:17.460]   So I know attention to the consequences as you pays me yep, but you're saying I know it
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:23.540]   I want to pay no attention to the consequences you say the consequences. This is just what happens pollution just happens
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:29.740]   Abortizing is generally being called surveillance capitalism. So Leo you're in the business of surveillance capitalism
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:31.740]   You're selling certain audiences to certain people
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.940]   You're the two
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:38.780]   What time I would disagree with you on that actually because we don't what we do is we create
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:42.460]   Content that attracts a certain kind of person. We don't know for a fact
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:47.580]   You're turning Leo's business model in this drama and here don't be well fun, but I love media
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:49.740]   So it's timing of the many times of war
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:55.420]   I can go to axiom far before the Internet and give more data than I then could an Internet company
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:45:02.660]   I also understand the Internet. I am I'm worried section 230 that the kind section 230 is in danger right now
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:08.420]   I just just there are bad laws, but you can't that's not the reason to not think about any regulation
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:14.740]   I'm not saying I've written long post which I've read to the show where I there are regulatory regimes that I endorse
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:20.940]   The internet court I endorse the French structure I endorse I endorse regulatory regimes, but I don't endorse
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:25.900]   This this idea that that labeling the entire Internet surveillance
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:32.540]   Is gonna be is gonna be beneficial because it leads us to bad law like we have and like law that was proposed today
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.820]   About section 230 you want to hear about that law from our dear government?
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:39.020]   No, no, I want to move on for this topic
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:44.940]   That's one way to move on let's get me on this. I'm gonna get on this one no matter what
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:51.660]   Was really dangerous to the Internet. This is a proposed law not an actual law, right? But yes
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:58.700]   What is who is doing this and what is the proposal? Oh, that that they would give section through the 30 protection
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:02.180]   Only to companies that show that they are not
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:05.060]   engaged in
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.100]   political
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:08.100]   Leaning in their moderation
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:14.220]   This is an effort on the right to say Facebook and Google and Twitter you must oh
[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:17.940]   Josh Holly's this is Josh Holly's new bill. Oh
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:24.260]   Act on 230 and it's one of many attacks that are gonna come I'm not saying this law is gonna pass as is so
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:30.140]   Has proposed a bill called ending support for internet censorship act?
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:38.580]   Which would say that companies would be stripped of their safe harbor immunity their section 230 immunity if they exhibit
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:40.980]   political bias or
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:44.540]   moderate in a way that disadvantages certain political candidates or viewpoints
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:48.220]   I guess you could say this is bringing back the equal time amendment
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:50.700]   Mmm
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:54.900]   No, I would put it another way. I think that it is a government
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:59.620]   It is it is so absurd to the First Amendment. It's kind of ironic because doing that
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:02.220]   I bet you anything Josh Holly was against equal time
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:07.620]   It's gonna try to break out. Yeah, it's gonna try to regulate the internet like broadcast which I would find to be abhorrent
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.900]   um
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.900]   So by the way Ted Cruz
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:15.060]   and Nancy Pelosi
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:20.780]   Have I think might be in bed with this because
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:27.100]   They've threatened companies like Facebook and Twitter with modifications to the law of
[00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.820]   230
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:35.460]   Very nervous about the talk about oh, let's just regulate the internet
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:40.020]   We're gonna lose freedoms. We're gonna lose the potential this brings
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:44.260]   So I'm sorry, but I'm not an apologist for any company what you do to those companies
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:49.020]   You do the internet and when I'm defending is the internet and the freedoms that it brings like this though, Jeff
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:51.020]   What about this thought that?
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:56.580]   These companies are not the internet these companies are Google Facebook
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:02.860]   What whatever you want to pick and really their goal is not to have a free and open internet
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:06.340]   Their goal is to collect this information like the dragon and hoard it to themselves
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:12.060]   They are not saying oh, this is all great. We're gonna share this is not the internet
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.420]   this is some specific companies who are
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:18.500]   aggressively pursuing the aggregation of this information and
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:24.620]   Protecting it keeping it to themselves the worst companies. I think we can all agree are the telecos
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:29.980]   Yeah, I would say the worst companies are the data brokers. However, I don't I don't care
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:36.660]   Who's the worst company? I care as an individual that I am powerless to control the flow of my data and the protection of my data
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:43.540]   And but people that's gonna just concept of my data most data is a transaction and there's an other side of that transaction
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:46.740]   And who's to say who has the prime premier rights?
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:52.100]   Well, it is the information is that you're walking down a street of city have two sides to it
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:49:01.700]   Yeah, yes as a journalist that is public and if you restrict the idea of what is public you restrict my ability as a journalist to report on
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:06.500]   Those things that are public how about what about the information about where you slept last night?
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:12.260]   Who's who's both sides and that transaction if I slept in a comfort in the comfort in has a right to know what that
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:15.540]   If you slept in information, what if you slept at your girlfriend's house? I
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:21.780]   Know but where is that information necessarily? It's probably my phone company. It's probably not at
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:28.180]   No, I'm using face recognition on a camera. That's running on a street and Google knows it
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:31.260]   Go for its house Google knows it because it's on your phone. Yeah
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.020]   We'll go back to the street
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:36.020]   again, what's public is public and
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:44.980]   What's public though, Jeff is now that's very easy and cheap to aggregate all of your information
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:46.500]   So as a journalist, yes
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:50.420]   I can see as a journalist people doing something and doing my job on a public street
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.660]   So I can go out and talk to people and get news
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:57.940]   But the government can also follow me while I'm getting that news see exactly who I'm meeting with
[00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:01.860]   Which means clandestine source meetings become way more difficult
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:06.900]   And they could also use that to track me or build a case against me
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:14.740]   Or you know, but you could also use this to look at the case we had just this week of the horrendous police in phoenix
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:17.460]   and the
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:18.180]   The
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:21.220]   surveillance cameras gave the case to show
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:26.020]   How they have used a woman is zero point. That's going back and forth
[00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:29.620]   Let me put words in jeff's mouth really quick
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:37.460]   Jeff wants to not regulate the collection of this he wants to regulate how it's used
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:41.460]   Yes companies. Yes. Yeah, that's what that's and I'm fine with that
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:47.860]   And I'm more than fine with that but what I get nervous about this idea that data is a scare word and knowledge
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:53.220]   Is a bad thing that's a very dangerous thing to do in a supposedly enlightened country
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:58.500]   I don't know if we're to supposedly in light in country anymore. I think that might be part of the problem
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:01.620]   But then boy, you're over that line
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:05.540]   I understand what you're saying, but that's a dangerous. Don't you read? That's a hard line in this day. See?
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:11.620]   I am I am very concerned about where we have I mean ever since the Patriot Act. I've been thinking about
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:14.580]   what we do as a country so
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:19.620]   It is a hard line, but it is something to think about especially as a term. Then whom do you trust?
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:25.620]   To manage that the Patriot Act didn't come from google or facebook it came from the government you want to regulate google and facebook
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:31.380]   I know but giving the government access to more and more data which they can get through
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.940]   subpoenas and they can't get through
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:38.180]   You know the use of tools from some of these companies does become
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:43.700]   You know a challenge and I'm not saying i'm not just against google and facebook. I'm against all
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.180]   collection of this data and all
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:48.980]   applications of
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:54.820]   surveillance technology basically again define define the words this data and surveillance technology
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:52:02.580]   Right a lot of this is useful and good and that is a very broad sweep that says gathering data and information is bad
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:06.260]   I would say unlimited use of facial recognition data by
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:15.700]   Municipalities and government entities is probably is a problem. I would say unregulated use of facial recognition in private places use to
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:18.260]   create
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.900]   Redlines or limit access to certain
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.700]   Would you require
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:27.460]   Faces be blurred that tapes be raised. Let's say is that a way to regulate that?
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.620]   Everybody feel about the recent
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:32.100]   Law that's passed in san francisco
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:38.420]   Banned face recognition in san francisco law enforcement's use of of of of
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:42.740]   I think that's good. We've actually seen how law enforcement is
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:49.380]   Abusing what if they're using it to find someone who's left the old folks home who has Alzheimer's or a missing child
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:56.020]   Or or in fact a terrorist, but wait wait wait jeff you're saying you say you want
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:00.260]   to focus on how it's being used this is a very
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:05.460]   Narrowly targeted law of about how this data is being used
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:09.220]   Right, so so karstin answered me this is I don't even follow the law this carefully
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:15.940]   Um if it if it's law enforcement can't use it no i'm against that if law enforcement can't use it in these cases i'm all for it
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:19.860]   Which how was the how was the statute written law enforcement cannot use it?
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:24.420]   That's what i'm against because there are good use law enforcement is not holy evil
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:27.860]   Bon how do you feel about unreachable search and seizure?
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:30.420]   I mean that is a law that is
[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:35.460]   That is a law that is designed for protection of our individual right you feel about
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:39.620]   Finding a missing child. How do you fight feel about finding a kidnapped child?
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:44.340]   I think i should not we should not break my my
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:52.100]   Sharp dividing line is if to find that missing child you have to break the the fourth amendment then no
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:54.660]   I don't want to find that child
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:54:00.820]   Exactly even if it's my child. I know that's a it's a crappy thing and law enforcement deals with this all the time
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:05.140]   I also throw in one little extra thing which is sometime in this coming week
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:09.220]   Uh ice is going to fan out all over this nation
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:12.260]   Looking for undocumented
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:14.660]   undocumented
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:19.380]   Foreigners and is going to arrest them detain them and throw them into camps
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:23.380]   And I bet you in many cases face recognition will be a big part of this
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:28.660]   Process the tip what's evil and that is not the technology what's evil and that is doing with it
[00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:30.820]   Well, yes, and please
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:32.260]   Should we
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:38.980]   Misstition what is evil in it though if if the face recognition produces a large number of false positives because
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:42.900]   It is inaccurate and people of color then you regulate that
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:45.460]   You don't regulate the
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:48.100]   Out but the operation that's regulation use
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:52.900]   San Francisco is done. They have said they've said this technology is not right
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:58.100]   That's specifically what san francisco has done is that they have said this technology is not ready
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:00.660]   This technology is right now
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:06.420]   You should not use this technology for this reason and this reason and this reason mostly because of the false positives
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.940]   Um
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:10.340]   Can you imagine a difference statute that would be better written?
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:14.260]   It says you cannot use it unless with approval of a court. That's why we have things like warrants
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:16.980]   That's why you can do a wiretap, but you have to get a warrant
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:21.300]   Maybe there are ways to regulate this without without going through the whole thing and saying all official
[00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:26.980]   Yes, but right now we can't use it because it's not accurate. So we're saying you can't use it
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:31.380]   Like you could ask the court, but a court would say I guess the court could say hey
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:36.100]   If you're looking for a white guy, it's pretty good here, but anything else no, but they don't know who they're looking for
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:40.340]   It turns it in no fishy mission to to fan out and search for all sorts of
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:46.740]   illegal immigrants. This is a completely legal move by law enforcement
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:48.260]   um
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:51.780]   And giving them more tools to do the wrong thing is
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:53.940]   legal
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:55.940]   But I would say immoral
[00:55:55.940 --> 00:56:00.260]   I but I also think that there are things that are right things to do and if we have that I mean
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:02.900]   I don't have much faith in my government right now, but the san francisco police
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:08.500]   Um, I think that there are there are far better ways to write this it was written in a moral panic way
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:12.980]   Which said technology this technology is bad in all cases. There are
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:16.100]   It's sense. Yeah, that's fine
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:20.420]   Jeff's
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:23.780]   We can change the subject but let's let's take a break. Jeff's
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.700]   Gonna
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:31.220]   Weans to appeal garlic that twitter went crazy about jeff's jeff's gonna jeff's gonna win this argument
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:33.780]   in the long run because I fear that uh
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:39.140]   No regulation even if they attempt to enforce it is going to win in the long run
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:44.100]   And so we'll find out what the consequence is. I fear we're already fine. We already know what the consequences
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:47.620]   Don't forget. Let me see again. I favor some regimes of regulation
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:51.060]   I've written about that say see you can you knock your head on the mic, but I do
[00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:55.140]   By just i'm going to defend against broad swans
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:57.940]   The gathering data surveillance technology
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:02.580]   If you were in China right now and you knew that chinese were using face recognition
[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:08.580]   To isolate and arrest a muslim minority the weger weegers. I'm telling you very clearly what's bad
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:11.380]   There was the chinese government. That's what needs to change right?
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:13.380]   What does a home call not face recognition?
[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:14.580]   Hong Kong, right
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:22.100]   Okay, you can't change the chinese government if they've got a surveillance operation that can stop you before you even start
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:27.940]   We're not going to talk about this anymore because this is we're going to agree to disagree on this because I think it's
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:34.420]   It's clear we and by the way, the garlic peeling video was debunked today by many people even some famous chefs
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:36.900]   Oh, man. I really wanted to try it
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:40.340]   Don't put it up take it down
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:45.140]   Carson is going on vacation and he's trying to speed this show along
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:52.740]   We're going to take a break and come back and we'll have a nice happy pleasant topic that we can all agree on
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:55.620]   But that's not not that's not why you list this show
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:58:01.140]   You guys just I've been I've been hanging out with my worry bird the last like 30 minutes
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.220]   I'm just like worry
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:09.060]   That that that video was BS because I have I have peeled a lot of garlic in my time and there's no way that works
[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:12.260]   Well go queue it up so we can watch it. It's really really tasty
[00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:13.940]   You have you happen to have any garlic in the house?
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:20.500]   No, and I because they injured my husband doesn't eat garlic anymore. So I was wrong with him
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:28.900]   It's it's a sad thing cheese. I hope to god. I never get to that point in life where I can't eat garlic garlic garlic
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.460]   Does to him what this conversation did to stay sad and me?
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:36.820]   He's a vampire. I'll just give Andrew a worry bird and move on. It's time to talk about
[00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:40.180]   Our fine sponsor worldwide technology
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:48.100]   And their atc their advanced technology said have they been building this for over a decade now? It is so cool. It's grown
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:53.300]   Well exponentially it's there's no other research testing lab like this in the world
[00:58:53.300 --> 00:59:00.020]   And you can use it you can use it from wherever you are 24/7. Let me talk about this lab
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:04.740]   It contains more than half a billion dollars in equipment from hundreds of OEMs
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:13.380]   People like Cisco net app VMware and then even small and new companies like tanium and equinox and ex expanse that are
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:15.300]   disrupting
[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:18.580]   WWT helps companies like yours
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:28.900]   Acquire technology install it configure it run it choose it and this lab is so awesome the atc the advanced technology center is an incubator
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:34.580]   For it innovation you get hundreds of on demand integrated solutions labs
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:42.500]   Representing the newest advantages in anything your enterprise might be interested in flash storage software to find networking network automation
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:49.940]   Endpoints security architecture. I mean as a perfect example here. You know, we're sitting here and we're trying to figure out what should we use
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:53.940]   For our how should our security architecture be built?
[00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:57.940]   We can go to the lab. We can configure it. We can try it
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:02.980]   We can and we can even do this remotely from here to see how things work what works with what?
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:06.660]   You can learn about products before you launch them
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:10.420]   In fact, that's how wwt zone engineers do it
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:14.740]   They use these environments to spin up proofs of concept and pilots in a sandbox
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:19.620]   So the customers can see how they work. They can confidently select the best solutions
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.940]   reducing
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:24.820]   your time of delivery from concept to
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:27.700]   market with from months to weeks
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:32.340]   They offer something this is actually exciting called lab as a service
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:38.020]   It's a dedicated lab space within the atc where you can perform your own programmatic testing
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.780]   Using that incredible technology ecosystem. They've built there
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:48.900]   They also have a virtual system. You can take full advantage of their unique benefits anywhere in the world 24/7
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:56.020]   In fact this summer they're going to launch a new digital platform with hands-on access to more than 200 new lab environments
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:01.620]   Wwt engineers work in these labs every day. They're beta testing new equipment. They're building reference architectures
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:06.980]   They're setting up custom integrations for their customers so that as a customer you can see the results
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:11.780]   You can make decisions with much less investment. This is a benefit for everyone
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:15.220]   I want you to know about it because you can use it if you go right now
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:22.740]   to wwt.com/twit you can sign up for pre-launch access to the new on-demand lab platform
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:30.500]   Wwt simplifies the complex wwt worldwide technology wwt.com/twit
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:34.980]   Wwt is delivering business and technology outcomes around the world
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:37.940]   Let them deliver them to your door
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:42.180]   Thank you wwt for supporting this week in google
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:46.420]   And thank you for supporting twig by using that special url
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:52.660]   So deep fake garlic are you telling me it's deep fake show the garlic roll the garlic is this on twitter?
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:54.660]   I miss this somehow
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:57.860]   This is a video on twitter of a way to peel garlic
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:01.860]   You take the knife you take the garlic. What is she using to do this?
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.460]   A knife
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:07.540]   She's bringing the knife in the bottom of the garlic and pulling it out from the papery leaves
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:10.660]   So you don't have to peel it. Let me just tell you this is this has got to be
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:13.140]   maybe like
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.340]   A month
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:19.460]   Two-month-old garlic for this to work. There's no there's just no with fresh garlic you don't
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:23.540]   Garlic this the skin is very so a number of big-time chefs
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:27.620]   Debunked it and one guy actually cut himself to it. Oh, jeez
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.580]   So no
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.900]   Here's another story. I love this story
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:36.580]   Rap genius, which is a site for lyrics
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:40.580]   It's a crowdsource site for lyrics, but it is the place if I want to know lyrics
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:42.580]   I'd like to go but lately, you know
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:44.100]   The
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:48.820]   We have all realized the best way to figure out what the lyrics in a song are just ask google google
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:51.540]   song name and lyrics
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.940]   Let's let's try it with not today
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:58.260]   Lyrics by lsia carer
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.740]   And see this is the thing it's not a snippet
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.620]   It's not like so nzusz
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:06.340]   It's the whole freaking lyric
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:10.420]   Oh, well the fun of rap genius is it's annotated to explain. I agree
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:14.420]   What the heck things are I agree and if you do this on google
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:20.500]   You know, okay, if you don't understand the fun of rap genius, you're gonna probably find this now google does
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:26.340]   Immediately right beneath it. Yeah, the copyright notice, which is funny comes from the music publisher
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:30.580]   But it turns out that's not where that's new as of as of this is
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:35.780]   Source source lyric find is new because here's what happened rap genius
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:39.860]   It turns out i've been doing with a lot of Mac makers have been doing for hundreds of years putting
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:44.740]   different information in the lyrics in this case
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:47.780]   choosing between smart
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:50.900]   apostrophes and dumb apostrophes
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:54.900]   in the punctuation they've been watermarking lyrics on their website
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:59.860]   And in fact, let me just show you because it's even cleverer than that
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:06.820]   Because the mix of straight apostrophes and korea apostrophes can be used to create a morse code
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:10.100]   That when you spell it out
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.540]   Watch this here it comes gives you the words
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:18.980]   Da da da da da da da da da da da red handed
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:23.460]   Well, yeah
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:30.100]   Apparently, uh, even though those were unique to genius google was displaying them now google's explanation is
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:35.540]   Oh, uh, we don't scrape the net directly. We use lyric find to do that
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:39.860]   This is by the way the excuse that companies have used for years
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:45.380]   That way just hire a third party and they they break the law on our behalf lyric find says no
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:49.620]   We have a military
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.380]   Right
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:56.500]   We have a whole team a content team that does you know, sometimes we get them from the artist
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.740]   Sometimes we get them from websites
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:05.460]   What I really would like is for google just to there's two things google could do
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:10.180]   One is they could buy these lyrics from the publisher if they really want the information
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:14.180]   But what if you just gave the first verse and then a link back to the source
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:17.460]   Just like they do with newspapers do snippets
[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:22.660]   Yeah, I think I think that's that's right. I'm amazed that there hasn't been
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:28.420]   So if this had happened 10 years ago, there would have been copyright screams from the publishers
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:31.780]   Clearly there's benefit to having the lyrics online
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:34.420]   It must drive
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:39.060]   Attention, well remember we're old enough to remember when you'd buy an album and have the lyrics on it
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:44.660]   But some artists didn't want the lyric they wanted you to guess like the rolling stones never put lyrics on their stuff
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:51.380]   Right, right and I also remember when when i'm old enough to remember in the early days of the of the internet that I so dearly love and protect that
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:57.380]   Uh, if you put up more than n lines of lyrics you get you were in trouble
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:03.140]   And that's kind of gone away. That's interesting because it is copy it is
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:06.900]   Publishers copyright it's already copyrighted. They own it
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:09.300]   so
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:17.460]   Yeah, I agree with you. Uh, let's give credit to rap genius now just genius calm that the information that is on their site is much more than just
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:20.340]   lyrics here annotated but the interesting is they
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:26.260]   Get it off listening to the music so they're violating copyright. Oh right there in many cases
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:29.460]   They get it from fans. It's crowd sourced. That's what I'm saying
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:35.060]   But also the artist themselves annotate. I don't know if you've ever
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:37.140]   Exact that's why it's all seen as a good now
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:41.700]   So the funny thing what i'm trying to say is this the funny thing is that and I like the guys are genius
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.180]   They're very smart and I'm not criticizing them, but
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:47.700]   They are in essence vialy in the copyright of the music
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:52.820]   Producer and now they're accusing google of violating the copyright that they violate
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:59.540]   Now the truth is that as you say the artists go in and join the conversation. So it's all a fine thing
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:01.860]   So
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:06.740]   2012 lyrics website owes music publishers 6.6 million dollars because
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:09.940]   Apparently posting lyrics is illegal
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:14.660]   But I think that's changed. I guess the the labels kind of accept it now
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:20.820]   And by the way, if you listen to a song in your amazon echo show, it'll play lyrics in front of it, right?
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:26.500]   Google's home hub will now uh, apples even will on apple tv
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:30.420]   I yeah, I think probably
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:37.700]   Just as record companies have realized that having music on youtube isn't the end of the world that having lyrics on the web is not so bad
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:42.740]   It's probably good for sales and I have to say I love the annotations on genius
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:46.740]   Because uh, I don't know. I don't know. Here's the problem with your solution
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:49.700]   Is that it is the ubiquity of search?
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:57.220]   Um, so what I went on our emotion. There's a license. Here's the solution. They licensed the this is back and went
[01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:03.620]   What's the year of that twenty four? Oh, okay. They're okay that I said correct. They actually did license. They did license. They made a deal
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:06.500]   So the one of their peeved
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:09.300]   Their pan so I went on was not a millberter
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:13.140]   Uh two weeks ago. Yeah, and I I needed I said on twitter
[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:15.700]   ARM me with some lyrics
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:23.220]   People and so some people on twitter did but I had to find the original and for the late that video. Yeah, yeah, so I had to search
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:26.580]   the lyrics themselves which were in the middle of a song
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:29.140]   and
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:31.380]   The only way I could do that is because google had the entire lyric
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:35.220]   By the way pan dora is being sued
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:40.100]   By the publishing company for tom petty rage against the machine and weezer
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:44.260]   Because they put lyrics without any valid license or authorization
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.220]   on the pan dora screens
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:54.420]   Uh pandora shows lyrics between beneath some songs on mobile and desktop and it's done. So since 2009 partnering with
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:57.220]   lyric find
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:00.500]   It's apparently in flux
[01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.500]   Yes
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:09.220]   It's a situation in flux. I just honestly I really liked what genies did they suspected that they were getting scraped
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:13.780]   And so they put smart quotes in it. Oh, it was very smart and they caught them red
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:16.660]   Handed
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:19.380]   Uh
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:23.220]   Let's see. I guess we could talk about rcs. This is just an endless
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:26.580]   cluster mess up
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:34.420]   The I love our arana mario's article google's ninth attempt at a messaging service. This is so funny. Yeah, a ninth
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.740]   All attempt
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:44.100]   Will be based on rcs, which is this rich communication services which google wants telcos to use to replace sms
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.700]   It gives messaging
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:49.700]   Basically a few of the simpler features of you know, what's app and
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:52.660]   messenger
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:56.580]   rcs has not been really widely
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:00.020]   supported by the carriers rcs
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:08.660]   According ronamario will follow after google talk google voice google buzz google plus messenger hang out spaces alo and hangouts chat
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:17.540]   Um, so now google's because they couldn't get the telcos to do it are going to run their own rcs server
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:25.860]   Importing out this is not happening in america for a very important reason
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:27.860]   Why is it not happening in a meriwai?
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:34.180]   Telecoms want to want to play around and they have a lock on sms so it's going to happen in the uk in france
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:37.860]   Can't inter operate with sms without
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:42.340]   Right permission from the telco's so google, you know says we'll provide a gateway
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:44.980]   That's not a problem. We're going to make it inter universal, but the
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:50.420]   You know if the companies don't go along with it then you have a messaging app that doesn't work with anything else
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:53.380]   Can I ask a dumb question?
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:56.420]   Why is it working apple it doesn't work?
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:59.700]   Uh here i know you was playing before but i just forget
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:04.260]   Because apple has a captive bunch of people
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:09.460]   And have also have a lot of cloud with the telcos but apple does support sms
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:12.660]   As well as its own database messaging platform
[01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:15.300]   So if you have to send
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:20.980]   A message to somebody who's not on an iphone for instance because all you know no android phone supports messages
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:25.780]   You will use sms so the carriers say okay, well, she's in a ropper. It's in a ropper
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:31.220]   Yeah, if you're like so when i'm on like i'm an android user a bit everybody's iphones
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:36.580]   So in because i am not using because my carrier doesn't support it
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:41.060]   rcs and because i don't have an apple phone on my end running the right software
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:47.700]   I see stupid things like friend liked this or friend laughed at all the time. I hate it
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.740]   Lots of my head i was like, please stop
[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:59.060]   And well the other question you might ask is well, why doesn't everybody just use service x what's app or facebook messenger or
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:03.540]   Telegram or there's a million of these but the problem is nobody can
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:07.140]   We just we don't need it. Can we just set a standard and just all use it wait wait
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:10.420]   There's an xtc for this xtc xkcd for the
[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:14.260]   There's all there's an xkcd for everything in the world
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:19.300]   They've they've dealt with this before let me see the chatroom probably gave us a link. They're very good on that
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:25.940]   um, but one of the problems i haven't run has as well with google's solution is
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:34.020]   That it's tied to your phone number, which unlike
[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:38.500]   Hangouts yeah unlike hangouts
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:46.980]   Means that you can't use it on your desktop easily you have to tie it to your phone specifically. Oh, this is the standards one
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:55.620]   Yeah, there are 14 competing standards 14 ridiculous. We need to develop one universal standard that covers everyone's use case
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:59.540]   Yeah soon situation there are 15 competing standards
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:04.020]   Standards are great. There's so many of them
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:11.860]   So that I I think google is probably the last company in the world that should try to get everybody use a standard
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:16.580]   platform so is it just hopeless as an android user will never have really good
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:21.620]   You know in some part like if you're in brazil everybody just uses what's app and that's that
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:25.460]   Yeah, that's so that becomes a standard so facebook wins
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:31.940]   In that case, we all use group is instead of group test we group text we use what's app
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:35.380]   We used to use hangouts, but now we don't know who's gonna have support for hangouts
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:39.540]   I really I still use hangouts. I I just I want it to work because it works on all my phones
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:43.300]   It works on iPhone works on android. It works on my desktop. There's a chrome plug-in
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:46.180]   Google already has the perfect solution
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:52.100]   It's just depressing. I don't I don't know what the answer is
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:54.980]   it's
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:57.220]   So stay see how the dog adjusted the move
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:00.900]   She's still barking
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:03.220]   She's not doing well. She is she's sad
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:06.340]   Oh, no, this is Austin
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:12.100]   I think she's just we were here for like first we flew her up here, which was beyond scary for her
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.700]   Yeah, that's really yeah
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:18.740]   And then when she got here we had like two weeks of nothing in the house and she got used to that and then suddenly
[01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:21.860]   We put her away from her change change on
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:28.260]   Suddenly all the furniture came and so we kind of broke the dog, but you know, we're trying to get her back onto track
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:29.780]   I'm sure she
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:34.340]   I'm sure she'll she should hopefully she'll get I mean, I don't know what else to do for her. Oh, she'll get you
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:36.020]   No, she'll sell that
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:40.100]   Treats many treats. Yeah, just yeah, we're doing treats. She doesn't like walks anymore
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:45.700]   She doesn't want to leave the house for very long. Yeah, she's afraid it'll be gone when you should get back. Yeah, so we're we're really
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:47.940]   We're trying
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:52.660]   Letter but she needs to pee inside the house everywhere to just to know it. No, no, that is not
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:55.220]   She doesn't want to do that and we don't want her to do that
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:15:05.540]   Casey Newton does it again block buster article on the verge once again talking about the poor content moderators
[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:08.660]   at Facebook
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:12.820]   Casey wrote a story about phoenix and then heard from a lot of people
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:20.100]   Uh, now it's caught it's it's Facebook's lowest performing content moderation site in Tampa, Florida
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:26.660]   Facebook does this thing that a lot of companies do which is they outsourced it they outsourced it to a company called cognizant
[01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:30.260]   It's a big contract $100 million for two years
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:38.980]   Cognizant hires people working for $15 an hour which sounds low until you understand that the minimum wage in florida is like eight bucks
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:42.340]   So people are happy to have this job
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:45.700]   But it is a nightmare furthermore
[01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:53.540]   Uh, Casey had a bunch of contact they have a 14 page nda, but case he was able to get some people to talk to him
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:16:04.260]   Contractors told me that cognizant had lured them away from less demanding jobs by promising regular schedules bonuses and career development only to renege on all three
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:08.900]   They described a filthy workplace in which they regularly find
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:12.180]   Cubic care and other bodily waste at their workstations
[01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:17.140]   Employees said managers laugh off or ignore sexual harassment and threats of violence
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:20.500]   Wait, why is there pubic care at their works? Don't ask
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:23.380]   It's on a need to know basis
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:26.340]   Yeah, let's let's just don't ask questions like that. I
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:33.140]   I stay see I admit when I read it. I focused on that as well, but let's just move on. Shall we? Yeah, let's please leave your
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:39.060]   It's a terrible play. I'm just like wait. How does that even happen? But okay. Yeah, I shouldn't ask these questions
[01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:43.780]   Well, remember too. I mean the other part of this and this is a horrific article
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:48.580]   it's in fact, there's definitely a trigger warning in this article because
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:53.780]   It just talks about some of the content that these moderators have to see
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:59.300]   And not just once but again and again. There's one moderator talks about an animal abuse situation
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:04.500]   He flagged it of course facebook decided not to pull it down saying and get this
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:08.980]   We want the authorities to have a chance to track down and arrest the perpetrator
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:11.460]   The moderator says and as a result
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:17.220]   This keeps getting re shared and I keep having to see it over and over and over
[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:20.740]   They have the video. Why don't they just send it to the authorities?
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:22.580]   Because they track
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.580]   This is this is this is a no win
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:31.460]   uh for for for moderators because the authorities complain sometimes about things being taken down
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:35.220]   Because they want to see the traffic around it to get to get to understand the network
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:36.660]   Yeah
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:43.540]   As the weeks went on the video continued to reappear in his queue and he realized police were unlikely to look into the case
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:49.780]   They kept reposting it again and again. He said pounding the table as he spoke. It made me so angry
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:51.860]   I had to listen to it all day
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:54.900]   uh now
[01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:58.260]   You know, there's part of me says you should get a better job
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:00.900]   Now go doesn't do crap
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:05.060]   Well, the other problem is this was this was true in the christ church video
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.860]   Is they try to hash the videos?
[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:10.420]   But of course the videos get changed
[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:13.620]   Right, so there are n number of versions of the video because they don't want to get around
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:18.260]   And the hash technology isn't smart enough yet to recognize pieces
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:22.580]   And when it does they'll use it for surveillance tech to
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:28.020]   Check out humans who've modified their own spaces to avoid surveillance. Sorry. Go on
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:33.780]   There you go against also apparently cognizant is not spending a lot of time screening hires, which
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:38.980]   Well, they give one example pretty quickly. Yeah, they give example. They hired a a
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:40.900]   moderator who
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:46.020]   Actually had been sent since to 18 months imprisonment for an investment fraud scheme involving facebook
[01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:52.500]   Uh, and also I think the constant barrage of these videos
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:56.500]   Has it takes its toll on these people and they start to act out
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:04.340]   Um, the result is a raucous workplace where managers send regular emails to the staff complaining about their behavior
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:10.420]   Nearly every person interviewed independently compared the Tampa office to a high school loud altercations
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:20.180]   Of often over workplace romances verbal and physical fights break out monthly address code was instituted to discourage employees from wearing provocative clothing to work
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:27.060]   Um, it sounds the smell of marijuana is so strong one manager complaining is getting like
[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:29.460]   a high a contact high
[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:35.540]   Anyway, it's uh, it's a terrifying and sad story and
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:42.420]   It's something probably when you read these statistics about the high rate of employment in this country. You should remember that many people are employed at jobs
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:45.140]   That are just awful
[01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:50.980]   Yep, and then and the problem too. So so I talked earlier. I went to the this
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:57.060]   Uh, a workshop for the oversight board that facebook wants to do that's not going to scale more the darn
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:59.540]   The volume of the stuff is amazing
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:03.060]   But the difficulties I said, you know, they gave us a couple case studies and people disagreed
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:09.860]   And it's difficult. I read today the the washington post has a really good reporting on a rich new york couple that's that's
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:17.140]   Contruity more than three million dollars to anti-vax stuff. Yeah, and so they're out there everywhere. They're doing this stuff
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:24.180]   How do you how do you play wack-a-mole? Not with a bad video not with a bad image with a bad idea content? I know
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:30.580]   Um facebook now higher has employed 30,000 people in this in these jobs
[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:33.220]   And as I like to point out at this moment
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:38.820]   There are a few and again it's apples and oranges, but there are fewer than 30,000 journalists working for newspapers in the us now
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:43.380]   Yeah, so it's what where are we devoting our societal resources?
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:52.020]   To tamping down the idiocy of a few let's say it's a few who do this versus informing the many yes, we're fighting the we're
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:56.900]   we're dealing with facing with fighting the consequences of
[01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:59.700]   of these
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:02.900]   platforms instead of possibly regulating the their
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:07.700]   Their use I I just I'm so glad I'm cars. Hold on there karsten
[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:10.900]   You act as if as if I just passed
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:14.820]   Carsten I was gonna do something but I did not poke jeff with a stick
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:18.020]   Don't you want to leave on vacation?
[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:20.020]   vacation you really can't tell
[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:26.260]   I'm gonna get back at him for this if you act as if it's as easy as saying we pass along that doesn't what this story
[01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:28.820]   Demonstrates is how hard the actual work is
[01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:35.620]   Well, it also demonstrates that yeah, you and I jeff reasonable people can disagree
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:37.860]   Yes
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:40.820]   And thank you for calling me reasonable. I appreciate that. I'll call you reasonable too
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:47.540]   All right, didn't do it not call me another great story matthew miller. Well great not great
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:52.340]   Uh, who is a zd net uh columnist he covers smartphones and cell phones
[01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:58.980]   Published his story. I've known about this for a while, but he finally published his story sim swap horror story
[01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:03.540]   I've lost decades of data and google won't lift a finger. I don't know if that headline really
[01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:08.500]   So we heard about last week. Yeah, I don't know if it's really fair matt was talking about matt you and you was talking about it
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:11.860]   uh, he's the guy uh, uh, june
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:14.820]   Isn't that or I think it was matthew engram was talking about
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:16.100]   Oh
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:18.100]   It was probably kevin because this is his
[01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:24.980]   On the mobile pod cast absolutely right it was so oh, I didn't know that he works. He works with kevin. Oh, okay
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:28.580]   Yeah, they have the the mobile tech roundup is the name of their podcast
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:31.220]   So you'd think he'd know better
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:33.860]   He had a t mobile phone
[01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:37.860]   Uh, he got up in the morning his oldest daughter shook his shoulder and said
[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:42.740]   Actually, no, I'm sorry it was 1130 at night and said your twitter account's been hacked
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:49.140]   I picked up my iphone saw the text message that said t mobile alert the sim card for your number has been changed
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:52.260]   If just change is not authorized to call 6 1 1
[01:22:52.260 --> 01:23:00.500]   He uh, apparently had another phone with a google phy simonant so he called and t mobile
[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:05.460]   Uh, he called t mobile and said, uh, I did not authorize to change from my account
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:09.460]   I was getting I was able to get them to assign my number back
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:14.740]   By giving them the sim card id I asked why they would allow someone to call up
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.620]   And take my sim without my approval
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:22.900]   The representative said well, we can't really discriminate or tell who is who over the phone
[01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:27.700]   And as long as some key information is given to them a swap can be authorized
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:31.860]   And say what that information is mother's made name birthday. I don't know
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:38.660]   So the problem is it did it done then with t mobile whoever did this obviously was targeting
[01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:41.620]   uh, matthew because
[01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:45.620]   Then they went after his twitter account and stole it and of course
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:50.180]   Because twitter and I've tried this today. I try to turn off
[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:56.580]   If you have two factor on twitter they offer a variety of ways of doing it, but you can't turn off
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:24:00.420]   SMS to factor you can't turn it off
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:04.340]   So you can have other means
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:08.900]   But of course as long as SMS has turned on it is always the weakest link
[01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:16.020]   So he also found that he can't get his twitter account back twitter has a form to fill out if your account's been stolen
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:18.020]   But it needs your email address
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:20.340]   But his email was also stolen
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:25.460]   Uh, he's stuck in a circle of hell with twitter and google
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:29.620]   Nothing been fixed yet. Nope. It's been fixed now and they stopped a thing
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:33.060]   I will point you to just because this is
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:36.980]   Kevin did a blog post on his about chrome books.com
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:42.340]   Talking about how what needs to happen to make something like this not happen
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:48.180]   And as we talked about last week put a pin number. It's public service. Let's go through this again. It's important
[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:54.740]   Um, okay. Well in this case, so yes, don't use mobile SMS, but also he says
[01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:58.580]   uh, he points to chrome books having tpm's trusted, uh
[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:06.820]   Program, um, platform. Yeah, yeah, or program. I can't know you're right platform trusted platform. Um, that won't let you
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:08.660]   log in
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:10.180]   um
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:12.100]   And he also recommends
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:19.540]   I was actually going to do this because I did this at kevin's behess this morning going into your google security thing often
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:23.700]   And yes, do this checking and see in revoking
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:29.620]   Whenever possible. I know that SMS as authentication. You can turn that off on google
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:36.260]   So I use a ube key and then I have as a backup. I have an authenticator, but whatever possible turn off SMS
[01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:42.260]   Unfortunately, almost all the banks in this country require SMS for two factor and it is better
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:45.540]   to have two factor than not even if it's
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.940]   SMS
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:51.620]   Because in this case the bad guys had his password and his SMS
[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:55.140]   uh, and in at least in some of these cases
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:56.740]   uh
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:01.060]   Plus they got his bank account and bought $25,000 in bitcoin
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:02.980]   so
[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:08.180]   That didn't happen. They they took that out. Uh, they revoked that transaction and they didn't have his password and
[01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:14.660]   They had they only had his SMS. That's all they needed because they were able to get twitter to give him a new password
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:20.900]   Yes, so in this case using SMS as a second was sufficient. It wasn't really a second fact
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:26.100]   Then have yeah, I'm not having a well and that's the point is if it's not going to be used as a second factor
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:28.580]   It's a single factor. It is worse than a password
[01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:35.220]   Is I as I remember we talked about last week that because I'm I live love you to google and I have chrome book and android
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:41.460]   When I sign in someplace new in the chrome, it sends a message to my phone not SMS
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:44.020]   And I have to
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:49.780]   Yes, a lot of phone and say that's okay. That's right. That's right. That's actually a very good way to do it
[01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:52.340]   Better than authentic here. Yeah
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:58.100]   So even though i'm authentic. I yeah, I'm reading the this the june 2017 article
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:03.300]   So since in the two days since even though this article is not updated he has gotten everything back
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:07.140]   Is that your worst standing?
[01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:10.180]   His money he he now I think has everything
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:15.460]   But his $25,000 that they tried to get from his bank did not go through so
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:19.940]   Um, yay, let me just say that we will be asking him in person tomorrow
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:22.740]   On tech news weekly. Yeah, he's gonna be a guest
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:29.460]   Uh with the Megan actually Megan's on vacation with Jason hell. So yeah, watch uh tomorrow tech news weekly
[01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:32.580]   You personally answer all your questions. We can find out
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:36.020]   How it stands, but boy is that a that is a
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:38.420]   Real
[01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:40.420]   Yeah, and it does suck
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:44.740]   So leah, what's the uh inconvenience to the ubikki or the the physical thing
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:48.100]   You have to have it with you. Yeah, I'm not sure it with me at all
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:51.940]   And you have to be able to you have to plug it in you've got the time to plug it in every time you lose it
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:54.580]   so this is really the issue is
[01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:58.900]   Uh, if you you know if you have what I would suggest with the ubikki
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:04.260]   Is get two and lock one in a say for keep it somewhere where you can't lose it
[01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:12.500]   And then you can say I don't know other authentication except for this physical authentication. That's a that's a very secure system
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:15.380]   Uh, but if you lose me was on the amount of the country
[01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:20.260]   Yeah, so that's why I would I don't I think this thing where google
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:22.740]   This is the new thing google does where they send you a notification
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:27.460]   On your phone and you have to approve it and you have to do that by logging in first
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:33.220]   I think that's equally secure your phone. That's one your phone is your authenticator your hardware
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:38.180]   Protected him from losing his gmail, which would have been key to the whole exactly problem
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:43.700]   Exactly, but the problem is nobody else uses the but google right? Well the yeah banks
[01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:46.260]   Uh your phone company twitter
[01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:50.660]   I always look for a way to turn off SMS as an authentication. No, no
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:55.060]   What i'm saying is they oh there are lots of people that use this approved and I think
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:29:02.420]   Uh, do doo security uses it microsoft uses it. Oh, that is the new that is kind of the new standard as opposed to the six digit
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:07.300]   Authenticator a lot of a lot of people are also starting to use authenticator
[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:10.500]   apps like google authenticator
[01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:15.140]   Yeah, we've been using that here at twitch. Yeah, we require that and for
[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:18.420]   um, so I talked to somebody who is
[01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:25.380]   They're using a new authenticator like app, but you know with google authenticator how you you
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:29.620]   Look into it and you get a code a one-time code for each of your right?
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:36.180]   Yeah, the logins but the code expires every minute basically. Yes 30 seconds
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:42.580]   It's called to tp a time-based one-time passwords. I'll talk about the technology if you're interested go ahead sacy
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:45.380]   Oh, but the challenge is when you get a new phone
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:48.980]   You lose all of it. So you have to download authenticator again
[01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:52.420]   And then you have to only if you're using google's google's stupid authenticator
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:55.060]   So what people sometimes do is they print the QR codes
[01:29:55.060 --> 01:30:00.100]   I use and recommend an authenticator that uh called authi which is free from twilio
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:02.580]   A
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:06.420]   Okay, I was like there's another one and I can't remember the name of it and i've been looking for
[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:10.020]   Several of them that do this authi is my favorite authi
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:17.620]   Has you create an authi account and an encrypted you encrypt your past your uh, so the reason this is
[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:22.020]   I still I like this approved and I think a little bit better
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:29.060]   The way time-based one-time passwords work is every site has in effect a second password a long
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:32.100]   secret number
[01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:34.100]   And that is hashed with the time of day
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:38.260]   Updated every 30 seconds to generate a six-digit code
[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:42.420]   But that is kind of like a password and if somebody were to get those
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:46.500]   Long numbers they could come up with the authentication code
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:50.340]   So that's that's the problem with that system
[01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:55.940]   And that's one reason probably google authenticator says well, you're gonna give you that number once
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:59.300]   It's going to be stored deep within authenticator. Nobody else will get access to it
[01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:01.460]   But if you get a new phone or you lose your phone
[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:09.380]   You're out of luck authi tries to make it more convenient by storing that long number in your authi account
[01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:13.380]   It encrypts it on device sends it to authi. They don't totally. Oh doesn't have access to it
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:16.580]   So it's always encrypted. You want to encrypt it with strong, you know
[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:22.500]   Passphrase if you can but that's the advantage and see I needed this because I I have a new phone every five minutes
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:25.700]   So I need to be able to move my authenticator account. So I just did it
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:30.420]   I just went so I have the the new phone and I went to the other phone and um
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:34.820]   Open authi and it just said go to the other device that we know is okay
[01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:41.620]   Yes, and say it's okay there and then my my new device is okay. So that's that's really there are some very good systems out there
[01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:45.620]   I'm a fan of authi. I think Twilio is a good company right stacy
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:50.420]   Oh, yeah, Twilio is a lovely company. Yeah, and I so I trust them and that's why they give it away for free
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:52.100]   Which is pretty good
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:57.460]   Authi has this new that new thing that you just did jeff which i'm very excited about and businesses can enable that
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:01.460]   Which is a much an even more secure way of uh of doing it
[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:04.100]   um, so yeah, I think that
[01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:06.660]   There are solutions out there
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:13.220]   The problem with sms is that one you just talked about jeff which is they didn't need the password. They only needed the sim
[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:18.660]   That's really troubles troubling. Well the weak link and all of that is the damn phone company, right?
[01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:23.780]   Yeah customer service reps who you know what the authentication there is very weak
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:28.180]   But the weak the weak link is is almost always going to be social engineering humans
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:34.420]   Always the weak link and we talked last week about google phy and kevin sent me a link
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:39.860]   Um, so phy will generate a new pass code every time you log in
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:44.980]   So you can that so the what will happen with phy if somebody calls them up and says well
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:46.900]   I want a new sim card they'll say okay
[01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:53.460]   Tell me your code and that you'll have to go to your phy page and it will generate and then press a button that will generate a new code
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:57.060]   And that's each time you do that. So I think that's a good solution as well
[01:32:57.060 --> 01:33:02.180]   So phy.google.com slash accounts hashtag setting slash privacy
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:05.060]   Yeah, you don't where you can see your matter. You don't need to see it because
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:08.500]   It's generated a new every time the representative asks you
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:11.700]   You see you don't you don't need to generate it now
[01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:13.940]   Right
[01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:18.100]   It's only it's it's so that when you have an interaction with a customer service rep they can say okay
[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:23.060]   You have additional security use a secret code to verify your that any when you contact us button
[01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:26.820]   Get secret code, which sounds like so much fun. I just want to do that all the time. I know
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:35.140]   I would be like max well smart. So this is something I you know, we we always have to give a google credit for it. They're good at security
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:37.140]   Mm-hmm
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:41.780]   They're real good at see here's if you go to your phy if you have a phy account and you go to your phy account
[01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:46.020]   Under settings. There's a privacy button. You could show this car so I don't care
[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:51.780]   There's a privacy button and this is where you get the secret code to verify your days. You just press that
[01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:55.060]   You don't want to know no you can have it now. It's not it's not worth anything
[01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:59.540]   It's it's a it's the same thing. It's a to tp and it expires in 30 minutes
[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:03.300]   30 minutes or 30 seconds this one 30 minutes. Okay
[01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:08.340]   All right, well, I should give that out, but anyway
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:10.740]   uh
[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:12.740]   Please don't use that hackers, please
[01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:18.900]   30 minutes go I honestly feel really lucky that I've this has never happened to me
[01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:23.140]   Don't don't chase the gods. Would you knock some wood, please?
[01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:28.180]   knock some wood. Thank you. Well, that's but that's why my strong preference is you use you use
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:31.780]   Yuba keys apple net last pass supports it now apple supports it
[01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:36.740]   Finally on the iPhone. I never have my challenges. I never have the right thing
[01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:39.460]   I used to have like a little RSA security dongle at timing
[01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:45.220]   They made me have one of those on my corporate computer, which I never used right I did have one
[01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:46.740]   um
[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:48.260]   but yeah, I just
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:52.980]   I never have the right tool with me when I'm because I actually wander around with my computer
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:56.260]   And I never have my phone with me. So I'm constantly like, oh crap
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:00.180]   So this is this is on the key ring that my house key and my car keys are on
[01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:06.100]   So I really can't leave home without it. Oh, no, I just mean like, you know, I'll be downstairs and it'll be upstairs
[01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:12.180]   I mean, it's am I complaining about having to walk? Yes, it's a trade-off between security and convenience
[01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:14.740]   That's the fact
[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:17.540]   I will note that Theo complained about this for about
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:24.420]   Three or four weeks straight when he first started doing it. What do you mean? Oh that no that was when I did the super secure
[01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:28.100]   That was my Yuba key. That was when I did Google's super security
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:29.300]   So what is more super?
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:31.060]   I was playing the difference between those two things that came to me
[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:35.860]   That's when it will only accept a hardware token and they require you to buy two
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:40.820]   Titans or you can use the Titan security key, which does both Bluetooth and hardware
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:47.300]   And that's the only way you can log in and that actually turns off a number of useful features in your
[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:51.460]   Every single time you log in every single time so that's for people like
[01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:56.260]   Podesta if you're if you're the Democratic National Committee
[01:35:56.260 --> 01:36:04.260]   You should absolutely be securing your email. What is what does Google call it the super super duper authentication?
[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:10.500]   Technology, but it's they even say this is going to be really inconvenient
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:13.860]   But it's good
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:20.900]   Yeah, I tried it because I thought well, I'd like to do this called Google advanced protection
[01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:28.100]   And I tried it for a while, but you're right karsten. I was bemoaning it every time they were last year
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:34.020]   They were rights con and were offering the keys free because these are people who are out there doing dangerous things
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:40.500]   Even rights advocates. Yeah, and they were oh yeah, I'm gonna do this. Yeah, if you think the Russians are after you
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:44.340]   You you want to do this you have to buy two keys
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:48.260]   Um and register them with your google account
[01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:53.540]   They do say they've added some new features. What happens if I lose both my keys
[01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:58.660]   You're bored if you have lost both keys and do not have access to a login session
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:01.380]   You have to submit a request to recover your accounts
[01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:05.060]   It will take a few days for google to verify it's you and grant you access
[01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:09.540]   If you lose both keys you you simply must use social engineering to get
[01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:14.740]   Yeah, there should never be it's always remember security is that's always the weakest link
[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:18.260]   That's why if SMS is allowed the bad guys have SMS
[01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:23.460]   It's why I don't believe in secret questions, which are a terrible
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:27.780]   authentication method and whenever I see that it drives me nuts because
[01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:32.900]   Nobody should ever use secret questions. You should treat secret questions like a password
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:38.100]   And provide it with a random password which you record in your last pass
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:44.020]   But I actually was on a site the other day that had dropped down secret questions and dropped down secret answers
[01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:46.820]   So you couldn't do that you had to use
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:53.540]   Yes, yeah, there's a little company that every time I go in and ask me the same two questions from the same drop down
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:56.260]   That's not right
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:59.220]   And this is a company that uh
[01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:00.740]   has
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:04.660]   Control and access about much of my access to the internet. Yeah, see
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:08.980]   It's problematic
[01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:11.540]   I should do the advanced protection again
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:14.900]   Especially after you challenged everyone on your show
[01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:19.860]   Believe me it doesn't take a challenge to get people trying to hack my accounts
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:22.980]   It's fine. I can live with it
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:25.620]   Well, actually my the low hanging fruit is probably my twitter account
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:28.420]   Because again twitter requires again
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:35.540]   If you started tweeting though, we'd all be like what is happening? This is not yeah, that's how he's thought that's how math use daughter
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:40.740]   She realized this hack started because she looked at his twitter accounts of that's not her. That's my dad
[01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:45.060]   Googles, uh, let's do the changelog because there's some interesting things coming from google
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:54.820]   Carse, you don't have a vacation yet carster. Come on your job. Come on boy. I really see a curve on that. I'm so sorry
[01:38:54.820 --> 01:39:06.740]   I don't know I can't see what's going on on the on the board over there
[01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:10.180]   It's a little distant and dark, but I just imagine carster going like
[01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:12.900]   It's hitting every button
[01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:16.100]   Wait for my vacation
[01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:18.260]   Chances is my crib tonight
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:25.460]   Uh, I just saw this my google assistant showed me where I parked today
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:29.220]   Oh
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:31.220]   You sure you want that
[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:33.220]   Okay, okay
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:38.500]   Why did you park there if you don't want that you may remember it used to do that and that
[01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:41.860]   With google now the google now is gone
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:46.020]   But now assistant will go to googles then yeah
[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:52.100]   You see I have an app that's done this for me for for years and it turns on when I push a button
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:53.780]   Yeah, that's a better way to do it. It doesn't automatically
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:57.780]   Track my car at all times. Yeah, but yeah, but remind me
[01:39:57.780 --> 01:40:01.540]   Yeah, but hey your car is yeah, but i know where my car is
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:07.540]   I didn't know the problem is you don't usually lose your car unless you're kind of not thinking about that, right? Right?
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:11.540]   That's the thing if you think oh, I don't want to lose my car. You're not gonna lose your car
[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:13.860]   It's when you're drunk off your ass
[01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:17.380]   And you don't remember where you put your car. That's when you need this feature
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:19.460]   Well, it can't tell you what floor you're on right
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:24.020]   I remember to push the button for that so I go and I look let's see if it's doing it. I think it's doing it
[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:29.220]   I'm gonna go to updates. Yeah, you parked here updated four hours ago based on your location history
[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:32.500]   And it's right can't do for it's right
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:34.580]   Say again
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:36.980]   Carston i'm not carston. Uh, what's your name? Jeff
[01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:39.140]   Haha
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:43.220]   Soon they forget it can't do floors in liama, New York. Oh, yeah
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:47.220]   Yeah, do you ever park in the car elevator garages?
[01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:48.820]   No
[01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:52.020]   They're so weird you park and then it puts your brings your
[01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:59.460]   Like stacks the cars. Oh, I have a secret place. I park in New York and i'm not saying it on the air i'm not telling anybody because i'm not generous
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:03.700]   I'm not sharing this because you park in time square. Oh, but I know we could figure it out
[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:06.500]   See this is this could teach jeff a lesson
[01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:09.300]   That's actually
[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:16.020]   You have 30 minutes to find jeff's car. Go. Yeah, go find the other thing I do the other thing I do is I've got a secret route in Jersey
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:22.340]   And I turn off ways when I take it. I've got a secret route in Jersey. Oh, you turn off ways so it won't
[01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:28.020]   Yeah, anybody else know that i'm i'm i'm a very generous guy. I share lots of things
[01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:30.900]   Those are the two things I won't share but see you you
[01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:37.460]   Let's point out because of privacy. No, but because no, no, you have the choice. That's the point
[01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:42.100]   Well, actually it probably does track me anyway
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:52.100]   It does. I mean so you work in times square you work in what it has to be in center of the universe the whole world the worst place to find a parking spot
[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:57.700]   It gets worse all the time because they're building hotels like crazy and taking another garages, which is a fine thing
[01:41:57.700 --> 01:41:59.700]   How much do you pay a day?
[01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:02.260]   uh, it can go anywhere from
[01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:05.700]   $45 to
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:08.900]   $65 to $70
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:13.220]   I don't i don't drive in. I don't do that. I don't do that. I don't like the past. Yeah, it's a path
[01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:16.100]   Oh, so your secret spot is not in New York. It's in jersey
[01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:20.100]   I'm not gonna say where it is. It could be in Nebraska. I'm not saying
[01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:23.100]   - I have a good spot.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:23.920]   - That's it.
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:24.760]   - As a matter of what,
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:26.140]   you can't get it out of me.
[01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:28.360]   - Good, it's, I actually know you know what,
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:29.280]   I know exactly what I mean.
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:31.340]   Because I have a secret space to park in
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:32.360]   for the Giants games.
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:34.340]   - Oh. - Yeah.
[01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:37.060]   - Google Safe browsing service
[01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:39.900]   gets its own Chrome extension.
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:44.060]   So you get this benefit when you use Chrome anyway,
[01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:47.960]   but they release the suspicious site reporter extension,
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:50.100]   which lets you report suspicious sites
[01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:52.180]   to the Safe browsing service.
[01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:54.420]   Safe browsing service is one of the best things ever.
[01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:56.020]   When you, and sometimes it's wrong,
[01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:57.500]   but when you go to a site,
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:59.620]   like I can actually make it happen
[01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:02.700]   because if I go to Dicty Bartolo's site,
[01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:06.500]   he's done something wrong with his certificates.
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:07.700]   But if I click,
[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:10.820]   I think it's if I click the what the heck is it?
[01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:12.460]   No, maybe it's,
[01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:13.780]   oh, it's working now, too bad.
[01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:14.620]   I used to get--
[01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:17.740]   - You should, IRC, your IRC channel is insecure.
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:19.540]   - Is it, no, no, I'm not talking about that.
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:21.140]   The one where you get, there's malware.
[01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:22.740]   You know, you really, you can't go here.
[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:24.220]   You have to say yes.
[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:26.700]   This is, that's the Safe browsing service.
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:28.020]   And now you can report.
[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:31.380]   - See, I'm a little suspicious about the story,
[01:43:31.380 --> 01:43:33.540]   only in so far as whenever I've heard people
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:34.980]   raise that kind of idea,
[01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:37.020]   let's all Chrome source bad stuff.
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:38.020]   Google people have told me,
[01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:41.020]   and Facebook told me that's gonna be utterly worthless data
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:43.300]   'cause it'll get game, it'll be crap,
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:44.540]   that their algorithms are faster than--
[01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:45.660]   - Well, clearly they've figured out--
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:46.820]   - They're not an honest in this stuff.
[01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:49.540]   - Clearly they've figured out a way
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:51.100]   to vet this information.
[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:53.300]   - I know, you know what I think it is, Leo?
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.060]   I think it's the crosswalk button.
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:57.220]   It just makes you feel like you're doing something.
[01:43:57.220 --> 01:43:58.780]   - Yeah, it's the close door button,
[01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:00.020]   elevator close door button.
[01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:01.540]   - Yeah, elevator close door button, right?
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:03.340]   Yeah. - Sometimes those work.
[01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:04.820]   - Yeah, they work for me.
[01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:07.180]   'Cause whenever I see Jeff coming down the hall,
[01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:09.860]   I hit that button and it closes the door and I go.
[01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:12.460]   And I say, oh, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry,
[01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:13.660]   as we're going away.
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:18.540]   - The other Jeff, yeah, not you, Jeff.
[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:23.460]   I told Karsten every time you bark at instruction
[01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:25.540]   to that Jeff, I jump.
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:26.860]   - Yeah, that's our new Jeff.
[01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:27.780]   - What did you do?
[01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:29.260]   - It's our new Jeff.
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:34.060]   Should I, Jeff, do you have a nickname?
[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:36.460]   I can use instead of saying the J word.
[01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:38.220]   - He's Jeff, it's funny, it can be Jeff.
[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:39.060]   - I'll just call him old.
[01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:40.700]   - I'll call him new Jeff.
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:44.020]   New Jeff, and that way I get to call you old Jeff.
[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:46.180]   - That's not good for me.
[01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:48.060]   - Let's call him ancient Jeff.
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:51.260]   - It's actually redundant to call one new and one old.
[01:44:51.260 --> 01:44:54.260]   You should just decide, either call him new or...
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:55.260]   No, we should just call Jeff.
[01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:56.740]   - What is going, this is what happens
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:59.540]   when you get a degree from Harvard.
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:01.740]   You know, actually...
[01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:02.820]   - Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:03.660]   - What did you do?
[01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:04.500]   - What did you do?
[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:05.340]   - What did you do?
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:06.180]   - I'm not cranky.
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:08.660]   - I have one vacation already, I'm sorry.
[01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:10.780]   - These were in shorts and a Hawaiian shirt.
[01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:12.380]   This is a guy who comes to work with a tie,
[01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:13.780]   a suit and tie every single day.
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:15.900]   - Yes, I've met him, bow tied.
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:17.460]   - Yeah, very exact.
[01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:20.140]   - I've never seen Wolfty Carson.
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:21.820]   - Wolfty Carson.
[01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:23.300]   I have never seen Wolfty Carson.
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:24.500]   - Is there a camera over there?
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:25.820]   We want to see Wolfty Carson.
[01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:26.940]   - Are you in Wolfty?
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:27.900]   - I am not in Wolfty.
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:29.100]   - No, I was making it up.
[01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:30.540]   He's actually looking very happy.
[01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:32.660]   - I'm in Wolfty underneath my clothes.
[01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:34.740]   - Underneath my clothes.
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:37.300]   - Google, okay, maybe this is another walk button.
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:39.340]   I don't know, Google says, we're gonna pay,
[01:45:39.340 --> 01:45:41.740]   we're gonna give $1 billion
[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:46.620]   to build 20,000 houses in the Bay Area.
[01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:48.300]   - What is that per house?
[01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:49.460]   - I don't know, that's a lot.
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:50.820]   - First aid, Harvard, hey Harvard.
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:51.820]   - You have it.
[01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:53.540]   - I did not major in math.
[01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:56.740]   - For the next, so this is a big investment.
[01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:58.780]   But it's in part, so over the next 10 years,
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:01.500]   we'll repurpose the land, our own land,
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:04.020]   that we have $750 million worth,
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:06.180]   which is currently zoned for office of commercial space.
[01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:08.980]   We're gonna repurpose it as residential housing.
[01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:11.660]   That'll let us build at least 15,000 new homes
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:14.260]   at all income levels, although honestly,
[01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:15.900]   it's gotta be 'cause they wanna have a place
[01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:17.300]   for the engineers to live.
[01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:19.660]   - 50,000 is the $50,000 house.
[01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:21.380]   - 50,000 is the $50,000 house.
[01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:24.740]   - Google says that is per house, which is--
[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:25.580]   - Nothing.
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:26.420]   Then they're gonna build--
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:27.540]   - How does it get in the Bay Area?
[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:28.900]   - That's nothing.
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:32.620]   - One of my favorite games in the Valley is to,
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:35.220]   or in the Princela, is to go buy a house
[01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:37.380]   and look it up on Zillow.
[01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:39.660]   You see some rundown piece of junk in this
[01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:42.260]   - $2,000,000 house. - $2,000,000.
[01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:43.700]   - But to Google's credit,
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:46.820]   they're gonna have low and middle income housing as well.
[01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:47.780]   In fact, they're gonna establish
[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:50.100]   a quarter billion dollar investment fund
[01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:51.980]   to provide incentives to enable developers
[01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:54.460]   to build at least 5,000 affordable housing units
[01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:55.500]   across the market.
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:58.780]   In addition to the increased supply of affordable housing,
[01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:01.020]   we're gonna give 50 million in grant through Google.org
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:02.660]   to nonprofits focused on the issues
[01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:04.220]   of homelessness in displacement.
[01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:07.340]   This is good, I think, as much as I'd like to be cynical,
[01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:10.180]   I think this is good corporate citizenship.
[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:13.700]   - Yes.
[01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:15.740]   - It's also the zoning issues.
[01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:17.020]   They're gonna hit-- - Yeah.
[01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:18.900]   - Yeah, I was gonna say that the challenge here
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:19.740]   isn't just money.
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:23.900]   It's like, hey, we're gonna put up dense, cheaper housing
[01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:25.740]   in your area and then people are gonna be like--
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:26.900]   - Not my backyard.
[01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:28.260]   - I don't think so.
[01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:30.700]   I paid 4 million for this.
[01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:32.180]   - The property they're gonna give away
[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:33.900]   is in places where there's no houses,
[01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:35.460]   which means they're not great neighborhoods.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:36.820]   They're not unsafe for anything,
[01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:37.660]   but they're just really boring.
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:39.780]   - Mountain views, boring, but it's not unsafe.
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:40.980]   Mountain views, you know.
[01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:43.780]   Hey, I'm really excited about this,
[01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:46.620]   and Carson, I hope you're gonna do something like this
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:47.460]   with your kids.
[01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:50.980]   I'm thinking of doing this with our teenager.
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:52.980]   Google has released Game Builder
[01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:56.580]   that lets anyone create 3D games in a Minecraft-like UI.
[01:47:56.580 --> 01:47:58.940]   Remember, Microsoft bought Minecraft
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:02.260]   and is doing a lot, I think, to make it an educational tool.
[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:04.420]   But this is Google's response, Game Builder,
[01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:07.220]   and this comes from Google's Area 120,
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:10.380]   which is their experimental workshop.
[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:12.660]   If you have an idea for a video game,
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:14.700]   you can use this.
[01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:17.340]   It features a card-based visual programming system
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:18.860]   for building 3D levels.
[01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:20.140]   Now, let's look at,
[01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:22.180]   that's not the video of it, unfortunately.
[01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:24.100]   Drag and drop cards to answer questions
[01:48:24.100 --> 01:48:25.900]   like how should I move?
[01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:27.180]   You can make moving platforms,
[01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:29.020]   scoreboards, healing, potions, drivable cards.
[01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:31.500]   Have you played with this or has Zack played with this
[01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:33.220]   or anybody? - We have not played with this yet,
[01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:38.220]   but it looks like it's got a lot of scratch-like
[01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:40.300]   - Yeah. - It's easy to it.
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:41.140]   - Yeah.
[01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:46.140]   Scratch is a MIT version of Smalltalk, actually.
[01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:48.260]   And it's got a plug-and-play,
[01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:50.260]   kind of simple drag-and-drop interface.
[01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:52.540]   That's become of, I don't know, look at this.
[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:53.820]   This is pretty cool.
[01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:55.340]   This is the video on Steam
[01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:57.900]   'cause it's available for free on Steam.
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:49:01.660]   It is drag-and-drop, but, you know, it looks pretty cool.
[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:05.460]   You can also put JavaScript in and it's live.
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:10.460]   So, light and particle effects, this is pretty cool.
[01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:13.860]   I'm gonna play Game Builder, let's see.
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:16.020]   Oh, I need to install Steam, I won't do that right now.
[01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:18.660]   But this early access game is not complete
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:20.220]   and may or may not change further.
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:23.540]   If you're excited to play this game in its current state,
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:25.100]   if you're not excited to play this game
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:27.180]   in its current state, you should wait.
[01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:29.220]   But, if you want early access,
[01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:32.620]   Apple or Windows, download Steam,
[01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:33.780]   and install Game Builder.
[01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:35.740]   This is from Google's Area 120.
[01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:37.860]   I think this is so cool.
[01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:41.860]   I'm gonna get the kids playing with it.
[01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:43.180]   That's for sure.
[01:49:43.180 --> 01:49:44.620]   - Kids, go code.
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:45.660]   - Well, they want a code,
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:47.340]   and I've been really looking for different ways
[01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:48.180]   to teach them.
[01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:52.060]   They're all like sophomores and juniors in high school.
[01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:55.420]   And so, they're ready to, I think, learn real coding.
[01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:56.660]   But I wanna also make it fun.
[01:49:56.660 --> 01:49:57.700]   And the nice thing about something like this,
[01:49:57.700 --> 01:50:01.060]   they love games, is it would give them instant feedback.
[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:03.140]   And I think it'd teach them some of the skills,
[01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:03.980]   some of the basic skills.
[01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:05.000]   - It's a really good entrance to
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.300]   - Yeah, that's what I think.
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:07.140]   - Yeah.
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:11.460]   Google has ditched nets.com.
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:13.420]   You gotta go to store.google.com
[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:16.780]   if you wanna buy Nest stuff.
[01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:19.580]   - To be fair, you can always buy Nest stuff
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:20.700]   on the Google store.
[01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:22.300]   So now you just know like the Nest.
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:24.420]   - Right, just can't go to the Nest store.
[01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:26.380]   - I asked, or I didn't ask somebody else,
[01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:29.540]   when I was at IO, whether they were gonna withdraw
[01:50:29.540 --> 01:50:30.780]   all the boxes and rebrand them,
[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:33.740]   they said, "No, I will sell them until they're gone."
[01:50:33.740 --> 01:50:35.240]   (laughing)
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:36.080]   - Sure.
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:37.700]   - They stuck a sticker on them.
[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:38.780]   - Yeah.
[01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:39.620]   - They stuck a sticker.
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:42.580]   - They, on the goo, gosh, here we go.
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:43.500]   I'm gonna mess it up.
[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:45.260]   It used to be the Nest home hub.
[01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:46.900]   Now they stuck a sticker over the word Nest
[01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:49.180]   and it's the Google Home Hub.
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:50.020]   - And I know--
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:52.820]   - I thought that was the opposite.
[01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:56.020]   I'm pretty sure that's the opposite of the app.
[01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:58.100]   - They stuck a Google sticker on the Nest.
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:00.020]   - They stuck a Nest sticker on the Google
[01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:01.820]   'cause it's now the Nest Home Hub.
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:03.500]   - It's the Google Home Hub.
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:05.100]   - They killed the, that's right.
[01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:05.940]   - Sorry, yes.
[01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:07.380]   - They killed the Nest servers,
[01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:10.500]   but they adopted the Nest name.
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:11.500]   - Jesus.
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:13.700]   - There's not a job.
[01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:15.460]   - A very good service on Google is gonna be called Nest.
[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:16.460]   - Yeah.
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:19.820]   - I can't wait for the Nest messaging platform that's next.
[01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:22.820]   - Followed by the Wave messaging platform.
[01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:26.740]   Do you think, you've got a young daughter, Stacey,
[01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:28.180]   do you think kids today are learning
[01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:30.780]   how to apply makeup from YouTube?
[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:32.780]   - Oh dude, I learned how to apply makeup from YouTube.
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:33.780]   - Yes, yes.
[01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:36.100]   - Oh absolutely.
[01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:37.980]   - Oh yeah. - There's no question.
[01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:40.980]   - I like why I speak it to Twitter.
[01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:42.220]   - Really?
[01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:47.140]   - Okay, so I actually learned how to put on eyeshadow.
[01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:48.820]   Not eyeshadow, I still haven't learned that.
[01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:50.220]   I haven't sat through that yet.
[01:51:50.220 --> 01:51:53.580]   But I started wearing mascara like two years ago
[01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:55.140]   for this show because I was like,
[01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:58.220]   "Oh, people see my face, I should do something with it."
[01:51:58.220 --> 01:52:03.660]   But I also learned, yeah, I watched like contouring videos.
[01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:04.500]   You know I talked about this.
[01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:06.020]   - That's right, we've talked about it, I forgot, yeah.
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:07.940]   - My favorite is this woman.
[01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:10.020]   I'm trying to think of her name and I can't.
[01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:11.940]   She does these like makeup mistakes
[01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:14.220]   and she does half her face the way you're not supposed to do it
[01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:15.940]   and the other half the way you're supposed to do it
[01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:18.020]   and she's awesome.
[01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:19.420]   I love her.
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:22.540]   Anyway, the point is yes, yes a thousand times.
[01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:23.780]   - So.
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:24.940]   - And hairstyles too.
[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:31.260]   - Now you can use YouTube and augmented reality
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:36.460]   to help you choose makeup, to learn how to put on makeup.
[01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:42.580]   This is an AR Beauty Trion.
[01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:45.620]   M-A-C Cosmetics is the first to do this.
[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:46.580]   They'll be-- - Mac.
[01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:48.500]   - Mac, you say Mac or you don't--
[01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:49.340]   - Mac, you say Mac.
[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:52.620]   - What do they put the dots between the M and the A and the C?
[01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:54.620]   Well, it's Mac.
[01:52:54.620 --> 01:52:56.380]   - Yo, yo, yo.
[01:52:56.380 --> 01:52:58.940]   - Okay, it's a, okay, whatever.
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:01.460]   It's a Mac-- - Plus these are not M-A-C.
[01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:02.700]   - So-- - Secretive.
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:05.500]   (laughing)
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:08.100]   - Also, Google had talked a little bit about having
[01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:09.860]   three dimensional display in search.
[01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:13.540]   Well, they're also gonna do this in ads, display ads.
[01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:19.700]   So AR is creeping into every part of your life.
[01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:22.820]   And if you're a product, this is--
[01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:24.140]   - I'm gonna have to check out this,
[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:26.420]   'cause I don't understand how AR really would help me
[01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:28.580]   learn how to apply makeup.
[01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:31.140]   I need to see how it looks on my actual face.
[01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:33.940]   - Yes, that's exactly it.
[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.380]   - Well, Sephora does that.
[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:38.980]   Like you can go in and put their products on a picture of you,
[01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:41.940]   but it's still, it needs to be on your actual face.
[01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:43.580]   Otherwise, it's useless.
[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:45.380]   - This is kind of like that, but with, I think,
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:47.860]   better facial recognition and--
[01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:50.180]   - Okay, yeah, but with makeup on the face,
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:54.540]   it's like, you know, your skin texture matters,
[01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:55.780]   but that's just me.
[01:53:55.780 --> 01:54:00.500]   Yes, yes, Ali Andrea, that is her name.
[01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:01.420]   Yes!
[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:02.900]   - We'll see her, we'll see her.
[01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:05.380]   (laughing)
[01:54:05.380 --> 01:54:06.540]   - Let me see, hold on.
[01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:08.820]   (mumbles)
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:17.540]   Yes, if you Google her name, and it's EEA.
[01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:22.540]   So, Ali A-N-D-R-E-E-A, makeup mistakes to avoid.
[01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:26.180]   - I have something so much more important to talk about.
[01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:29.100]   - Wait, we gotta watch the end of this.
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:33.700]   And you have to say the things to make me get out of this.
[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:34.860]   - Is that Italian?
[01:54:34.860 --> 01:54:37.140]   Why are you getting Italian subtitles on that?
[01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:38.500]   - 'Cause she's Italian, I don't know.
[01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:41.260]   - Oh, this is not-- - I guess this is not--
[01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:42.980]   - Opie Brown. - Not a half an hour.
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:43.820]   - Opie Brown.
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:46.620]   - Oh, this may not be, I don't know.
[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:51.620]   - The most important change lock story of the year is next.
[01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:55.260]   It is because Niantic.
[01:54:55.260 --> 01:54:56.620]   - Is no longer owned by--
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:58.420]   - Which was a Google company.
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:54:59.380]   (laughing)
[01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:03.340]   They were the Google Maps people, they created Ingress,
[01:55:03.340 --> 01:55:05.900]   then they created Pokemon Go.
[01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:07.980]   They have been working with Warner Brothers
[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:09.980]   to create a new game.
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:14.180]   It will finally come out on Friday.
[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:16.620]   Harry Potter Wizards unite.
[01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:20.020]   I will be very distracted for the next two or three years.
[01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:21.020]   I'm just warning you.
[01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:22.260]   - I'm so cranky that they waited
[01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:24.180]   until my children are gone and now--
[01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:25.380]   - You play it by yourself.
[01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:27.140]   - You seem to play it. - This is the perfect time,
[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:28.180]   Carsten.
[01:55:28.180 --> 01:55:30.540]   - But this means I have to leave my house
[01:55:30.540 --> 01:55:33.060]   and the whole point of the next week
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:35.220]   was not leaving my house.
[01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:39.020]   - This is taking the geography created initially
[01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:42.060]   in Ingress and eventually in Pokemon Go
[01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:44.740]   and applying a layer, it's augmented reality,
[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:46.900]   a layer of Harry Potter to it.
[01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:53.060]   Instead of Pokey Stops and Jim's, there are now,
[01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:55.740]   what are they, Fortresses?
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:57.380]   And there's a whole bunch of new stuff.
[01:55:57.380 --> 01:55:59.340]   There's magical creatures.
[01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:01.540]   You have to cast spells.
[01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:04.060]   We've been, this game was released a couple of months ago
[01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:06.220]   in Australia and New Zealand.
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:08.860]   And we've all been really interested
[01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:10.460]   in when they were gonna release it in the US
[01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:13.020]   and they've decided to take the summer solstice.
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:16.140]   They say it's a global rollout.
[01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:19.100]   So it will be starting its global rollout
[01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:22.100]   on the first day of summer this Friday.
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:23.900]   - I don't understand.
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:25.660]   - It's not for you, Jeff.
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:27.820]   - Sure want to-- - But you didn't like Pokemon Go?
[01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:29.700]   I think of that Portlandian episode
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:31.020]   where they're like-- - I'm not a Harry Potter fan.
[01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:31.620]   - Put a word on it. - Is there a point
[01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:33.540]   in India about pork Pokemon Go?
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:34.380]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:37.100]   So I'm like the Portlandian episode about put a bird on it
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:38.860]   and this is like put a potter on it.
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:40.300]   - Put a potter on it.
[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:42.380]   Put a potter. - I am really excited about this.
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:43.380]   - I finally-- - You know what it means?
[01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:44.820]   - Maybe even better. - I finally started watching
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:47.460]   the fifth, the latest season of Portlandia
[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:49.780]   and in the very first episodes.
[01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:53.260]   They make fun of NPR style podcasts
[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:55.340]   and they do it so perfectly.
[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:58.900]   Do you remember that one there in a police department?
[01:56:58.900 --> 01:57:00.460]   And they actually is a guy with a fiddle
[01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:02.300]   and a banjo following them around.
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:04.460]   It's really good.
[01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:05.620]   They nailed it.
[01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:07.500]   - Nailed it.
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:11.980]   - Okay, so that's-- - Do you watch
[01:57:11.980 --> 01:57:14.100]   the good place?
[01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:14.940]   - Yes.
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:16.660]   - I love it.
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:18.340]   - That's the change log.
[01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:20.100]   (laughing)
[01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:22.260]   Now you can talk about other TV shows.
[01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:23.100]   No, no, it's fine.
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:24.220]   - Well, is it time for our thing?
[01:57:24.220 --> 01:57:25.220]   Do we have more ads?
[01:57:25.220 --> 01:57:26.540]   - No more ads. - Are we ending the show soon?
[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:29.100]   - Let's end the show right now with Stacey's.
[01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:31.740]   - No, I wanna talk more about TV.
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:32.580]   - No, I don't.
[01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:35.300]   - Former TV guide critic, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:36.700]   TV worth watching.
[01:57:36.700 --> 01:57:37.540]   - I was like, yeah. - Well, we do have
[01:57:37.540 --> 01:57:39.820]   the cat filter on the Pakistani polls
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:40.980]   in terms of stories still left.
[01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:41.980]   I love that story.
[01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:42.860]   - Okay. - Okay.
[01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:43.700]   - Wait, what?
[01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:44.540]   - Oh.
[01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:45.740]   - The cat filter.
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:48.180]   By the way, congratulations to Kashmir Hill,
[01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:50.140]   who is joining her times. - Oh, that's great news.
[01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:51.180]   - Yeah. - We just gonna continue
[01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:54.620]   to do her unique brand of in-depth investigative reporting
[01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:56.020]   with a twist.
[01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:57.340]   She's so talented.
[01:57:57.340 --> 01:57:59.220]   She was at Fusion and then Gizmodo.
[01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:01.500]   I guess she was at Fortune as well.
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:03.180]   She is now gonna be doing,
[01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:06.420]   and she says she's gonna get to do the same stories,
[01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:07.700]   but this time for the New York Times.
[01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:09.820]   - Yeah, you don't mess with her thing.
[01:58:09.820 --> 01:58:12.100]   - She is a really responsible tech reporter.
[01:58:12.100 --> 01:58:14.180]   - And a star, a superstar.
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:16.140]   - Super star. - So.
[01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:19.260]   - Very excited.
[01:58:19.260 --> 01:58:24.460]   What was the, oh, cat filter on the Pakistani polls.
[01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:25.940]   - Pause.
[01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:28.820]   It's just so giggly, I just love it.
[01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:30.820]   - Pachy-stanny politicians event.
[01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:33.340]   They were streaming it on Facebook,
[01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:38.340]   and they didn't notice, they had turned on the kitty cat filter.
[01:58:38.340 --> 01:58:40.420]   (laughs)
[01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:46.500]   - Oh, oh, oh, and did they not know?
[01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:47.580]   - No, they didn't know.
[01:58:47.580 --> 01:58:49.860]   It didn't last long, but it's just too perfect.
[01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:53.140]   - There's little cat ears and whiskers on series.
[01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:54.140]   - Oh my God.
[01:58:54.140 --> 01:58:59.060]   - So, cat, Yousaf Si, Zai, the regional minister
[01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:00.060]   from Northwest Pakistan,
[01:59:00.060 --> 01:59:03.740]   speaking to reporters last Friday about local issues.
[01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:06.020]   His parties streamed the event live on Facebook,
[01:59:06.020 --> 01:59:08.740]   so constituents could follow along,
[01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:12.500]   but they accidentally tapped the kitty cat.
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:13.820]   - It fills her.
[01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:17.660]   - I think I've done everybody powerful.
[01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:20.420]   - No, no, I gotta see the,
[01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:23.620]   here's the clarification notification.
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:26.780]   Pakistan's social media,
[01:59:26.780 --> 01:59:28.100]   their party social media team,
[01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:30.180]   seem to be the pioneers of social media
[01:59:30.180 --> 01:59:32.460]   in Pakistan when they pride ourselves,
[01:59:32.460 --> 01:59:34.980]   in bringing Pakistani politics to internet,
[01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:38.340]   but also feel content in sending high standards of SOPs
[01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:43.340]   and etiquette with the help of our dedicated volunteer-based
[01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:45.060]   social media force.
[01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:47.340]   Today, a cat filter was witnessed by the viewers,
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:48.780]   which was removed within minutes.
[01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:52.540]   The disciplinary committee probed the matter firsthand
[01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:55.180]   and concluded the incident was a human error
[01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:58.860]   by one of our hard-working volunteer,
[01:59:58.860 --> 02:00:01.540]   all necessary actions have been taken to avoid such incident
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:05.180]   in the future with great emphasis on strict enforcement.
[02:00:05.180 --> 02:00:07.500]   What is SOP, standard operating procedure?
[02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:08.940]   - Free procedures.
[02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:11.860]   - And protocol for live coverage by the ground team.
[02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:13.500]   - I told you that'd be worth it.
[02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:15.540]   - The volunteer's is being used.
[02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:17.620]   - One of the things that I put on here that I love
[02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:19.060]   is the ants on a plane.
[02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:21.900]   - Ah, this is a Twitter's.
[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:23.100]   - What does that have to do with us?
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:24.940]   - It doesn't land out entirely on Twitter.
[02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:26.140]   Play down on Twitter.
[02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:30.260]   Okay, shall we read the thread?
[02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:31.100]   - Well, you can just part of it,
[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:32.900]   you can go down quick, you don't have to go to the wrong.
[02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:33.740]   - I'm a plan from Venice to New York
[02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:36.620]   when a large fat ant walks over my pillow.
[02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:38.920]   That's odd, tweets Charlotte Burns.
[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:41.780]   Minutes later, another fat little bug.
[02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:42.820]   Then another one on my arm,
[02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:44.340]   their bold, it starts to filicy.
[02:00:44.340 --> 02:00:45.580]   One over here, it goes on,
[02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:46.900]   the nice lady talking to me pouring a drink
[02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:49.260]   when she shudders, she's seen an ant problem
[02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:50.660]   as it's time for the meal service.
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:51.900]   Would I mind waiting?
[02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:54.180]   All of a sudden, I mind, there's another bugger,
[02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:57.540]   so this is a long thread.
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:01:00.900]   Guy wakes up, he's wearing a Spiderman ear mask, by the way.
[02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:03.300]   I'm asked, he says, "Comly for Guy,
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:05.220]   "just got woken up about an ant infestation."
[02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:07.300]   Ah, yes, I saw one earlier.
[02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:11.100]   - So they're continuing to keep from that guy's bag.
[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:12.940]   They wouldn't open his bag 'cause he was asleep
[02:01:12.940 --> 02:01:14.780]   and they waited to wake up before they get the bag up.
[02:01:14.780 --> 02:01:17.140]   - Apparently he has an ant farm in his bag.
[02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:18.820]   - And then they opened the bag on a seat
[02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:19.700]   which spreads the ants.
[02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:22.580]   People were trying to go around and get all the ants.
[02:01:22.580 --> 02:01:24.460]   Meanwhile, I love this Ben Berkowitz says,
[02:01:24.460 --> 02:01:26.260]   "Hi, this has been with NBC News New York.
[02:01:26.260 --> 02:01:28.860]   "Any chance that's Delta 475?"
[02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:31.780]   (laughing)
[02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:34.060]   And here are the Hazmat team.
[02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:38.660]   No, that's just a GIF.
[02:01:38.660 --> 02:01:39.620]   I have motherf--
[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:40.900]   ants on the motherf--
[02:01:40.900 --> 02:01:42.540]   playing, you can bloop that out.
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:44.860]   (laughing)
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:46.380]   Oh, this is fun.
[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:48.100]   But that's just, now see, this is why Twitter
[02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:49.620]   should never end because--
[02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:50.940]   - Yeah, you see this is what we do.
[02:01:50.940 --> 02:01:53.260]   - That's a good thing.
[02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:54.500]   - Honestly, really Jeff.
[02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:56.860]   - Deep fake, deep fake garlic.
[02:01:56.860 --> 02:02:00.140]   - Pakistani kitty-talls and ants on the plane.
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:00.980]   - See?
[02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:01.820]   - See?
[02:02:01.820 --> 02:02:04.180]   - It's okay guys, it's all okay.
[02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:11.380]   - Or a 22 tweet thread about MFN ants on this MFN plane.
[02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:14.740]   We did the garlic.
[02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:17.340]   - We've done it all.
[02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:20.580]   - We didn't do Mozilla builds, AI penis doodle detector.
[02:02:20.580 --> 02:02:22.340]   (laughing)
[02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:23.940]   - I know, we sure didn't, that's okay.
[02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:26.380]   - We can skip that one.
[02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:28.820]   - Notice who did it, Mozilla did it.
[02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:30.300]   - Yeah, to protest--
[02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:31.140]   - To protest--
[02:02:31.140 --> 02:02:31.980]   - I just wanted--
[02:02:31.980 --> 02:02:32.820]   - Google's Prudery.
[02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:34.900]   - I just wanna make it clear that I did not put that
[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:36.620]   on the rundown, Jeff put that on the rundown.
[02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:38.140]   - I did, I did.
[02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:40.180]   Stacy Schurzel didn't.
[02:02:40.180 --> 02:02:41.260]   - No, I did not.
[02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:43.260]   I very rarely put things on the rundown,
[02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:45.420]   partially 'cause I get here too late.
[02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:46.900]   - It's fine.
[02:02:46.900 --> 02:02:51.900]   - We are now going to go to Stacy's thing.
[02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:56.380]   - I don't have a thing this week,
[02:02:56.380 --> 02:03:00.100]   but what I do have is an app.
[02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:01.780]   It is called O-L-E-S-T-O.
[02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:02.860]   - That's a thing.
[02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:04.820]   O-L-E.
[02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:08.500]   - O-L-I-S-T-O.
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:10.980]   Someone just reached out to me for this,
[02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:12.060]   and I downloaded it.
[02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:13.820]   Unfortunately, I have not connected all
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:15.380]   my connected smart things,
[02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:18.140]   but this is like a variation on ifd.
[02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:19.140]   - Ah.
[02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:21.980]   - But it's home automation focused.
[02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:23.340]   - It is home automation.
[02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:28.820]   - And let's see all the things it supports.
[02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:31.380]   Amsterdam, Krause, a good selection.
[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:36.380]   Nest is in there, Nokia Health, Hue, Spotify,
[02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:40.620]   Amazon, Echo and Google Assistant.
[02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:44.020]   - And you can do multiple things on this.
[02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:46.380]   They call them trigs, which I want to whack them
[02:03:46.380 --> 02:03:47.660]   over the head for, but.
[02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:48.980]   - Yeah.
[02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:51.020]   - And you can share your trig.
[02:03:51.020 --> 02:03:55.260]   - Tips and trigs.
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:57.540]   - Yeah, so it's a little bit more,
[02:03:57.540 --> 02:03:59.340]   so it reminds me more of Stringify,
[02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:01.260]   except it doesn't have that weird gooey interface
[02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:03.500]   that sometimes can trip people up.
[02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:07.940]   So, if you're interested,
[02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:09.340]   this is something you can try.
[02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:11.060]   - I could have my Huelight's Flash
[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:14.020]   when I get on my Y-Things scale and I'm under 200 pounds,
[02:04:14.020 --> 02:04:15.300]   something like that.
[02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:16.140]   - Yeah.
[02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:18.220]   - I could have my radio play, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
[02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:19.300]   - Yeah.
[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:20.140]   - I don't know about your radio.
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:20.980]   - We all set that up.
[02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:22.980]   - Well, yeah, Spotify, yeah.
[02:04:22.980 --> 02:04:24.180]   - Okay.
[02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:27.020]   Yeah, and it works with tons of smart home stuff.
[02:04:27.020 --> 02:04:29.260]   Like, there's your Hue lights.
[02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:31.340]   I'm trying to see if there's like a good,
[02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:33.980]   and it works with the voice services,
[02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:36.860]   so you can set up something with your voice services.
[02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:37.860]   - Nice, other places.
[02:04:37.860 --> 02:04:39.180]   - Or you could, there's Slack.
[02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:41.220]   You could actually Slack your entire team.
[02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:42.220]   - Slack, everybody on the team.
[02:04:42.220 --> 02:04:43.220]   - You featured.

[02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:51.980]   - Oh, well then, location, use location on your phone
[02:04:51.980 --> 02:04:52.820]   to Slack.

[02:04:59.060 --> 02:05:01.780]   - I am not paying for it yet.
[02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:03.340]   - I don't see a price.
[02:05:03.340 --> 02:05:04.940]   I see no price.
[02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:07.620]   Maybe they get the things to pay.
[02:05:07.620 --> 02:05:09.740]   - The things may pay. - Or charge the tricks.
[02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:10.900]   Maybe.
[02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:12.420]   What is this?
[02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:13.260]   - What is what?
[02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:17.420]   - Click on click-o-it.

[02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:25.780]   - Dutch, yeah, okay, there you go.
[02:05:25.780 --> 02:05:27.620]   - You can now, oh, I didn't know this.

[02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:33.620]   Thank God, I've been waiting for that.
[02:05:33.620 --> 02:05:35.420]   Stem bus touring is here.
[02:05:35.420 --> 02:05:37.540]   - New, ookie, ne-de-len-de.
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:38.820]   - I love Dutch.
[02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:42.660]   Dutch, it sounds like a fake language.
[02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:46.900]   - Well, I imagine the word is probably pronounced Google.
[02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:51.540]   - I love the Dutch people.
[02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:52.620]   I love the Dutch people.

[02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:57.300]   - The beer.
[02:05:57.300 --> 02:05:58.660]   - I love the Dutch.
[02:05:58.660 --> 02:06:01.500]   - Slack, not crazy about it.
[02:06:01.500 --> 02:06:03.060]   - So that's right.
[02:06:03.060 --> 02:06:05.060]   - That's my thing. - That's my thing.
[02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:06.740]   - Thank you, that's a good thing, a listo.
[02:06:06.740 --> 02:06:08.860]   You said you didn't have a thing, you had a thing.
[02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:09.700]   - A thing.
[02:06:09.700 --> 02:06:10.540]   - That's a good thing.
[02:06:10.540 --> 02:06:11.380]   - What's the thing?
[02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:12.700]   - It's not a physical thing.
[02:06:12.700 --> 02:06:15.260]   - It doesn't have to be a physical thing.
[02:06:15.260 --> 02:06:18.340]   I sometimes mine are TV shows.
[02:06:18.340 --> 02:06:19.900]   It could be anything you want, books.
[02:06:19.900 --> 02:06:21.500]   - Oh, no, I do books all the time.
[02:06:21.500 --> 02:06:23.660]   - It's just a podcast.
[02:06:23.660 --> 02:06:25.140]   - It's just a podcast.
[02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:26.580]   - It's the 87th hour.
[02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:27.700]   - You don't have to bring your E-game.
[02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:29.940]   - We're in hour four of the podcast.
[02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:32.260]   You can do anything you want now.
[02:06:32.260 --> 02:06:35.140]   - Jeff Jarvis, please get us out of our museum.
[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:37.700]   - I'm gonna go with thank you Google
[02:06:37.700 --> 02:06:40.940]   for a three hour vacation we all had this week.
[02:06:40.940 --> 02:06:41.940]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:44.500]   - When Calliver went down and no one could do conference calls.
[02:06:44.500 --> 02:06:46.020]   - Yay.
[02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:47.620]   - No one could go to meetings.
[02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:48.860]   No one knew what to do.
[02:06:48.860 --> 02:06:50.540]   - I love this tweet.
[02:06:50.540 --> 02:06:52.940]   Google Calendar is down and I don't know where I am
[02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:54.860]   or where I'm supposed to be.
[02:06:54.860 --> 02:06:57.540]   (laughing)
[02:06:57.540 --> 02:07:01.580]   - I saw a lot of, you know, get Dorothy to go to Zoom
[02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:02.660]   and get a conference calls.
[02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:04.060]   We don't have any conference calls.
[02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:04.900]   - Oh.
[02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:07.540]   - What is wrong with Google?
[02:07:07.540 --> 02:07:08.700]   - I slept through most of that.
[02:07:08.700 --> 02:07:10.060]   So I was kinda disappointed.
[02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:11.140]   I was like, oh.
[02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:11.980]   - Yeah.
[02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:13.580]   Yeah, I actually had no meetings canceled
[02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:17.220]   because of it, but I'm gonna use this excuse for weeks.
[02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:19.060]   It's 9.40 a.m. on the West Coast.
[02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:21.900]   Some workers may have forgotten to come into work entirely.
[02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:23.060]   (laughing)
[02:07:23.060 --> 02:07:24.500]   But it's not their fault.
[02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:26.060]   Calendar was down.
[02:07:26.060 --> 02:07:27.540]   - Oh, you guys, I'm getting hungry.
[02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:28.980]   - All right, quick.
[02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:30.620]   My pick.
[02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:33.620]   It is the 50th anniversary of the most important
[02:07:33.620 --> 02:07:35.500]   momentous thing humans have ever done,
[02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:38.060]   which is to step foot on the moon.
[02:07:38.060 --> 02:07:42.820]   And this is the most amazing website you have ever heard of.
[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:47.020]   It's ApolloInRealTime.org.
[02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:49.420]   They have collected everything,
[02:07:49.420 --> 02:07:51.540]   all the Mission Control film footage,
[02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:55.420]   all the TV transmissions and onboard film footage.
[02:07:55.420 --> 02:07:57.460]   2,000 photographs,
[02:07:57.460 --> 02:08:01.820]   11,000 hours of Mission Control audio,
[02:08:01.820 --> 02:08:04.380]   to 15,000 searchable utterances.
[02:08:04.380 --> 02:08:06.980]   You wanna join it at T minus one minute.
[02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:07.900]   - After the ignition sequence.
[02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:09.220]   - This is so cool.
[02:08:09.220 --> 02:08:13.100]   Now, if you saw the movie Apollo 11, which was great,
[02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:16.460]   it's a doc recent documentary that came out
[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:21.460]   that has this great incredible Cine Ram equality 4K video.
[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:26.620]   This is, that's all in here, but a lot more if you loved it.
[02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:29.300]   And look at, here's the transcript on the left.
[02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:35.780]   This was the most, for me, thrilling thing in my life.
[02:08:35.780 --> 02:08:38.140]   And if you wanna relive it in real time,
[02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:39.300]   what a great site.
[02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:41.420]   There's so much work went in this site.
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:45.260]   This is how history should be recorded.
[02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:46.540]   Apollo InRealTime.org.
[02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:48.100]   - Imagine if we had Twitter back then.
[02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:49.820]   - Thank God, there's no Twitter stream
[02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:52.660]   anywhere in this site.
[02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:54.940]   - No, it's not.
[02:08:54.940 --> 02:08:59.220]   Zero, no Twitter, never.
[02:08:59.220 --> 02:09:00.820]   It is time to wind this thing up.
[02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:02.700]   Thank you, Stacey, go eat.
[02:09:02.700 --> 02:09:03.620]   What's on the menu?
[02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:06.820]   I have fine Seattle salmon.
[02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:08.340]   - Oh, you know, I don't even know.
[02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:10.980]   I'm just like, oh, I need a snack.
[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:11.820]   It's 4 o'clock.
[02:09:11.820 --> 02:09:13.940]   - Nice, have you found any queso?
[02:09:13.940 --> 02:09:16.620]   - I haven't looked yet.
[02:09:16.620 --> 02:09:17.780]   So it's weird.
[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:20.340]   I haven't been needing queso,
[02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:22.620]   possibly because we went to Chipotle.
[02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:25.140]   I'm not kidding you, three or four times
[02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:27.100]   in the first week and a half over here.
[02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:27.940]   I was like, no bar.
[02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:30.140]   - What a disappointment that must have been.
[02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:30.980]   - It was terrible.
[02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:33.540]   And I got to the airport at Montreal and I was like,
[02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:35.380]   oh, I just need some food or it wasn't Montreal.
[02:09:35.380 --> 02:09:37.860]   It was wherever I was Philly.
[02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:40.460]   And I go down there and I'm like, son of a gun.
[02:09:40.460 --> 02:09:43.460]   All that's open is a Chipotle in an Oban pan.
[02:09:43.460 --> 02:09:45.700]   (laughing)
[02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:48.220]   - Stacey, always a pleasure.

[02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:03.180]   We missed you.
[02:10:03.180 --> 02:10:04.460]   - Yay, Stacey.
[02:10:04.460 --> 02:10:06.420]   - Jeff Jarvis, we love him too.
[02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:09.300]   I got to say, it's great to get the crew all together.

[02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:12.180]   Jeff, you may not be here next week.
[02:10:12.180 --> 02:10:13.300]   I know we have Matthew and--
[02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:14.540]   - No, I'm planning to be.
[02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:15.380]   - Okay.
[02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:16.220]   - But we have back up.
[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:17.220]   - I'll be not far away from Matthew,
[02:10:17.220 --> 02:10:18.220]   but I'm going to be in Toronto.
[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:19.060]   - We have backup and kids.
[02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:22.300]   - Or the Media Ecology Conference,
[02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:25.380]   an academic conference on the Clue and--
[02:10:25.380 --> 02:10:28.020]   - Oh my God, that will be fun.
[02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:28.860]   - That'll be fun.
[02:10:28.860 --> 02:10:30.180]   - That'll be really fun.
