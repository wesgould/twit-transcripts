[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google Jeff and Stacey are here. We've got lots to talk about.
[00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.840]   Stacey has been keeping an eye on Amazon re-invent the conferences going on right now.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.940]   Amazon made dozens of new product announcements. We'll break many of them down for you in the next few minutes.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.340]   Google Fi opens up to other handsets and towards the end, maybe the most important story of the year.
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.940]   It involves gene editing. It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.400]   In that cast you love.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.400]   From people you trust.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.400]   This is Twig.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:49.400]   This is Twig. This week at Google Episode 484 recorded Wednesday, November 28th, 2018.

[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.400]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, the show we cover the latest news from the Google verse.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.400]   And today it's going to be a lot of goos from the Amazon verse here to talk about all in Sundry.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.400]   We've got Mr. Jeff Jarvis. He's the Leonard Tao, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to wake you, Jeff.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.400]   Leonard Tao, professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.400]   And director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400]   And that he blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.400]   And he just barely fits behind his lower third.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   Professor Jarvis, hello.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   Hello and happy almost birthday Leo.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   Thank you. Yes, they've decorated the set a little prematurely with birthday hats.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   Tomorrow's your day off.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   Tomorrow I'm taking a day off for my proof of faith.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   And that's my day off anyway.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.400]   Yes.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   And Stacey Higginbotham is also here from Stacey on IOT.com.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:42.400]   She's had a lovely day trying to follow the 372 announcements that Amazon made at Amazon.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   What is it? Amazon Relay?
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   Reinvent. Re-invent. Redo.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   Request.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.400]   AWS.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.400]   Reinvent.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   Yes, we've got race cars.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.400]   Fish. Blockchain.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   AI. It's going to be crazy.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   They announced so many products.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   It's mind-boggling.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   Yeah, the most interesting one was something called Deep Racer.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   And you can go to aws.amazon.com/deepracer to find out more.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   I actually ordered it.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   It's not going to come till March, just kind of a bummer.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   It is, they say, the fastest way to get rolling with machine learning, literally,
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   get hands-on with the fully autonomous 1/18 scale race car driven by reinforcement learning
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.400]   and the city racing simulator and global racing league.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   So I guess they're going to have a league compete with the world's first global autonomous racing league.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   I have no idea what this is.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   So I don't know if this is the most exciting piece of news, but it is definitely well packaged,
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   deep, nerdy news that you're like, "Oh my God!"
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   So what they're talking about here, and it is big news.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   Don't get me wrong, but there's a lot of other news coming out.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   But this one, what's cool is they are showing a way to do what's called reinforcement learning
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   at the edge, and by edge, they mean on a tiny little race car.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   So what they're doing is they're training a model using something called reinforcement learning.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   And the way reinforcement learning works, it's actually the same way that they train Google's deep mind
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   to play Atari games.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   So you basically give it a goal and you're like, if you get it right, you keep going, if you get it wrong,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.400]   you fall off in the car case, you derail, and you're like, "Oh, that's not how."
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.400]   And each time it gets it right, it optimizes for that moment.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.400]   So that's what reinforcement learning is about.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   So that's like that Brev Walker I used to have, which is a screensaver, a box with four legs that couldn't walk,
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.400]   but it would keep trying different strategies, and then it would note, "Hey, I got a little farther this time,
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   and so incorporate that strategy."
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.400]   And the theory was over days, weeks, and months, and it did take a long time, it would actually teach itself to walk.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   Yes, I don't know if that's the exact model that that one was using, but it's a similar concept.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.400]   It's a long time ago.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   I mean, this is a decade ago or more.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.400]   So that's why I'm like, maybe?
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   Because I don't actually know what you're talking about.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.400]   Oh, man, I wish I could still find this thing.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   But what's cool about this is they're basically training the car in this tiny little car,
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.400]   and they're going to be like, "Okay, car, we've trained you on these tracks.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   Now go, and it's going to put it out in the real world."
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   This is a big deal because you have to train things in the cloud and these giant GPUs,
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   but then you also have to use models that are, you're building these super complicated models
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.400]   and getting them to run on a device that's like battery powered without a lot of compute power.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   It's really hard to do.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   So that's- So it's not connected to a server somewhere?
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   It's not doing this in the cloud.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.400]   It's doing it on board?
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.400]   It's on board, and it's using...
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   Wow.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   So that's why this is really interesting.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.400]   I mean, it can connect to the cloud, but it learns the tracks and then runs them.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   So that's what's kind of happening here that's worthwhile.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   It is also, I guess, I'm not 100% sure.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   I don't see how you can do a competitive race unless you have the same track, right?
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   So yeah, that I'm not 100% sure.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.400]   I'm like, "I don't know how this works.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.400]   I can explain the technical weird stuff behind it, but how you win, I don't know."
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.400]   But this is- Oh, so they have- They're doing races.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.400]   Right.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.400]   Having a racing dream.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   But they're not like your physical things there.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.400]   It's online, right?
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   You upload what you taught your racer and see how it does against other racers in a virtual environment.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.400]   It looks like.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.400]   Evaluate your model on a simulated race track, tune your reward function, and hyperparameters,
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.400]   train again to improve lap times, then submit your model to the virtual leaderboard
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.400]   to enter the AWS Deep Racer League.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.400]   Oh!
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.400]   But then it does- Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.400]   I take it back.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:10.400]   Then, once you've been accepted, deploy your model to the AWS Deep Racer to pit your skills
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.400]   against others in real world racing events.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.400]   This sounds pretty awesome.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:22.200]   Yeah, and so like what I was talking about, so the reward function in like the video game
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   is it's like, don't die.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.200]   In here, it's going to give you lots of different options for reward functions and parameters.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.200]   Maybe it's like, "Hey, you can take turns of this fast.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.200]   I don't know what's important in racing."
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.200]   But those are the kind of things that you'll train it with.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:44.200]   And you'll be like, "Okay, let's say your actual end goal is to, you know, stay upright
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   and not fall off a track."
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   Then it might go slower and you're like, "Oh, that's a crappy end goal.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.200]   Let's train it using this instead."
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.200]   This is really simplistic.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.200]   I'm just trying to keep it lightening.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   I hate to be a Scrooge McKilljoy.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.200]   But doesn't it just go round and round and round and round?
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.200]   Let's learn.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   No, there's probably, I mean, if it's a simulator, there's 20 different races.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.200]   I'm assuming they're going to be kind of like the racetracks, like if you do 4.1, how each
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   track is different.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   Yeah, you won't know what the track is ahead of time.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   I'm just training it to enter an unknown situation and navigate.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   Oh.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   That's the way I'm downloading.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   Well, we've been talking, downloading and installed the Brev screen saver.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:36.200]   So this screen saver is going to, it keeps dropping this thing in here and trying to walk.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   You see it has not in fact traveled any distance at all.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.200]   So that is a failed iteration.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.200]   And it's going to keep iterating until it finds an iteration that actually moves.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:52.200]   And I'll tell you what, next year, just ask me, we'll leave this on for a year, see if
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.200]   it walks.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   It's kind of a, it's, I think it's the same kind of thing, except that you can, this is,
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.200]   this, you can have inputs to your deep racer as opposed to this, which just kind of, you
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   know, the best distance I've done is three meters and somehow out this, this brick doesn't
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.200]   look like it's going anywhere.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   Oh, here's one.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200]   Oh, this is interesting.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.200]   Look at that.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   See?
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   Well, it moved.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   It moved.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.200]   It flipped itself over.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   So, well, it's learned something here.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   This was the, by the way, this is the new champion, 3.57 meters.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   It's actually, I used to put it on my kids' computers.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.700]   They loved it because it was, you know, for little kids, this is great because it's one
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.200]   thing more inept than they are at learning how to navigate the world.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.200]   So deep racer is cool.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   I've just ordered one.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.280]   I don't know if I have the, yes, I have a feeling I can do it.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.800]   It seems, I guess the question is, who is this intended for?
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:55.760]   Is this intended for kids to learn or for adults who are actually working in the field
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.600]   to do stuff with?
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.840]   I think it's going to be probably for both, but mostly for adults who like to play with
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.840]   these toys.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.840]   It's a toy though.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.840]   It's not.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.840]   Here it is.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.840]   Here's the league.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.340]   It's open to everyone.
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:15.740]   Five events, they'll be at London, Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, and New York at AWS Summit locations.
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.260]   This is PR, right?
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.260]   Yes.
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.620]   That's why I'm kind of like, is this the biggest news?
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.860]   I mean, from an economic standpoint, and Amazon's business?
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:24.860]   No.
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:25.860]   No.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.860]   Well, it's pretty, it's $249.
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.700]   So actually, list price is $300.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:36.180]   So it's made me help Amazon's bottom line a little bit.
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.180]   They get people excited.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.100]   Oh, oh my gosh, Leo.
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.420]   Here's what I found for you.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:46.140]   So your screen saver uses agent-based modeling as opposed to reinforcement learning.
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.980]   And I have found a quaara answer on the difference between the two.
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.020]   I'm not reading it now because I'll stop paying total attention to you and that would be bad.
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.660]   But leave this assignment for future research.
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.700]   I will drop this in our chat if you care to learn.
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.700]   Very interesting.
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.700]   Oops.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.180]   Maybe I'll drop this chat.
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.180]   Maybe I won't.
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:09.900]   Well, so it says on that right up, you just showed from the order.
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.100]   The first selling point is that it's a way to learn more about ML.
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.540]   Yeah, right.
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:27.900]   Amazon also debuted a file system compatible with Windows called AWFX.
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.940]   I think I've lost the story.
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.500]   I clicked the link, but I can get the story.
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.500]   FSx.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:41.620]   Amazon FSx for Windows File Server to move customers from Microsoft to use Glacier Deep
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.340]   Archive as a cheaper data storage option coming in 2019.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.220]   This is according to Bloomberg.
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.620]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:55.300]   Amazon targets hybrid cloud customers with on-site servers.
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:03.340]   Oh, so if we're talking about big themes from AWS, not just cool, like tiny announcements
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.860]   there, I think we're two or three that I thought were worthwhile.
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:11.540]   I don't know if you want to talk about this, but one is hybrid cloud.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:16.820]   It is the recognition that Amazon has all of these enterprise customers who want to have
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.540]   their own stuff running on their own data centers.
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.860]   So there's a bunch of news around getting stuff to run together between their cloud
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.300]   and Amazon's cloud.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.140]   There's services like Direct Connect that are going to make it easier and cheaper to
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.700]   connect those things securely.
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.860]   And so there's a bunch of stuff related to that, right?
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.100]   Is Amazon stay right there for second state state state right there?
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.220]   Is this like the old Google yellow box?
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:45.740]   Are they selling the server that you use on your site or you could use other other equipment?
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:52.500]   There is basically the software you run their software and it sinks the two.
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.500]   Sinks.
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.500]   Thank you.
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.500]   It does more than sync.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.140]   I believe you can also like develop in those environments and also run them in production
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.660]   on the cloud.
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:05.140]   Like there are lots of elements to this, but we'll just call it the ability to do it and
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:11.340]   keep it synced between places and to run it in both places and to develop in both places.
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.340]   It's kind of.
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:16.420]   It reminds me of going back to the original like Netscape server days.
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:21.020]   It is a pendulum that swings back.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.020]   Yes.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.020]   Okay.
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.020]   So that's one.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.020]   Sorry.
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.020]   Thank you.
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.020]   Sure.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:33.860]   We did a bunch of big announcements around IoT and we should think about this IoT for industrial
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.020]   and enterprise customers.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:40.780]   So they did more security for Creengrass, which is an IoT product that sits at the edge.
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.540]   And these all kind of fall also sort of into hybrid cloud.
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.020]   If we want to think about that way, because they're also designed to run at the edge on
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.980]   someone's premise and in the cloud.
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:53.180]   Oh, you can't see my other hand where I'm doing my edge in cloud.
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.820]   Okay.
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.500]   And so they did a security thing with Greengrass.
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:02.180]   They did a couple like sensor analysis and pulling in sensor information.
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.540]   And I can't remember what those are called.
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.540]   Hold on.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.700]   It's like, I've got like six Amazon screen tabs.
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.420]   I'm like, I can't find that one inside.
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.460]   It's like insight, IoT insight.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:21.860]   They also today announced a super fast time series database, which is really big in the
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.900]   industrial world, because like that's where you're sending all this like, I'm at this
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:30.740]   and this is my temperature at this time, temperature time, temperature time, or just
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.900]   basic state, you know, time.
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.020]   And there are two news announcements related to that.
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.940]   And then they had their satellite service, which I feel is kind of an IoT thing.
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:48.540]   And that is a weird thing because it's, how big is the market for satellite?
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.700]   We don't know.
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.700]   That's what's interesting here.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.700]   It applies.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.860]   This is a large market.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.660]   This is a software services for people who run satellites, right?
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:04.060]   Well, so basically it lets you, if you're interested in satellite connectivity, it lets
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.340]   Amazon run that instead of you, which could be like an opening up of the market because
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:12.460]   beforehand you had to build your own satellite station.
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.340]   So think of like a smaller version of contact, like the lab at Jodie Foster lives in and the
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.860]   movie contact.
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:25.340]   So instead of doing that, you just buy it from Amazon, which means you could use satellite
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.100]   as a backup for maybe cellular in your connected car that you always want to be able to add.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.300]   So it's a platform for people who want to use this kind of connectivity, not for people
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.300]   who launch satellites.
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.220]   In fact, satellite is called AWS ground.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.820]   Bezos will do that for you too, but just wait a minute.
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:45.140]   Apparently it's called AWS ground station and it's, oh, this is what Iridium has ended
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.140]   up doing.
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.140]   All right.
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.940]   So 12 satellite facilities around the world.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.820]   And so the ground station, basically it's a service.
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.060]   It's satellite is a service.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.060]   Geez.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.060]   Wow.
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.580]   Have we ever had, they had a V.S.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.500]   The CTO of Amazon on one of your shows?
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.500]   We should get them.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.500]   Verner or Amazon.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.500]   Verner photos.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.300]   Verner doesn't do a lot of stuff anymore.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:18.700]   So Verner is the sweetest, nicest, funniest man you will ever hang out with, but he is
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.540]   also very prone to talking out of school.
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.500]   So he doesn't, you don't see him in a lot of places.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.020]   I've been with him in conferences in his homeland.
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.020]   Yes.
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.260]   And in different language, I guess it's okay.
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.460]   Delightful person.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.460]   Wonderful.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.460]   Absolutely.
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.460]   What big bear of a man?
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.820]   Yeah, he's wonderful.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:45.420]   But they put Matt Wood and Andrew Jassy are the people that they tend to put out into
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.420]   the world nowadays.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.020]   And you should.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.020]   They're great to talk to you.
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.540]   They're both very smart and good to talk to.
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:57.260]   So AWS ground station would remove the capital costs of building ground station networks
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.340]   off satellite operations.
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:06.540]   They've partnered with a number of companies, including Spire, which is a company that launches
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.180]   CubeSat.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.180]   Little tiny satellites.
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.580]   They have 60 of them in orbit with multiple sensors.
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:17.380]   They track ships and airplanes, gather atmospheric data to forecast weather.
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:22.740]   Spire says, you know, that's just an offshoot of our real business, which is analytics, but
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.780]   we had to put the satellites up.
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:29.300]   They, the Spire guy said the same way we rank compute capacity on Amazon due to need,
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.820]   we'll now be able to rent ground station capacity to suck data from our satellites on demand.
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:34.820]   So I guess it is.
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.540]   Oh, so here's how you set it up.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.380]   They are working with the ridium as well.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.420]   So think about it this way.
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:44.580]   So if you know the difference between, I, okay, I'm just going to do it.
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:49.980]   IaaS infrastructure as a service versus platforms as a service and versus software as a service.
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.940]   So I just went up a stack there.
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:58.940]   Amazon with AWS has the infrastructure as a service, plus they have platforms as a service
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.500]   as well, sales versus a software as a service.
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.700]   What Amazon is doing, the satellite providers are going to be the infrastructure.
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.900]   So the servers are equal to satellites in this example.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.980]   And then Amazon with ground station is going to be this PaaS layer that would be like a
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:19.940]   Heroku or a pick another PaaS layer in Amazon that I can't think of right now.
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.300]   It makes you wonder why they don't launch satellites and do the whole stack.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.260]   Well, there's a bunch of junk up there in space.
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.980]   Yeah, we don't need more.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.260]   That's why they're working with a ridium, which was originally launched to be a satellite
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.540]   phone network and then went bankrupt.
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.540]   Motorola launched them.
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.380]   But is this part of?
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.940]   So they're going to, is this Bezos is a bigger picture with having a rocket company?
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.940]   Well, but wait a minute.
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.300]   No, I think it's the other way around.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:51.460]   I think it's, this is Bezos really all Amazon is is infrastructure as a service.
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:56.580]   Well, initially it was, you know, selling stuff, but the infrastructure is, you know, half
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:01.020]   the stuff Amazon sells on its website is not sold by Amazon.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.020]   They are fulfillment as a service.
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.100]   It is infrastructure as a service.
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.100]   That's why they have trucks.
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.100]   That's why they have planes.
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.180]   That's the way they have warehouses there.
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:13.540]   And so they're in addition to all of those, they also have satellite ground stations.
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.380]   I guess that's enough of a business, but they want to set that up.
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.820]   You know, all I'm saying is the base is the base is as well.
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.460]   He's got a good, yeah, but that's not is that Amazon?
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.460]   That's Bezos himself.
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.460]   That's that's because he has so much money.
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.460]   He doesn't know what to do with it.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.780]   So he started a set or I started a spaceship company.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.620]   But he also did a great prime deal with Washington Post, even though those are separate.
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.620]   Right.
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.980]   Yeah, no, there's there's definitely interconnects.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:37.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.700]   No, I think this is clever.
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:46.140]   Maybe this is a better insight into what Jeff Bezos's actual ambition is, is just to say
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.620]   infrastructure as a service.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.140]   I think that's an interesting play.
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.700]   So what interests me a lot?
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.700]   Sorry, go ahead, Stacy.
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:58.780]   No, no, I was just going to say, so the interesting thing about and I'm I did not come up with
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:03.820]   this, but what Amazon has done is it's created this platform, right?
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.340]   That it can deliver services on.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.340]   So be it infrastructure, like, sort of satellites, be it servers, whatever.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:15.780]   And then it has a way to see what's happening on those services.
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:21.060]   And what you see it do is when it sees something that it likes that a lot of people are using,
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.460]   it's like, Oh, jump right on.
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.900]   I'm going to build that.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:28.340]   So then it builds that, but it builds it also as a platform.
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:33.100]   So what it's basically doing is just building layers so it can see what's popular and then
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.340]   get in on that business.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.340]   And it's brilliant.
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.340]   It's data.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.340]   Yep.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:41.380]   You create infrastructure as a service and then you use the resulting data to decide what
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.740]   are their businesses to get into.
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:47.140]   Well, they're also create API like Google create API is to all this ML stuff that people can't
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.140]   build.
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.140]   Right.
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:54.860]   So you're getting it's not software as a service so much as as as added services to
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.860]   the infrastructure.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.700]   Well, and here's another thing they announced.
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.700]   You haven't gotten all three.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:05.500]   I'm going to guess that you're the third leg of the you said the first thing was I'm
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.780]   sorry, hybrid cloud, cloud, hybrid cloud.
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:13.420]   The second thing was IOT, which you could argue industrial slash enterprise readiness
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.420]   for IOT.
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.420]   What's the third one?
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.420]   Arm servers.
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.420]   What is it?
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.420]   She got excited.
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.860]   I don't know what about a dam.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.660]   This is what I'm so excited about.
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.660]   Yes.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.220]   Well, I'm based servers.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.420]   Arm based servers as her school as they're just hooting.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.740]   It's the last thing I would have thought Stacy would hoot about.
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.300]   Oh, I know you guys are excited about the fish, but guys, I have been waiting and waiting
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:45.980]   for like more years talking about both Jeff and I are buying Amazon enabled Billy Bass,
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.860]   big mouth Billy Basses.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.660]   That's really the level where our level.
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.660]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:51.660]   And she's excited.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.700]   Well, Stacy is up with the cloud up there.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.200]   Arm based servers.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.500]   I'm sorry, holl.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.500]   You're better than us.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.500]   We'd accept that.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.500]   I'm not better.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.940]   I'm just different.
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.940]   Okay.
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:07.420]   So this was exciting to me.
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:12.020]   And I guess probably expanding the Alexa ecosystem is probably number four and legitimately,
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.020]   it's probably number three and arm based servers is way down there.
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:21.020]   But give it to me y'all because I have been waiting for this forever, which is the idea
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:29.860]   that instead of just using x86 based servers, now using arm servers makes a lot more sense,
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.540]   especially when we start talking about things like virtual machines.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:38.820]   So when we started talking about virtual machines way back in like, I don't know, was
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.180]   it 2008 to 2006?
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:48.660]   I guess is when they launched it started to make sense because you didn't actually need
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.220]   these massive cores to run these small little spin ups of compute jobs.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:58.700]   So that's when this idea of lower powered and optimizing performance per watt.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:03.260]   So creating more efficient data centers came in and arm is a way to do this.
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.500]   But man, it took forever.
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.660]   We had to get to like 30 and we went from 32 bit arm based cores.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.620]   We had to get 64 bit base cores, then we had to get chip designers to build it, but
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:17.260]   the big implicate and then we had to get people like Amazon to use it, which is why this is
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.660]   such a big deal.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.900]   So Amazon's now using it.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:21.900]   Baidu uses it.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.540]   I think Microsoft may use some arm based servers for some of their stuff.
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:28.660]   This has to make Intel crazy.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.140]   Exactly because there's two things here.
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:36.180]   One, there's a viable for some workloads competitor to Intel and I'm sorry AMD.
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:40.460]   I love you so much, but most weeks you are not a viable competitor.
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.900]   Right now their current generation is.
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:49.180]   But also people can license this arm architecture and build totally different style chips based
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:54.060]   on it, which means you can optimize for different workloads.
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.420]   And that's a big deal.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.180]   Okay, that's it.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:02.300]   Do you not think that AI, ML, RL also are a bit wrong?
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.220]   Yes, those are huge.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.980]   That's why Nvidia has been able to get into the data center.
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:16.580]   Now there is, there are not still that many workloads right now.
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.780]   You still have, and I would love actually, I don't know if anyone does this, divides
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.020]   up the types of workloads there.
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:29.220]   If you think about transactional database workloads versus just straight up spinning up
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:38.140]   by EC2 instance versus machine learning or encoding, decoding, all of those things are
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.140]   very specific jobs.
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:45.580]   And I don't know what percentage of jobs could be done on ARM.
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:50.020]   So Amazon also announced in Ferrencia.
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.500]   This is exciting too.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:59.940]   A machine learning reference chip to compete with Google's TPU or Nvidia.
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:04.860]   The cost and speed of the speed and cost of running machine learning operations are a
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.740]   competitor differentiator for enterprises.
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:12.020]   Speed advantages will make or break successive enterprises and nations when you think of
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.220]   warfare.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.700]   This speed can only be achieved with custom hardware and in Ferrencia is AWS's first
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.860]   step to get into this game.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:25.140]   It's Holger Muhler who's an analyst with Constellation Research talking to TechCrunch.
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:32.300]   In Ferrencia, I don't know anything about any of this stuff, but it does support TensorFlow,
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.300]   which is Google's.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.940]   And Cafe and it supports all the big ones.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.100]   So this is again infrastructure as a service, right?
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.220]   It's machine language machine learning.
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:53.140]   So it's a chip that's going to run presumably best using Amazon SageMaker and other AI stuff,
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.300]   but it will also run these others.
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:00.260]   And the idea here is to get the lowest cost basically to optimize your things.
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:07.300]   So it's either low cost or it does jobs faster, which I guess turns into low cost or is more
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.300]   efficient.
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:12.020]   So it costs Amazon less to run these models for their clients.
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:16.980]   They also announced Amazon's Elastic inference engine.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.700]   If they really had said something like Elastic inference engine open, they could have called
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:26.180]   it EIEIO, which would have been I think better, but they missed a bet on that one.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:31.460]   But the Elastic inference engine, the fish would be fun to say.
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:39.260]   Let's use is attached GPU powered inference acceleration to any easy to instance to reduce
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.460]   deep learning costs by 75%.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.620]   There's a lot of deep learning AI stuff in here.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:49.980]   The other thing that excites me in media is Amazon personalization and is on personalize.
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.300]   What's that?
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:56.700]   So that makes their personalization services available as a service.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.340]   Their personalization services are not like blowing me out of the water.
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:06.060]   Is that where they say people like you also bought the Big Math Billy Bass?
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.060]   Yeah.
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:12.380]   Imagine, I've been arguing for media people to be doing this for years.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:16.820]   And we don't because we think that everybody wants the same one product we make.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.020]   Personalization across recommendations of all sorts.
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.540]   It's a recommendation engine.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.140]   And there's huge opportunity around recommendation.
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.060]   If you do it right, nobody's able to name it.
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:30.660]   And Stacy has a point that their Amazon's personalization surprisingly given all the
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.260]   data they have is not the best.
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.420]   In fact, they got rid.
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.620]   I'm still pissed at them about six months ago.
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.300]   They got rid of the personalized recommendations for me.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.820]   And now it's all mixed in everything they do.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.900]   And it's not as good before it was much more straightforward.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:44.900]   Here's what we're recommending to you.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.180]   Here's why.
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.380]   And I could have an impact on that.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.380]   And I missed that.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:55.340]   Nonetheless, personalization as a service isn't done well most of anywhere.
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.460]   Now the issue is where does the data come from?
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:58.460]   Is a GDPR compliant?
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.260]   Do you have permission to do this?
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.460]   The way they describe you provide the data.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:03.460]   They're just providing the hardware.
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:09.140]   They're providing the hardware and the ML.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.140]   The backs of the up.
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.980]   It says you create a schema describing your data set.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.660]   You create a data set group for building the model.
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.100]   You send the data to personalize.
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.340]   It then creates a solution and a campaign.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.420]   Here's Amazon Poly.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.420]   Explain.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.420]   Do we know about Poly?
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.420]   Let me know.
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.420]   Oh, yes.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.420]   Poly's been there for last year.
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.420]   Yeah, it's been up for a while.
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.420]   How many places?
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.420]   I don't know.
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.420]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.660]   Amazon Personalize.
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.500]   Real time personalization and recommendation for everyone.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.660]   It sounds a little bit like you.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.060]   I think your reference offers a wide range of exciting topics to work on.
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.060]   He's not as happy as a person.
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.220]   It's just an answer voice.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.220]   That's all it is.
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:47.220]   I can do that too.
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.940]   Amazon Personalize.
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.700]   But I can't do it as cheaply.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:51.700]   It's as Poly.
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:52.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.900]   I expected Poly to have a female voice.
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:54.900]   I must confess.
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:55.900]   Well, go to Poly.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.900]   Go to that link on Poly.
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.900]   Yeah.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:58.900]   You want to?
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:28:59.900]   Joanna?
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:00.900]   Joanna.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:01.900]   Hello.
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:02.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:03.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:04.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:05.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:09.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:10.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:11.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:12.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:13.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:14.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:15.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:26.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:33.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:38.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:43.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:44.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:45.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:46.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.900]   I want to talk about how to do it.
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:48.900]   They are exploring.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.900]   Amazon gets into the blockchain.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.900]   They said they never do it.
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:58.900]   They said last year they said we're not going to do a blockchain.
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:03.900]   Today, according to TechCrunch, the company announced a new service called Amazon,
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.900]   Quantum Ledger Database, QLDB,
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.900]   which is a fully managed ledger database with a central trusted authority.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.900]   I thought the whole point of blockchain was decentralized, but okay.
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.900]   You can have it two ways.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:21.900]   One of the services that supports QLDB is their managed blockchain service.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.900]   The thing is it's immutable.
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:29.900]   Append-only, tracks history of all changes, cryptographically chained and verifiable.
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.900]   That's really kind of, I think, the key to blockchain runs and all of that.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.900]   It doesn't have to be decentralized.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.900]   It also announced a managed blockchain service.
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.900]   It'll be really scalable.
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.900]   It says AWS CEO Andy Jassy.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.900]   Okay.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.900]   That's not all.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.900]   It's all just all I understand.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.900]   Some of that I don't really even understand.
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.900]   Wait, we haven't talked about the fish yet.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.900]   Bigmouth Billy Bass.
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.900]   Did they announce that today?
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:01.900]   I don't know.
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:02.900]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.900]   It was all the list for sure.
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.900]   The fish is on the list.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.900]   Your fish is on my list.
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:18.900]   I already won immediately, but we've disappointed to learn that the bigmouth, this was, it was
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:19.900]   a meme.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:20.900]   Wasn't it?
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.900]   Carsten, we saw a video of it and it was fake.
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.900]   Yes, no, no, it was a hack.
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:33.900]   Someone had hacked, basically just hacked the voice recognition of an old school Bigmouth
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.900]   Billy Bass.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:35.900]   Which would have been better.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.900]   To speak when...
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:42.900]   So now they have an echo, it's basically an echo speaker that's a Billy Bass.
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:43.900]   With a moving mouth.
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:44.900]   It would lip sync.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:45.900]   Yes.
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:52.900]   Yeah, it's called the bigmouth Billy Bass with a $39.99 pre-order, delivers December 1st, or
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.900]   released December 1st.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:32:04.900]   But if you look more closely, you have to pair an existing Amazon Echo device to that as a
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.900]   new speaker and then it will sync to you.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:13.060]   And I don't know why they did it this way, because Amazon in September introduced something
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:17.740]   called ACK ConnectKit.
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:22.980]   And with that, what you could do is pop that module in and it would have actually, if it
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:29.060]   had a mic in it, so you would have to have a mic in the Billy Bass, not just a speaker,
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:30.140]   you could talk to it.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.100]   And it would be a standalone Echo device.
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.260]   Wouldn't that increase the cost about a hundred bucks though?
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.260]   I don't know.
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.100]   I mean, they're selling a dot for 25, so...
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:44.100]   I have one favorite talking Anthony Fish now responds to Amazon Alexa Voice of Command.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:48.860]   Just pair bigmouth Billy Bass with your preferred device in the Amazon Echo family and let the
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.100]   fun begin.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.100]   Billy lip syncs with Amazon Alexa.
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.100]   Whoever thought this would be Bass.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.100]   I should respond to inquiries.
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.820]   I don't understand why it happened in the patience and the longs.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:01.740]   And dances to the beat with Amazon's own bigmouth Billy Bass automatically updates with a
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:02.740]   little upgrades.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.740]   So he always has a little more.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.740]   Of course it does, because he's not only capabilities.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.180]   It's bigmouth Billy Bass.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.380]   He's back and better than ever.
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.620]   Where'd he go?
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.100]   Where'd he go?
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.100]   They stopped making him.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.100]   It was a fad, Jeff.
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.100]   You could only find him at the clearance house.
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:24.180]   So, next we're going to have the pet rock with a...
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.940]   Yeah, well, let's start thinking.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:26.940]   You could have...
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:27.940]   I have one of those.
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.860]   Speaking spells with... you could have a...
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:31.860]   Well...
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.860]   With pullstring dollies with...
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.860]   You could just go on and on and on.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.260]   Teddy, Rexpin will be back next year.
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:37.260]   Teddy, Rexpin.
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.260]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.260]   Oh.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:42.100]   So, the Billy Bass, you're right.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.140]   So this thing uses something called a...
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.140]   Gadgets.
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.700]   And it's the gadget kit.
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.340]   And basically it turns any sort of thing.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:56.860]   It gives it the ability to talk to and recognize like do notifications and help you with anything
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.220]   that you can tie to Alexa.
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:01.740]   So, if you want to build your own.
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:02.740]   That's what...
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:09.420]   So, you could take a big mouth Billy Bass and put a Raspberry Pi behind it or something
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:13.540]   and have it and put the Amazon Echo voice services on it.
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:14.540]   And then it was just...
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.540]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.540]   Right?
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.540]   I don't know how the lip sync works.
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:18.540]   Probably the only part we know.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:19.540]   Or yeah, something cheap.
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:20.540]   But I don't know how the lip sync works.
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.540]   So, are you...
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.140]   We'll work with the Amazon voice services kit.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.420]   Well, yeah, not the gadget kit.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.180]   So the gadget kit is different than connect kit.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:35.180]   Connect kit is just the Wi-Fi and a link back to the IoT core hub, whatever Amazon calls
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.780]   their IoT service.
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.220]   How do you get the lip sync to work?
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:41.820]   I don't know.
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:43.420]   I can only go so far Leo.
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.300]   It's gonna only do so much.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.460]   It's time for you guys to do some heavy lifting.
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:48.460]   All right.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.940]   We're gonna take a break and then I'll do some heavy lifting.
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:51.940]   Poor...
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:52.940]   Is there good news to talk about?
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.940]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:54.940]   I've covered...
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:59.140]   Is there anything else that the Amazon re-invent announced that we missed?
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.140]   Probably.
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.140]   Yes.
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.140]   But for sure.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.140]   For sure.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.220]   But nothing else that we have to know about today.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.340]   No, because you guys gave me my arm servers.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.340]   So thank you all.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.340]   Arm servers.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.540]   You're welcome.
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:14.020]   And that'll be arm servers on AWS so you could use arm.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.020]   Yes.
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.020]   Okay.
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.020]   Oh, wait.
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.020]   I lied to you.
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.940]   Amazon, do you care about their Cyber Monday press release that was basically...
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:23.940]   We sold a heap.
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:24.940]   Yeah.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:25.940]   But kind of devices.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:26.940]   We're gonna get to that.
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.180]   I don't consider that re-invent news.
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.780]   That's just general Amazon we have.
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.940]   Oh, that's the other line of business they have.
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:34.940]   Yeah.
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.940]   Another thing we do selling stuff, remember that?
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.460]   And we'll talk about the day one fund in the Black Friday protest.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.620]   There's other Amazon news.
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:42.620]   That's for sure.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:43.620]   But...
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.620]   Take a deep breath.
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:52.340]   I want to talk about WordPress, which is blogging as a service.
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.340]   Wow.
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.380]   Actually, it's the best way.
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.380]   I think blogging is really not...
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.700]   Is a small fraction of what you can do with WordPress.com.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.980]   That's what I do with it and have done for more than a decade.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:10.140]   But WordPress.com really is about making a website that reflects your company's brand,
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:15.740]   your aesthetic, a place for teenagers to put their best work so that when people Google
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:19.420]   their name, their WordPress.com site shows up.
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:25.980]   That video that their enemy shot of them in the back rooms at the school, smoking cigarettes
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.140]   or whatever.
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:31.260]   You want to control your reputation on the web, whether you're a teenager, an adult in
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.740]   our business.
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.020]   You got to have a home on the web.
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.500]   I mean, it's just that simple.
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:39.340]   Everybody needs a website and WordPress is the easiest place to do it.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:45.980]   I have to say WordPress.com takes care of all the boring stuff, the hosting, the security,
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:46.980]   the software updates.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:51.380]   You focus on what you do best, your stuff, your content.
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:55.420]   You could choose from hundreds of designs to match your vision, establish your brand,
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.540]   no matter how much design experience you have.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:02.660]   At WordPress.com, it's my home on the net.
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:03.940]   You can have a Facebook page.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.060]   You can have an Instagram account.
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.500]   You can have a Twitter account.
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.900]   But you don't own any of those.
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.500]   You own your WordPress site.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.540]   Upload images, video and audio to the WordPress site.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.380]   Ever since I closed my social media, that's where I put all my stuff.
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:20.380]   You know, unlike posting it on somebody else's site, you never lose control of it.
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:25.860]   You can export content to an import to your WordPress site, export from it.
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.860]   It's your site.
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:27.860]   It's your home.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.860]   It's your content.
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.860]   You own it.
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.780]   It's so important to me.
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.380]   Everybody at least has to have a website.
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:39.500]   You know, if a baby's born, you've got a friend or family who just had a baby, get them
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.820]   a WordPress site with the baby's name, set that up.
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.180]   That's something that it'll grow up with.
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:48.820]   20 years from now, we'll take over and that will have been their thing, their site.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.100]   What a great gift that would be.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.100]   Grow your audience.
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.900]   If you're a business, you'll reach new customers, built-in search engine optimization.
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:58.260]   So you show up at the top of Google social media features.
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:05.580]   So your customers, your readers can share your content, your business on their Facebook
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:10.700]   site, on their Twitter page, on their Instagram marketing tools that'll help you grow.
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.700]   And with the WordPress app, I love the WordPress app, iOS or Android.
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.340]   Actually it's on desktops too.
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.140]   You can manage your site on the go.
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:23.380]   I used it to post as I was traveling around Europe, but I also used it to approve comments,
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:26.420]   check viewer stats, things like that.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:30.220]   Of course, the best part about WordPress is 24/7 support.
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:35.380]   It's there when you need it and a price that is right, as little as $4 a month.
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.580]   I think it's a $100 business plan.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.580]   I love it.
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:39.580]   It is awesome.
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:43.740]   It's $32% of all the websites in the world run on WordPress.
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.580]   Find out why.
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.300]   Go to WordPress.com/twig.

[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:59.700]   Create your beautiful, fantastic, wonderful site.
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:05.580]   WordPress.com/twig to get 15% off.
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.740]   You played with Gutenberg yet, Leo?
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.100]   Yeah, I use it.
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:14.180]   It's the new editing platform for content that you create on your WordPress site.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.180]   I like it.
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.180]   I know it's been a little bit cut.
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.180]   This is my WordPress site.
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.180]   It's been a little controversial.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.620]   I haven't tried it yet.
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:21.620]   It's great.
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.260]   How is it controversial?
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.220]   Because if you change...
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.540]   That guy just almost walked off the table, but he didn't.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:32.060]   If you change anything anywhere on the web, it's controversial.
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.060]   Right?
[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.060]   Yes, exactly.
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.060]   Nobody will look at the old stick shift way.
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.060]   What is this automatic transmission thing?
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.060]   I want a double clutch.
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.460]   I'll log in and show you.
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:45.300]   I use the app, so I don't really see it that much.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:51.140]   If you want to post on the WordPress site, you'll see Gutenberg.
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.780]   I just like the name.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.780]   I know.
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.220]   You just like the name.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.740]   That's the real reason.
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.540]   Yeah, no, it's fine.
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:03.500]   I really like the back end on WordPress.
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.220]   Like I said, I've been using it for more than a decade.
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.780]   I'm so comfortable with it.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.220]   It's just natural.
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.580]   Just easy for me.
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.860]   I think that's really the secret to the whole thing.
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.700]   It's a lot better than Blogger.
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.100]   God, we come a long way, haven't we?
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.180]   Wow.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.300]   I used so many platforms when I first started out.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.180]   There was one called Grey Matter.
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.180]   They remember to type...
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.180]   What was it?
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:28.180]   Type?
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.180]   Type that.
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.180]   Type that.
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.180]   Type that.
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.180]   And then there was Dave Winers.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.180]   I never used...
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.980]   I never used a frontier.
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.460]   Frontier, right.
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:37.460]   Although that looked...
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:40.060]   The principle is very, very cool.
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.900]   I did use Typepad and then they had Vox.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.900]   They created Vox.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.220]   That was an example of...
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.900]   I did not own that site because when Vox went out of business, I lost a lot of my images.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.900]   I was able to get the text out, but those images were hosted on Vox.
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.420]   See, that's why I really like the idea of...
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.740]   And I back up regularly.
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:02.580]   My WordPress site is always safe on my hard drives as well as on their servers.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:06.420]   And they make that very easy to do.
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.980]   Let's talk about Cyber Monday.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:09.980]   Silly name.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:17.900]   Oh, the premise used to be that everybody would wait to shop online until they were at work
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.540]   where they had fast internet connections.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.020]   Now most people have faster internet connections at home.
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:26.100]   In fact, billions of dollars in goods sold Thanksgiving day.
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.940]   So Amazon came up with a noon thing, but I don't know if we should talk about it yet.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.940]   I told Jeff because I was making a...
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:32.940]   Go ahead.
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:33.940]   What is it?
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:34.940]   They're calling it the Turkey Five.
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:35.940]   Oh, they're great.
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:36.940]   I refuse to condone.
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:37.940]   No, the five...
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.940]   They mean storms that aren't hurricanes.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:40.940]   Yeah.
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:46.020]   The five shopping days that start with Thanksgiving and continue through Cyber Monday.
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.020]   Broke records.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:48.020]   Which I say...
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:53.020]   US consumers bought millions more products over that period compared with that period.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:56.420]   Last year, 18 million...
[00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:57.580]   This is all from Amazon.
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.500]   18 million toys on Black Friday.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.500]   13 million...
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:04.260]   Oh, I'm sorry, Black Friday and Cyber Monday come on.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:09.180]   13 million fashion items.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.180]   Sales...
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.220]   This is Amazon's information.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.220]   The other one to look at, of course, Adobe Analytics.
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:19.220]   They have global information.
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:26.540]   The shopping event Cyber Monday for Amazon anyway was the biggest shopping day in the
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.580]   company's history.
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:34.820]   They saw more stuff Monday than they did on Black Friday or even on Prime Day.
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:38.820]   I wonder how that compares to Alibaba or Baidu on Singles Day.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.100]   And Amazon's...
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:45.940]   Their press releases are just pointless in the sense that there's no real data to be
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:46.940]   had there.
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:47.940]   But that's...
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:51.100]   If I could find out, that's the question I have.
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:58.020]   I think we could probably find out, let's see, according to Adobe Cyber Monday...
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.020]   Sales...
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:03.500]   We're 7.9 billion online.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.260]   That is, I think, a fraction of Singles Day.
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:09.620]   Yeah, 30 billion on Singles Day for Alibaba.
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:17.900]   So one merchant in China, Alibaba, sold more on one day than all merchants, three times
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.500]   more on one day than all merchants in the US.
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.940]   Or worldwide, I guess.
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:22.940]   I don't know.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.380]   Cyber Monday is a global phenomenon, right?
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:29.420]   Public traffic at some malls and stores was down over the holiday weekend.
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.420]   That's because more and more people are shopping online.
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.620]   It's a 19% increase year over year for Cyber Monday.
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.820]   Black Friday, $6.22 billion.
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.060]   Again, this is not just Amazon.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.700]   This is all online.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:50.300]   But the weirdest thing to me was that online sales on Thanksgiving Day were $3.7 billion.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.700]   One billion of it from phones.
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:54.900]   So what's the scenario?
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:44:00.940]   You go to the families to have Turkey, you're bored to tears, you sneak off in a corner while
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:05.620]   Uncle Joe snoring on the barca lounge or in the football games on and you buy some stuff.
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.180]   Yep, it's the new cigarette break.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.380]   It's the secret break.
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.380]   Amazon break.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:13.300]   If you're Leo LaPorte, you get excited and say, "I have to buy that fish now!"
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.020]   Well, this is why I'm an outlier.
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:19.260]   My sales, the line of sales doesn't really peak at any point.
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.700]   It just continues.
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:21.700]   Solid buzz.
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:25.460]   Well, the other interesting thing about this is this is the first Christmas without Toys
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.300]   R Us.
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.180]   So I put it on the rundown chat.
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:33.500]   Amazon said it sold 18 million toys between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:38.100]   It had been stockpiling toys since Toys R Us.
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.100]   Guess who put Toys R Us out of business?
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:41.100]   Yeah.
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.100]   Well, Toys R Us.
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.100]   Time for equity firms.
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.100]   And Walmart.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.100]   And loaded them up with debt.
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.380]   Yes, it wasn't Amazon actually.
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.900]   But they're certainly reaping the benefit of it.
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:51.900]   Wow.
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:56.300]   Coles had a record day for digital sales and Thanksgiving.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:01.460]   Walmart and Target also strong online sales.
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:04.780]   Some customers, a lot of customers opting to buy online and pick up in store.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:08.500]   I never will understand that, but you see these ads all the time for Walmart.
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.940]   Because you don't pay for shipping then.
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:11.940]   And you get it that day.
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.620]   You get it that day, right?
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:14.620]   Yeah.
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.260]   It's just a way to reserve something.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:17.260]   Yeah.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:18.700]   Is that online sales?
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:19.700]   They count that.
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.700]   I think so.
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:28.580]   Anyway, it was, you know, I guess, if I'm honestly, if you want to say how strong the economy
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:33.500]   is, this is the best way to, the best stat to quote, if people are confident, they're
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.500]   going to buy more.
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:40.500]   And we're seeing massive increases year over year from last year in online sales.
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:45.660]   Thursday was the first day in 2018, all of the year to see a billion dollars in sales
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.620]   from smartphones, according to Adobe.
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:56.620]   Shoppers spent 8% more online on Thanksgiving Day compared to a year ago, growth of 8%.
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.580]   So I think that's one of the stories.
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:00.900]   Black Friday is not the only day anymore.
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:04.220]   It is the Turkey Five.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:08.260]   How did Adobe end up in the shopping day?
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:12.620]   I don't know, but this is the big, you know, of the last few years, it's Adobe analytics
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:13.620]   every time.
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.140]   No, that's true.
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:19.580]   It's a weird new business for them, relatively now.
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:24.300]   You know, there's really nothing to say about this.
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:26.180]   I think it's fascinating.
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.180]   I think it's a fun.
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:29.060]   I mean, it's better connectivity.
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.220]   It's mobile phones.
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.900]   It's the ability to buy things.
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:37.580]   And I don't know about you guys, but the number of pitches from companies and number
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:42.220]   of emails I got related to sales in the preceding week were just obscene.
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.220]   Yeah, me too.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.220]   So.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:49.300]   Meanwhile, Amazon workers went on strike on Black Friday.
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.820]   We are not robots.
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:54.940]   Unions for the warehouse employees called working conditions in human.
[00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:56.780]   Amazon disagrees.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:05.260]   This was particularly big in those communist countries of UK, Spain, Italy, and Germany.
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:06.500]   We are not robots.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:07.500]   We are not.
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.500]   We are not.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.500]   We are not.
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.900]   Actually, they may regret saying that.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:13.700]   We could be robots, honest.
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:19.180]   I'm sure they'll be replaced by robots.
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:22.540]   So it wasn't mass protests.
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:27.420]   Unifical said they expected about 2,600 workers would show up.
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:30.620]   So but it got some news.
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:36.860]   It got some airtime.
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:41.340]   I think we have now literally tapped all of the Amazon.
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.340]   Amazon day is over.
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:45.340]   The turkey is dead.
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.340]   It is.
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.820]   Turkey five are done.
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:53.420]   Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:56.460]   They said they sold out of Echo dots.
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:57.460]   Sold out, wow.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.820]   Well, I don't know if that's true though.
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:01.980]   Can I buy one right now?
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:02.980]   I bet you could.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.300]   They're making them fast.
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.900]   People are saying that the new Echo dots sound really good.
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:08.900]   They do.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:13.860]   I actually was going to buy another like a new Echo dot to replace my other one.
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.340]   And then I realized I had a Google hub.
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:16.340]   So I just use that.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.580]   I have so many Echo dots.
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:20.140]   I don't want to replace them.
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.260]   But mostly now I use them because they're so tinny.
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:24.540]   I use them just play to something else.
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:27.540]   Maybe my big mouth Billy Bass when time comes.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:34.420]   Yeah, the new ones right now instead of their $30 instead of they were $25.
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:38.860]   So, you know, pricey.
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:45.300]   We don't know what Amazon.
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:46.300]   Yep.
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.300]   I don't care.
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.980]   It's big news around Google five.
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:52.980]   I think this is good news, but I think it's I'm going to save it for the change log.
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:53.980]   Oh, sorry about that.
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:54.980]   Okay.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:55.980]   No, that's okay.
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:56.980]   But no, no, no, no, no.
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:58.540]   We step on your stuff all the time.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:48:59.900]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.260]   The change log is a little bit sparse today.
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:05.260]   So yeah, I need everything I can get.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:08.220]   I need all the changes I can get.
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:12.460]   We talked about this on this weekend tech on Sunday, but I'm brought up to you guys.
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:14.020]   And I don't know what you think about it.
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:18.820]   Washington, according to the Wall Street Journal, and they don't say who in Washington,
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:21.420]   the US government.
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.980]   So this could be intelligence agencies.
[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:26.540]   It could be the White House.
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:27.780]   It could be the Commerce Department.
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:28.780]   I don't know.
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:33.060]   Has initiated an extruder for all I know it could be Brent Kavanaugh.
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.060]   I don't know.
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:38.780]   Associated an extraordinary outreach campaign to foreign allies, says the journal, trying
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:44.180]   to persuade wireless and internet providers in these countries to avoid telecommunications
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:47.340]   equipment from Huawei.
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:52.540]   They're going to Germany, Italy and Japan, although the Italian response was, yeah, well,
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:56.020]   we don't like to use Huawei, but there's not really anything else.
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.420]   We cannot ignore Huawei because they're a leading telecom equipment provider worldwide,
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.780]   and it's a very tough call.
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.340]   Said one Italian official.
[00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:13.460]   So you remember in 2012, Congress put out a warning, the Chinese networking gear might
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:16.660]   not be safe to use.
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:23.740]   Last year, the Commerce Department said we warned us about Huawei ZTE, both Chinese
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:27.700]   companies that have some connection to the Chinese military.
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:32.740]   Huawei, in particular, was founded by a former Chinese military officer.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:39.300]   Huawei is the number two phone manufacturer in the world after Samsung, the number one
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:43.780]   networking gear manufacturer in the world.
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:49.300]   And they are the number one by far maker of 5G networking gear.
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:54.580]   The fear, according to the journal, and I think it's a reasonable fear, is that Chinese
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:51:01.340]   telecom equipment used in the United States or our allies could be used A, to spy on companies,
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:07.940]   either for industrial espionage or military espionage, and B, could have a kill switch
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:08.940]   built in.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:15.420]   And as part of a cyber attack or a cyber war could be used to shut down the networks and
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:19.860]   disable the information networks in these countries.
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:26.340]   The US is considering increasing, not doing it, just thinking, we're thinking about increasing
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:32.300]   financial aid for telecommunications development in countries that shun Chinese made equipment.
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:37.660]   And of course, maybe US companies too, but that's the problem.
[00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:40.540]   Yes, there's only like four of those.
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:44.140]   There's Cisco, is it Ericsson?
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:46.940]   Ericsson and Nokia are big players in this.
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:52.460]   Nokia still, I can never remember, there was Alcatel-Lucin, but that got bought.
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.860]   It's very, it's listed as Nokia, but who actually owns it?
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:57.820]   No, it's probably, then it's still Nokia.
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:01.060]   Yeah, there's like Cisco, Nokia and Ericsson.
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:02.060]   Right.
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:03.060]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:05.140]   And Huawei, but Huawei is number one.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:06.140]   What do you think?
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:10.220]   Now, see, on the one hand, because they don't say which government officials, this could
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:16.860]   easily be a campaign on the part of the administration as part of a trade war with China.
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:21.980]   So this is, I feel like our administration has lost so much credibility.
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:28.340]   I can't tell if this is like part of like the crazy Trump-China thing that he's got,
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.900]   or if this is legit.
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:39.980]   There, I mean, Huawei has had this complaint lodged against it for years, and they have,
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:45.140]   up until now, it's been just a complaint.
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:49.540]   So it's unclear to me if anything, like if they found material information and something's
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:56.060]   really changed, or if this is just more, this is an escalation of that rhetoric.
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:53:02.380]   And it's, we could be quick to point out, there's a ton of gear made by other Chinese
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:07.540]   companies that's in the market today, and there's even more stuff made by US companies
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:10.700]   in China, including the iPhone.
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:16.780]   So I don't know where you find this made in America, built in America, safe to use stuff.
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:21.180]   And by the way, one can also, I mean, this is a, in a way, this is a trade war.
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:25.740]   I mean, I'm sure that there are legitimate security issues, but it is a trade war because,
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.140]   of course, what's the response from China?
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:30.780]   Well, don't buy American equipment.
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:31.780]   And Trump-
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:32.780]   And Trump-
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:34.260]   It wouldn't be wrong to say that.
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:37.100]   Yes, and Trump threatened to 10% tariff on iPhones.
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:38.860]   It was an impolitically.
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:41.460]   That is not a political, smart move, but-
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:44.020]   That was, yeah, that was just strange.
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:48.540]   I think, I think part of the problem in that case is that the president doesn't really
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:50.740]   understand that tariffs-
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:56.660]   No, no, no, no, yeah, they don't mean money in the pocket of the consumer.
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:00.860]   They mean money out of the pocket of consumers.
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:08.700]   I don't think he understands that, but, you know, that's, that's neither here nor there.
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:13.260]   We could spend the whole show trying to figure out what Trump does and does not understand.
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.260]   I'm like, let's not.
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:18.620]   Well, I mean, I've seen a number of statements from, from the administration, not just the
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:21.700]   president, but others in the administration that really imply they don't get it.
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:25.060]   That, oh, a tariff, that balances our trade.
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:26.500]   You know, we take that money and we have it.
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:27.500]   Now we have a trade balance.
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:28.500]   No, that's not-
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.300]   No, economics is hard.
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.820]   They call it the dismal science for a reason.
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.380]   But he said today he has a better gut than brain.
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:41.140]   I'll go, yeah, you've seen the junk food he eats.
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:45.260]   I will grant you that.
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:47.620]   So that's, it's unfortunate because you're right.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:52.420]   We live in an age where there actually probably are legitimate security threats.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:55.380]   There's certainly a reason to worry.
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:56.380]   Yeah.
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:57.380]   But, or there's a reason to investigate.
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:58.380]   Let me rephrase that.
[00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.180]   But there's some doubt-
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:02.460]   And I would count us cast on this because of the political environment.
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:03.460]   Yes.
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:08.180]   But maybe they really did find something and that would be really worth knowing.
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:09.180]   Right.
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:10.180]   But-
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:11.340]   That's, that's I think what needs to go.
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:13.900]   If you're going to talk about the, you know, if you're going to castigate Bloomberg for
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:18.060]   its super micro story, this is even more so.
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:19.940]   I'd love to see the evidence.
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:25.220]   And I do think that if Huawei were doing this, that there would be some physical or software
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:26.220]   evidence.
[00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:28.980]   Yeah, you would have to see it in the code.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:29.980]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:35.740]   I mean, when Verizon and AT&T buy this gear, they test the heck out of it.
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:38.980]   And they test the heck out of it with the vendors.
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:43.900]   So like I've been inside test, test facilities for these guys.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:48.580]   And this is not, this is like years long efforts.
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:54.540]   And I feel like, especially a company like AT&T, which is like right next to the US government
[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:57.500]   and cozy, cozy, they're not going to screw this over.
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:00.100]   I don't actually know if they're using Huawei equipment though.
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:01.100]   So that is-
[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:07.360]   They're lovely are Australia has banned Huawei and ZTE from its 5G networks.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:13.380]   In October, UK authorities say they were reviewing the makeup of its telecom equipment.
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:16.860]   New Zealand has blocked Huawei imports over a significant security risk.
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:21.740]   So it's my guess there is a smoking gun.
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:22.740]   I feel-
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:27.900]   I'm a little, this is why I don't ever like to talk to PR people.
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:33.700]   I met and talked to for some time the VP of public relations for Huawei devices US.
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:34.700]   Oh, Bill.
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.500]   No, it's a woman.
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:37.500]   Oh, okay.
[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:38.500]   It used to be a man.
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.100]   Bill's corporate, I think.
[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:41.100]   Oh, okay.
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:42.660]   She's Huawei devices US.
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:47.940]   So anyway, she said, because she, I felt bad because I had a P20, which is a really nice
[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:48.940]   phone.
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:52.380]   And then she had the brand new Huawei Mate 20, which is a gorgeous, the most beautiful phone
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:53.380]   you've ever seen.
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:57.220]   Really an amazing phone, which you can't get in the US.
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:01.020]   The only country in the world you can't get either of these because- and you probably
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:05.100]   remember this last year at CES Verizon and AT&T announced, pre-announced, they were
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:06.620]   going to carry these phones.
[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:09.740]   Then we're told by the US government it would be a bad idea.
[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:15.380]   They pulled it and you remember the Huawei guy coming on stage at CES being livid because
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:18.620]   it basically destroyed their plans to sell the phone in the US.
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:22.180]   She told me, "We just don't want to spend marketing money in the US selling something
[00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:26.420]   if it doesn't have a carrier contract because that's how phones are sold in the US without
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:27.420]   a carrier relationship.
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.780]   You're just not going to sell it."
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:32.780]   So they yanked the phone, but they still sell their laptop.
[00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:37.140]   Huawei Mate book laptop is a gorgeous laptop, a really nice laptop.
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:39.220]   I was playing with it for a while.
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:45.300]   So right after that or soon after that, January 16th, 2018, there's a Reuters story by a
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:51.260]   different reporter, almost the same headline, except this one cites two congressional aides.
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:57.180]   So knowing that that's the source, that feels much more politically motivated.
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:59.420]   Although they cite national security concerns.
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:01.420]   Well, it's completely legitimate.
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:05.740]   It's also, if that's the case, it's a challenge to come up with something that doesn't have
[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:10.060]   a national security concern because we don't make this stuff here in the US very much anymore.
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:14.940]   I guess you could trust the Swedish company, Ericsson, and the Finnish company, Ericsson
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:16.740]   and the Swedish company.
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:17.740]   No, wait a minute.
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:18.740]   No, Kiek.
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:19.740]   No, Kiek.
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:20.740]   No, Kiek.
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:21.740]   No, Kiek.
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:22.740]   No, Kiek.
[00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:23.740]   No, Kiek.
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:24.740]   No, Kiek.
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:25.740]   No, Kiek.
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:26.740]   No, Kiek.
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:27.740]   No, Kiek.
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:28.740]   No, Kiek.
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:29.740]   No, Kiek.
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:30.740]   No, Kiek.
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:31.740]   No, Kiek.
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:33.740]   No, Kiek is headquartered in Espu.
[00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:34.740]   Sorry.
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:37.740]   Never second guess.
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.740]   Stacey Higginboth.
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:41.740]   No, no, no, no.
[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:47.380]   I remember having to write Espu based Nukiya when I was writing about handsets for the 20
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:49.740]   seconds that I wrote about handsets.
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:52.740]   All right, so there you go.
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:58.140]   I keep bringing this story up and nobody seems to really have.
[00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:00.740]   If I had the smoking gun, Leo, I would tell you.
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:05.140]   I want the smoking gun.
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:08.740]   So Leo, have you made a reservation using duplex?
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:09.740]   No, have you?
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:12.380]   Well, so I just was trying to.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:14.180]   I was turning down the mic and trying to do it.
[00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:16.020]   So you go to Assistant on your Pixel.
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:18.220]   See, it's only available in certain markets.
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:20.780]   Well, no, they expanded it.
[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:22.420]   So I went to my Pixel.
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:23.500]   I went to Assistant.
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:27.500]   I asked for a certain restaurant and then it had the button you want, which is make
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:28.500]   a reservation.
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:30.700]   Then it said, guess what?
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.780]   You can't do that with this account.
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:36.380]   But you might be able to do it.
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:42.540]   So how should I say I should say go to Assistant, go to Assistant, ask for a restaurant.
[00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:45.900]   You know, when you know the ticket reservation in San Francisco.
[00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:51.220]   No, what I would do is ask for a specific restaurant because then you're going to have
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:54.260]   a restaurant box and below that it's going to ask you, do you want to make a reservation
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:56.380]   at this restaurant?
[00:59:56.380 --> 01:00:01.500]   So plug, what are your favorite restaurants?
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:08.260]   Make a reservation at Kokari restaurant in San Francisco.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.380]   It may not give you the box.
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.380]   It may.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:11.380]   Kokari SD atorio.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:13.900]   For how many?
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.900]   Two people.
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:16.900]   Okay.
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:17.900]   For two people.
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:18.900]   For when?
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:19.900]   Tomorrow.
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:20.900]   Got it.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.900]   At what time?
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.900]   But what if I don't really want a reservation?
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.900]   You can cancel it.
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:26.900]   You can cancel it.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.900]   Just keep going.
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:28.900]   Okay.
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:29.900]   What's the phone number for this booking?
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.580]   It's going to do it.
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:32.580]   I don't know what the phone.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.580]   Oh, my phone.
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:34.580]   It's your phone number.
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:36.580]   Say this number.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:38.580]   Six p.m.
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:42.980]   I couldn't find any tables around six p.m.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:43.980]   Please try again.
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.180]   So it's just using open table or something.
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:48.140]   It's using open table in that case.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.820]   So what you wanted to do is make a call for you.
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:51.820]   Yes.
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:52.820]   Right.
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:54.460]   You got to find a restaurant that doesn't use open table.
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:55.460]   It's still pretty cool.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.420]   Although that's kind of a long process.
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.900]   It's actually not a great voice first use case.
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:00.900]   Yeah.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.100]   Well, I guess I could though.
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.620]   Let's try this.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:06.540]   Make a restaurant.
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:10.700]   I thought you were an announcer for a living.
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:16.700]   Hey, I'm good.
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.980]   Hey, good.
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:26.460]   Make a reservation for a party of 2 7 p.m. at Aka Rello restaurant San Francisco.
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:31.740]   Well, I can't make reservations at that particular restaurant.
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.700]   Here's their phone number.
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:37.300]   No, no, no, no.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:40.580]   Does anybody know a restaurant in San Francisco?
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.900]   That's not an open table.
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.940]   Good luck finding that.
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:49.740]   Anyway, what about Petaluma?
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:50.740]   No.
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:51.740]   All right.
[01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:56.980]   I'll bet they don't have an open table.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:03.540]   Make a restaurant reservation for the chukery Petaluma tomorrow at 7 p.m.
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:04.940]   Table for 2.
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:06.860]   Got it.
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.580]   Let's make a reservation with open table for 7 p.m.
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:14.220]   Oh, no, no.
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.100]   I'll see you at the chukery tomorrow at 7 p.m.
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.300]   No, I just made a reservation.
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.700]   It'll be a fine birthday to your party.
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.100]   No, I don't want it.
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.060]   So that's OK.
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:29.540]   So what we're trying to get to is that Google duplex thing that they demonstrated at Google
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:35.740]   I/O where that semi-human sounding voice will make a reservation for you on the phone.
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:39.540]   Here, let's venture beat did it and we can play their video.
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:41.540]   Make a restaurant reservation.
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:45.100]   OK, I found some choices.
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.540]   Which place do you want?
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.700]   Cafe Istanbul.
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:50.700]   That's what I should have got.
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.700]   Sounds good.
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.940]   I'll call to make a reservation at Cafe Istanbul.
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.940]   Ooh.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:55.940]   For how many?
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.940]   I wish you could listen.
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:57.940]   Two people.
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:58.940]   Maybe you do.
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:02:59.940]   I don't know.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:00.940]   Maybe you can.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:01.940]   For two people.
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:02.940]   For when?
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:04.580]   Friday.
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:08.740]   I presume you can jam all that information together just to save time.
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:09.740]   8pm.
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:10.740]   Sounds good.
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.740]   More fun.
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.540]   It's 8pm on Friday.
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.220]   Just in case that's not available.
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:19.140]   Can I try between 7pm and 8pm?
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.620]   Yes.
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:24.900]   Got it for 7pm to 8pm.
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:28.220]   I have a phone number here ending in 8321.
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:30.700]   Can I use that to book the reservation?
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:31.860]   Yes.
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:35.420]   This is a lot slower and more painful than just doing it.
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:39.900]   I'll look at under Kyle with the phone number ending in 8321.
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.220]   Should I try to book?
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.220]   Yes.
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:46.020]   Imagine you're driving Leo.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:47.020]   Okay.
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:48.020]   Alright.
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:53.100]   I'll try calling them now and update you within the next 15 minutes.
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:54.860]   You can always ask me about your reservation.
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:58.660]   I wonder how Cafe Istanbul feels when this thing calls them.
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:03:59.660]   Business.
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:00.660]   Yeah.
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:01.660]   You're right.
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:02.660]   Yeah.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:04.900]   Well maybe the reporter called them and asked them.
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:05.900]   Yeah.
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:06.900]   Apparently not.
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.540]   Because of that video just ended.
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:12.540]   A spokesperson confirmed a venture beat.
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:17.940]   The duplex has expanded from quote a set of trusted users quote end quote.
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:23.460]   It's a small group of Google Pixel phone owners who can now use duplex via the assistant
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:26.500]   to secure restaurant reservations in select cities.
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.500]   Presumably.
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:31.180]   I can't do it because I have a Google's Cheeseweats account.
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.180]   Oh yeah.
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:33.660]   Neither can Mr. J.
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:34.660]   Mm hmm.
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.740]   New York Atlanta Phoenix San Francisco.
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.740]   If you're not in the trusted tester group, you'll likely get an error along the lines
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:41.740]   of sorry.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:45.140]   I can't call to make reservations for you yet, but here's their phone number.
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:46.140]   Okay.
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.140]   Alright.
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:48.140]   We try.
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:50.380]   So maybe you're just not in the group.
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:54.620]   Well, I didn't know because I didn't get to a restaurant that didn't have other ways
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:55.620]   to do it.
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:56.620]   Maybe.
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:57.620]   I don't know.
[01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:58.620]   Should I try Cafe Istanbul?
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:04:59.620]   Sure.
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:03.420]   I'm sure they have lots of reservations.
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:11.620]   Take a reservation for Cafe Istanbul tomorrow night, 7 p.m. party of two.
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.620]   Here it is.
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:15.540]   Kitchen Istanbul.
[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:16.900]   That's all they gave me.
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:17.900]   Here it is.
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:18.900]   Maybe I'm.
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:21.820]   Do you have a place closer to you called kitchen Istanbul?
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:22.900]   I don't even know.
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:23.900]   And Cafe Istanbul.
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.220]   I don't know where this is.
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:28.900]   How many Turkish restaurants aren't there out there?
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:30.580]   Istanbul, Wisconsin, Tintanop.
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:31.580]   Oh, it's called Kitchenest.
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.220]   No, it's in San Francisco.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.620]   Maybe it's not Cafe Istanbul.
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:37.260]   But it says Cafe Istanbul is closed.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.260]   Like permanently.
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:40.260]   I give up.
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:47.740]   It's a ghost restaurant there making calls to it from a ghost.
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:50.060]   Alright, let's take a break.
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:51.500]   I want to do the change log.
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:54.460]   I can't hold it any longer, my friends.
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:59.700]   So right after this, your first evening of change, I'm bursting with change log news.
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:03.100]   Good spirits of change log tied.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:07.500]   But first a word about privacy.com.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.740]   I love to use privacy.
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:15.580]   In fact, I'm going back now through previous charges online and replacing my regular credit
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:18.980]   card on those systems with a privacy card.
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:23.860]   I'll tell you why privacy is the only card I use online.
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.460]   It's free.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:28.660]   Used by 400,000 users.
[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:33.300]   And what it is, it's a credit card, it's a Visa card, but it's tied to your debater checking
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:34.300]   account.
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:35.300]   But here's the best part.
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:40.340]   Once you use a privacy card at any individual merchants, it's locked to that merchant.
[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:42.700]   No one else can use that card.
[01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:48.380]   So if that card is stolen, no big deal if the number is exfiltrated as it were and we
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:50.860]   know breaches happen.
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:52.780]   No big deal.
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:54.900]   Anybody else can use it.
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:55.900]   You can when you create.
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:58.340]   Let me create a new card just to show you the process.
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:06:59.620]   It's really easy.
[01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.140]   You can nickname the card.
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:06.940]   I'm going to make this be for a let's see who do I want to replace.
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.100]   Oh, I know what I need to do.
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:13.380]   I think my subscription for the Wall Street Journal ran out.
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:14.700]   So Wall Street Journal.
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.260]   So you nicknamed the card.
[01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:19.780]   It will suggest a logo if it's something that it knows, but it doesn't have.
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:21.420]   You don't have to have a logo who cares.
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:22.620]   You can set a spend limit.
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:26.540]   So I know that that subscription is not going to cost me more than $100 a month or I could
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:29.660]   say per charge or I could say per year or total.
[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:30.940]   So you could say, you know what?
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:35.500]   This is going to be used and it's going to be used once for $100 and never again or there's
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:36.660]   no limit at all.
[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:37.740]   There is a single use button.
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:42.500]   If you want to click that, it'll also say it can only be used once for this amount and
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.340]   then you create a card.
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:48.380]   Now I am going to show you this card because you can't use it.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:49.940]   Ha ha ha ha.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.180]   Actually, I better I better kill that card right now.
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.180]   So there's a number.
[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:55.940]   There's a by the way, I love this part.
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:02.820]   It gives you a a trans a expiration date that's five years in the future, which is great.
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:04.540]   So you don't have to worry about it for five years.
[01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:06.100]   But here's the best part.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:10.860]   If I use if I'm going to trash this card right now, watch, so don't try to use it.
[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:11.860]   That's gone.
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.660]   So that that card you saw, it's gone.
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:19.140]   This is the one I created last time unnamed burner, but I use it for Hulu.
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.860]   I use it for subscriptions.
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:24.820]   I use it for everything because you never have to worry about a subscription going on and
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:26.100]   on and on and on.
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:30.700]   You can pause, freeze or delete the card at any time.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:31.780]   It's no longer good there.
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:33.660]   PCI DSS compliant.
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:36.740]   That's the same security standards as your bank.
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:40.620]   All your information is secured using military grade encryption.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:43.700]   Split key encryption with partial keys held by separate employees, kind of like in the
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:44.700]   war games.
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:48.180]   So no single person at privacy can access the data.
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:49.180]   The cards that you use.
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:50.180]   I love this.
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:52.380]   Any billing info you like.
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:55.980]   So if you want to use a card and not give the merchant your address or zip code, use
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:56.980]   whatever you want.
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:09:03.740]   Privacy will approve the charge, but the merchant will not get your address or your zip code.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:07.220]   They also support two factor, which of course I use to log in.
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:10.300]   Now I am sorry to say it's only available in the US right now.
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:14.460]   It costs you nothing to use because of course, like any credit card, they make money from
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:15.460]   their merchants.
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:16.460]   They won't sell your information.
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:17.980]   There are no hidden fees.
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:22.620]   I love it that subscriptions are now in my command.
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:25.340]   There's a browser extension of the Chrome Web Store you can use.
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:27.060]   They have an Android or iOS app.
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:30.220]   You saw how easy it was to create an app on the website as well.
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:34.260]   You link your virtual cards to your US checking account or your debit card account.
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:35.540]   So it's not a charge card.
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.060]   There's no interest.
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.060]   It takes the money out of your account right away.
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.860]   That's something you should be aware of.
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:41.980]   But oh man, I love this.
[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:45.500]   You don't ever have to worry about being billed twice or upgraded without your consent.
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.260]   You can totally send a limit.
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:50.500]   In fact, if the merchant gets hacked, you'll probably know before they do because you'll
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.340]   get that decline email or push notification.
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:57.620]   I have those turned on the minute somebody tries to use that card somewhere else.
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:00.140]   Privacy says that's the card you linked to Amazon.
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:05.100]   Somebody's trying to use it at Walmart and it'll decline of course.
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.620]   So you never have to worry.
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:11.620]   This is the only card I use online now and it's definitely the only card I use for subscriptions.
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:17.140]   I didn't even mention you get cash back up to 5% cash back.
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.660]   This is such a great solution.
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:21.220]   I don't know why everybody's not using it.
[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:22.220]   Privacy.com.
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.860]   There's no cost to you.
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:31.660]   It keeps your money safe and you have total control over that credit card.
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:34.420]   I literally use it now almost exclusively.
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:38.900]   As I said, I'm going back to all my online accounts and replacing the real credit card
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:41.300]   that they have with my privacy card.
[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:42.300]   It's that good.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:43.300]   Privacy.com.
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:46.740]   Oh, if you go to, I should give you one more little treat.
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:47.740]   That's for the holidays.
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.820]   Privacy.com/twig.
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:52.980]   That way they know you saw it here on this week in Google and you'll get a $5 credit
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:53.980]   on your first purchase.
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:55.460]   I know it's not a huge amount.
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.660]   It's just a little something to thank you.
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:58.660]   Privacy.com/twig.
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:05.940]   I'm a big fan.
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.260]   It was inevitable.
[01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:13.700]   Price comparison sites are now complaining to the EU that Google is flouting the EU competition
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:16.180]   rules favoring their sites.
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:17.420]   This is an ongoing battle.
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:23.620]   This isn't the one Google lost for the 2.4 billion euro fine.
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:31.620]   And now 14 rivals have sent a letter to the European Commissioner for Competition.
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.140]   I'm sorry, competition.
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:43.860]   Margarita Vista here saying, "Hey, they're not complying with your order."
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:46.420]   We come back to the problem.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:49.540]   Some of these things can be decent comparison sites and some of them can be crap sites that
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.460]   are just link farms.
[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:53.500]   And so who's to judge?
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:57.500]   I have long argued that Google should have a jury of business peers to judge rather than
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:01.940]   themselves since Google has the power of God in these cases.
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:02.940]   Yeah.
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:07.420]   Foundum, which is the company that originally brought the complaint against Google in 2010,
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:09.140]   is one of those 14 sites.
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:12.060]   I'm trying to find the others in the letter.
[01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:14.060]   There are.
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:17.860]   A Chatemoishere.com, price runner, ideal.
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:20.940]   A porado, comparado.
[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:26.380]   If Google fails to comply with the commission's decision, it'd be liable for non-compliance
[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:33.420]   payments of up to 5% of the average daily worldwide revenue of Alphabet, backdated to
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:35.100]   the start of non-compliance.
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:36.580]   5% of revenue.
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:38.380]   I thought it was only 4%.
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:41.580]   Oh, we know this is under a thin, non-GDPR.
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:45.820]   And this is also a penalty, right?
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:49.900]   5% of revenue.
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:50.900]   That's some money.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:52.460]   That's a lot of money.
[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:54.460]   That's a lot of money.
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:57.460]   I don't know.
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:02.540]   I would not want that.
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:12.420]   So this is, I guess they did record, I'm sorry, going back to this duplex thing.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:17.820]   Here is audio of Google duplex making a restaurant reservation from Venturebeat.
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:21.740]   I don't know if this is from the Google I/O demo.
[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:24.140]   No, this is new.
[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:25.140]   This is real.
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:26.140]   Hello, Capra.
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:30.740]   Hi, I'm from the University for a client and copy in Google.
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:37.380]   So I like that Irish accent.
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:38.380]   That adds a certain value.
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.220]   How did I identify itself again?
[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:42.660]   I'm calling from Google so I may be recorded.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:47.700]   So it didn't say it says I am calling a robot.
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:51.660]   It says I'm calling from Google.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.620]   But it didn't say I'm a robot.
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:54.620]   But that's all right.
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.620]   What are we?
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.700]   Yes, at what time would you like to reserve?
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.660]   I'm 7 PM.
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:00.660]   Okay, perfect.
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:01.660]   How many people?
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:03.660]   It's 4 and 2 PM.
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:08.100]   Okay, 2 people tomorrow at 7 PM.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.100]   What's your name?
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.100]   It's a President of the HANA.
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:13.740]   HANA, okay, thank you.
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:14.740]   Okay.
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.580]   I'll see you tomorrow.
[01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:17.580]   Thank you.
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:18.580]   Doesn't sound like HANA.
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:19.580]   Thank you very much.
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:20.580]   Thank you very much.
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:21.580]   Thank you very much.
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:22.580]   It's pretty realistic.
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:23.580]   It is.
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:24.580]   That's pretty good.
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:25.580]   There were no "a"s.
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:26.580]   But there were pauses.
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:28.940]   There were pauses.
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:32.940]   And I like, I mean, some of this is kind of thrown away like, okay, I thought that was
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:33.940]   quite good.
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:36.660]   And I had an accent, which would be perfect.
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:37.660]   Yeah.
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:38.660]   Not a very heavy one.
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:40.460]   But so rather charming accent.
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:45.100]   In that recording, which was an actual call that, you know, I guess they ran over to the
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:47.140]   restaurant and said, hey, Google's going to call you.
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:48.140]   Let's record.
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:52.080]   In the call we recorded, it says Venture Beat, the wording has changed from the original
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:57.020]   duplex ad of last year, removing the part that makes it crystal clear it's not a human
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.020]   calling.
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:00.260]   I'm calling to make a reservation for a client.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:05.140]   I'm calling from Google so the call may be recorded.
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:07.980]   That actually might have been a human operator.
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:11.220]   So this is an update that, wow, this is interesting.
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:12.540]   Venture Beat just put it on an update.
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:16.500]   At this stage, some duplex calls are made using Google's automated system.
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.820]   Others are conducted using human operators.
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:20.860]   Oh, this is like Facebook's M.
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:22.980]   And remember how much really that went.
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:25.100]   The former announced that they are automated up front.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:26.460]   So this was a real person.
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.460]   We were fooled by the fooling.
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:30.180]   Human operators don't say that.
[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:31.780]   They just say they're calling from Google.
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:32.780]   Hi, mom.
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:33.780]   I have a job at Google.
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:34.780]   Great.
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:35.780]   Are you going to make weapons?
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:38.380]   No, I'm just going to call and make reservations.
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:40.220]   So that was a human.
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.820]   Well, that's no fun.
[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:43.820]   No waste of time.
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:46.060]   You don't like humans edit this out.
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:47.460]   Humans humans.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:48.460]   We know humans.
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:52.380]   We've seen humans do act as assistance for years.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:57.020]   There's nothing special about that.
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:59.340]   I don't want a human to make full.
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:05.380]   So have you now read the many reviews of the slate, Jeff Jarvis?
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:06.900]   And are you thinking about it?
[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:08.900]   All right, Dieter Bonet had one.
[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:14.340]   Kevin wants you to read his because he feels that most of them hated it, but they were
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:16.820]   not actual Chromebook users.
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:17.820]   That is all I have to say.
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:21.180]   He spent a large portion of time talking to me about it this morning.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:22.180]   What's his site?
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:23.180]   All Chromebooks?
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:24.180]   About Chromebooks.
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:25.180]   About Chromebooks.
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:31.660]   So yeah, Kevin's a better because the complaint, almost all of the reviews I read were not
[01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:33.380]   about the hardware.
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:38.300]   They were about basically Chrome OS and often about Android on Chrome OS.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.180]   That's well, which is on complaint about too.
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.180]   Yeah.
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:43.140]   And you can't blame them.
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:47.860]   Pixel slate and Pixel slate keyboard review, portability and productivity at a premium price,
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:53.020]   7 TOEFL writing and about Chromebooks.com.
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:17:00.220]   He says the Pixel slate is a peak expression of the Chrome OS tablet, a powerful thin tablet
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:04.900]   for portability and content consumption and a relaxed environment, but all of the productivity
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:09.300]   of a full desktop Chromebook with a detachable keyboard.
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.980]   He said there's a price to pay for premium designer performance.
[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:13.780]   Yeah, literally.
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:19.460]   The model I recommend and it looks like the Kevin Got is the i5 configuration, which has
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:23.820]   8GB of RAM and 128GB of EMC storage.
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:25.540]   That is probably the sweet spot.
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:30.460]   You can get an i7, you can spend more money, but I'm not sure that's really worth it.
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.700]   And I wouldn't go too much lighter than that.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.660]   Those are pretty low powered processors.
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:39.500]   This i5 is a Y series processor, so even it isn't super fast.
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.100]   Do love the screen resolution.
[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:43.700]   3000 by 2000.
[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:49.700]   It's UHD 615 graphics from Intel shared memory.
[01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:54.940]   He says you don't sacrifice on performance, which I would say makes sense.
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:18:00.660]   He compares it in performance to a Pixelbook and to a Chromebook spin.
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:05.980]   And the spin is the winner in every case, almost every case.
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:11.460]   But it is significantly faster than last year's Pixelbook.
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:15.860]   So as Pixelbook users, Jeff, you and I, we might be interested just for the upgrade and
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:16.860]   performance.
[01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:24.900]   The only place looks like the Pixel Slate was faster than the Chromebook spin from Acer
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.700]   was the base mark, benchmark.
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:33.060]   And everything else, but on one and two, Jetstream and Octane, the Chromebook spin was faster.
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:40.940]   It's a premium priced, but it's less expensive, I think, for the slate for what you get.
[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:44.580]   What's the price of the Chromebook of the...
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:50.740]   It's seven or 800 bucks.
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:53.180]   He has his review of the spin as well.
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:54.340]   But the spin is in a tablet.
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:55.340]   It's a two-in-one.
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:57.340]   You know, it's one of those foldable things.
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:19:04.340]   It's a two-in-one.
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:10.340]   I can't contribute with Chromebook stats, so I'll seek a song.
[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:11.340]   Sorry.
[01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:13.340]   You have a nice voice.
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:14.340]   Keep going.
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:16.340]   Yeah, I sing the eyes of Texas or upon you.
[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:17.340]   Yeah, okay.
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:23.340]   Now, I wonder, did Kevin say whether he prefers the Google keyboard or the bridge keyboard?
[01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:25.340]   Because the bridge is 50 bucks cheaper.
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:26.340]   You know what?
[01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:28.420]   He's going to be on the show next week, I think, right?
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:30.780]   So you can ask him.
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:35.020]   He says that one annoyance, and I think Dieter Bonne said this as well in the verge of the
[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:38.980]   Google keyboard is it's kind of sloppy and floppy.
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:43.780]   And Dieter said, unless you have a really solid, flat surface, it's going to give a little
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.260]   bit.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:48.340]   Kevin says carrying the slate with the keyboard cover, which is a folio style.
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:50.860]   It goes over the front and the back.
[01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:55.460]   It has a little movement as well, some keyboard wobble when you type, but also movement as
[01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:56.780]   you carry it.
[01:19:56.780 --> 01:20:01.060]   It's a minor annoyance at best to me, writes Kevin, but others may really dislike it.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:04.260]   If you don't like it, the bridge, yeah, he doesn't have it, but the bridge is another
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:05.260]   option.
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:08.140]   I really like the circular keys, and I do like the fact that it's backlit.
[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:11.060]   That's something that Apple's keyboard folio is not.
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:15.740]   And I find that a big annoyance for the iPad pros.
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:22.500]   So I'm forgetting now, I guess I confused the other differences between the Google keyboard
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.180]   and the bridge keyboard.
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:28.540]   I don't know if the Google, the bridge keyboard has a fingerprint reader, the Google keyboard
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:31.180]   does.
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:33.380]   Or maybe that's on the, on off switch, I'm sorry.
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:37.780]   I guess that's on the slate itself.
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:38.780]   Battery life is good.
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:45.500]   Camera app is from Android.
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.220]   No headphone jack.
[01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:53.420]   And I know Dieter bonehead problems with the Bluetooth dropping out on his slate.
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:55.860]   Both but as a pixel C jack.
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:57.180]   Yeah, both Kevin.
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:59.020]   I thought to me not to see.
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.020]   I mean, USB C.
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:04.500]   I finally bought right today, a USB headset.
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.500]   Oh, good.
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:06.500]   There you go.
[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:07.500]   Let's see.
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:08.500]   Is it good?
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:09.500]   Which one did you buy?
[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:10.500]   Yeah, it's good.
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:11.500]   Oh, I forget.
[01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.140]   Google ships one with its pixel three.
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:14.140]   That's pretty good.
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:15.140]   Actually, I like it a lot.
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:17.020]   I thought they just shipped a dongle.
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:20.660]   No, no, no, you get you get headphones with the pixel three.
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:22.260]   Oh, very nice one.
[01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:23.700]   But those don't fit my ears.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:25.500]   This fits in my ears.
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:30.980]   By the way, Google's USB C to a headphone adapter dongle works on an iPad Pro as well,
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:31.980]   which is good news.
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:35.180]   I guess there is a standard now for that.
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:36.580]   They do not include.
[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:38.780]   Oh, they do.
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:39.980]   I'm sorry with the slight.
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:41.380]   They include the adapter as well.
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:44.380]   So you could use regular headphones.
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:46.100]   He seems like he liked it.
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:50.420]   He says, as much as I liked it in my first week, it's not a device for everyone.
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:55.260]   Not everyone needs a Chrome OS tablet when a two or one might be better suited.
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:58.900]   You should ask yourself these two questions, Jeff, to decide if the pixel slate is for
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:21:59.900]   you.
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:04.060]   Oh, that's another article.
[01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:05.060]   I fall.
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:06.060]   Okay.
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:07.060]   Now I have to go to that article.
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:08.580]   He doesn't say what the questions are.
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.660]   Here are the two questions.
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.620]   True tablet or two in one Chromebook?
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:13.620]   Okay.
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:15.220]   Do you really want a tablet?
[01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:18.140]   You know, I actually think I want a Chromebook with that.
[01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:23.020]   Yeah, I think the spin might be a better choice then or I'm very, the reason I haven't
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:26.140]   bought one yet, I really like my pixel book and I don't find it.
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:27.140]   Yeah.
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:28.900]   I don't find a need to upgrade.
[01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:30.380]   And then how much performance do you need?
[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:35.620]   And that's because performance, at least on this comes at a pretty steep price.
[01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:38.620]   So I have big Chromebook news.
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.820]   Ooh, tell us.
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:42.740]   Carsten and I did this before the show.
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:48.740]   So finally, finally, finally, finally, finally, finally, finally, skype works with video calls
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:50.660]   in the Chrome browser.
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:51.660]   Oh.
[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:57.660]   So we tested that, Carsten and I did before the show, not in the Android Skype app because
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:58.820]   that we know is not working well.
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:00.020]   No, in browser Skype.
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:06.020]   But the in browser Skype on the Chromebook, finally, all I did was calls before.
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:07.020]   Now it does video calls.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:08.020]   And it works.
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:10.140]   And Carsten said it works.
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:13.620]   And the fact that he liked the camera on the camera on my Chromebook made me look better
[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:14.860]   than this camera.
[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:17.860]   Oh, oh, exciting.
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:18.860]   Oh.
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:23.260]   So he was ready to just make that the device for the show.
[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:24.260]   But I said, no, let's play safe.
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:25.460]   I don't want to get in trouble.
[01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:28.260]   So we'll get more with Kevin next week.
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:32.220]   Or you could listen to the IoT podcast from this week, right?
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:33.220]   Stacey, you've spent some time.
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:35.660]   You do not talk about Chromebooks on a podcast.
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:36.660]   We talk.
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:37.660]   There you stay.
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:38.660]   Well, Kevin will be filling in.
[01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:40.580]   Very Stacey next week.
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:45.380]   So, and I'm now like, oh, God.
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:47.500]   So he was going to fill in for Jeff.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.340]   Now he'll just be on as a, as an extra guest.
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:51.340]   All three of you.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.340]   I'm filling in for Leo.
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:53.700]   I am not going to be here next week.
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:56.940]   I'm going to be in Manhattan watching a play.
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:58.780]   I'm going to be in Paris.
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:04.180]   But I now not flying well, just for a day and a half.
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:07.300]   But I'll probably be able to do that in the show for least a while that night.
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:08.300]   So come in here.
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:09.300]   Kevin.
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:10.300]   All right.
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.300]   So there you go.
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:14.300]   There's, I really don't.
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.820]   I should order it to review it.
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:20.060]   I think we, I think Jason Howell is going to do that.
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.540]   So we'll get a chance to play with it a little bit.
[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:25.300]   I just don't feel like I need to replace my pixel book.
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:26.860]   Yeah, same here.
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:28.980]   I wouldn't mind a new pixel book.
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:31.980]   They could sucker me into buying a new pixel book just because it has more performance
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:33.740]   and memory or whatever.
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:37.500]   Again, I would kill for LTE in it.
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:40.500]   And I'm surprised they didn't put LTE in the tablet.
[01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:43.300]   Yeah, boy, that's a, that's a missing piece.
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:44.940]   I guess they have five.
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:49.180]   Well, I guess their feeling is you could just hotspot from your phone.
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:50.220]   Why wouldn't you just do that?
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:53.220]   Why would you have like an instant tether feature or zad apple?
[01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:54.220]   That might be apple.
[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:55.220]   They do.
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:25:01.060]   They have a stutter, but it's just well, let's do a little change log.
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:03.020]   What do you say, kids?
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:08.300]   The Google, he was right on that button, man.
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:09.300]   Yeah.
[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:13.940]   And the big story is it isn't Project Fi anymore.
[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:17.180]   It's Google Fi and actually even bigger story.
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:22.020]   You can now use it on many Android phones and even your eye.
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:26.700]   Oh, heresy, heresy, heresy.
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:29.500]   It does take some extra configuration to use on your iPhone.
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:35.660]   And there are some features missing in particular voicemail.
[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:37.460]   You won't get the visual voicemail.
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:39.820]   You'll still get a text with a text of the voicemail.
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:43.100]   But if you want to listen to the voicemail, you actually have to call the voicemail number,
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:44.100]   big deal on an iPhone.
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:46.860]   And you do have to go in there and mess with it a bit.
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:53.180]   Messages will work over Wi-Fi, but to get it to work for SMS over Fi, you'll need to change
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:54.180]   some settings.
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:57.660]   All of that is pretty straightforward.
[01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:03.740]   You get many of the benefits of Google Fi, which both Jeff and I use and love.
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:09.460]   It's $20 a month for voice and text, unlimited voice and text in the US.
[01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:13.300]   International travelers will pay a little more for the voice calls, but not much.
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:17.780]   And the text continues to be unlimited for the 20 buck base price.
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:22.100]   And then data is 10 bucks a gigabyte, up to 6 gigabytes.
[01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:25.460]   And then free after that until you get to 15 gigabytes.
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:29.340]   And then you have a choice of either being throttled or paying 10 bucks a gigabyte for
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:30.340]   the next one.
[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:31.340]   Oh, you do have a choice then.
[01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:32.900]   Yeah, you can after 15.
[01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:34.860]   I read this, but I'd forgotten about it.
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:37.300]   Paul Thorett tried it when he was in Europe.
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:40.940]   He said, "Yeah, they actually notify you.
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:42.980]   They say, 'Hey, you're coming up on 15 gigs.
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:44.020]   Would you like to be throttled?'
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:45.020]   He said, 'Let it throttle.'
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:46.620]   And he said it was fine.
[01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:51.940]   Or would you like to pay and have full speed at the same price 10 bucks a gigabyte for subsequent
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:52.940]   gigabytes."
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:55.060]   So that's very fair, if you ask me.
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:59.420]   It works internationally in 100 some countries, almost 200 countries.
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:02.660]   That's nice too, because if you travel a lot, you don't have to do anything.
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:04.060]   Your phone just continues to work.
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:05.060]   Data continues to work.
[01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:12.180]   You pay the same price, except for, as I said, long distance calls from Europe.
[01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:17.700]   There will be a Fi app for iOS, which will help you a little bit configuring Google Fi
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:18.700]   to work with iOS.
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:23.500]   It's actually quite a nice looking app.
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:28.220]   The other thing that Paul Throt said, and I hadn't seen this, is that it won't do that
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:33.540]   special thing Google Fi does on Pixel phones, which is hunt for the best network.
[01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:40.900]   The way Fi works on a Pixel, for instance, is it will use T-Mobile, Sprint, or US Cellular,
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:45.700]   or Wi-Fi, whichever the four is the strongest, and it hands off seamlessly.
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:50.420]   So I'll be at home on Wi-Fi, drive out my door, drive out the up the driveway.
[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:55.140]   It'll switch over to T-Mobile, and the call will continue as if nothing had happened,
[01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:56.580]   which is pretty cool.
[01:27:56.580 --> 01:28:03.700]   Apparently, the ability to detect or to operate in other networks is not on other phones.
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:07.420]   I think those phones will show up as T-Mobile, or always use T-Mobile.
[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:08.420]   But I...
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:12.820]   The one odd thing about my Fi phone, again, I use it mainly internationally.
[01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:16.020]   So I use my older Pixel, my original Pixel.
[01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:22.620]   It can take sometimes a half a day to get configured to the network.
[01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:23.620]   Really?
[01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:24.620]   I've not experienced that.
[01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:25.620]   Yeah.
[01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:26.780]   I don't know what it is or why it is.
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:27.780]   It's very weird.
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:30.220]   Everybody from Google is hearing and knows what the problem might be.
[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:31.980]   I don't know.
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:33.940]   But it just won't hook in.
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:34.940]   And finally, it does.
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:38.100]   I've never had a lot to it.
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:44.700]   So a lot of phones, Samsung phones, Moto phones, LG phones, OnePlus phones will work now with
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:47.580]   Google Fi as well as iOS phones.
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:48.980]   So you really...
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:52.900]   It's basically now they are a real service, not just a project Fi.
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:54.700]   They are Google Fi.
[01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:55.700]   So...
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:57.700]   Jeff, what happens when it doesn't connect?
[01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:58.700]   So what are you saying?
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:28:59.700]   Are you roaming there?
[01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:00.700]   It just says...
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:01.900]   No, I have to use my other...
[01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:02.900]   I use my USB phone.
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:03.900]   Oh.
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:06.820]   I have never experienced that, ever.
[01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:08.420]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:10.500]   So now you can get up to 909.
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:14.940]   But if you go to the Google page, which I had to go to incognito because it would keep
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:20.780]   like taking me in my own account, you go to the Fi page and you shop for phones, it
[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:29.780]   says that if you order a Pixel 3, you get up to $999 in travel gift cards.
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:33.340]   I'm still not ordering a Pixel 3.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:35.500]   Well, that would pay me free.
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.780]   I'd say if you've been seeing the Pixel...
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:42.300]   I can't believe the amount of money Google's spending on NFL games for the Pixel 3.
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:44.820]   I'm not a real man, so I don't watch.
[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:46.820]   If you were a man, you'd know.
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:47.820]   Uh, Google...
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:48.820]   Jeff, that's okay.
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:49.820]   I'm not a real man, either.
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:50.820]   It was...
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:52.300]   Apparently, I'm the only real man around here.
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.500]   On Monday Night Football, there were...
[01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.340]   And they're doing a great job because they're show...
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:58.740]   First, they show the best shot thing.
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:02.620]   They show that the great video with people, face all squenched up.
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:03.620]   They show that.
[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:06.740]   And then they do a great night sight demo.
[01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:09.380]   They do a wide-angle selfie demo.
[01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:12.940]   They might must be spending millions on marketing this phone.
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:13.940]   It's very...
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:17.980]   And I'll tell you, if it sounds like they think that the number one feature people are looking
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:21.500]   for in a smartphone is a camera, because that's what they're pushing.
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.780]   And I have to say, they have the best camera on the market.
[01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:24.780]   So if that's what you wanted...
[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:25.780]   I was gonna say...
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:26.780]   Yeah.
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:31.740]   By the way, speaking of how much they spent, not only do they buy the NFL Monday Night Football,
[01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:36.420]   which I have to think is expensive, they had Queen and AC/DC as...
[01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:40.700]   The real music from the real artists as their background music.
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:42.140]   That's kind of cost a pretty penny.
[01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:43.940]   I don't know.
[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:47.220]   Wait, Queen, Freddie and Mercury, he's dead.
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:50.020]   But they still have to pay for it?
[01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:51.460]   Death does not let you off.
[01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:53.300]   Death does not let you off the hook.
[01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:56.780]   But you're saying they were singing live in the background or they just were...
[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:57.780]   No, no, no.
[01:30:57.780 --> 01:30:58.780]   They were like live.
[01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:01.700]   I was very confused, Leo.
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:02.700]   I'm like...
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:03.700]   Let me...
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:04.700]   Did they get his hologram?
[01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:05.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:08.140]   Now Freddie Mercury was...
[01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:09.700]   Here's the...
[01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:11.740]   Here is the Pixel ad.
[01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:14.620]   Let me play it for you for a night sight.
[01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:17.980]   This is the one you'd see.
[01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:26.300]   And they're using the Queen song for Flash Gordon to show how bad Flash photography looks.
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:27.300]   Everybody's blinded.
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:29.700]   They take pictures of food, it looks horrible.
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:30.700]   Everybody's annoyed in the restaurant.
[01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:33.060]   You're in a concert trying to take pictures.
[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:35.260]   All you get is your girlfriend.
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:38.100]   Lose the Flash, not the moment.
[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:43.340]   And then they show night sight and it looks so good.
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:47.380]   And a brilliant, by the way, use of Queen.
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:48.380]   Flash...
[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:50.380]   You want to see the selfie, Cam Hagg?
[01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:53.380]   I don't know who this ad is.
[01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:56.220]   Who this song is.
[01:31:56.220 --> 01:32:03.340]   It's Harrison.
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:04.340]   Is it?
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:05.340]   Person is Steve Perry.
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:06.340]   Yeah.
[01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:07.340]   Living on the edge.
[01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:08.340]   That's perfect.
[01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:09.340]   That's perfect.
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:10.700]   Let's see what is the other one.
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:11.700]   It's actually...
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:14.540]   These are really good ads.
[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:15.940]   Let's see.
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:16.940]   So Google's got...
[01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:20.940]   I don't know what their marketing budget is, but holy cow.
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:21.940]   Oh.
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:26.220]   Pixel Slate has not been authorized as required by the rules of the Federal Communications
[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:27.380]   Commission.
[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:30.300]   This device is not and may not be offered for Sailor Lees or Solar Lees.
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:32.300]   One, two, three.
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:36.740]   It's another one.
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:39.060]   Is it all the new things from Google?
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:42.980]   It's funny because you don't think a Google is a hardware company trying to make money
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:43.980]   on hardware.
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:48.620]   One, up, up and bring it down and we're going to switch.
[01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:50.940]   That's why I have a Google Home Hub.
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:52.540]   So I'm just looking at this.
[01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:53.900]   So you really do.
[01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:57.660]   So you get travel certificates.
[01:32:57.660 --> 01:32:59.180]   What kind of travel?
[01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:00.180]   Oh.
[01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:04.180]   The Delta Airlines Airbnb, hotels.com, Southwest Airlines.
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:07.780]   They only...
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:09.700]   Equally in the amount of the purchase.
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:11.300]   It ends tonight at midnight.
[01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:13.980]   It's a free phone.
[01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:16.420]   A free phone if you're going to use those services.
[01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:17.420]   If you...
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:18.420]   Yeah.
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:19.420]   As much as I travel.
[01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:20.420]   Yeah.
[01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:21.420]   So Jeff, go.
[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:22.420]   Go, stop.
[01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:23.420]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:24.420]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:25.420]   Jeff Mann.
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:26.420]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:27.420]   Okay.
[01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:28.420]   I'm so sorry, Jeff.
[01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:29.420]   I can't help.
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:30.420]   You're in a good mood, Stacey.
[01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:31.420]   I like it.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:32.420]   Wait till you hear my face.
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:34.420]   She's happy about armed servers.
[01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:35.420]   I'm so ecstatic.
[01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:39.660]   So all you need to do to make Stacey happy is armed servers.
[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:40.660]   I'm sorry.
[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:42.260]   Exciting chip news.
[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:43.460]   Does the trick...
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:44.460]   Let's...
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:46.540]   So here's my question, you guys.
[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:47.540]   Yes.
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:54.780]   I have big fears because all of the major hardware companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft,
[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:59.820]   they're developing their own chips for various different TPUs or the Bionic.
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:03.860]   Apple's going to replace, yeah, Apple's going to replace all Intel chips.
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:09.540]   So what does that mean as you shrink the huge buyers of these chips?
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:13.020]   What does that mean for everyone else who is dependent on them in...
[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:17.140]   It's a fundamental restructuring of the chip industry, which is already consolidating.
[01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:23.380]   But I sit there and I think about that a lot because a lot of innovation comes from startups,
[01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:27.580]   but historically a lot of innovation, especially in actual manufacturing, has come from the
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:28.580]   bigger companies.
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:34.900]   And I know TSMC does a lot there too, but it's the designs from the big companies that force
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:35.900]   them to do that.
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:38.100]   Anyway, this is something I'm thinking a lot about.
[01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:40.860]   So if anyone wants to talk about this, you just give me a call.
[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:42.860]   Steve Tyler, not Steve Perry.
[01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:44.820]   Steve Perry is the lead singer of China.
[01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:45.820]   James Addiction.
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:46.820]   James Addiction.
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:47.820]   Oh, no!
[01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:50.100]   Which they played at AWS.
[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:51.620]   They played Ben Cott Steelin.
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:53.580]   It's all tied together!
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:54.580]   Ta-da!
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:56.980]   With the armed servers.
[01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:58.140]   What are you moaning about?
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:34:59.140]   It's Perry Farrell.
[01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:00.140]   Perry Farrell.
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:01.140]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:03.180]   Steve and Perry, isn't he the guys who then?
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:04.180]   That's journey.
[01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:05.180]   Journey.
[01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:06.180]   Journey.
[01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:09.020]   And the sun shines on.
[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:10.020]   Well, somewhere.
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:15.060]   And then Joe Perry, who's the guitarist for O Smith, so it all got muddled.
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:18.860]   Of course I meant Steven Tyler, the guy with the lips.
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:22.820]   Man, Carson, you sounded almost insulted, so I feel bad now.
[01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:23.820]   He really...
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:24.820]   You were like, "Ugh!"
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:26.620]   He was really upset.
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.420]   Apparently a James Addiction fan.
[01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:29.420]   That's fair.
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:30.620]   I'm a James Addiction fan.
[01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:31.620]   Who is?
[01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:32.620]   I'm just bad at names.
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:33.620]   Yeah.
[01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:34.620]   Me too.
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:38.860]   Did you know that Google's chief business officer's name Phil Schintzler?
[01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:39.860]   That's confused.
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:45.780]   Yeah, Philip Schintzler, not Phil Schiller, wrote about Disney and Google expanding their
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:50.340]   strategic relationship as we continue with the change log.
[01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:51.820]   Disney and Google share a passion.
[01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:53.580]   Oh, my God, we're still in the change log.
[01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:55.420]   That's what I was just like.
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:57.860]   That's why I said that a little parenthetically.
[01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:00.500]   We're in the magic wonderland.
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:01.500]   We're never going to leave.
[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:07.740]   Google's going to power advertising for Disney's brands, Disney ABC, ESPN, Marvel, Pixar, and
[01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:08.740]   Star Wars.
[01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:14.100]   This is funny because of course the relationship between Disney, Pixar, and Apple is pretty
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:17.580]   tight, but I guess Apple doesn't have an ad platform.
[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:18.580]   So there.
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:23.300]   Google is acquiring a $1 billion Mountain View office at Park.
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:26.700]   It's 2018's largest Bay Area Real Estate deal.
[01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:27.700]   Congratulations.
[01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:36.340]   Just before Thanksgiving, they bought Britannia Shoreline 51 acres across from and larger than
[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:38.540]   the Googleplex.
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:42.300]   There are 12 structures there, but they're going to tear those down, I'm sure.
[01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:45.660]   And they do the largest real estate deal in New York when they did the Chelsea.
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:46.940]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:47.780]   When they bought that office block.
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:48.780]   That's right.
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:55.860]   Oh, I have to tell you, Kevin has sent me a correction saying that the FCC approved the
[01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:57.660]   whatever it was that you said wasn't approved.
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:36:58.660]   I know they did.
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:01.580]   But for some reason on the YouTube ad, yeah, because he's got one.
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:03.060]   So obviously it's approved now.
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:04.860]   But for some reason that YouTube ad I've like.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:07.940]   He also says, "Dave has worked in the browser for months."
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:09.220]   I don't know.
[01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:12.860]   I just want you to know this because he sends them to me and I'm like, "Oh, do I convey
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:13.860]   those?"
[01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:14.860]   We should give TOEFL a hot line.
[01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:20.020]   He's got my work in as phone calls, but I was not getting the video opportunity.
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:21.020]   Now I am.
[01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:24.820]   Oh, I don't know what Kevin has to say about that.
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:25.820]   If he's in a chat.
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:29.700]   Kevin, I'm sure knew what to do and I was stupid.
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:33.580]   So Google bought Chelsea Market for $2.4 billion.
[01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:35.740]   So that was a little more expensive, but that's Manhattan.
[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:40.180]   Oh God, to go down on the first floor there, it's worse than go through Times Square.
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:43.380]   Tourist, tourist, tourist.
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:49.180]   And do they have this nudas or to call me Elmo walking around?
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:50.180]   No, Elmo's.
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:51.180]   Just tourists.
[01:37:51.180 --> 01:37:56.500]   I've had to go to meetings in that building and it's just torture to get through it.
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:57.500]   Yeah.
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:58.500]   What are they touristing about?
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:37:59.500]   What's down there?
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:03.100]   The first floor of Chelsea Market is hip shops and restaurants and things.
[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:05.500]   Oh, no wonder I don't know about it.
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:06.500]   It's hip.
[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:14.300]   Google is updating its fast pairing feature on Android and Chromebooks.
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:18.920]   So you can simultaneously pair compatible Bluetooth devices with phones, tablets and
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:21.660]   laptops that share the same Google account.
[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:24.140]   This is kind of like what Apple does with AirPods.
[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:29.180]   When you link the headphones to one product, all the devices connected to the account will
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:31.060]   automatically pair.
[01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:32.060]   That's very convenient.
[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:35.940]   I'm just going to guess it won't work with my account.
[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:37.140]   Just going to guess.
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:38.140]   Probably.
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:39.140]   Jeff, you know what?
[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:42.820]   They should just send you like a special Jeff, not for you.
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:44.060]   Not for you, Jeff.
[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:45.060]   No convenience for you.
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:47.060]   No convenience for you, Jeff.
[01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:49.660]   You're on the need not to use list, Jeff.
[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:50.660]   And that's.
[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:51.660]   I want it to, Jeff.
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:52.660]   It's almost enough.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:53.660]   Change lock.
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:39:00.420]   I was going to say it's almost enough to get me to like find an alternative to G suites
[01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:03.940]   just so I can avoid the G suite penalty.
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:07.860]   You're not doing off of it, but I don't know how to.
[01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:09.780]   I have, we use G suites at work.
[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:14.300]   So I have Leo at Twit.tv, but I have my Google account, report a Gmail.
[01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:16.180]   What did I use for all of those things?
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:18.140]   Is it consumer account?
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:19.140]   Right.
[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:26.900]   But I use my business calendar, for example, and when I travel, if I make things in my business
[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:32.620]   email, then they don't flow over into places I needed to walk.
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:35.020]   That's why I use calendar sharing.
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:39.420]   I have calendar sharing, but I can't, you know, share my calendar on my Google stuff.
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:40.420]   Yeah.
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:41.420]   No.
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:45.660]   It's, it's a little easier if you log into your phone, under your personal account, but
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:50.820]   then what happens is you end up doing more things like I all send invites out from my
[01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:55.340]   personal thing when I mean to do it from my.
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:58.260]   And we saw how that cost Hillary Clinton the presidency.
[01:39:58.260 --> 01:39:59.780]   So I would warn you.
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:00.780]   Yes.
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:02.580]   Don't pull in the vodka.
[01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:07.820]   Speaking of Ivanka, she and cook visited a school.
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:11.140]   I put the link of the links up on the, yeah, there's a controversy here.
[01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:18.220]   So Ivanka and Apple were buddying up in Idaho down under other.
[01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:19.780]   That's interesting.
[01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:24.580]   Apple's donated iPads to students and max to teachers in schools in this district.
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:28.060]   And the students protested because they don't like the iPads.
[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:29.060]   Yeah.
[01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:30.060]   Huh.
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:33.060]   Did, uh, okay.
[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:39.660]   Well, you know, people are upset about this because Steve Cook and Ivanka Trump were
[01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:40.660]   buddying up to each other.
[01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:43.820]   And cook and Ivanka liked each other.
[01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:44.820]   Shame.
[01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:50.780]   We should make them walk naked through the town square ringing a bell.
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:51.780]   Shame.
[01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:58.580]   MIT, this is actually the big story of the, of the, maybe the week, the year, the decade.
[01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:08.260]   CRISPR, baby, Chinese scientists, according to a story in the MIT technology review, have
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:19.220]   used CRISPR to gene edit embryos to actually eliminate their, they, uh, they eliminated
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:28.940]   gene called CCR five, which would render these children resistant to HIV, smallpox and cholera.
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:34.100]   Now what's not clear, they, we know they're doing this according to Chinese medical documents
[01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:35.100]   posted online.
[01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:42.900]   What's not clear is if those embryos have been gestated to birth, twin girls were born.
[01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:46.180]   Oh, then, then, then, then, no, they have live.
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:48.100]   So they have made a lot of, oh, okay.
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:52.540]   So the associate or press then updated the story from the technology reviews, say one
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:58.580]   couple in the trial, according to the doctor, he, John Quay, who was doing this, one couple
[01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:01.100]   gave birth to twin girls this month.
[01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:04.140]   Um, AP was not able to confirm this independently.
[01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:06.860]   He released a promotional video.
[01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:08.540]   So so there you go.
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:12.020]   This is both shocking and amazing.
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:17.260]   CRISPR is a gene editing technique that's somewhat like cut and paste and, and, and illegal
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:23.340]   or well illegal in the US illegal in Europe and the US, but not in China.
[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:24.340]   Shame.
[01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:27.740]   No, China says, so that's actually.
[01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:32.740]   It's an app.
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:36.500]   I need the shame app.
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:37.740]   The bell of shame app.
[01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:42.140]   The team at the Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen China has been recruiting
[01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:46.220]   couples in an effort to create the first gene edited babies.
[01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:51.740]   I don't think it's illegal in China, apparently, but it is illegal in most of the world.
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:52.740]   Maybe not appropriately.
[01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:56.740]   Of course, the real concern is, I mean, I don't think anybody would complain about the elimination
[01:42:56.740 --> 01:43:01.500]   of the CCR five gene, but that's just, I mean, that's just one of the many things, one of
[01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:04.460]   the wonderful things you could make children that glow in the dark, if you wish.
[01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:10.020]   And one of the many things you could do with the CRISPR technology, there's also the issue
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:18.080]   and I have seen reports that sometimes CRISPR causes errors elsewhere in the gene.
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:20.180]   So there may be some side effects.
[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:21.180]   I don't know.
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:23.780]   I'm not an expert on CRISPR.
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:30.580]   But this is, you know, there's the risk of introducing unwanted mutations or, according
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:36.260]   to the technology review, yielding a baby whose body is composed of some edited and some
[01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:38.260]   unedited cells.
[01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:43.540]   I don't know if that's better good.
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:44.940]   What do you think?
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:46.420]   It certainly changes things.
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:51.940]   I mean, I think honestly, that's what I meant when I said this could be the story of the
[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:53.420]   year really.
[01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:54.420]   Yeah.
[01:43:54.420 --> 01:43:56.020]   We've known that this was coming at some point.
[01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:58.940]   This somebody rogue or otherwise was going to do this.
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:02.380]   Apparently, it has been done now in China.
[01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:06.820]   Genetic and editing of embryos to produce children that in this case, a resistant HIV
[01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:07.820]   cholera and malaria.
[01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:12.740]   So in China, the MIT technology story says currently using a genetically engineered embryo
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:16.340]   to establish a pregnancy would be illegal and much of Europe prohibited in the US and
[01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:21.100]   is also prohibited in China under a 2003 ministerial guidance to IVF clinics.
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:22.100]   But that's the problem.
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:24.060]   It is a guidance, not a law.
[01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:29.700]   It is not clear if he got a special permission or disregard of the guidance, which may not
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.300]   have the force of law.
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:32.300]   Yeah.
[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:35.620]   I got to think though, in China, you don't do anything like this without government.
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:36.620]   Yeah.
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:39.700]   And you don't announce it if you don't feel pretty secure in the fact that you're not
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:41.860]   going to jail tomorrow.
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:44.260]   But I would say that's moral panic, Jeff.
[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:45.260]   Yes.
[01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:46.260]   Cute, Jeff.
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:47.260]   Cute, Bennett.
[01:44:47.260 --> 01:44:50.260]   It's probably prudent to pay.
[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:53.900]   Probably prudent to pass those laws until you can be sure that this stuff could be done
[01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:54.900]   saying this.
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:55.900]   I think it is.
[01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:56.900]   Yeah.
[01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:58.540]   But honestly, think of all the benefit.
[01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:02.380]   This is going to talk about Pandora's box.
[01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:03.380]   This is going to...
[01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:04.380]   Yes.
[01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:08.980]   This is now because there's all sorts of beneficial things you can think of, but there's huge
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:16.460]   consequences in the case of haves and have-nots where people can choose to have smarter, more
[01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:21.780]   athletic, more attractive babies because they can afford to have the editing or perhaps,
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:25.020]   you know, I mean, there's always been genetic editing in a very primitive way.
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:31.500]   It's called on because CRISPR can be and they're not researching it, but there is the theory
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:36.420]   and I think they've done it in animals that actually you can change genes in people who
[01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:37.420]   are living.
[01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:38.420]   After the fact, yeah.
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:39.420]   After the fact.
[01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:40.420]   I don't know what...
[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:41.420]   After the birth.
[01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:42.420]   After the birth.
[01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:43.420]   After the birth.
[01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:44.420]   Yeah.
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:45.420]   Postnatal.
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:46.420]   Postnatal.
[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:47.420]   P.N.
[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:48.420]   That's kind of me.
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:49.420]   I'm just postnatal.
[01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:50.420]   We're all postnatal now.
[01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:51.580]   We're all postnatal.
[01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:53.060]   We're all postnatal.
[01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:54.060]   You wouldn't have...
[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:55.060]   I mean, depending on...
[01:45:55.060 --> 01:45:57.580]   I mean, there's going to be limits possibly.
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:02.580]   I mean, who knows, but it's possible we could get similar updates or more importantly,
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:04.780]   our kids, like I had someone with a 12-year-old.
[01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:07.700]   I'm like, "Oh my gosh, is my child now obsolete?"
[01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:08.700]   Ugh.
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:11.060]   I think this is a huge...
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:14.980]   I just think this is huge.
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:15.980]   We knew it was coming.
[01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:16.980]   It was inevitable.
[01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:21.260]   Um, CRISPR has made some real progress.
[01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:23.420]   I don't know what to say except that you...
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:29.060]   This could be a watershed moment in humanity where we're actually able to edit genes and
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:33.660]   reprogram the blueprints of life itself.
[01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:34.660]   Yes.
[01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:37.740]   What would you do if you...
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:39.100]   I mean, like...
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:40.660]   I've been thinking about this.
[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:42.740]   I'm like, what kind of things...
[01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:47.460]   I mean, first, you have to decide if it's something that is expressed easily in a gene
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:50.380]   and is not part of multiple genes.
[01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:57.520]   Well, I mean, look, we know already that people have used more brutal methods to get
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:00.340]   rid of girls and keep boys.
[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:01.940]   That's clearly...
[01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:07.580]   That kind of genetic editing would be clearly immoral and wrong and it'd be easy to pass
[01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:11.860]   a law against that, harder to enforce.
[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:14.180]   And I don't think CRISPR actually can do something that dramatic.
[01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:19.220]   I think it's much more you can snip out or replace little portions of the gene.
[01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:23.420]   You're not going to take a whole Y chromosome out or something.
[01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:26.460]   Well, no, you just abort that girl baby.
[01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:27.460]   Right.
[01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:28.460]   I mean, you're not going to...
[01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:29.460]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:31.420]   It's been done for years in more primitive fashion.
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:37.500]   But there are traits like intelligence, those actually, we don't know where those are.
[01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:38.500]   So we can't...
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:40.060]   Some of this stuff, we can't do.
[01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:41.060]   Yeah, you could actually...
[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:44.500]   You're a glow in the dark baby, bioluminescent babies.
[01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:45.500]   We've actually...
[01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:46.500]   We understand that gene...
[01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:48.340]   Yeah, CRISPR has been used to do that.
[01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:49.340]   Yeah, so...
[01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:53.340]   Actually, actually, that's why I turn pink on the show all the time.
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:54.700]   What about though?
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:58.700]   I mean, mostly you could see this in genetics for...
[01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:02.780]   You could take out the BRACA gene variant, for instance, that...
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:03.780]   But there's other...
[01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:06.620]   One gene can have multiple effects is the issue.
[01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:07.620]   Right.
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:08.620]   That's right.
[01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:09.620]   We don't really understand.
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:11.820]   We don't really understand this very well.
[01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:16.180]   Or sickle cell anemia could be eliminated in certain populations.
[01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:18.740]   But yeah, and we don't...
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:19.740]   You're right.
[01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:22.660]   Intelligence is a much more difficult issue.
[01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:23.660]   Or athleticism.
[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:27.700]   Isn't it true that if you change a gene in me and then I father a child, it's not guaranteed
[01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:28.700]   to change...
[01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:30.940]   The genes are changed in the next generations.
[01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:33.780]   So you're having an impact past the one person.
[01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:34.780]   Yeah.
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:36.700]   Oh my God, it's like climate change.
[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:39.460]   Only it's on our species.
[01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:40.460]   Okay.
[01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:41.460]   It's...
[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:45.100]   I'm telling you that you're going to look back and say, "Well, that was...
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:46.740]   Everything changed suddenly."
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:47.740]   Or maybe not.
[01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:48.740]   I don't know.
[01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:49.740]   Maybe this is...
[01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:50.740]   Maybe A, the guy could be lying.
[01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:51.740]   Leo, you can't walk about it.
[01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:52.740]   Yeah, not true.
[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:53.740]   You just got to be...
[01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:54.740]   It's a big...
[01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:55.740]   I agree with you, man.
[01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:56.740]   It's a big moment.
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:48:57.740]   I think so.
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:01.620]   Logitech is not blind plantronics after all.
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:04.340]   We didn't think they were, but that's like...
[01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:05.340]   Never mind.
[01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:06.340]   Never mind.
[01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:07.340]   There was a rumor there were.
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:08.340]   It was going to be a big purchase.
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:15.300]   Oh, Ohio is the first state to accept Bitcoin for tax payments.
[01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:18.740]   Too bad Bitcoin just lost 40% of its value in the last two weeks.
[01:49:18.740 --> 01:49:25.060]   Yeah, redeem that kind of quickly.
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:29.140]   Corel is buying parallels, which is a virtualization company.
[01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:30.140]   Even more sorry.
[01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:31.140]   Yeah.
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:32.140]   Wow.
[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:33.140]   Yeah.
[01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:34.140]   I used to run that on a...
[01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:35.740]   Yeah, I like parallels.
[01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:38.300]   It's a way to run Windows on a Mac or that kind of thing.
[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:41.180]   It used to be SWsoft or was it...
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:42.180]   I don't know.
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:43.180]   Anyway, yeah.
[01:49:43.180 --> 01:49:44.180]   Okay.
[01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:45.180]   Australia...
[01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:46.700]   I didn't know Corel was still around.
[01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:47.700]   Corel, yeah.
[01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:50.700]   They used to be word perfect, but then they really branched out.
[01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:52.660]   And I think we were talking about this on Windows Weekly.
[01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:56.540]   They really are more a portfolio company than anything else these days.
[01:49:56.540 --> 01:49:59.900]   Oh, look, this whole time, I didn't even know it.
[01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:02.460]   I've had a Facebook portal looking at my crotch.
[01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:03.460]   I don't know what...
[01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:08.140]   What were you doing down there, a little portal?
[01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:10.820]   You thought I might want to use that on the show today.
[01:50:10.820 --> 01:50:13.940]   I just noticed it.
[01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:19.260]   Australia to build a pirate-proof fence.
[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:22.860]   This is a little scary from the register today.
[01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:27.700]   Australia is certain to have a new site blocking regime imposed by the government with a Senate
[01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:30.260]   committee deciding to waive the legislation through.
[01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:33.420]   The draft law has passed the Senate today.
[01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:36.140]   It will go to the House of Representatives.
[01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:44.060]   The Copyright Amendment online infringement bill 2018, if it does pass and the register
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:48.940]   thinks it seems likely to pass, it would give rights holders greatly expanded powers
[01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:51.380]   to force takedowns of infringing content.
[01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:54.940]   Is this kind of like Article 13 in the EU copyright?
[01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:56.900]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:50:56.900 --> 01:51:01.420]   Article 13 has preemptive requirements of the platform.
[01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:02.900]   This is postnatal.
[01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:03.900]   Okay.
[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:05.060]   So it's post facto.
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:10.700]   Rights holders postnatal will be able to seek injunctions against search engines, requesting
[01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:14.660]   blocks on file sharing sites and block what the legislation calls alternative pathways
[01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:16.620]   to pirated content.
[01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:22.340]   The test for a site's illegality will be widened from sites whose primary purpose is infringement,
[01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:29.260]   kind of like a bit torrent linking site, to cover sites whose primary effect is infringement.
[01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:36.940]   All right, so the committee recommends bills operation be reviewed two years after it
[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:40.220]   kicks into action.
[01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:46.740]   The only party dissenting the green party.
[01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:51.940]   Senator Janice Wright opposed site blocking, saying copyright is better addressed by making
[01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:55.740]   the content available conveniently, affordably in a timely way.
[01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:58.780]   What a revolutionary idea.
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:00.220]   You got a piracy problem?
[01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:03.740]   Make it easier to buy the thought.
[01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:06.540]   Copyright is a Gutenberg era notion.
[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:08.900]   IP is a Gutenberg era notion, right?
[01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:13.460]   Yes, this whole notion of property intellectual law has property, right?
[01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:16.300]   Let's take a break because your picks of the week are coming up next.
[01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:21.940]   Oh, chat rooms already been talking about curiosity stream.
[01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:22.940]   Curiosity stream.
[01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:25.660]   They've got a very good offer on their website right now.
[01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:32.900]   Curiosity stream is the world's first streaming service addressing our lifelong quest to learn
[01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:33.900]   and explore and understand.
[01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:39.900]   If you listen to this show, I think you are a natural curiosity stream user.
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:41.460]   Great documentaries.
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:45.420]   John Hendricks found that he was the founder of the Discovery channel.
[01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:46.900]   They've got apps on every platform.
[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:53.060]   Of course, Web App Roku, Android, Xbox One, Smart TVs, iOS, Chromecast.
[01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:56.660]   You'll find on your fire, your Kindle, your Apple TV.
[01:52:56.660 --> 01:53:02.740]   It's available worldwide without restriction, contents, spans, science, nature, history,
[01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:04.740]   technology, society and lifestyle.
[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:12.300]   If you visit curiositystream.com/twit, you will see many of the 2000 plus nonfiction programs
[01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:14.420]   in all of those areas.
[01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:19.060]   Stephen Hawking's favorite place is the hunt for dark matter, birth of the Internet, cyber
[01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:21.060]   war.
[01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:27.500]   Unlimited access starts at just $2.99 a month.
[01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:32.980]   You can have a premium plan which includes 4K and ultra HD streaming, which is really
[01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:33.980]   nice.
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:35.740]   I just love learning.
[01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:40.540]   When I watch TV, I really often say, you know, Lisa and I will both say this, you know,
[01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:41.540]   let's watch something good.
[01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:44.500]   Let's watch a documentary tonight.
[01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:48.500]   Curiosity stream always has something good and healthful to learn.
[01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:52.100]   If you've got kids around the house, it's great too.
[01:53:52.100 --> 01:54:02.220]   CuriosityStream.com/twit, unlimited access to the world's top documentaries and nonfiction
[01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:03.220]   series.
[01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:06.540]   Oh, by the way, little something for our listeners.
[01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:10.940]   If you use the promo code TWIT when prompted during the sign up process, your membership
[01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:14.500]   is completely free for the first month.
[01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:20.220]   The CuriosityStream.com/twit and use the code TWIT to get one month free.
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:23.700]   CuriosityStream.com/twit.
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:25.500]   We really love that.
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:29.980]   It's nice to have that on your TV waiting for you.
[01:54:29.980 --> 01:54:35.300]   Stacey, was it you who told me about the iDevices device?
[01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:36.300]   I did.
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:40.620]   I bought seven or eight of them.
[01:54:40.620 --> 01:54:42.620]   Are those working for you?
[01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:46.900]   Yeah, except are they fully waterproof?
[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:52.540]   They're either IP65 or IP64 rated.
[01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:53.540]   Okay.
[01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:56.740]   I've been having some shorting problems.
[01:54:56.740 --> 01:54:58.980]   Oh, hold up.
[01:54:58.980 --> 01:55:05.060]   Somebody told me that even though they're called outdoor, they actually aren't waterproof.
[01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:08.140]   So I just move them in under the roof.
[01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:13.580]   It says perfect for any outdoor environment, rugged rain type design.
[01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:16.380]   Yeah, let me look at their IPV rating.
[01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:17.980]   I don't see an IP rating.
[01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:18.980]   That's IPV rating.
[01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:21.180]   That's what kind of concerned me a little bit.
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:26.140]   Anyway, they are controlling my holiday, my Christmas lights.
[01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:30.460]   And except for that minor thing where they set off the GFI circuit.
[01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:34.620]   Oh, sometimes that, well, sometimes that happens with normal Christmas lights too.
[01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:35.620]   Oh, could be.
[01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:37.340]   They draw a lot of power.
[01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:38.340]   I was surprised.
[01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:42.900]   Actually, the nice thing about the iDevices, besides the fact that I can turn these on from
[01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:47.900]   here, if it gets to be a gloomy day, is it tells you power consumption.
[01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:49.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:54.540]   Which is fascinating because I had no idea our Christmas lights are costing us $6 a night.
[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:56.900]   Do you not have LEDs?
[01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:58.060]   Yeah, they're LEDs.
[01:55:58.060 --> 01:55:59.700]   There's just a lot of them.
[01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:00.700]   Wow.
[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:02.860]   Do we have a picture of the display?
[01:56:02.860 --> 01:56:06.620]   Yeah, I think on my blog.
[01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:10.780]   Let me just see because I think this is so cool.
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:11.780]   Seven hours.
[01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:12.780]   Oh, no, it's gone down.
[01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:13.780]   Okay.
[01:56:13.780 --> 01:56:14.780]   This was when we were installing it.
[01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:16.620]   Seven hours daily use 16 cents.
[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:17.620]   That's not too bad.
[01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:19.300]   That's for set one.
[01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:20.300]   Here's set two.
[01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:22.660]   Oh, no, these are the expensive ones.
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:25.940]   Seven hours daily use $6.76.
[01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:28.260]   So this is this is which ones are these?
[01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:29.260]   These are.
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:32.220]   Yeah, this is the front yard.
[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:36.580]   I think they're all LEDs, but there's some there's some blinking ones and there's
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:37.580]   some ice crystals.
[01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:39.060]   They're a little bit more expensive.
[01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:40.060]   See, I can just turn them on.
[01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:41.060]   I hear like that.
[01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:42.060]   Boom.
[01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:43.060]   My Christmas lights are on.
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:44.060]   Turn them off.
[01:56:44.060 --> 01:56:45.060]   Very tasteful.
[01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:46.060]   Leo, that's not what I was expecting.
[01:56:46.060 --> 01:56:48.260]   Oh, you're looking at the blog?
[01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:49.260]   Yes.
[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:50.260]   Yes.
[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:52.900]   I thought you were expecting Gary.
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:58.700]   I thought you'd go for a hoot and overdo it and have dancing Santa's and things.
[01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:00.540]   No, it's pretty.
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:02.340]   I think I like it.
[01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:03.340]   It is pretty.
[01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:05.380]   That lights these balls up in the portico.
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:09.260]   You don't see what you don't see is the blinking icicles and the stars as if there's
[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:10.420]   there behind there.
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:14.180]   These balls keep falling down though.
[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:15.180]   I got dropped.
[01:57:15.180 --> 01:57:16.980]   My balls drop and it's terrible.
[01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:19.900]   It's terrible to do that.
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:20.900]   Punch Leo.
[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:23.340]   Punch Leo.
[01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:28.740]   But it is pretty and it's festive and yeah, I think I like it.
[01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:30.700]   I'm still not finding their I.B.
[01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:31.700]   Ready.
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:32.700]   Yeah, I don't think they have one.
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:35.060]   But anyway, they're they're now under the eve.
[01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:37.780]   I think that's a better place for them.
[01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:40.580]   And they haven't they haven't popped the circuit in a while.
[01:57:40.580 --> 01:57:43.260]   But you've got to ask a completely off question.
[01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:45.980]   So now that I'm your blog, you have that lovely picture of you.
[01:57:45.980 --> 01:57:47.420]   They say getting married.
[01:57:47.420 --> 01:57:48.420]   Yes.
[01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:50.100]   There's a picture of you.
[01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:51.540]   Here's the picture of you.
[01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:53.020]   So the front page rotates.
[01:57:53.020 --> 01:57:55.380]   There's a picture of you me and Gina at Google.
[01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:56.380]   Oh, wow.
[01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:58.260]   So the front page is different images all the time.
[01:57:58.260 --> 01:58:00.540]   So the wedding picture you have next no hair.
[01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:02.100]   Was that because of New Year's Eve?
[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:03.100]   Yep.
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:04.100]   Oh, wow.
[01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:05.100]   Ever.
[01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:06.100]   Yes.
[01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:08.740]   We got married a month later.
[01:58:08.740 --> 01:58:10.900]   I hadn't put two or two together there.
[01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:11.900]   That's so funny.
[01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:14.060]   I shave my head for UNICEF.
[01:58:14.060 --> 01:58:16.700]   We raised $80,000 something like that.
[01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:19.420]   I also got a little tiny tattoo on my butt.
[01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:23.780]   The hair is grown back, but every time Lisa sees my butt, she says, nice tattoo.
[01:58:23.780 --> 01:58:25.260]   And I go, oh crap.
[01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:26.260]   I've forgotten.
[01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:31.820]   I think of the things I just I just I just I should you shaved to Jeff.
[01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:33.100]   We shaved you for the.
[01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:35.100]   Well, belly will leave us.
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:36.100]   Yeah.
[01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:37.860]   And it was fun.
[01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:38.860]   We raised a lot of money.
[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:41.660]   I wish those New Year's Eve things, but I do too.
[01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:43.500]   Yeah, they were a lot of fun.
[01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:44.500]   Yeah.
[01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:48.660]   Leo, I found an answer for you on your it is not IP.
[01:58:48.660 --> 01:58:52.420]   It's rated ring type by UL according to iDevices.
[01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:53.420]   What's that means?
[01:58:53.420 --> 01:58:55.740]   So it I guess it means it's a rain type.
[01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:56.740]   Rain type is different.
[01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:58.940]   I wouldn't want to submerge it water.
[01:58:58.940 --> 01:58:59.940]   Right.
[01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:00.940]   Okay.
[01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:02.820]   We were getting some pretty severe storms out here.
[01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:03.820]   And goodness.
[01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:07.860]   Now, after the fires, it's more than welcome.
[01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:10.140]   But it did short there on a GFI circuit.
[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:15.340]   So I waited till things dried out, pushed the reset and it's working fine.
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:16.820]   Stacy, I did mean interrupt.
[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:18.860]   That was your pick from some time ago.
[01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:20.220]   What do you have this week?
[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:21.220]   Oh, okay.
[01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:23.260]   So this week, I'm trying out a new device.
[01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:26.540]   I'll tell you about that next week once I know how well it works or it doesn't work.
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:29.740]   But I went out because Starbucks has a brand new coffee.
[01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:34.660]   I've been tweeting about this because I've been so infatuated by it.
[01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:35.660]   What's the cost?
[01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:39.540]   Starbucks introduced the Juniper latte.
[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:45.300]   And as a gin lover and a coffee lover, I was like, can I bring my two loves together?
[01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:47.740]   The answer is I cannot.
[01:59:47.740 --> 01:59:56.180]   So Juniper is the is the holly berry that gives that unique flavor to many gins, which
[01:59:56.180 --> 01:59:58.500]   is one of the traditional gins.
[01:59:58.500 --> 01:59:59.500]   It does.
[01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:00.500]   It tastes Christmassy.
[02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:02.700]   It tastes like forests and delicious.
[02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:06.100]   A light, fine flavor with delightful citrus under to hangovers.
[02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:07.900]   Tastes like hangovers.
[02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:09.500]   Well, that's.
[02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:12.980]   So they also put pine citrus sugar on it.
[02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:15.100]   They do.
[02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:19.500]   So my challenge when I got one this afternoon, because I asked people for their takes and
[02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:21.060]   most people had negative takes.
[02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:25.500]   One person said it was fruity and kind of had a floral undertone.
[02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:28.220]   He liked it, but nobody else has.
[02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:30.420]   So I tried it.
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:31.980]   I did not like it.
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:36.740]   I think if I were going to try it again, I would probably try it with the blonde.
[02:00:36.740 --> 02:00:42.540]   The blonde roast because the bitterness of the coffee really fought with the kind of
[02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:43.540]   floral leave.
[02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:48.340]   Or just get yourself a goddamn gin and drink it.
[02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:49.340]   That's your other option.
[02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:53.100]   So I just want to let everybody know since this was this has been my Twitter quest for
[02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:54.100]   the last two days.
[02:00:54.100 --> 02:00:55.900]   I thought I'm going to talk about it.
[02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:57.900]   The chugo pre-lotty.
[02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:01.100]   Yeah, because it's their new holiday drink.
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:02.100]   It tastes like.
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:03.100]   It just was announced.
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:07.020]   According to Fox News, it tastes like grass and dirt.
[02:01:07.020 --> 02:01:08.380]   But I didn't get dirt.
[02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:09.380]   Yeah.
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:10.380]   But I'll give it grass.
[02:01:10.380 --> 02:01:14.100]   Fox would probably like it better if it said Merry Christmas on the cup.
[02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:15.820]   I got I would not get a red cup.
[02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:16.820]   I got a green cup.
[02:01:16.820 --> 02:01:18.660]   I guess they have different holiday.
[02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:19.660]   This Stacy.
[02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:21.020]   There you go.
[02:01:21.020 --> 02:01:22.700]   How about coffee gin?
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:23.700]   I would try that.
[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:26.700]   Gin, put coffee gin.
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:27.700]   It was crazy German.
[02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:29.380]   What's your favorite gin?
[02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:30.940]   I have four.
[02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:31.940]   Okay.
[02:01:31.940 --> 02:01:32.940]   Out with it.
[02:01:32.940 --> 02:01:34.620]   Super junipery.
[02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:35.860]   So you feel like forest.
[02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:37.580]   It is St. George terroir.
[02:01:37.580 --> 02:01:38.860]   It's made in California.
[02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:42.580]   If you want a smooth drinking gin with a hint of cardamom.
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:44.220]   209.
[02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:51.260]   If you are in the middle of Spain and it's hot and you want the kind of original gin,
[02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:53.780]   get a gin, Maré and have it with rosemary.
[02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:56.020]   It's delicious.
[02:01:56.020 --> 02:01:57.020]   And what's my other?
[02:01:57.020 --> 02:01:58.820]   Oh, it's made in Utah.
[02:01:58.820 --> 02:01:59.940]   It's called Jackrabbit Gin.
[02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:05.820]   It's from a small distillery called Beehive and it is excellent in cocktails and in martinis.
[02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:07.660]   It's a little sweeter.
[02:02:07.660 --> 02:02:08.660]   Wow.
[02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:10.740]   Yes, I love my gin.
[02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:12.500]   Which 209 do you like?
[02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:14.220]   There's a number of them.
[02:02:14.220 --> 02:02:15.780]   You but I like the normal 209.
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:17.740]   I don't know if they have a kosher.
[02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:18.740]   209.
[02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:20.740]   Kosher for pests.
[02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:21.740]   Yeah.
[02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:24.980]   I believe it is the only kosher gin out there.
[02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:25.980]   Nice.
[02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:31.540]   And they have Chardonnay Barrel, Sauvignon Blanc Barrel or Cabernet Sauvignon Barrel Gin
[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:32.700]   as well.
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:33.860]   I'm going to try this.
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:36.380]   I am a G&T drinker.
[02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:40.420]   So 209 makes a really good gin and tonic.
[02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:45.540]   I would recommend using Q tonic or the fever tree lighter tonic.
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:46.540]   You don't want to.
[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:47.540]   Yeah.
[02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:51.740]   Well, Q is a little better for that because it's less sweet and it'll let the flavor shine
[02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:52.740]   through, I think.
[02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:54.420]   But that's just me.
[02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:56.260]   I just go for the G.
[02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:57.260]   Just straight G.
[02:02:57.260 --> 02:02:58.260]   Straight G.
[02:02:58.260 --> 02:02:59.260]   That's no vermouth.
[02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:05.540]   If I can't use guys to come out for Twitter on Sunday the 23rd, we have to bribe people
[02:03:05.540 --> 02:03:07.540]   because it's two days before Christmas.
[02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:11.780]   We're going to open a bottle of $5,000 cognac.
[02:03:11.780 --> 02:03:12.780]   Oh my.
[02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:15.780]   Still not doing it.
[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:17.780]   Yeah.
[02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:19.020]   Louis the 13th cognac.
[02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:20.020]   $20 gin.
[02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:21.220]   You might have us.
[02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:22.220]   Yeah.
[02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:23.220]   Yeah.
[02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:26.700]   In that beautiful crystal bottle.
[02:03:26.700 --> 02:03:27.700]   Why are you doing this?
[02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:28.700]   What?
[02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:29.700]   Just a bribe?
[02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:32.740]   A bribe to get people to come to the...
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:36.940]   Because it's two days before Christmas Eve.
[02:03:36.940 --> 02:03:44.540]   And because it's more fun to do those holiday tweets, a little warmed up.
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:46.300]   I have yet to find a bottle of it.
[02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:48.380]   I've got a promised Alex Lindsey.
[02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:50.020]   No, I will.
[02:03:50.020 --> 02:03:51.020]   And it may not be $5,000.
[02:03:51.020 --> 02:03:53.500]   It may be less than that.
[02:03:53.500 --> 02:03:55.260]   What if it's more?
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:56.260]   Yeah.
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:57.260]   Okay.
[02:03:57.260 --> 02:03:58.260]   Somebody...
[02:03:58.260 --> 02:03:59.260]   I don't know.
[02:03:59.260 --> 02:04:00.260]   It depends how much you get.
[02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:02.380]   I'm not going to get Jera Bohm of it.
[02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:04.980]   That would be crazy talk.
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:06.180]   They do make it Jera Bohm.
[02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:07.180]   Holy cow.
[02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:10.220]   I know nothing about cognac.
[02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:11.220]   So...
[02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:14.500]   Well, how would you like to learn?
[02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:19.660]   I don't think I should learn on a $5,000 bottle.
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:22.460]   You'll never enjoy it again by anybody else.
[02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:26.380]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, you're in my hotel in Stockholm.
[02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:29.700]   They give us little tiny airline bottles of brandy every night.
[02:04:29.700 --> 02:04:30.700]   Oh, that's cool.
[02:04:30.700 --> 02:04:31.700]   The rooms.
[02:04:31.700 --> 02:04:32.700]   You got a nice...
[02:04:32.700 --> 02:04:33.700]   It's actually...
[02:04:33.700 --> 02:04:35.140]   You don't really sleep better.
[02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:36.140]   No.
[02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:37.620]   No, I didn't have them.
[02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:38.620]   But I thought...
[02:04:38.620 --> 02:04:39.620]   I'm not going to throw this out.
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:44.260]   So I put them in my soap and deodorant.
[02:04:44.260 --> 02:04:45.260]   So I have them.
[02:04:45.260 --> 02:04:47.420]   I'll put them in the liquor cabinet.
[02:04:47.420 --> 02:04:48.420]   But...
[02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:49.420]   Anyway.
[02:04:49.420 --> 02:04:53.780]   Oh, if you want, guys, I can put the gin advent calendar in the show notes.
[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:55.620]   Oh, there's a gin advent calendar.
[02:04:55.620 --> 02:04:57.380]   Which is a different gin every night?
[02:04:57.380 --> 02:04:58.380]   Yeah, here.
[02:04:58.380 --> 02:04:59.380]   Instead of my...
[02:04:59.380 --> 02:05:01.780]   Since we've gone off the rails...
[02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:03.260]   Oh, my God.
[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:05.180]   Next week I do have a connected device for you.
[02:05:05.180 --> 02:05:06.980]   So it's not totally crazy.
[02:05:06.980 --> 02:05:11.460]   I'm going to match that.
[02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:12.460]   Hold on one second.
[02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:13.460]   I'm going to find this.
[02:05:13.460 --> 02:05:14.460]   Give me a second.
[02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:15.700]   Give me a second here.
[02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:16.700]   Bam.
[02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:17.700]   Talk for a second.
[02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:18.700]   I'm going to find...
[02:05:18.700 --> 02:05:20.660]   I just put my advent calendar in there.
[02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:23.420]   Okay, here we go.
[02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:25.420]   I have for you...
[02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:26.420]   Yeah.
[02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:31.460]   We should do advent calendars today because Saturday is December 1st.
[02:05:31.460 --> 02:05:32.460]   Yes.
[02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:33.460]   All right.
[02:05:33.460 --> 02:05:35.460]   That's why I was like, "Oh, I should do this."
[02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:36.460]   Yeah.
[02:05:36.460 --> 02:05:43.340]   So this is the size of a quilt because it has to have a bottle of gin in 25 different
[02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:44.340]   openings.
[02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:48.060]   There's 25 little bottles of gin on the wall.
[02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:49.580]   I'd take that.
[02:05:49.580 --> 02:05:50.580]   I am really sad.
[02:05:50.580 --> 02:05:54.420]   Like this is one of those things where I'm like, "Oh, I wish my husband would like see
[02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:55.700]   this and get it for me."
[02:05:55.700 --> 02:05:57.500]   But not yet.
[02:05:57.500 --> 02:05:58.500]   One day.
[02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:03.700]   So I have for you, I'll match your gin advent calendar.
[02:06:03.700 --> 02:06:04.700]   Yes.
[02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:12.540]   And I'll raise it with a beef advent calendar from the German magazine Beef.
[02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:14.620]   It's in the rundown.
[02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:16.820]   And it's on the comments.
[02:06:16.820 --> 02:06:17.820]   Beef.
[02:06:17.820 --> 02:06:20.980]   So like you get...
[02:06:20.980 --> 02:06:22.460]   Saitenik Gefunden.
[02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:24.460]   For a form.
[02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:25.460]   Fumf.
[02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:26.460]   Fumf zero.
[02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:27.460]   Fumf.
[02:06:27.460 --> 02:06:28.460]   Fumf.
[02:06:28.460 --> 02:06:29.460]   Hold on.
[02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:30.460]   I'll put it now.
[02:06:30.460 --> 02:06:31.460]   Is that how you say it?
[02:06:31.460 --> 02:06:32.460]   Fumf zero.
[02:06:32.460 --> 02:06:33.460]   Fumf.
[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:34.460]   Nurefumf.
[02:06:34.460 --> 02:06:35.460]   Fumf.
[02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:36.460]   Nurefumf.
[02:06:36.460 --> 02:06:37.460]   Dofir.
[02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:38.460]   That's Firf.
[02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:39.460]   Fumf is five.
[02:06:39.460 --> 02:06:40.460]   I'll put it under...
[02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:41.460]   Firf.
[02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:42.460]   Firf.
[02:06:42.460 --> 02:06:43.460]   Stacey's things.
[02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:45.260]   Under the gin advent calendar.
[02:06:45.260 --> 02:06:46.260]   Try that.
[02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:47.740]   See if that works.
[02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:48.740]   There.
[02:06:48.740 --> 02:06:50.740]   Ah, beef adventure.
[02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:51.740]   Beef.
[02:06:51.740 --> 02:06:52.740]   Edvins.
[02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:53.740]   Kiss them.
[02:06:53.740 --> 02:06:54.740]   Ooh, yum.
[02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:55.740]   69 euros.
[02:06:55.740 --> 02:06:56.740]   Get me.
[02:06:56.740 --> 02:06:57.740]   Tell me.
[02:06:57.740 --> 02:06:58.740]   Beef.
[02:06:58.740 --> 02:06:59.740]   We talked about Beef magazine before in the show.
[02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:00.740]   I think you've mentioned it.
[02:07:00.740 --> 02:07:01.740]   Is it only in German?
[02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:02.740]   Yes.
[02:07:02.740 --> 02:07:03.740]   It's only in German.
[02:07:03.740 --> 02:07:04.740]   It is beautiful.
[02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:05.740]   I had it on the screen in my class.
[02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:06.740]   I was laughing with it.
[02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:14.740]   If you just search for beef.
[02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:15.740]   I think I want it.
[02:07:15.740 --> 02:07:17.740]   It's gin-vent calendar is what I want.
[02:07:17.740 --> 02:07:22.060]   I'm having a hard time finding a way to buy it in the US.
[02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:23.060]   I'm having a hard time.
[02:07:23.060 --> 02:07:24.060]   I'm very sad.
[02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:27.900]   It says we can't actually ship to the United States at this moment.
[02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:28.900]   Ah.
[02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:29.900]   The gin-vent.
[02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:33.660]   So we need to fright you what you need is someone in the UK to buy it.
[02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:35.380]   And then to send it to you.
[02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:41.500]   Ideally, each dram you uncover from behind the 24 windows would be a total surprise.
[02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:44.220]   That is a scotch calendar right there.
[02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:45.220]   That's right.
[02:07:45.220 --> 02:07:47.900]   No wonder I was talking like that.
[02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:50.020]   I'm like, I don't know about that one.
[02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:52.420]   The master of malt calendar.
[02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:53.420]   But there is a gin.
[02:07:53.420 --> 02:07:54.420]   Yeah, so that's...
[02:07:54.420 --> 02:07:55.420]   There is gin.
[02:07:55.420 --> 02:07:56.420]   Oh, wait.
[02:07:56.420 --> 02:07:57.420]   Amazon had it.
[02:07:57.420 --> 02:07:58.420]   Here's a whole...
[02:07:58.420 --> 02:07:59.420]   Wait a minute.
[02:07:59.420 --> 02:08:00.900]   Here's a whole page of advent calendars with booze.
[02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:03.500]   Yeah, but gin is the only fun one.
[02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:07.180]   The boutique gin company, how about this?
[02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:08.180]   Would you like that?
[02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:09.180]   I can get you that.
[02:08:09.180 --> 02:08:11.820]   Oh, you can actually ship to you in the US.
[02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:12.820]   Mm.
[02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:13.820]   All right, see.
[02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:15.460]   But they have 209 in there.
[02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:17.460]   Here's the gin-vent.
[02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:18.460]   Yeah.
[02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:19.460]   Mm.
[02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:20.460]   All right.
[02:08:20.460 --> 02:08:21.460]   Well, wait a minute.
[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:22.460]   You can buy it.
[02:08:22.460 --> 02:08:24.460]   The whiskey exchange shop now.
[02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:25.460]   Oh crap.
[02:08:25.460 --> 02:08:27.660]   Now you're moving into an like an Irish accent.
[02:08:27.660 --> 02:08:28.660]   What is that?
[02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:29.660]   That's normal.
[02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:30.660]   All right.
[02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:32.820]   So, Jeff, did you have a number as well?
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:33.820]   You want to make the beef?
[02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:34.820]   That could be yours.
[02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:35.820]   It could be the beef.
[02:08:35.820 --> 02:08:36.820]   It could be the beef.
[02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:39.140]   Oh, let's see what I have real quickly.
[02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:40.140]   How big...
[02:08:40.140 --> 02:08:44.500]   Well, speaking of beef, the question that's been roiling the internet today is how big
[02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:46.140]   is the big cow?
[02:08:46.140 --> 02:08:47.140]   How big is it?
[02:08:47.140 --> 02:08:48.140]   Is it real?
[02:08:48.140 --> 02:08:49.140]   Is it not?
[02:08:49.140 --> 02:08:50.140]   What's that big cow?
[02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:53.740]   So the big cow has been on Twitter of this gigantic cow.
[02:08:53.740 --> 02:08:59.260]   Now Washington Post is a killjoy and says that it's neither a cow nor a giant because
[02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:00.260]   it's not a cow.
[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:01.260]   It's a steer.
[02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:02.260]   Okay.
[02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:04.180]   It's steer and it's real.
[02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:05.340]   Here's the real time that's the big.
[02:09:05.340 --> 02:09:06.340]   It's real time that's the big.
[02:09:06.340 --> 02:09:11.300]   It went and sold it on auction because potential buyers said it wouldn't fit in their quote,
[02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:13.780]   farm equipment.
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:16.580]   That's an interesting euphemism.
[02:09:16.580 --> 02:09:18.780]   It's it's it's fire equipment.
[02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:20.060]   So he's a steer.
[02:09:20.060 --> 02:09:21.140]   He's real, not a cow.
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:23.740]   Well, yes, but it's a cow-ish thing.
[02:09:23.740 --> 02:09:25.660]   It's a male cow, which would be a steer.
[02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:26.660]   Yeah.
[02:09:26.660 --> 02:09:27.660]   That's not a cousin.
[02:09:27.660 --> 02:09:29.500]   It's just a male.
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:31.500]   It's a boy.
[02:09:31.500 --> 02:09:36.020]   It's kind of acting like a great day and scared little cows.
[02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:39.300]   It's actually not the world's largest steer.
[02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:43.500]   It's three inches short of the Guinness World Record for tallest living steer, but no one
[02:09:43.500 --> 02:09:46.860]   bought it because you couldn't fit it in the equipment.
[02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:48.260]   Very clever of you, steer.
[02:09:48.260 --> 02:09:49.260]   Yes.
[02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:50.260]   What a stay alive.
[02:09:50.260 --> 02:09:51.260]   You know what his name is?
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:52.260]   Some pig.
[02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:53.260]   Knickers.
[02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:54.260]   Knickers.
[02:09:54.260 --> 02:09:56.500]   So I said you say some pig?
[02:09:56.500 --> 02:09:57.500]   Yes.
[02:09:57.500 --> 02:10:02.380]   You know, they didn't cross this Wilbur because, you know, that's babe.
[02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:03.780]   Oh, that's babe.
[02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:04.980]   This is to avoid getting killed.
[02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:07.740]   Wilbur had Charlotte spin the web of some pig.
[02:10:07.740 --> 02:10:08.740]   Right.
[02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:09.740]   Yeah.
[02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:10.740]   Anyway.
[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:14.700]   These two inches taller than Arnold Schwarzenegger and weighs 2,800 pounds.
[02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:17.060]   So this is what I'm missing by not being on Twitter.
[02:10:17.060 --> 02:10:18.060]   Is that what you're saying?
[02:10:18.060 --> 02:10:19.060]   There you go.
[02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:21.940]   See, you could have seen the story of the big cow.
[02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:25.420]   It's finally happened that I feel left out of the conversation because I'm not a Twitter
[02:10:25.420 --> 02:10:26.420]   user.
[02:10:26.420 --> 02:10:28.420]   Yeah, I told you.
[02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:29.900]   I told you.
[02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:32.060]   Everywhere on Twitter.
[02:10:32.060 --> 02:10:33.060]   Oh, maybe Fadey.
[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:40.260]   Meanwhile, brand watch named Taylor Swift, the most influential person on Twitter.
[02:10:40.260 --> 02:10:42.700]   She tweeted only 13 times.
[02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:43.700]   Wow.
[02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:46.540]   But that one tweet where she said everybody said register and vote.
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:49.380]   That had a lot of influence.
[02:10:49.380 --> 02:10:52.060]   And Donald Trump is not the most influential man on Twitter.
[02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:53.060]   Says this ridiculous.
[02:10:53.060 --> 02:10:54.060]   I think that's not true.
[02:10:54.060 --> 02:10:56.780]   Who is the most influential person?
[02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:57.780]   Liam Payne.
[02:10:57.780 --> 02:10:58.780]   Liam Payne.
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:00.380]   Oh, the singer.
[02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:01.380]   Yeah.
[02:11:01.380 --> 02:11:02.380]   No, no.
[02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:03.380]   Okay.
[02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:07.220]   The president is easily the most influential person on Twitter.
[02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:09.220]   Yes, this is this BS, these things.
[02:11:09.220 --> 02:11:13.300]   But you can say number besides the president.
[02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:15.820]   Besides the president.
[02:11:15.820 --> 02:11:18.660]   So since we're doing advent calendars, I will show you mine.
[02:11:18.660 --> 02:11:19.660]   I do this every year.
[02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:21.860]   The advent of code calendar.
[02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:24.660]   Oh, we.
[02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:25.660]   Okay.
[02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:26.660]   I'll take gin.
[02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:27.660]   Thank you very much.
[02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:35.060]   So each day it's going to launch in a 24 hours each or no longer than that Saturday,
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:39.780]   42 hours at midnight Eastern time on December 1st, the first puzzle will unlock.
[02:11:39.780 --> 02:11:42.860]   They are coding puzzles.
[02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:44.700]   So you know, you couldn't go back in time.
[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:49.140]   We could look at the previous years and see, but they're fun.
[02:11:49.140 --> 02:11:50.140]   They're fun.
[02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:51.140]   They're good.
[02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:56.020]   And it forces you to do a new, solve a new problem every day.
[02:11:56.020 --> 02:11:59.900]   It's adventofcode.com.
[02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:03.980]   Small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels.
[02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:07.420]   And they've been doing this for a long time, which is really cool.
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:08.580]   And a lot of people participate.
[02:12:08.580 --> 02:12:12.860]   So you can see other people's answers and so forth.
[02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:13.860]   Advent.
[02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:15.700]   I'm really sad about this gin thing.
[02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:18.980]   I think it's just because our whiskey shipping laws are so difficult.
[02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:19.980]   Oh, yeah.
[02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:23.220]   We need a casele calendar.
[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:27.900]   No, just cheese every day.
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:29.380]   I think gin isn't bad.
[02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:31.460]   Gin's a good start.
[02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:33.820]   Chocolate's pretty good.
[02:12:33.820 --> 02:12:36.740]   It has to be good chocolate.
[02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:38.700]   It can't be like Hershey's chocolate.
[02:12:38.700 --> 02:12:40.700]   I mean, I'd still eat Hershey's chocolate.
[02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:42.340]   There is a good dive advent calendar.
[02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:43.340]   There's a lint.
[02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:44.340]   Are you don't good divers?
[02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:45.340]   Just not my thing.
[02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:46.340]   It's not my jam.
[02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:47.340]   No, not my jam.
[02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:48.180]   What's your favorite chocolate?
[02:12:48.180 --> 02:12:49.660]   Um, here's the cheese.
[02:12:49.660 --> 02:12:50.660]   My favorite.
[02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:51.660]   Or cheese.
[02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:52.660]   I'm going to get it at Target.
[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:54.860]   Oh, just a little bite of cheese.
[02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:59.940]   Don't let the mice find it.
[02:12:59.940 --> 02:13:00.940]   What's your chocolate?
[02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:01.940]   What's your chocolate?
[02:13:01.940 --> 02:13:03.900]   Oh, I don't really have a like, I don't have a favorite chocolate.
[02:13:03.900 --> 02:13:05.500]   I like the france and Seattle.
[02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:06.780]   They have the france carmels.
[02:13:06.780 --> 02:13:10.260]   Those are the way she's moving to Seattle boys and girls.
[02:13:10.260 --> 02:13:11.660]   Zephyr got the right answer.
[02:13:11.660 --> 02:13:12.660]   C's.
[02:13:12.660 --> 02:13:15.940]   I don't love C's either.
[02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:17.420]   I don't, I don't love chocolate.
[02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:19.140]   That's probably something else should know.
[02:13:19.140 --> 02:13:22.780]   That is a weird, strange thing.
[02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:24.220]   I'm not, I'm not going to lie.
[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:26.220]   How can you not love chocolate?
[02:13:26.220 --> 02:13:29.780]   Uh, ladies and gentlemen, confirm your age.
[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:34.300]   No, this is cannabis Christmas just in time for the new laws.
[02:13:34.300 --> 02:13:35.300]   [laughter]
[02:13:35.300 --> 02:13:38.860]   What do you know what you're doing?
[02:13:38.860 --> 02:13:43.860]   What states is that available in Washington and California and Colorado?
[02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:48.940]   Uh, cannabis Christmas calendar.
[02:13:48.940 --> 02:13:55.420]   And all of Canada.
[02:13:55.420 --> 02:13:57.660]   I feel like this might have gone a little too far.
[02:13:57.660 --> 02:14:01.380]   It took, it took the fun out of it.
[02:14:01.380 --> 02:14:03.220]   There's more than one of these.
[02:14:03.220 --> 02:14:04.220]   Apparently.
[02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:05.220]   Cannabis calendars?
[02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:06.220]   Yeah.
[02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:07.220]   I believe it.
[02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:10.100]   Uh, 25 days of different strains.
[02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:11.100]   Yeah.
[02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:14.580]   I'm not going to spread that out over, over more than just the month.
[02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:18.380]   I could have a gin and tonic every night, but I don't know if I could get high every night.
[02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:20.220]   It would not be good.
[02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:22.260]   I mean, I can't because in Texas, it's illegal.
[02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:23.260]   That's right.
[02:14:23.260 --> 02:14:24.260]   Yeah, it would be wrong.
[02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:25.940]   I'm sure you would never do that.
[02:14:25.940 --> 02:14:27.460]   I would never break the law.
[02:14:27.460 --> 02:14:32.140]   There is a, there is a, let's get wasted calendar.
[02:14:32.140 --> 02:14:33.140]   These are not my goals.
[02:14:33.140 --> 02:14:34.140]   Me for beers.
[02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:38.740]   Well, that's, that's the, no, that's the, this week of Microsoft calendars, beers.
[02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:39.740]   [laughter]
[02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:40.740]   All right.
[02:14:40.740 --> 02:14:41.740]   All right.
[02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:43.820]   And this show, but I guess I best.
[02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:48.980]   Stacey Higginbotham is available at her website, stacey@iot.com.
[02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:50.580]   When you're there, you sign up for the newsletter.
[02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:54.980]   That way you'll get her weekly at gigastacey on the Twitter.
[02:14:54.980 --> 02:14:56.780]   I will not be here next week, Stacey.
[02:14:56.780 --> 02:14:59.180]   So I hope you can hold down the fort with Jeff and Kevin.
[02:14:59.180 --> 02:15:00.180]   Oh, yeah.
[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:01.340]   I think I'll be in charge.
[02:15:01.340 --> 02:15:03.140]   Can I have a special hat?
[02:15:03.140 --> 02:15:04.140]   Yeah.
[02:15:04.140 --> 02:15:08.500]   The only thing we need somebody from the staff to read the ads, so you don't have to compromise
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:12.260]   yourself, but get, send her the special hat.
[02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:15.220]   Get right on that.
[02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:18.180]   Carsten's like, it's you Stacey.
[02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:20.460]   Stacey in charge is a great idea for a show.
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:21.460]   I like it.
[02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:22.460]   Let's do it.
[02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:23.460]   Here, give me that hat.
[02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:24.460]   Well, won't there be like Jason or someone?
[02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:25.460]   This is the special hat.
[02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:27.300]   Oh, is that the special hat?
[02:15:27.300 --> 02:15:28.300]   All right.
[02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:29.300]   I would wear that hat.
[02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:30.500]   Yeah, you'd look at that.
[02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:32.380]   Jeff Jarvis is professor of journalism.
[02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:33.540]   Well, I have the whole thing here.
[02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:35.420]   I don't know if we have enough time to write it.
[02:15:35.420 --> 02:15:36.420]   No, no, no.
[02:15:36.420 --> 02:15:37.420]   You've done it already once.
[02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:38.420]   You've already done it.
[02:15:38.420 --> 02:15:39.420]   Cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:40.420]   CUNY.
[02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:41.420]   He's also buzzmachine.com.
[02:15:41.420 --> 02:15:43.620]   Many, many great books.
[02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:48.180]   Latest is Geeks bearing gifts, reinventing the news business, but also, but would Google
[02:15:48.180 --> 02:15:49.340]   do public parts.
[02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:52.140]   Public parts is great.
[02:15:52.140 --> 02:15:53.980]   Be a good gift for anybody.
[02:15:53.980 --> 02:15:57.380]   You're the only one who thinks that, but that's fine.
[02:15:57.380 --> 02:15:59.380]   Nobody buys optimism.
[02:15:59.380 --> 02:16:01.180]   Nobody buys optimism.
[02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:02.180]   Nope.
[02:16:02.180 --> 02:16:03.180]   Nope.
[02:16:03.180 --> 02:16:04.180]   That is true.
[02:16:04.180 --> 02:16:05.860]   They just buy those hats.
[02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:06.860]   This hat.
[02:16:06.860 --> 02:16:08.100]   I'm feeling more optimistic already.
[02:16:08.100 --> 02:16:09.100]   Is better when you're here.
[02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:10.100]   You're happy.
[02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:12.100]   Oh, it says ho-ho-ho on the front.
[02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:13.100]   Oh, ho-ho.
[02:16:13.100 --> 02:16:14.780]   I totally wear that.
[02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:15.780]   You want it?
[02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:16.780]   I'm going to send it to you.
[02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:18.420]   No, no, no.
[02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:19.620]   You should keep your own Christmas hat.
[02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:20.620]   I have a Christmas hat.
[02:16:20.620 --> 02:16:21.620]   I could tell you about that.
[02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:22.620]   I have many Christmas hats.
[02:16:22.620 --> 02:16:27.260]   And I will be wearing them, by the way, on our Best of episode, because this show is
[02:16:27.260 --> 02:16:32.860]   normally on Wednesdays, and this year, Wednesday's Boxing Day, and we don't want to have to work
[02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:36.180]   on Boxing Day, so we will have a Best of this week in Google.
[02:16:36.180 --> 02:16:38.300]   I will host it in a Santa outfit.
[02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:39.620]   There may be gin involved.
[02:16:39.620 --> 02:16:40.620]   I don't know.
[02:16:40.620 --> 02:16:43.860]   So I hope you'll tune in for that.
[02:16:43.860 --> 02:16:45.780]   You should make a lion's tail using bourbon.
[02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:47.420]   It is a very Christmassy drink.
[02:16:47.420 --> 02:16:48.420]   It sounds good.
[02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:50.180]   What is in a lion's tail?
[02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:52.820]   Bourbon, all-spice, dram, and lime?
[02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:54.820]   Sounds wonderful.
[02:16:54.820 --> 02:16:55.820]   It's really yummy.
[02:16:55.820 --> 02:17:00.940]   But you do have to have all-spice, dram, which is kind of a really fru-fi liquor.
[02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:04.700]   This recipe requires pimento, dram.
[02:17:04.700 --> 02:17:06.140]   That is all-spice, dram.
[02:17:06.140 --> 02:17:11.300]   So, fresh lime juice, simple syrup, agnestura, bitters, and egg white.
[02:17:11.300 --> 02:17:13.260]   Wow, this sounds really good.
[02:17:13.260 --> 02:17:15.740]   I don't have the egg white in mine, and it's fine.
[02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:18.620]   But if you want to go egg white, just extra protein.
[02:17:18.620 --> 02:17:20.860]   It's smooth out some of the edges.
[02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:21.860]   It's a delicious drink.
[02:17:21.860 --> 02:17:22.860]   I recommend it.
[02:17:22.860 --> 02:17:24.860]   It makes you feel like Christmas is here.
[02:17:24.860 --> 02:17:25.860]   Oh, man.
[02:17:25.860 --> 02:17:28.300]   I wonder where I can get this.
[02:17:28.300 --> 02:17:32.300]   Litter store.
[02:17:32.300 --> 02:17:33.300]   Or my house.
[02:17:33.300 --> 02:17:34.300]   I have some.
[02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:35.540]   I'm on my way.
[02:17:35.540 --> 02:17:40.380]   We do this week on Google Wednesdays, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2130 UTC.
[02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:41.820]   Come by and watch us live.
[02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:45.620]   Audio and video versions are available at twit.tv/live.
[02:17:45.620 --> 02:17:49.300]   If you do that, visit the chatroom.rc.twit.tv.
[02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:52.100]   And please subscribe, actually.
[02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:53.100]   That's the best way to do it.
[02:17:53.100 --> 02:17:55.620]   Then you can have it on-demand and sitting on your phone, waiting.
[02:17:55.620 --> 02:17:59.500]   Anytime you're in the mood, you can say, "I feel like some Stacy and Jeff."
[02:17:59.500 --> 02:18:02.180]   And just fire up this week in Google.
[02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:03.700]   We thank you all for being here.
[02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:06.580]   I will see you in two weeks.
[02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:08.700]   But Jeff and Stacy will be back next week.
[02:18:08.700 --> 02:18:10.740]   Jeff from Paris.
[02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:12.980]   If all goes well, safe travels.
[02:18:12.980 --> 02:18:13.980]   Thanks, everybody.
[02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:15.980]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:18:15.980 --> 02:18:16.480]   Bye-bye.
[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:26.480]   [MUSIC]
