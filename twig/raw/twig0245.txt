[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.360]   And a couple of new apps, a Google Chrome extension that lets you remote access

[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.560]   And Google's new camera app.

[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.880]   The show where we talk about Google, the Google verse, the cloud verse, the verse, the
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.360]   verse, the verse, the inverse and the adverse.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.240]   And speaking of Bob verse to my left, Janet Trebani.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.240]   Hello.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.000]   I'm Bob of smarterwhere.org.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.760]   That's our blog and of course thinkup.com.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.520]   Now public, that analysis program that kind of checks in on your Twitter and Facebook
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.520]   feeds.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.520]   Hi, Gina.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.520]   Hi.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.200]   We're actually at the top of Product Hunt today, or we were for a little bit.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   And then we got knocked down by some next fashion thing.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   Is that a big deal?
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.200]   You know, I don't know.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   Maybe.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.200]   It's actually a really cool app.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.440]   I hadn't heard of it before today, but it actually started a pretty cool conversation.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.600]   It's a really well designed app.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.840]   It's kind of like Reddit or dig for new products.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.840]   Isn't he?
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.920]   Do you see some traffic as a result?
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.920]   Yeah, we did.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.920]   We did.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.480]   We definitely drove a few signups, which was exciting.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.320]   A daily leaderboard of the best new products.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.920]   And you can actually get this in your mail.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.920]   This is good.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.760]   Yeah, it seems very skewed toward the web and some good stuff there.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.760]   I'm voting up.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.760]   Think out.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.760]   Oh, I got to sign in first.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.640]   Oh, we sign in with Twitter, but it doesn't.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.640]   I don't believe it posts.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.040]   It can't post tweets for you.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.040]   It's read only.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.200]   I always appreciate that.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   It's good.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.320]   I'm this humble piece of internet.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.840]   This is cool.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.400]   I really like this.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   All right.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.600]   So Jeff Jarvis is also here from the City University of New York.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.000]   CUNY, as it is known.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Hello, hello.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   How are you?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Is it from home?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.360]   He is in his home today.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.320]   And we are talking about the goog.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.360]   Who wasn't here last week?
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.440]   You weren't here last week, Jeff.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.440]   I wasn't.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.440]   I was the bad boy.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.440]   Welcome back.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.200]   I was on Twitter, which I always love and is wonderful for them.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.600]   But boy, did I get junk from your listeners.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.360]   You got hate mail for what?
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.360]   Both sides.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.360]   Both sides.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   Positive and negative.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.040]   No, no, not negative, but also positive.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.600]   One because of, if you dare, if you dare, breathe the word apple without angelic tones
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.440]   behind you.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.960]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.720]   And then the whole San Francisco bus thing.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.960]   So on the one hand, some said that I was a capitalist pig awful.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.520]   Other people said that, you know, that I was a commie or something like that.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.520]   I didn't understand.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.200]   I asked him, good for you for good sense.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   Oh, geez, people were me long emails.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.200]   Like I have time for more emails on this stuff.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.560]   When I made a crack about the Supreme Court decision, mean you could, you know, get to
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.560]   more damn Republicans.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.560]   Somebody wrote me this long.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.560]   I was joking.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.560]   Oh, man.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.480]   Don't, don't bring it all up again and just get more.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.480]   Oh.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.960]   Well, that doesn't happen on twig.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   That happens on Twitter.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.960]   That's a bunch of left lefties.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.960]   Listen to this show.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.440]   Yeah, we were all in the world.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.320]   No, you know, because everybody knows you, Jeff, and we know, you know, we know what
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.320]   is count everything I said.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.840]   No, but I mean, we just know you.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.160]   So we don't, you know, but if it's your stranger, then people don't understand, they get angry,
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.440]   but no reason to get angry at Jeff.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.440]   He's a sweetheart.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.560]   I know why you avoid politics on Twitter.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.840]   But let's, as long as we're talking about it, good article, I thought very good article
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   on tech crunch.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:59.120]   How boring I will lead to vomiting anarchists, incredibly long people, unbelievably long,
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.440]   but, but really good understanding of the whole circumstances of development and, and
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.160]   home prices and the economy in San Francisco.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.160]   Really good work.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.760]   Kim May Cutler wrote it.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.240]   And I'm, you know, the real, the, the, the TLDR summary of it actually has nothing to do
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.480]   with burrowing owls.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.760]   That's really the reason that Silicon Valley can't expand to accommodate all the new workers
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.760]   that are being brought in.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.760]   It's a, it's a gag.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.000]   It's why it's why Google's not allowed to pull apartments next to the next to the Google
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   plaques.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Right.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.640]   But the real issue is that, she writes 80% of the city of San Francisco isn't oriented
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.000]   to ad housing stock.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.680]   It's a nimby problem.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.240]   It's not a tech problem.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.760]   In fact, the tech industry is only 8% of San Francisco's workforce.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.120]   So this whole anger at Google, um, while I understand it, isn't, isn't, is not really
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   is misplaced.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.560]   What is it?
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.560]   Nindi.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.200]   Not in my backyard.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.920]   And so she uses as an example, telegraph Hill Dwellers Association, which, uh, is a neighborhood
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.920]   group.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.920]   I used to live on telegraph Hill.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:13.880]   It prevents any development there because, uh, the bulk of the homeowners, which, which
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.120]   only represent by the way, um, 35% of San Francisco's.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.240]   So, so let's take the first 35% of the San Francisco, uh, residents, they own their home.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.120]   They, uh, they are benefiting greatly from the shortage of housing.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.680]   Their housing is worth a hell of a lot more than it should be millions, uh, because of
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.920]   the scarcity of housing.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.960]   So they don't want development rent controlled tenants, which accommodate, which account for
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:48.760]   another large percentage of this, uh, are paying rents so far below market rate that
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.360]   nothing that could be done with construction could possibly help them.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.000]   So so she says about 80% of the city just says, we don't need more housing stock.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.160]   Text only 8%.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.680]   They're not causing the problem.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.080]   Then there's the issue, of course, of Silicon Valley.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.280]   Lots of people, lots of jobs created.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.440]   They're not lots of housing, uh, they're for a number of reasons.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.120]   So and who necessarily wants to be forced to live there, by the way, nobody wants to live
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120]   in Mountain View.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.120]   That's why Google has buses.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.360]   But they can't anyway.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.400]   There's not enough housing by even close.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.520]   No, no, we're near.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.880]   So this is a start with the basic fact of San Francisco that some people don't grok unless
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.880]   you live there.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   It's seven miles by seven miles.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.880]   It is, it is bounded in.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.520]   It can't grow because it's a rat surrounded by water.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.520]   It can't grow.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.800]   It's not even, it's water around three sides.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:41.200]   And the fourth side, it's Daily City and South San Francisco, which is no space for expansion.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.320]   There's a big leap from there to liveable places south.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.760]   Not not livable, you know, San Francisco level livable.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.240]   Well, you know why I'm in Petaluma?
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.440]   You want to know why we're in Petaluma?
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.880]   We lived in San Francisco when Abby was born 20 years ago.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.880]   We wanted to buy a house.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.520]   We couldn't come close 20 years ago.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.480]   Couldn't come close to a fording house.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.400]   We started driving north until we could.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.760]   Went right through Marin, which was equally expensive and got to Petaluma warehousing prices
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.760]   were relatively low.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.640]   Well, when I left in 1981, my children, I couldn't nearly afford it.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.960]   My co-worker and I were going to buy a two flat in the neighborhood and we couldn't afford
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.960]   it.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:18.960]   I worked for the San Francisco examiner.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.160]   I was a columnist on the San Francisco examiner.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.560]   I couldn't afford to live there.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.560]   Nobody.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.560]   I'm sure nobody watching this show cares.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.960]   So, but that's, I guess that it was a good article.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.200]   And I think it really pointed out that it's these are, I think these are complex issues
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:36.560]   that are not easily explained on a protest placard.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.560]   It's complicated.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.720]   And certainly not worth assaulting a reporter for his Google Glass.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.960]   Oh, my, my, my.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.960]   Well, okay.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.960]   Let's talk about that.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.960]   I knew you'd want to talk about that.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.040]   Well, I also heard you had your continuing, I hate class.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.640]   Idiotic opinion based on the movie theater conversation continued into this topic.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:03.080]   Well, I don't think it's okay to beat up somebody because he's wearing Google Glass.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.760]   Guy was walking through the mission, right?
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.320]   He was on his way to 16th Street BART station.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.040]   Everybody knows that area.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.320]   It's a, it's a mixed neighborhood.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.160]   There's families there.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.160]   I like it.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.280]   It's one of my favorite neighborhoods in San Francisco.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.640]   But he was wearing glass.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:25.800]   He actually was coming from covering the protests against tech workers.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:31.640]   Everybody ran up to him, took his glass, actually ran away with it at first.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:39.080]   So it's not clear if he was stealing the glass or what, but then, I think there were
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.520]   shouts of glass glass.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:49.600]   But then he gave chase and the glass was thrown to the ground and stomped upon.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.280]   And that's all there is to say about that.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.280]   Well, I have decided when I come to San Francisco next, I'm going to wear this in
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.280]   protest.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.120]   Kyle Russell was the, I think you're asking for trouble, my friend.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.080]   And I don't, I don't have any problem with you wearing glass, obviously.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.880]   But I think you're asking for trouble.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.800]   Well, they also have something about the reporter, I think bent over far too far backwards to
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.360]   say, Oh, I want to understand.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.320]   It was just too gushy liberal for, you know, Henry Blodton, capital site for God's sakes.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.520]   It was a business insider.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.520]   He had a right to be pet.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:27.880]   It was assaulted for wearing Google glass in the wrong part of San Francisco.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.040]   They would just finished covering a protest, which I thought was kind of interesting.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:38.320]   So he's that he's, I mean, this is obviously never okay, but I always, I don't know, it
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.320]   makes, it makes me wonder, even if the housing crisis isn't the fault of technology, it's
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.480]   interesting to me that technologists or employees of these big companies are so easily hated.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.880]   Like, what do they represent beyond these problems?
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.040]   Like, I feel like this is, this is, yeah, capitalism, but I mean, privilege, elitism.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.840]   I don't know.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.840]   It's a new one.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.280]   Fracturing a culture, the new 1%.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.600]   I mean, it's, you know, it comes down to a really severe problem in this country, which
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.920]   is income inequality.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.920]   Yes.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:14.320]   And whenever that happens, as it did in 18th century France had sometimes role.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.040]   Oh, God, we're going to be heading technologists.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.000]   But you understand why the French peasantry finally revolted.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.600]   All you have to do is go see Versailles and understand why they revolted against French
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.240]   royalty and chopped their heads off.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.040]   Well, there's, there's a hot, though probably not terribly readable book from a French economist
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.360]   called Capital, which is all arguing about Thomas Piketty, I think his name is.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:44.000]   I just saw a great review of it in the FT that says that when, you know, when, when
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.600]   capital and income reach, reach this level, it doesn't stop until that happens.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   Right.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.520]   And then what happens?
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.520]   And then you have upset.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.520]   And I understand why people are upset.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:01.640]   I think, I think in this country, you may be not uniquely, but some, it seems uniquely
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.920]   and our international viewers will tell me if I'm wrong.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:14.240]   There is this notion that anybody can succeed if you have brains, if you have persistence
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.360]   and ambition that this is a land of opportunity.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:28.880]   And as long as that seems to be true, I think people will put up with a very wealthy 1%.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.920]   But it, but it does, but as soon as it feels like you don't have a shot at it, like you
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.480]   couldn't be in that 1% in your lifetime, then that then I can understand why people
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.480]   will be upset.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.240]   Well, I, I, I, but I think it's, it's, it's also the, you know, the, the top 1% got, I
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:51.760]   think 60% of the wealth growth in the last, I think decade or two decades.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.920]   That's what inequality really hits.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.880]   So it's, yeah, you got a shop, you don't have that shot.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.680]   There's also a growing sense that this is not a democracy.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:06.480]   We saw this study from Princeton and Northwestern saying that the US government does not represent
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.360]   the interests of the majority of the citizens as our mythology tells us, but instead is ruled
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:19.720]   by those of the rich and powerful using extensive policy data collected from 1981 to 2002,
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.880]   sifting through 1800 US policies enacted in that period and comparing them to the preferences
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.880]   of average Americans at the 50th percentile of income and affluent Americans at the 90th
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.680]   percentile and large special interest groups.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:40.680]   Researchers concluded that shock the United States is dominated by its economic elite.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.880]   That's in 2008, 1981 through 2002.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:48.520]   The most visible of that elite now is technology is actually there banking.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.880]   There's plenty of other areas where there's a lot more money, but the, but the huge pay
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.720]   days are happening in technology.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.480]   And so there's a resentment of that.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.880]   And glass is a manifestation.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.800]   I mean, I've had my cell phone stolen on the subway before because I stood close to someone
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.120]   who was sticking out of my bag and that wasn't an attack on me as a person.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.280]   That was just a regular, I got my phone.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.280]   Right?
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.600]   But with the glass represents a certain kind of not only disposable income, but a connection
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.400]   to Google because you all up until recently, up until yesterday, you kind of had to know
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.880]   somebody or had to be handpicked in order to test it.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.240]   It just, and it's very personal.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.240]   It's on your face.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.480]   So getting it ripped off your face feels like a much more personal attack than having
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.040]   in yourself on pulled out of your bag.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.160]   Glass takes it to a whole, a whole nother level.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.320]   Also glasses, you know, it's a, it's an accessory.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.120]   Let's say, you know, I mean, $1,500 accessory.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.520]   If you wore a $2,000 watch down the street, I don't think that that, what do you know
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.520]   is in New York?
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.520]   Yeah, would you miss?
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.240]   I mean, that's, that's, that's, talk about conspicuous consumption.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.160]   I mean, we're in the, there was one of the placards put into that article, I think was
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:04.040]   something from the, I don't know what it was, 80s, 90s of, of, of, you know, let's go after
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.240]   all the SUVs.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.240]   Right.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.400]   So it's a $6, $60, $1,000 car.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.400]   Right.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.280]   You know, we walk, there was a time when walking around with a Macintosh was obnoxious too.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.280]   Mm hmm.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.280]   Yep.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:25.440]   So yeah, that, that, I, you know, I understand, uh, upset over income inequality.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.600]   What I worry is that technology, which I, you know, look, technology is not uniformly
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.600]   good.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:40.960]   It can go either way, but it is in many respects the hope of our, our, our, our species.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.480]   That is how our species has advanced.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.720]   And it is very important stuff.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:52.080]   And I hate for it to be equated with income inequality to say, you know, we got to shut
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.040]   this technology, you know, this Google stuff is bad because people are getting rich on
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.040]   it.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:02.640]   Um, this is, but in the end, this is an issue very simply of taxation.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.280]   If you want to, and I, you know, I think, I think as we, as we have fewer jobs and less
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.680]   security, I personally believe we need a single payer health system.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:15.320]   I believe we, um, uh, need a better safety net.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.760]   Are you saying that socialism is the cure to this?
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:26.640]   No, I'm saying that there are some that we don't have the essential, um, safety net,
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.320]   the Europeans, for example, have, and I think that, and if we assume that people are going
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:37.960]   to have fewer jobs, uh, less seniority at jobs, less less stability at jobs than having
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.800]   some security from mobility, I think is important.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.320]   And that's one way to redistribute wealth is you tax it.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.320]   It's the only way.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.240]   What do we, you know, it's, it's like the fight in, in, in Europe or where Google's
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.280]   taxes, but I have a fit about because it's not up to Google to decide how much to give.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:58.400]   It's up to governments to decide how much to tax and what to then do with those proceeds.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.200]   That's the real fight here.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.000]   And of course our political system is back to your point, Leo.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.560]   It's a political fight and our political system can't bear it.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.200]   Is there an obligation as a technologist?
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:17.080]   I mean, let's face it, glass really does look frivolous, expensive.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:23.240]   And there's a certain amount of arrogance that is imputed by somebody wearing this camera
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.080]   that they could take a picture of you at any time.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.320]   Should we power on that?
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.320]   There's a power.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.320]   Should we tread more?
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:37.240]   Should we tread more carefully and, and should, should we avoid these like glass because so
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.280]   they imply that it's very uncomfortable.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.240]   Is, is, is that becomes so, so, so PC doesn't extend just to language.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.320]   It now extends to innovation.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.000]   We shouldn't innovate certain things.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.080]   We shouldn't be trying certain things because somebody might not like it.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.080]   Oh, God, no.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:56.760]   Well, not because somebody might like what not like it because it, because it is in fact
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.160]   extremely expensive of dubious value.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.160]   You said it, Gina.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.640]   It, it, it, it is a statement in a, in the power balance.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.500]   I mean, we need to do just the opposite, right?
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.240]   We have to work toward like, like you said, that technology isn't about income inequality,
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.240]   but it is right.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.640]   Like access to technology is what matters.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.600]   And the fact is that, that not everybody has access to technology.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.200]   And that's, that's part of, I think, the backlash to glass is that, you know, only the special
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.160]   folks who have enough money and who have the connections could, could get it, right?
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.000]   So I think it's up to us not only to innovate, but to work toward, you know, opening up access
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.920]   to all sorts of new technologies or demystifying and explaining it, you know, the camera on
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:44.200]   glass, like the ability to be able to take a picture of someone, of someone's by winking.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.680]   That is a very powerful thing.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.040]   You know, you can dock someone basically by winking.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.040]   Right?
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.040]   Like that's, that is a powerful thing.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.960]   And I can see how people might feel invaded by it.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.840]   But I'm like, again, I'll say, I'll say that there's nothing subtle about taking a picture
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.840]   with glass.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.680]   We'll still take a picture.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.680]   The wig still.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.640]   Yeah, but, but, but we're going, I'm sorry, I'm going to, I'm going to invoke it.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:10.600]   It grow back to 1890 and the Kodak camera and the Kodakers until we have the, the, the norms
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.080]   that deal with this.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.080]   Right.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:18.600]   If, if I walk down the street and see, even in a public street, you know, my views about
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:24.720]   publicness and you see a 12 year old girl walking and I just went up toward a picture,
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.320]   wouldn't we all agree that it'd be wrong?
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.240]   As a matter of what camera I use, what means I use that would be wrong.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.920]   Or norms, unstable.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.920]   What if, here's something else.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.920]   Do you know it?
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.560]   Is there any in the chairmaster interest in question?
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.440]   What if glass didn't have a camera?
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.600]   That's just a display.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.400]   It'd be even less useful than it is.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.400]   Okay.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:48.960]   But, but I would be less in, I would find it less intrusive.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.960]   It would, I think it's a perception.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.960]   Well, then it's a perception.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.960]   Change the perception.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.960]   I'd be connected all the time.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.960]   Gee, aren't you obnoxious or connected all the time?
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:55.960]   We know we'd still hear it.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.960]   It's, you know what?
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.040]   It's facing it's obnoxious.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.600]   And while I'm not blaming Kyle, and of course it's wrong to take something off somebody's
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.200]   face and smash it, that's wrong.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.800]   So I'm not saying it's Kyle's fault.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:12.160]   You know, my daughter was carrying an iPhone 5S in Mexico two days ago and got mugged at
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.160]   knife point.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.160]   Oh, is she right?
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.160]   She's fine.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.160]   I didn't hear that.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.160]   Yeah, I mean, but.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.160]   That's serious.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.680]   Almost been really traumatic.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.640]   Fancy phone.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.240]   She's carrying around late at night.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:31.120]   It's not her fault, but it's also prudent to take off your fancy jewelry in the subway.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.840]   Don't you, you know, my first one.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.680]   You've never heard her ring around in the subway.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.440]   It's prudent, but you should never blame the victim.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.560]   But it's not the victims fault, but at the same time, prudence would dictate that one
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.560]   doesn't flash one's jewelry on the subway.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:51.120]   Yeah, I wouldn't take my, my MacBook out of, out of my bag on the subway and use it.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.120]   Some people do.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.720]   But I will do on the, on the, on the civilized path as well.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:02.040]   But what we should be decrying here is not that we should be decrying is any, any part
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.040]   of a society where that happens.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:09.040]   I mean, I lived in New York in, in the end of the bad days when you were constantly cautious
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:15.400]   and constantly worried and, and you know, you could say, people getting mad at you, rich
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.000]   people moving into New York.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.080]   Well, that's just clearly wrong.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:23.560]   New York is so much better off now that it was and San Francisco is far, but better off
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.080]   than if the entire tech industry moved to Cleveland, which could use it and be grateful
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.080]   for it.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:36.040]   I think we'd be really careful here of not recognizing whom to blame.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.920]   Now if you're committing a crime, that's who you blame.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.440]   If that person is angry, well, all right, we can, we can discuss that, but that's no
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.880]   justification for the crime.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.880]   Never.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.880]   Never.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:51.920]   And if you get robbed on the subway because you flashed your jewelry, it's not, well,
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.440]   it's not, it is your fault.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.760]   But I'm not, but I mean, can't we have both things?
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.080]   Hey, it's a terrible thing.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.240]   Nobody should commit crime ever horrible.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.400]   And at the same time, don't be stupid and walk down dark alleys in the middle of the
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.400]   night.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.480]   That doesn't mean you're blaming the victim.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.480]   Just don't be stupid.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.120]   What?
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.440]   I know, I mean, can we have both thoughts at the same time or is it either or no, I should
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.960]   be able to do anything I want.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.040]   It's, it's, it's a tragic prudence you have to do.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.040]   It is tragic.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.320]   Welcome to the world for crying out loud.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.480]   Okay, but record, but first recognize the tragedy of that recognize that that's wrong
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.240]   that you even have to think about such things.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.440]   I agree.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.280]   I should be able to flash my 5D Mark II anywhere I want.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.440]   I was walking down the street in Argentina about midnight in Buenos Aires and somebody
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.320]   tapped me on the shoulder.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.320]   I jumped.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:49.040]   He said, you know, she said, don't carry your 5D Mark II on your shoulder in the middle of
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.040]   the night in Buenos Aires.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.880]   Are you insane?
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.760]   And I immediately went, oh, no.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:56.760]   And I didn't want to.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.160]   I didn't get mugged, but I was very lucky apparently because that I could have easily.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.000]   I mean, this is being a woman in the world.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.760]   I mean, yeah, right.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.440]   It stinks that this is the case, right?
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.000]   But of course, I'm always circumspect always.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Aren't you?
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Of course.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.960]   And I taught my daughter to be careful.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.160]   My wife taught my daughter to be careful.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.440]   She said, you know, don't if you're walking in the just don't go in a deserted parking
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.280]   group structure at midnight, have the guard go with you.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.280]   I agree.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:32.320]   We shouldn't have to do that, but we do.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.840]   And I think it's probably a bad idea, Jeff, if you come out here to go down Mission Street
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.160]   wearing a glass.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.680]   That's not quite so bad.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:46.800]   I want to I want to twit crew following the power of the camera.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.200]   I'm taking these off now.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   They're never comfortable.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.200]   And you look like it.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.080]   Hey, hey, hey, no, I got nothing against glass.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.640]   I look like a door for these glasses too.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.760]   So how many people do you think bug glass yesterday?
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.760]   Is it still on sale?
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.760]   Was it one day on?
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.160]   Oh, it was one day only and they say they sold out.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.520]   But of course, that's I wonder what that means.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.200]   A thousand 10,000 five thousand.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.160]   We all we know is that the white went first.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.160]   Really?
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.160]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.160]   It's my one.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.800]   They've been emailing me like updates.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.800]   I don't know.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.160]   I must have gotten on their PR list and from from someone at Google, hi, I'll just want
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.000]   to let you know we're not sharing the specifics around the sale.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.640]   As many of you have asked for numbers.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.720]   They want to share the statement and the statement is we're getting through our stock
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.720]   faster than we expected and we decided to shut the store down.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.360]   So the fact that they're not sharing numbers makes me think that the they're probably not
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.360]   very high.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.360]   Right.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.840]   If it was a million, they'd be saying a million.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.840]   No doubt.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.880]   No doubt they would be saying that.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.440]   So I think they're making it.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.640]   I'm thinking it's a stock.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.560]   I think I think they they they stock.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:48.560]   Now, are we out?
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.560]   Is that it?
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.560]   There's no more class ever?
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.360]   No, no, no, they're not saying that they even said they might extend the sale.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.040]   I saw that in some quotes somewhere.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.720]   I think what I think the question is, would they sell any?
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.880]   Here's the question.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.880]   If they are going to come out with a consumer product, immediately, like I would say six
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:10.680]   months and it's going to be a hell of a lot less than than these, that if I just bought
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.080]   these, I'd probably be a little pet.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.080]   Right.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.280]   I still think they're not doing a consumer product.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.280]   This is all research for Android Wear and there is no product here.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.840]   They know perfectly well this is not a mass market product.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.920]   I really don't think people want to wear this.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.120]   No, I listen, I own them and I don't.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.360]   It's a gimmicky thing.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.240]   I have my briefcase every day and I think, should I take them out now?
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.400]   Should I be doing something with them?
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:47.400]   So my problem is there's a speed bump to get them hooked up and connected and doing things
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:52.720]   and then I'm afraid it's going to go into my phone contract and that's, I just say to
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   me.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.120]   Is it safe to assume as eight-bit Steve does in our chat room that this means that it'll
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.400]   be a while if they are going to sell them because they wouldn't go like two months from
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.720]   now say, oh, and hey, guess what we got for 200 bucks?
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.720]   That sounds right.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.720]   I think that sounds right.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.520]   That means we got, you know, this is like a year off if at all.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.920]   And I'm serious.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.360]   I just don't see this as a consumer product.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.360]   This as it is?
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.360]   No.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.360]   No.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.400]   But the idea of an always on, see, here's the problem.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.000]   A few minutes ago I said, I don't know how in a camera around all the time.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.840]   But on the other hand, rationally, you have to agree that having a camera, you don't have
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.800]   to pull out and turn on is a wonderful thing as long as nobody knocks you in the face because
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.040]   you used it rudely.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.040]   Okay.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.840]   So the problem there is to get past the norms and the structure and maybe it is a light
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.640]   on it to let you know you used it or something like that.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.080]   But the idea of having a camera on all the time is a wonderful thing.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.400]   It's a very big old GoPro on their head.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.640]   There's no, I never hear what you're playing about.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.800]   Hey, you got a GoPro one because you look like a complete dork and you know you're recording
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.800]   everything on it.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.800]   Right?
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   I don't know about that.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:02.320]   I think, I don't think it's an unreasonable part of our social contract to say.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.000]   And if you're going to take a picture, you should have to pull out a device that's clearly
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   designed to take a picture.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.400]   The issue isn't the pulling out.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.760]   The issue is the knowledge.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:15.800]   So if this thing had a big red light on it and went, whoa, whoa, whoa, he's taking a picture,
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.800]   then there'd be no, you would have disarmed that complaint.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.400]   You have a different complaint, but you disarmed that.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.040]   Or flash or visible flash.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.920]   I think glass is going to come out in 2015.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:35.280]   I think it's going to be for certain kinds of people, security guards, you know, for,
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.160]   you know, doctors, surgeons, teachers.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.520]   And you know, maybe when you go to the amusement park, they let you rent a pair so you can
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.400]   take a bunch of pictures of, you know, while you're on the roller coaster or whatever.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.760]   I mean, I think it's very much an experience kind of accessory.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.800]   I don't think that every single consumer is going to have them, but I think there's going
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.560]   to be some sort of place for them in different.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:03.720]   There's a place for glass somewhere a place for glass.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.120]   You could wear it in your hair or ass where that glass.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.120]   No.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.120]   David Poking us.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.120]   I'm poking you.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.120]   You told me.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.120]   You've been poked.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.120]   Let's take a break.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.120]   Gina and Jeff are here.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.120]   We're just going to take a picture.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:25.720]   We're going to talk more stuff, more tech stuff in just a second, but first a word from
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:33.320]   Shutterstock, a great place to get those beautiful images you need for your blog, your presentation.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:38.520]   Anywhere we use photos, you should be using royalty free stock photos, royalty free stock
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:43.920]   vector, garage drawings or images or illustrations or footage.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:52.360]   There's a place to go and take a look at so many beautiful images, 36 million images,
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.200]   a quarter million new ones this week alone.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.040]   You've got to try the Android app.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.040]   It is gorgeous.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.040]   They also have an iPad app that won the Webby Award.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.680]   This Android app's new.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.800]   Goes on your tablet or your phone.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.960]   It's free to create an account, which gives you free content, a free photo and vector every
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.880]   week.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.240]   Once you've got your free account, you can also browse through the selection.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:21.520]   Of course, 35 million images, you've got to have a pretty good search tool.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.720]   I wonder if they have Google Glass in here.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.720]   Let's see.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   They must, right?
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.720]   Yeah, there we go.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:34.360]   There's a teddy bear wearing glass.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:38.480]   Any image that you need, you can find at Shutterstock.com.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.440]   You can also use their search tool in unique ways.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.360]   You can refine your search.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.920]   Do you want people in the image?
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.920]   No?
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.920]   Yes?
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.920]   Only images with people.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.800]   Do you want any particular gender, age, ethnicity, a number of people?
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.240]   Are you looking for a particular color?
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.160]   They've got a color picker.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.160]   This is fabulous.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.000]   Then you save those images out to the light box.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.520]   You can share the light box with friends or just keep it for inspiration.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.400]   They also have a footage tab right at the top of people.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.400]   I think missed that.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.000]   I'll highlight that right at the top.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Click the footage tab.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.520]   You can see their beautiful video as well.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.560]   1.7 million royalty free stock videos.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:21.000]   You can buy images or videos in individual image packs or get a monthly subscription.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.680]   But either way, I'm going to get you 20% off any package when you use our offer code Twig

[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:07.880]   Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis, Leo LePorte, it's time, my friends, for the Google change
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:08.880]   log.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:16.120]   The Google change log.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.000]   Gina Trapani has the new stuff from Google.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.280]   Of course, after all about Android aired last night, a bunch of two big Android new things
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.280]   dropped.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.080]   It always happens.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.600]   First one's pretty a big deal.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:35.800]   Android's camera app got a bunch of new features, a UI overhaul, and now it's just available
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.840]   in the Play Store.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:43.680]   The decoupling of Android's core features like keyboard and Gmail continues.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.520]   It's now available in the Play Store and it's got some pretty cool new features.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.720]   It offers photos for 360 views.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.440]   This new lens blur feature.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.600]   It gives you SLR photos with a shallow depth of field.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.880]   It does this without the extra hardware.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.880]   We were testing this earlier today.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.040]   I'm going to take a picture.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.840]   The way it works, I've turned on lens blur.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:12.000]   The way it works, I take a picture and then it says, "Slowly raise your device and keep
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.600]   the subject centered."
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.680]   You're going to rotate it.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.960]   What you're doing is you're giving it some parallax.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.960]   You're giving it a sense of two images.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:24.480]   What are HTC M8s, the ones do, Gina, with two lenses?
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:28.920]   In this case, you have to take the picture twice, basically.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.920]   Then you can...
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.920]   How do you edit it?
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.480]   What do I do to edit it in that chat?
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.480]   Go back.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.480]   There you go.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.840]   So find the one you just took next to the pencil.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.120]   There's the lens thing there.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.120]   Oh, I have to take the lens thing.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.120]   The lens thing.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.120]   Then you can...
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.200]   Now I can choose what's in focus, background or foreground or anything, which is a little
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.840]   bit more sophisticated than the M8.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:53.040]   Then I can also have a slider to reduce or increase the effect.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:56.040]   Here, let go of the slider and then it does it.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.040]   It's not...
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.080]   Let me take a different picture and play with it a little bit.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.560]   This one was in front of the...
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.120]   Actually, maybe I've already said, "Oh, no, okay."
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.120]   You were saying you can only save one image.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.880]   It doesn't save the original.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.960]   So it basically...
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.040]   There's some way that it tags it as.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.440]   This is an image that is a blur image.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:22.440]   Then you can re-edit the amount of blur or what is selected at any time, but then it
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.200]   only saves out one.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:30.360]   So, let's say you wanted to do a progression of blur or two different types of blur.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.680]   It really only saves one image.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:35.640]   It doesn't clutter up your gallery with multiple images.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.440]   It does a good job.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:44.600]   What's interesting about it is really the HTC One only feels like it only has two planes.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.000]   This has kind of an infinite number of planes.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.800]   You see, the twin is out of focus here, but I could have made it in focus.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   So it's...
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.000]   Yeah, I think it does a nice job, maybe arguably better than the HTC.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.680]   You also get the photo...
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.320]   It's photosphere, right, Gina?
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.320]   Yes, yes.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:03.760]   You get photosphere and there's panorama mode with high resolution.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.200]   And it's just got a really nice kind of UI, kind of gets out of your way.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.880]   Of course, the UI, you have to swipe in from the left in order to see the different options,
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.920]   which took me a few times to figure out.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.920]   You had to show me.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.920]   I couldn't figure it out at all.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.920]   Yeah, you swipe in from the left.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.920]   You keep pressing the HDR button.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.920]   Yeah, the HDR button.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.400]   So yeah, they say it's an updated UI that gets out of your way.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.160]   It gets so out of your way that it's hard to find the setting once you get used to it.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.400]   Once you know about this wipe-in.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:34.240]   It works on phones and tablets running 4.4, so that's only KitKat.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.800]   That's a new feature.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.160]   He's taking a video and it is telling him to turn your camera into...
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.160]   Oh!
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.160]   That is...
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.160]   No more...
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.160]   Oh!
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.160]   Oh!
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.160]   Oh!
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.160]   That's good.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.720]   It lets you do it, but it's kind of like a subtle reminder.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.320]   It says you don't have any taste.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.320]   Exactly.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.320]   Wow.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.320]   And there's some UI subtleties where if, you know, after you finish taking a photo, instead
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:02.720]   of it going down to a corner in a little sort of, you know, your recording, there you go,
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.960]   it swipes off to the side and it kind of pops in just like that.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.960]   It's just like that.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:07.960]   It's okay.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:08.960]   Here I am.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.800]   It's kind of a subtle reminder that you can swipe over at any time to get to your gallery.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:19.640]   So in the video, it's kind of a limited feature set, but you know...
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.000]   It's actually kind of nice that it's not so many.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.840]   It's a pretty short list.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.800]   The Google with the research blog did this great post about how they implemented LensBlur
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:33.720]   and how they're basically estimated 3D maps of the objects in your photos to figure out
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.720]   where the lines are.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.720]   Pretty cool.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.240]   And I have to say, compared to some of the photos that I took with the MA and used the
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:42.320]   HTC Change Focus app, these seem to be better.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.920]   At least just as good.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.800]   You can see like in that picture up that's up on screen, like the edge of her hair, which
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:53.560]   is in the foreground, and then that is really kind of clean and nice and looks more, I think,
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.040]   what you get out of an SLR.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.160]   So they did a really nice job with this.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.160]   I'm sad that it's kick-capped on this one.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.380]   Because it has more data, you know, you're not just taking two photos, you're taking a
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.380]   swing.
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.880]   Is that giving it more data to really get more of the shape?
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.920]   Yeah, to estimate where things are.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.920]   I think because you move your camera so that the camera can figure out what's far and what's
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.080]   near based on what pixels move the most.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.000]   This is my very, my laywoman's view.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   But that's why you have to do that, that quick move of the camera.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   What else?
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Why that?
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   You don't have it, it isn't sure.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.080]   Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.080]   What else?
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.320]   For Android, another huge app dropped, the Promoting app.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:40.560]   This is the Chrome Remote Desktop app, which is now available for Android, which lets you
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:44.240]   access your Chrome desktop from any Android device.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:48.480]   So this was available for Chrome, so you could from Chrome control another Chrome device,
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.960]   but now this is now available for Android.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:55.200]   So you download the app, the Android app, which is now in the Play Store, and you can
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.880]   do remote assistance for another user, or you can access your own Chrome desktop.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.520]   And I set this up just before the show.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.720]   So you need the Android app, you need a Chrome extension, then you have to install Chrome
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.320]   Remote Desktop host software, you have to set up a PIN number.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.040]   I mean, of course, there's a ton of security issues around, around remote access on your
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.040]   phone.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:19.320]   But once you've got it all working, it shows up on your Android device as a remote desktop
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.880]   that you can control.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.040]   You move your finger around and that's the mouse.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.800]   You can make the keyboard appear.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:31.280]   It's a really nice remote desktop app, also free.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:37.720]   And then finally, Gmail got a new button, an insert photo button.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.560]   And this is in the web interface of Gmail.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:44.920]   So if you click on the insert photo button in your compose box, you will get to choose
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:50.400]   between all the photos in your Google+ account, which if you have auto backup enabled, which
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.880]   I do and I totally, highly recommend, it's basically all the photos that are on your
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.880]   phone.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.880]   It's really nice.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.360]   You can insert an individual photo, you can insert an entire album, and in the compose
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:04.400]   window, you can resize the image, which is really nice because we all know what that's
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:12.040]   like to get an email from someone with a giant image that's the wrong orientation.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.080]   So look for that in your Gmail compose window on the web now.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.320]   It's just an insert photo button down on the toolbar on the bottom.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.320]   That's all I got.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.600]   And that's your change log.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:27.720]   Gina, Japani, I'm going to play with the M8 camera comparing it to the Google camera.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.680]   Please, you have the choice.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:30.680]   Do a face off.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:34.040]   The nice thing about the M8 cameras, you just take the picture and the data is there.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.160]   Keep the original and you have the refocused.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.160]   But I think you're right.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.240]   I think the Google camera does a better job.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.800]   And with the Google camera, I definitely move the phone up because it says move your phone
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.080]   up and I said, oh, too fast, too slow, not enough angle.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.880]   And you don't get any of that from the M8.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.880]   Right?
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:51.880]   The M8 just take the regular picture.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.000]   How pissed is HTC right now?
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.240]   I don't think they're pissed.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.560]   This was a feature that was in Nokia's Windows phones before HTC did it.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.400]   I don't think they're pissed.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.760]   I think that just, you know, there's other stuff that there's no slow motion video.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.600]   I think everybody knows, right?
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.040]   That Google is going to slowly make all the apps that are part of the Google services
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:17.880]   module part of the place.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.360]   If HTC had known this feature was in the works, would they have added in that extra
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:27.200]   hardware and the fact that the cost and the profitability of that device?
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.880]   They could have invested in something else or made it cheaper.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.440]   I'd be pissed by RHDC.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.280]   I'd say, come see what kind of part are you?
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.280]   Maybe.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.280]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.240]   They can say like, hey, this phone takes better pictures.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.400]   Look, there's two cameras.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.400]   How could they not be better?
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.400]   Right.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.400]   I mean, it's like, it's sort of markets itself.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.400]   Right.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.400]   I don't know.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.400]   And it's easier.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.400]   It's easier just to snap and that's done.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.400]   Yes.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.400]   And it has other features.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.320]   It has this like 3D feature that if you take, when you take a photo, you can go into this
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.320]   like 3D mode.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.560]   I think that's what it's called.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.520]   And as you tilt your device, you can kind of see around the subject.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.800]   It's kind of empty, I think.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   There's a bunch more.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.800]   No, there is a bunch more.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.960]   I like, I'm still happy with the M8.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.320]   I mean, who knows how many they're going to sell and whether it's going to save HTC
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.320]   anyway.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.320]   But I'm also glad that Google's really now that what they've released, the keyboard,
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:24.320]   they've released the launcher, they released the camera, they've released the calendar.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.120]   That was the first thing they did.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.120]   Gmail, right?
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.120]   That was awesome.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.120]   Gmail.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.400]   So if you're an Amazon...
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.400]   Chrome, obviously.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:40.960]   Well, no, I don't think it helps you on Amazon because Amazon has only what's in the Amazon
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.120]   store and I bet you they don't put these things in the Amazon store.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.080]   Plus you need, as Gina said, you need a very recent version of Amazon.
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.080]   That's true.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.080]   And the now launcher.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.080]   Yeah, I mentioned the launcher.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.080]   Yeah, Leo said that.
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.200]   Well, photos, I guess, ships with...
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.360]   Photos is new, yeah.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.360]   Although all my friends...
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.320]   Hangouts, which is taking over SMS.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.320]   Mm-hmm.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.320]   That's a lot.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.320]   It's an interesting shift in this strategy.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.840]   I don't have to worry about any of that.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.200]   Because you have a Windows phone.
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   It's all just here.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.200]   No.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.200]   Because you have a Nexus phone.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.200]   I have a Blackberry.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.200]   I have a Nexus.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:23.160]   It is kind of amazing how many of my apps are Google apps.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:26.000]   Some of the iPhone people use Google apps.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.800]   It's Google Plus.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.840]   It's got it going on.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:36.000]   They did change their privacy policy on Gmail to show a little bit more clearly what they
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.480]   were up to in scanning mail earlier today on Windows Weekly.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.480]   Yeah, I mean, it's silly.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.480]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.480]   It's just more of an admission that they're doing it.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.720]   It was a clarification, right?
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.720]   I mean...
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:47.720]   Which they should have done ages ago.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.720]   Yes.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.720]   The clearer they...
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.320]   I'm actually going to speak to the privacy group at Google in a few weeks.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:56.520]   And that's going to be my point is they've got to be the absolute best to breed about
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.520]   transparency.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:07.480]   Because if it's an explicit deal with your users, then everybody says, "Okay, I know what
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.480]   they're...
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.480]   I'm giving up.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.480]   This is what I..."
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.240]   They've complained some died down, except for these crackpots who were suing them as
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.720]   if they didn't know what was going on.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.280]   Paul Thorett pointed this out.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.800]   A, he declared victory for the Scrugold campaign.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.880]   I don't know if that's fair.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.480]   But he said, "See Microsoft forced Google to change your privacy."
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.240]   No, the suit.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.400]   And then I think the lawsuits.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.080]   And Paul mentioned that as well, the lawsuits as well.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.880]   So what does the new privacy policy say?
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:32.880]   What is...
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:36.680]   Let me get the actual language if I can find it here.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:41.200]   They basically admit that they're scanning your mail for advertising.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.440]   Which we've all known.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:48.160]   I mean, anyone who's given any thought about this at all, whatsoever knows this, right?
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.160]   Yeah, let's see what...
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.000]   Google does scan all emails.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.160]   Shock!
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:56.800]   Here's the...
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.960]   We want our policies to be simple and easy for users to understand.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:04.160]   These changes will give people even greater clarity and are based on feedback we've received
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.760]   over the last few months.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.760]   Our...
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.200]   Here's the new term of service.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.200]   Our audio...
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.200]   Sorry.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.400]   Our automated systems analyze your content, including email.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.320]   Actually, that's important.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:21.840]   But including can also be not limited to.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.840]   So they analyze your content.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.840]   Is that your Google Docs?
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.840]   Does that mean your Docs?
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.880]   That's a good question.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:34.580]   Our automated systems analyze your content, including emails, to provide you personally
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:43.840]   relevant product features such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.560]   spam and malware detection.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:52.200]   This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it's stored.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.840]   So it's almost like they're scanning all the time.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.200]   Well, it's certainly...
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.200]   It's not just for ads.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.000]   It's for example, for malware and viruses and such.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.520]   They're scanning that and your Docs, yeah, certainly they are.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.080]   They say so.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:11.000]   So this is an Uber scanning statement now.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.200]   But the problem is by adding, by telling more, they told less.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.440]   This hasn't been in their terms of, sir.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.760]   I don't understand.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.600]   They'd never spelled this out before.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.600]   This is not news.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.600]   This had to have.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.600]   None of this.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.600]   They had to have, right?
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.400]   Maybe this is just clarity or...
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.040]   We have them before and after?
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.040]   I don't.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.040]   Well, that's the key.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.040]   Listen, this is a statement.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.040]   This statement may not be that different from what it was before.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.600]   Well, this is, yeah, this is the new statement.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:43.240]   The lawsuits are, since...
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.720]   Because there are rules about privacy.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.440]   For instance, FERPA, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.560]   I'm sure, Jeff, you've come across FERPA because it's quoted all the time when I say, "Can
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.480]   I see my daughter's grades?"
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.200]   They say, "No."
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.400]   You may be paying for it, Dad, but FERPA protects her privacy.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.520]   And FERPA are the enemies of parenting among many.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:07.280]   Yeah, and they invoke FERPA a lot.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.280]   So if you...
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:17.200]   But Google knows my daughter's grades, I guess is the lawsuit.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:20.440]   You know, I don't think that equates to the same thing as a human being reading it.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.480]   Let me see if I can find...
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.480]   I don't know if I can find it.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.480]   It certainly does.
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:29.440]   Well, and for that matter, your ISP knows it and passes through.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:33.160]   It's stored somewhere.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.800]   That's an antiquated concept.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:41.320]   Well, and Microsoft is scanning that content not for ads, but for spam.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:44.680]   Any fact, anybody who fights spam is doing exactly the same scanning.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:49.320]   They're just using it for a different purpose or a more restricted purpose.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.680]   I just posted the diff in the chat.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.880]   Oh, you are good.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.040]   Did you run a diff?
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.040]   Well, no.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.040]   No, they run a diff.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.800]   Do their credit.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:00.800]   Wow.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.880]   That is fast work.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.320]   They fired up said, awk, and grep and difted.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:14.320]   No, they actually, they post a GitHub style, you know, a different color.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.320]   Wow.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.320]   Good for them.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.160]   And so if you scroll down, you can see the new...
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.160]   Okay.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.160]   So let me read it.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.160]   That sounds insane.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.760]   Yeah, the green is new and obviously the red is...
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.880]   The red is crossed out.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.920]   So when you upload or otherwise is cut out, submit.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.440]   Da da da da da da.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.280]   You know, they added this green graph.
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:37.280]   Oh, it's hard to believe that wasn't there.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:45.720]   Apparently they did not explicitly say, although they say it elsewhere.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.480]   It may not have been in the terms of service, but Google has never made a secret that they
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:55.640]   can mail for advertising purposes.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.960]   So that maybe just wasn't in the TOS.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.960]   No.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:01.960]   Thank you for the diff.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:02.960]   No, sure.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:03.960]   Anytime.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.960]   Dif it up.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.960]   Dif it up.
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:10.960]   Google now is going to let you know when you... where you parked.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:11.960]   That's cool.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.520]   This is awesome.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.800]   This is purportedly, reportedly, purportedly.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.800]   This hasn't happened yet.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.200]   Aw, that's going to be cool.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:23.560]   But Google now is going to guess when you've stopped driving parked in a car and gotten
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:24.560]   out of your car.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.560]   It's easy.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.240]   And then pins where you left your car.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.760]   This is the last place we saw you after you stopped driving.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.880]   There's all kinds of data around this that's useful.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:39.680]   I want to see on ways which gas stations people stop that most, because that's going to tell
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:40.880]   you where the cheapest gas is.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.920]   Well, they even know the prices, but you're right.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:43.920]   That would be even another...
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.920]   You do?
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:45.920]   How do they know the price?
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.680]   Because the gas stations post them.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.680]   So this is an app.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.240]   In fact, I reviewed it yesterday and before you buy.
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:55.960]   It's a little dongle you put on your OBD2 port on your car.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.280]   And then it Bluetooth to your phone as you drive.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:03.480]   And so it knows all sorts of things about your driving, including nearby gas.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.560]   And then it loads in the prices.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:11.360]   So it sorts it by price based on gas stations must be posting this information somehow.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.520]   I have no idea.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.480]   But this also remembers where you parked because it, you know, when you get in the car and
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.520]   start driving, it goes, "Good morning.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.240]   Dash is recording your trip."
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:23.360]   And then when you end, it's like, "Dash is stopped recording your trip."
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.360]   And then...
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.360]   That's in the APIs for Android, right?
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.960]   It'll tell you when you're driving, when you're walking, when you're biking.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.760]   It'll sense the speed, I guess, which you're going.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.360]   See, I know where I've parked.
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.360]   The kind of movements.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:36.360]   Right.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.920]   Now, you know, I mean, I know it's in a parking garage.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.640]   So it's roughly there.
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:44.680]   I mean, I guess I could get close enough that I could beep the horn with my keys.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.920]   But that's pretty cool.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.920]   And that's built in.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:52.320]   You see, I can even press the navigate button and it'll walk me to my car using ways or
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.320]   maps.
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.320]   Oh.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.320]   Nice.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.640]   So that's just an app.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.960]   I think now should absolutely do this.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.800]   And I can't imagine why they wouldn't.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:08.280]   Except for all those people who are creeped out by Google knowing anything about them.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.280]   This is the thing.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.280]   I want to see people's faces.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.280]   It's like, "I was like, here's your car."
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.720]   Google, "Where your car is."
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.040]   Let me take you back to your car.
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.520]   This is the beginning of a service in which Google rents out your car while you're not
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.520]   there.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.480]   And they'll just leave the cash on the dash.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:30.160]   And where you can get delivery made to your car and Google can unlock the car for you.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.160]   Perfect.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.160]   Just put it in the trunk.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.160]   Google.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:35.800]   And I say, "Okay, Google, please gas up my car."
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:36.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:41.040]   I love it.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.520]   So I don't know.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.240]   There was a story last week that Facebook was considering buying this company Titan Aerospace
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:52.920]   because they were going to remember that Facebook wanted to do internet via drones.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.880]   It's like a battle of the loony ideas.
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:50:00.680]   And I use the word loom intentionally because that's what Google wants to do balloons.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.000]   So Zuckerberg says, "You got balloons.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   I got drones."
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.600]   Well, then Google buys Titan Aerospace.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:09.560]   It says, "No, you don't."
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:12.200]   This is what happens when people have too much money.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.600]   So these things can stay in the air for three years.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:16.600]   Yeah, booby.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:18.600]   Crazy.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.600]   Is it better than balloons?
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.160]   I don't know.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:24.560]   Jet-sized drones that are intended to fly nonstop for years.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:29.760]   Actually, Google wants to use them for satellites, for street view, for maps.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.760]   I see more uses for Google than Facebook.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.400]   Facebook just says they want access.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.320]   Google has maps and all this other data that is--
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:40.680]   Well, Facebook was going to use it for that nonprofit internet.org idea to give the internet
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.560]   to everybody kind of thing.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.720]   Titan would work closely with Project Loon.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:50.560]   Anyway, Google's going to take over the airspace.
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.360]   Then see the howls.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.360]   Solar powered aircraft.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.600]   Well, then we get to my German friends in a few minutes.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.360]   We'll get to that, yes.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.840]   The howls have already started.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.840]   Howls.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.840]   It's a howl.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.240]   Let's take a break.
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.360]   Then we'll get to your German friends.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:07.360]   How about that?
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.480]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:13.480]   Not a law firm, but folks, if you want to start up your business.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.640]   Now's the time to do it with LegalZoom.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:20.840]   LegalZoom provides a great solution, works with your tight schedule and your finances.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.320]   The legal system is complicated.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.320]   The last thing you want to do--
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.640]   Trust me-- is spend a lot of time meeting with lawyers.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:31.680]   I can just feel the clock ticking when I get three or four lawyers in a room and I go,
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.000]   you're 185 an hour.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.320]   You're 185 an hour.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.080]   You're 250 an hour and you're 450 an hour.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:41.920]   This is costing me thousands of dollars an hour to sit here talking with you.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.680]   Not LegalZoom.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.680]   LegalZoom is not a law firm.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:48.960]   They can help you get the legal work done by walking you through the forms--
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:53.560]   LLC or trademark or will, chapter S or C Corp, Living Trust.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.320]   They get the job done right.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:52:00.280]   I can tell you that because almost exactly eight years ago, I started this little company
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.840]   here called Twit, filling out the forms online.
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.080]   Didn't use a law firm.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.080]   Used LegalZoom.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:08.360]   It was 99 bucks.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.360]   Still is.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.080]   $99.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:14.840]   LegalZoom has been helping families and small business owners for 14 years now.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.600]   Just got an A+ from the Better Business Bureau.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:17.600]   They're good.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.320]   I give them an A+ too.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.760]   Call or visit LegalZoom today.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:24.920]   LegalZoom provides legal help through independent attorneys and self-help services.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:29.520]   It's not a law firm, but it helps you get the stuff you need done quickly, effectively.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.520]   But yes, it is effective.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:35.960]   We are still using those same legal documents I created eight years ago all by myself.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.480]   LegalZoom.com, use the offer code Twig.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.760]   You'll get $10 off at checkout.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.760]   They'll know you heard about it on this week in google.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:49.120]   LegalZoom.com, use the offer code Twig.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:50.520]   All those Germans.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:53.040]   They've done it again.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.560]   All those Germans.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.560]   They're crazy.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:53:01.720]   So I woke up this morning and I got texts and emails looking at drivers.
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.720]   You have to see this.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.720]   You have to see this.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.720]   People are not just meeting you, Jeff.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.720]   You understand that.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.720]   That's fine.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.720]   I enjoyed the herring in my mouth.
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:13.360]   The hook wasn't feeling so good, but that's fine.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:17.120]   So including, by the way, Volus Gloza and the Google people leave me out to me.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:23.640]   So Matthias Dippfner, who is the head of actual Springer, which is a gigantic media powerhouse
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:29.400]   in Germany, it owns, built the largest paper in Germany, which I described today and pardon
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:33.440]   me for the sexist, Demolontandra here, but I enjoyed it.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.880]   Built is basically Fox News with boobs.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.920]   As if Fox was going to ask boobs, you see who gets it.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.600]   Apologize for the sexist language, but I enjoyed the joke.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:44.720]   I don't even understand it because Fox News, well, never mind.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.920]   There's plenty of boobs on Fox News, frankly.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:47.920]   Exactly.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:48.920]   That's the joke.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:49.920]   That's the joke.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.920]   But the only difference is in built, they're naked.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.920]   Oh, that kind of.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   You got it.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.920]   Ah, yes.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.920]   Sorry.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.920]   Okay.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:58.920]   Well, never mind.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.400]   So this guy went off on a huge attack on Google and Eric Schmidt.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:07.200]   This was because Eric wrote a piece in the same paper the week before, which he said Eric
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.200]   Schmidt, he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:13.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:21.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:39.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:44.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:47.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:50.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:56.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.200]   And he said, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:06.200]   He compares Google, of course.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:11.200]   He says, "The agreement with the EU, which allows competitors to advertise on Google in guaranteed ways, at guaranteed prices or price structures.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:17.200]   He calls this protection money like the mafia, as if the New York Times would really allow the Wall Street Journal to advertise inside it.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:20.200]   Certainly, the Wall Street Journal would not allow the New York Times to advertise.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:26.200]   Then he says that Mark Zuckerberg's view on privacy would come from the head of the Stasi, if I find a fence on it.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.200]   These German secret police.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:35.200]   Then he says that Google, "Sits on the entire privacy of mankind like the giant Fafner in the ring of the Dibelung."
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:36.200]   How's that for a German insult?
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:42.200]   Well, I can tell you right now, you're not going to hear that kind of literary reference in American parliament.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.200]   No, you're not. Fafner.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:47.200]   And then he says, "Forget big brother, Google is better."
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:54.200]   So he complains about all kinds of things, including the fact that Google's self-driving cars will compete with Volkswagen and Nest going into homes.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.200]   I got a Google Fafner.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:59.200]   I tried to understand it.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.200]   I tried to go through the plot.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.200]   It was like trying to game a throne.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:09.200]   Fafner was the son of a dwarf king, Hredemar, and the brother of Regan and Other.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.200]   He became a dragon and was slared by Sigurd.
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:17.200]   But before he was a dragon, he was a dwarf with powerful arms and a fearless soul.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.200]   And before he was a dwarf, he was a giant.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:22.200]   Well, basically, Wagner is going on here.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:26.200]   I have no idea what's going on here.
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:31.200]   Apparently, he'd sit on his golden horde like a dragon is wants to do.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:43.200]   So that's where he goes on and says that he frets about Google planning buying drone companies and planning huge ships and floating offices, operating stateless in the waters around the world.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:44.200]   Oh, come on.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:49.200]   And when needn't be a conspiracy theorist, he says to find this disturbing.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:55.200]   So the bottom line is he's trying to egg the EU into pushing Google farther.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.200]   He makes some really ridiculous proposals that he knows are ridiculous.
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.200]   He's a very smart guy, Dufthur.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:11.200]   And he says that Google should erase all cookies immediately after a session and hold no IP, which would mean that it couldn't do any ad targeting.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:14.200]   He says that Google should make transparent.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:18.200]   All of the qualitative data behind its algorithm, which of course would make it game and worthless.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:25.200]   He says that we shouldn't be paying for things with our behavioral data anymore only with money, which of course is a publishers old model.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.200]   And so the bottom line is it's just absolutely ridiculous.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:31.200]   So it's spreading like wildfire around the German world.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:36.200]   And I may have just put the entire audience to sleep with this and I apologize for that.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:44.200]   But I just find it amazing that the Google hatred that exists in a different way from San Francisco in Germany just keeps going on.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:52.200]   And it's a cynical act by an old dinosaur who hasn't figured out the net, who just tries to demonize his competitor for being successful.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.200]   Thank you for that moment.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:58:06.200]   Meanwhile, Google's first quarter earnings are in and missed analyst expectations but did have $15.4 billion in revenue.
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:10.200]   So Fafner's got some gold to sit on.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:19.200]   19% revenue growth year over year earnings per share of $6.27.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:22.200]   That is lower than the analyst estimate.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:28.200]   And you know how important it is to reach the analyst's analyst estimate of $6.42 a share.
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:29.200]   Here's the scary part.
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:35.200]   The volume of ads was up 26%, but the yield, the price down 9% because of mobile.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.200]   Ooh, interesting.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:39.200]   That's an extraable slide.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.200]   I got across the board too, right?
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:43.200]   Yahoo and Facebook as well.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.200]   That's a big deal in numbers.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:49.200]   The only English translation of this letter is "Kursu Google Translate."
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:51.200]   Is that true?
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:56.200]   And that's just, I'm Gobs.
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:01.200]   Well, my translation varies a little bit from, but I wouldn't dare to say huge.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:11.200]   I think your chairman's probably better than Google Translate.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:17.200]   One of the things I didn't know was that you can now users can improve Google Translate
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.200]   and correct it, which I was surprised they didn't that ages ago.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:21.200]   It's pretty good.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:24.200]   It gives you the sense, awkward grammar.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:28.200]   Things will always confuse it and genders confuse the heck out of it.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:29.200]   Right.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:37.200]   And capitalized German nouns confuse it greatly because it can't tell names as easily.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:40.200]   So there's some stuff it'll always be weak on, but it's pretty darn good.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:45.200]   I mean, and I can go to something in a language I don't speak at all and get a sense.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.200]   Thanks to it.
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:53.200]   Google made enough money that it can turn down government military funding from DARPA for
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:57.200]   its new robotics contest.
[00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:59.200]   Well, I also did that as a matter of principle.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.200]   I fake it.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.200]   I hope so.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:08.200]   Well, it also PR to say that with the owning robots and drones now and given the NSA,
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.200]   Google's got to stay as far away from government as it can.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:15.200]   These are the DARPA Robotics Challenge trials.
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.200]   They were in December.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:20.200]   The Google scored the most points.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.200]   Actually, Google's new robotics firm, Shaft.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.200]   Shaft your mouth.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.200]   I'm talking about Shaft.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:34.200]   Didn't go out of their way when the military was testing glass, didn't go out of their
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.200]   way to say they're just like any other explorer.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.200]   They bought it from us.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.200]   We didn't enable this.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.200]   It's a sensitive thing.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:46.200]   And some circles, and it doesn't bother me that they would be involved in military research.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.200]   Well, the net came from DARPA.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.200]   Right.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.200]   DARPA.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:01:00.200]   This is a two-legged robot that the Japanese Shaft team created that won the DARPA Robotics
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:06.200]   Challenge trials, scoring the most points across tasks that tested mobility, dexterity, perception,
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.200]   and autonomous operations.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.200]   That's the one that always scares me.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.200]   I imagine Mark Penn now creating the ad campaign, "Don't get shafted."
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.200]   You know, really.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.200]   Okay, this is like wearing glass in the mission district.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.200]   Google, do you really have to make autonomous two-legged robots?
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.200]   Do you really have to be doing that?
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.200]   It'd be a little circumspect here.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.200]   No, okay.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.200]   But here's the thing.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:37.200]   So, I was reading this stuff about the -- and I'm jumping around the rundown -- but another
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.200]   patent for Contact Wends is the back-of-camera.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.200]   Oh, my God, that you don't know what to do.
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.200]   No, but that's cool.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.200]   Well, okay.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.200]   Oh, all right.
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.200]   So, you can't even see it's a camera.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.200]   That's cool.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.200]   Oh, that's where this goes.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.200]   Interesting.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.200]   Very interesting.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:54.200]   I don't -- the only reason I like glasses is because it looks dorky and it's clunky.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.200]   Now we go back to the --
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.200]   You see a headache.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.200]   If you want to just wear it on time.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.200]   I've always said a heads-up display.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.200]   That's what I want.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.200]   So, the spy cameras are fine.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:03.200]   Okay.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:09.200]   Now we're going to go back to our comic book days, Leo, and their x-ray too.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:15.200]   So, but here's the neat thing about it in the write-up is that it imagined, you know, the self-driving
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:22.200]   human, the blind person who can now get connected to data and say you're at the -- you're at
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.200]   the sidewalk, the lights red.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:30.560]   I mean, all these things that could happen could be phenomenal.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:38.800]   And Google is testing away to match users, search users to their purchases at stores.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.800]   That's what we'll bring people out to.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.800]   This is going to piss people off.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.800]   It's anonymous.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:48.960]   Six advertisers, they're helping six advertisers as a pilot program to match the anonymous tracking
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.800]   cookies on users' computers to in-store sales information.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.800]   How could they possibly --
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:54.800]   I don't know.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.800]   It's anonymous.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.800]   How could they?
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:57.800]   Hmm.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:58.800]   Hmm.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.800]   Does it -- does it explain it, Ricky?
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:03.800]   Hmm.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.800]   It involves ad words.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.800]   Google gets played when users click on an ad visit the advertiser's website.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:13.800]   It's blah, blah, blah.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.800]   That's the holy grail.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.800]   So, yes.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.800]   Wow.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.800]   That's a $200 billion nut, according to Google ad executive Neil Mohan.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:29.800]   The $200 billion nut that's sitting out there basically ready to come into the digital sphere.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:32.800]   He's not a word, Smith.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:39.800]   It doesn't say exactly how they do this, but so much for anonymized cookies.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.480]   So, I'm signed into Google.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.160]   I get an ad for Michael's craft store.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.800]   I click on Easter baskets.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:48.800]   Yes.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:49.800]   I look at them.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.800]   Yes.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.840]   And then later that week, I walk into a Michael's and I'm signed into Android with the same
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.840]   account.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:56.840]   I was signed into call.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:57.840]   Oh, that's how.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.840]   Bingo.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.760]   And then what happens?
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.760]   Do I get a notification?
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.760]   Oh, hey, the thing you're looking at is on sale.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:05.760]   No.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.760]   Just Google get a pen.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.760]   You don't get Google sets of pen.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.760]   Google gets a pen.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.760]   Michael's gets a pen.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.760]   And Michael's gets a pen.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:16.760]   And Google says, "Sha-chang, because I got a pen."
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:22.360]   I saw a company this week at Greatcroft called No-Me, N-O-M-I, and they have beacons and
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.360]   stores.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.040]   And so, the first level of this is so they can just track traffic and find out how long
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.760]   people spend things and so on and so forth.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.760]   But then they just recently bought another company that does tie to unique IDs.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:33.760]   Wow.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.240]   And that's the holy grail in a whole kind of way.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.160]   Because then if you go to showrooming, I go after them.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.600]   I see if you're in showrooming mode.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.760]   The presumption is if I walked in the store, look at the thing left.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.760]   Yeah, because it can't tell if you bought it.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.760]   It can only tell you showed up.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.080]   Now you do the reverse too, Leo.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:52.440]   You go into the store, you look at the item, then you go home online and buy it online.
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.240]   Now that gives the opportunity to give the store some level for credit for being part
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.240]   of that sale.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.920]   And stores become marketing space.
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:00.920]   That's so, so, so.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:01.920]   Oh, so if you go both ways.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.920]   What you just announced.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:03.920]   Go both ways.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:04.920]   Yes.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:09.080]   So here's the ARPA, the shaft vehicle.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:14.320]   This is autonomous driving.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.840]   And this is the two-legged robot.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.600]   And this is not good.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.760]   This is very good.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.240]   Oh, you're wide, wide, wide, hot.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.200]   The terminator is just around the corner.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.760]   I swear to God.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.760]   We'll see one of those.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.760]   God, look at that.
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.760]   It's climbing up a ladder.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:29.760]   Wow.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.760]   You can't even run away upstairs.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.920]   I think this looks top heavy too.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:35.400]   I know those legs are working well.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.400]   It's building a house.
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.400]   Oh, no.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.560]   They made it the shape of a cat.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.560]   No one will complain.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.560]   Yeah, this is search and rescue.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.960]   Even stuff out of the way.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.960]   Wow.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.960]   Jesus.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.960]   Ha ha ha.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:56.240]   Friends, what you're now watching is the beginning of the end of the human species.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.680]   Oh, sure.
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:02.520]   It starts by cutting a small hole in drywall.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:10.000]   Oh, that was a whiteboard.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.240]   This is, these are all, there's like 31 tasks.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.240]   These are all the tasks.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:15.480]   Is that jazz music or their music?
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.800]   I think it's their music.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.800]   The thing that, that's their music.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:25.400]   And by the way, I think that is, if I'm not mistaken, Wagner's rings.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.400]   So it's all true.
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.400]   It's far full.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.400]   Shoo chuffed.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:32.040]   Sitting on his shaft.
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:36.960]   I don't want to see that coming towards me in a dark alley.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.000]   Geez, Louise.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.880]   There's a reason apparently, apparently just blew everybody away at the DARPA challenge.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:47.920]   People could not believe one robot did all this.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.920]   Geez.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.520]   But notice it is tethered.
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.520]   Well, batteries.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:58.840]   I think it's called, yeah, it's what you need.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.400]   When it does become sentient, we can at least harness it back.
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:05.240]   That's what the tether is about.
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.400]   Wait, we had, who do we have on?
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.640]   They look like the aliens from district nine.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.600]   Yeah, yeah, they do, don't they?
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:17.000]   When they're allowed to contribute to presidential campaigns, then we know our government.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.600]   That's just, that's, that's a given.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.840]   Um, robots are human.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.240]   Who are we talking to?
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:30.480]   Oh, it was Jeff Hawkins who founded Palm and then, and now is doing, you know, thinking
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.480]   machines.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.960]   He said, it's all fine.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.960]   It's not a big deal.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.240]   Our official intelligence is fine.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:38.760]   You just can't let them replicate.
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:39.760]   Just keep that long.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:40.760]   Oh, that's all.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:41.760]   Just, yeah.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.760]   Just as long as they can reproduce.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.440]   He said, if they can reproduce, it's over.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:49.240]   That's really not comforting in any way at all.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.240]   That's just...
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.760]   Did he really say he was serious?
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:52.760]   Yes.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:56.400]   I mean, just don't give them water after midnight.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.000]   It, it, everything else will be fine.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.240]   We've seen this movie.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:05.400]   Just whatever you do, don't let them replicate.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.120]   I'm just going to go home and watch that.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.520]   Good thing robots can't manufacture more robots.
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:13.520]   Right.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.520]   Because if they could, it's over.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.520]   Then you're dead.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.520]   You might as well go home.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:28.520]   Amazon's App Store has 200,000 apps on it now, by the way.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:36.040]   This week in fear and loathing.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:39.560]   Why do they remove a video calling from Glass because nobody used it?
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:43.040]   I think the experience just wasn't that good.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.040]   And so here we go.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.200]   Not a lot of people used it.
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.120]   And they, yeah, they took it out.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.120]   This is where I am at a disadvantage.
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.120]   Take that.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:55.400]   Because I don't, I never did it, so I don't know.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:59.840]   The other part, the other issue was in terms of just calling it a contact, you had a list
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.120]   of 10 contacts and that was it.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.120]   Oh.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.120]   It just wasn't a great experience.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.360]   I think they pulled it because people weren't using it.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:10.400]   I don't know.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.720]   Maybe it'll come back.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:15.240]   I bookmarked this because I just thought this was so good and I don't know really there's
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:17.880]   much to say we're going to, this will be our last story then we'll get to our picks of
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.880]   the week.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.880]   Internet trolls really are horrible people.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.880]   Okay.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:33.840]   Science says new research conducted by Aaron Buckles of the University of Manitoba and
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:38.760]   two colleagues sought to investigate whether people who engage in internet trolling are
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:45.320]   characterized by personality traits that fall in the so-called dark tetrad.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:51.400]   Machiavellianism, psychopathy, sadism and narcissism.
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:55.120]   Turns out not so narcissistic but really sadistic.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:02.480]   What they did is they pulled, they surveyed these people and asked if they enjoyed what
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:10.240]   they enjoyed most when online comment sites, when on online comment sites, debating issues
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:14.560]   that are important to you, chatting with others, making new friends, trolling others and other.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:23.040]   And among the people who said they enjoyed trolling, it was a small number, only 5.6%.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:32.640]   They really had personality traits for sadism particularly.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.200]   You can read the study.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:36.920]   That's why you don't feed the trolls.
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:38.520]   You don't feed the trolls.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:45.280]   Both trolls and sadists, they wrote, feel sadistic glee at the distress of others.
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:52.480]   Sadists just want to have fun and the internet is their playground.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:58.320]   So I'm working on some curriculum, which I'll not talk about today, but talk about another
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.720]   time involved with engagement and journalism.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:06.160]   And I had the great delight of including in the required reading, if I may use this
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:09.040]   word, assholes a theory.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.200]   That's a scholarly paper.
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.200]   It's a book.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.840]   It's a very good book.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.840]   It's a book.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.840]   And what is the theory of assholes?
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.280]   Just kind of why they do what they do.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.920]   Well, let's just get fits right in, I'm sure.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:23.920]   It does.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.320]   If you're going to deal with the public, you have to know this stuff now.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:32.720]   Because the behaviors are, this is the conclusion of the conclusion of the study.
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:37.600]   Because these behaviors are intrinsically motivating for sadists, comment moderators
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:42.840]   will likely have a difficult time curbing trolling with punishments.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.600]   For example, banning users.
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:49.840]   Ultimately, the allure of trolling may be too strong for sadists who presumably have
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:56.800]   limited opportunities to express their sadistic interests in a socially desirable manner.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.360]   I mean, a state isn't ever socially desirable.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.760]   No, no, but you couldn't do it before.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:02.760]   Acceptable.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.200]   You can't do in real life what you can do online.
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.880]   So now you can do it.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.880]   And it's drawing them in.
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:12.520]   Machiavellianism, a little bit.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:16.120]   Machiavellianism is the willingness to manipulate and deceive others.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:19.520]   Narcissism, not so much egotism and self obsession.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:21.840]   Psychopathy, the lack of remorse and empathy.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.960]   But the big one was the pleasure and the suffering of others.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.280]   That's really the...
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.080]   That's why if you are suffering at the hand of a troll, you do not let the troll know that
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.080]   that's a piece.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.080]   That's what they dig.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.080]   Exactly.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.720]   That's what they're going for.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.240]   And it also says that if you...
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:40.760]   And I was the big defender of comments early on in newspapers.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:45.640]   And I've said this on the show before where the first problem of comments is inherently
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:51.040]   insulting to the public to say, "We will allow you to comment afterward on with our work.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.040]   We should be more collaborative."
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:55.160]   But the other problem with comments is that it is just an open space.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.160]   It was true of forums before.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.520]   It was true of news net before.
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:05.320]   An open space, trolls will go and find it and find the opportunity to have this behavior
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:06.320]   there.
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.640]   And if it doesn't have a purpose, you're going to have this trouble.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.280]   See, and we've talked about this before as why I bring this up.
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:16.760]   And I was of the opinion that these are people who are seeking negative attention because
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.880]   they'd received this as children.
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.880]   And they misinterpreted his love.
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.200]   I was giving them a lot of benefit.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:25.240]   No, it turns out they're just cruel sons of bitches.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:32.720]   They're really, no, no, they're nasty people.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:38.640]   In their study, they found that only about 41% of internet users, actually 41% of internet
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:42.280]   users don't comment, don't engage online at all.
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:48.800]   Of the remaining, what is that, 59%, only 5.6% are trolls.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.320]   So it's a small, really, it's a few percentage points.
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.320]   It's maybe 100.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.320]   That's all you need.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.320]   That's all you need.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.320]   We know this.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:56.320]   We know that part.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:03.200]   But boy, those one or two percent are really effective because they just push those buttons.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:10.360]   They have a test they call GATE, the Global Assessment of Internet Trolling.
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:16.400]   And then they ask things on a scale of one to five, do you agree or disagree with this
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.400]   statement?
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.680]   I have sent people to shock websites for the lulls.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.600]   Anybody ever, anybody in the chat room?
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.880]   Have you ever sent people to shock websites for the lulls?
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.680]   I'm not talking Rick rolling.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.520]   I'm talking Goatsy, that kind of thing.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.520]   I like to troll people.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:34.080]   Well, somebody we know in respect, one's famously did that.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.080]   Who's that?
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:36.080]   Aneal.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.080]   Aneal?
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:38.080]   Aneal dad?
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:41.840]   He wore a Goatsy t-shirt that appeared, I believe, in the New York Times.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.760]   In the New York Times, yes, well.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:50.120]   And boy, that, and typical for a Neil, anything he does, even that, turned into an intellectual
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.120]   discussion.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.120]   Oh, of course.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:58.640]   Yes, but the New York Times photographs him with the t-shirt on not knowing what it was
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.640]   and published the photo.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.720]   I mean, that was the prank.
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:05.120]   It was a stylized, it was not clear.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:07.320]   It was, it was not the actual photo.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:11.480]   But then, surely, some people typed in the URL, right?
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.880]   Boy, that calls a discussion at the time.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:15.280]   Oh, my lord.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:19.520]   First time I did a live tweet, we did it at the Apple Store and somebody sat down in
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:25.080]   the audience and hijacked the Wi-Fi router so that all web searches went to Goatsy.
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.080]   Oh, geez.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.680]   And it was really interesting.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:31.080]   And if you don't know what Goatsy is, just ask your mom.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:37.960]   But it was really interesting because you could see the waves of horror and disgust
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:40.360]   propagate through the audience as people...
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.000]   I should laugh.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.280]   And then, but we found him because he's sitting there chortling.
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.760]   It was very easy to figure out who it was.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:52.640]   Well, I mean, aren't there whole blogs dedicated to taking a photograph of the moment a person
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.120]   sees, right?
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.200]   I mean...
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.440]   I like to troll...
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.440]   Truer Falls.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:01.640]   I like to troll people in forums or the comment sections of websites.
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.920]   Trolls, it turns out, are pretty forth.
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.280]   They say, "Yeah, I'm a troll."
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.560]   Yeah, I like to do that.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:09.440]   I enjoy griefing other players in multiplayer games.
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.520]   Here's one.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.600]   This one.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.600]   This one.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:18.280]   More beautiful and pure thing is the more satisfying it is to corrupt.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.280]   Right.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.920]   Think about Weave.
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.640]   Poor Weave.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:23.640]   He was a...
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.440]   Now, he's self-declared troll, right?
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:26.440]   He's off.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.440]   He got off, but on a technicality.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:33.640]   But he was the guy who was downloading email addresses of iPad users by discovering a
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.560]   flaw in the AT&T database website.
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:41.080]   I mean, he's also the guy that troll Kathy Sierra.
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.080]   Oh, he is.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.080]   I didn't know that.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.080]   And he was horrible.
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.080]   He was horrible to her.
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.080]   Yeah, horrible.
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:49.920]   And that's what that last sentence made me think of.
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.600]   The more, you know, the more beautiful and pure a thing is.
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.200]   So no wonder there's such mixed feelings about him getting off.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.040]   Now I understand.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:01.520]   He's self-proclaimed troll, and I guess he really, really is.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:04.840]   I don't want to make this a depressing show.
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:05.840]   Let me find something.
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:06.840]   All right, here's what I got.
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:07.840]   I got you.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:08.840]   I got you.
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:09.840]   Wonder about the comics.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:12.440]   Comics roast generic techies in SF.
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:16.640]   I can just read a couple of the gags there.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:17.640]   Okay.
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:20.720]   People were going to be involved, but they kind of didn't like the language about it about
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:25.320]   things like, you know, I don't know what the joke was, bring your vomit for the bus or
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.320]   something like that.
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:27.320]   God.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.200]   People isn't known for its sense of humor, at least not when it comes to tech backlash.
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:33.640]   This is from San Francisco Chronicles site, the SF gate.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:35.560]   That made the stand up comedy event on Saturday night.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.840]   The roast of a techie built complicated to execute.
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:46.680]   Your live Googler web developer Rico Rodriguez, not famous, sat on a stool on stage to be
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:49.000]   roasted by a group of comedians at a San Francisco bar.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   I guess the idea was, let's get it all out here.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   Here's a Googler.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   It's a funny idea.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   They should have done it.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.400]   Kevin Rose, they should have done it to him at least anyway.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.400]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:00.440]   And a Google acapella group had planned to perform, but when employees double checked
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:05.360]   with the company, organizers claim Google didn't take kindly to the language.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:11.840]   They didn't bring your best protest sandals and a carton of eggs at the flyer.
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:14.000]   They were concerned for the Googler's safety.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   You know what?
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   I like it.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   I agree.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.480]   And I like it that Rodriguez had a sense of humor.
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:21.280]   He said, all right, I'm going to try this.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:25.000]   It was just jokes.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.200]   It's like a roast.
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:29.720]   Most of the jokes were, you know, like below some of the jokes were tame.
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:35.040]   Do you ever stay awake at night thinking about the death of ask Jeeves?
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:44.880]   Your perfect 10 in binary.
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.480]   I think the Google bus is making a Darwinian U-turn.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:53.520]   I don't think we should be genetically selecting for ask burgers.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.040]   Okay.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.840]   I'm not trying to kick you guys off the bus.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:58.920]   I'm trying to get in the bus.
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:02.720]   It's nicer than my studio and has a better Wi-Fi connection.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.520]   That's probably true.
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:07.600]   So I think Rodriguez then had the best line of this.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:11.400]   The funny thing is I'm a front-end developer, which is the equivalent of a beautician.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.880]   I make buttons look pretty.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:13.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.480]   Making buttons look pretty for the sake of humanity.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.480]   Okay.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.680]   Well, it wasn't that funny.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:20.680]   Sorry.
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:28.280]   It beat Goatsy, but that's not my far.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.280]   Do you see the blood moon?
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:31.280]   No.
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.480]   I thought that was something I'm going to throw.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.640]   Lunar Eclipse a couple of nights ago.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:38.840]   Blood Red Moon.
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.840]   And it was.
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:40.840]   It was right after Game of Thrones.
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:42.840]   So I ask you.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:43.840]   Oh, coincidence.
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:44.840]   A coincidence.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:45.840]   I think not.
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.680]   Is Silicon Valley right after Game of Thrones?
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:49.680]   Okay.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:50.680]   What do you think?
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:51.680]   Now you've seen two?
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:52.680]   I'm in.
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:53.680]   I'm watching it.
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.680]   I like it.
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:55.680]   I've got you Jeff Jarvis television critic.
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:56.680]   I thought it was down a bit.
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:57.680]   I don't know.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:58.680]   It's a little broad.
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:19:59.800]   There's some broad stuff.
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.760]   But then there's apparently, okay.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:02.960]   So there's some really in stuff.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:08.560]   I didn't know this, but Mike Elgin told me that if you watch the second episode, there's
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:13.120]   a picture from Playboy on the wall in the apartment in the house.
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:18.200]   And it turns out, and I don't know how Mike found this out, that it was the, it must have
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:23.160]   read about that was the very first JPEG image.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.280]   To test the four of us.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:29.640]   And I remember, if I saw it now, I would recognize it because I do remember that.
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:30.640]   Of course the first.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.880]   But that's very good to have that.
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:38.160]   You know, I mean, there's, so apparently, well, we'll have to go through it with a fine
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:42.280]   tooth comb looking for geeky references like that.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:43.280]   I like it.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.800]   Yeah, I don't dislike it.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.400]   I just not sure.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.320]   It's not, I think it's smarter than I thought it would be.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.160]   It's not that reality show.
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.600]   It's much better than that.
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:56.600]   No, that reality show is like, yeah, not even.
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:58.600]   It's a sitcom.
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:02.040]   It's funnier than that.
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:03.040]   Roast.
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:05.560]   Frankly, sorry, I tried.
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:06.560]   You wanted to light this up.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:07.560]   It's all I had available.
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.480]   I could, you want me to go on the Germans again?
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:10.480]   Huh?
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:11.480]   I can do that.
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:15.400]   More Germans.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:19.080]   Since you make a Twitter analysis tool, what's the story with Gannip?
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.080]   Is that a big deal that Twitter buys Gannip?
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.080]   That was the last company.
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.520]   One of the few companies that had the fire hose, right?
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.560]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:27.560]   That's true.
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:28.560]   I'd forgotten that.
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.960]   I don't think it's that big deal.
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.240]   It doesn't surprise me.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:37.640]   I mean, I think that Twitter has sort of, has peaked on clients and is now, I think
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:39.640]   that they're definitely interested in analytics.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:45.360]   And, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, not at all.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.000]   I don't, I don't know.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.800]   Maybe to my detriment, I really don't pay attention to other people doing.
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:52.640]   I have a very clear vision of what we want to do and we're different.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:53.640]   We're totally different products.
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.920]   I don't think Google would do what you're doing.
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.680]   I mean, Twitter would do what you're doing.
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:00.160]   I think they should know analytics, but it's going to be for advertising.
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:05.360]   It was an independent third party that has feeds of it had the fire hose.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.360]   It had the total feed.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:10.320]   Very of many players too, not just Twitter.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:13.880]   Now that Twitter owns them, what impact does that have in terms of sources of social
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:14.880]   data?
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:15.880]   Ah, interesting.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:16.880]   Hmm.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:17.880]   I don't know.
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.960]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:24.600]   Well, don't know.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:29.800]   I have the chatroom is, of course, sending me the image of the first JPEG.
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:31.480]   Oh, let me see.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:32.480]   Before you show this.
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:38.440]   No, yeah, they can, you can show this because they didn't show the nudity.
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.600]   But look for this picture on the, oh, yeah, God, yeah.
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:42.600]   Remember that?
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.600]   Many times have I seen that.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:45.600]   There's no nudity.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:51.200]   It's just the first, the first, it's a November, 1972 Playboy.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:55.440]   It's their best selling issue ever sold 7 million copies.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:56.440]   Wow.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:05.720]   And the picture is of a Swedish woman named Lena Soderberg.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:12.800]   She's now married with three kids and has a job with the state liquor monopoly.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:19.640]   She's pleasantly amused by what has happened to her picture.
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:24.520]   So I was just looking to think up and, you know, this is Ben Grub, a verified user, just
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:25.520]   followed me.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.520]   That's great news.
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:29.240]   He's deputy tech editor at the Sydney Morning Herald.
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:30.720]   Hello, Ben.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:31.720]   Thank you for following me.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:32.720]   That's great.
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.000]   I wouldn't know about that, right?
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.840]   I retweeted Dr. Kiki and three times the people.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:40.440]   I guess you're instead of just raw numbers now, you're just giving multiples.
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:43.440]   We changed it up.
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:45.480]   In fact, there's a huge bug on your stream here, Leo.
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:50.640]   126,319 times more people.
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:53.720]   Well, this guy doesn't have many Twitter followers.
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:57.520]   Yeah, that is not something that one would say in conversation.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:03.480]   Like our goal with the copy is to make it very human, humanize it, right?
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:05.040]   It makes me feel damn fine though.
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.000]   But no one would say that in conversation.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.760]   So we have to change that copy to more than 100,000 times more people.
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:11.760]   There you go.
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:12.760]   More than 100.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:15.120]   See, see, that's why I'm a beta tester.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.560]   Two interesting people follow me last week in my tweets.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.840]   Wow, look at this one.
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:21.840]   This was the tweet that I did.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:25.960]   My number one tweet was my verification tweet for keybase.io.
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:29.000]   Did you, did you know about that?
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.160]   Yes, I do.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.520]   I actually am a terrible person.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.600]   I have an invite and I haven't set it up to it.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.600]   It's really easy.
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:36.600]   Is it, did you like it?
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:38.600]   I'll show you real quickly.
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.600]   We were giving you a plug, but I'll just quickly deviate.
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:40.600]   Oh, that's fine.
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:41.600]   So it's keybase.io.
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:44.400]   It's founded by the two guys who did okay, Cupid.
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:47.880]   But this is not a monetary proposition.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:51.600]   The idea of this, and let me just log in real quickly to my account.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:55.520]   The idea of this is to make it easy to do a few things.
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:25:00.920]   One, to do PGP crypto, open public key cryptography.
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:09.000]   But the other, to find people's key, public key, in a auditable, verifiable directory.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.640]   So when you sign up for this, and I'll show you my page, when you sign up for this, you
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:16.920]   publish as I did that tweet that verifies that it's me.
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:24.080]   And I also, you put a little GitHub gist up, and you can also put some text on your website.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.560]   And that proves that you're this person, the person who owns that Twitter account, that
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:30.040]   GitHub account, and that website.
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.120]   And then that's my public key.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:35.960]   So if you wanted to send me private stuff, you could actually use their website because
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.800]   it uses JavaScript.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.160]   But you can also install Node.js on your terminal.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.960]   And then do all of this from the terminal, which is kind of cool.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:46.960]   Very nice.
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:48.960]   And then--
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:49.960]   So I can send you an encrypted message.
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.080]   Well, you know, I used paste bin and then send an encrypted message, a link to an encrypted
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.000]   message on Twitter.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000]   And that was kind of fun.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000]   That was fun.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.880]   Yeah, there's just little things you can do.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.040]   I like the idea.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.040]   It's very beta.
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:04.040]   You have to get an invitation right now.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:11.800]   They say, and you know, we don't recommend you encrypt stuff using in browser crypto.
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:19.520]   But if you're sure that we haven't been tortured into serving you custom targeted JavaScript
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:22.880]   and your browser is clean and your life doesn't depend on it, you can do it within the browser,
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:25.160]   but you can also easily do it from the command line.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:29.600]   Installing Node.js turns out to be a very simple thing to do, at least on a Macintosh.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:34.680]   And then you have this command line capability of encrypting and decrypting and verifying.
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.520]   But most importantly, this is a directory.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:41.320]   So once Gina's in this, I can search for Gina and I could forget her public key.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:45.560]   Now there are existing directories like that MIT runs, well, whether the PGP runs on there's
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:46.560]   quite a few.
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:48.800]   But this is kind of pretty.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:49.800]   And they do verifications.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:55.560]   So part of the problem with PGP or GNU Privacy Guard, which is the open source implementation
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:59.080]   of PGP, is that anybody can create a key.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.200]   People have created a key with my name and email in it.
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.200]   It's a phony key.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:07.000]   You can't, you know, it doesn't do you any good, but it's a way to grief somebody because
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.500]   keys are unsigned.
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:12.100]   So you're supposed to have signing parties where you all get together and you sign each
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:13.700]   other's keys.
[01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:20.220]   But this, what this does is use these public verification procedures to create a key that
[01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:21.580]   is somewhat trustworthy.
[01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:23.220]   So I think that's a good idea.
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:24.220]   It's very easy to use.
[01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:25.220]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:26.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:27.220]   I'm going to get up off my behind.
[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:28.220]   It's a lot more.
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:29.220]   I didn't even invite.
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:35.180]   So one of the things that happens is you track people and then it will let you know if
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:37.700]   something goes wrong or their keys change or whatever.
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:41.100]   So it's kind of a way of like following them.
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:42.100]   Mm-hmm.
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:43.100]   Cool.
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:44.100]   It's cool.
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:45.100]   I think it's a neat idea.
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:46.100]   Back to ThinkUp.
[01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:48.540]   Anyway, so that was my most popular tweet.
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:49.700]   That was your big tweet.
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:54.020]   So you were verifying by tweeting, okay, so you were getting a bunch of replies or
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:55.020]   favorites.
[01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:56.020]   Look at Chad got a big tweet.
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:57.020]   What was that?
[01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:59.420]   Yeah, that was at the convention.
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:00.420]   Oh, it got it.
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:01.420]   Yeah, it packs.
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:05.060]   And yeah, I knew that that was going to have some crazy stuff.
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:08.780]   So I ran quickly to ThinkUp to see something.
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:10.820]   Yeah, it was really fun.
[01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:12.300]   And I also got a lot more followers.
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:17.420]   Like people, a lot of followers, you know, have retweeted and I gained some more ones
[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:22.140]   and it was really cool to run over and check ThinkUp every day and see what they're talking
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:23.140]   about.
[01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:24.140]   Yay.
[01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:25.140]   Awesome.
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:26.140]   And it's also very positive.
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:30.940]   It rewards you for, you know, whatever Leo LaPort said in the past week must have been
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:31.940]   memorable.
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:32.940]   I love it.
[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:36.780]   Well, you know, we have that one insight where it's how much you've been talking about yourself
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:42.180]   and it's sort of implies that you're narcissists or an egotist and we get a lot of feedback
[01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:46.540]   about that because it's kind of out of line with the rest of the messages are pretty positive.
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:48.980]   It just reminds you to stop using I, me and mine.
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:52.060]   I think that's a positive impact on the on the.
[01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:53.860]   Did you take that out?
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:54.860]   We didn't take it out.
[01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:55.860]   We did reword.
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:59.380]   We added in a few different headlines because each one of these headlines are sort of not
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:01.140]   to, you know, do the sausage making.
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:03.900]   But each of the headlines kind of alternates and rotates.
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:07.500]   So we added in a few others that were both positive and neutral.
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.820]   And then we still have the but enough about me, but there actually is, I mean, post this
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:11.820]   on our blog.
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:16.700]   I mean, there is some research that shows that people who post status updates about themselves
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:19.060]   the most to get less engagement.
[01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:22.060]   Like it's a lot of people find it a little off putting.
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:24.300]   So there is a reason why we pointed out.
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:27.700]   So is that your goal a little bit with ThinkUp is to make you a better Twitter user?
[01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:28.700]   Yeah.
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:29.700]   I mean, yeah.
[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:33.420]   But the idea is that like these networks give us these amazing superpowers, right?
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:34.420]   This is just like technology.
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:39.180]   Technology gives us these amazing superpowers and you can use them for good or not so good
[01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:40.700]   or not use them well at all.
[01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:45.580]   And so yeah, the idea of ThinkUp is really just to become more mindful about how you spend
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:48.540]   your time and these networks and what sort of messages you're putting out there and what's
[01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:52.700]   happening with your connections and what your impact is.
[01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:55.700]   So when you retweet Dr. Kiki, you know, what does that mean?
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:56.700]   Right.
[01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:57.700]   Really that kind of thing.
[01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:03.420]   It's not to get all like woo woo and Zen, but it's about sort of mindfulness and awareness.
[01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:05.740]   And it is kind of about behavior change too.
[01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:09.020]   It's worked because I've tweaked a lot more than I did before I started using ThinkUp.
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:10.020]   And I'm glad.
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:11.020]   I'm glad.
[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:12.020]   I'm glad.
[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:13.020]   Well, you've got to see John Ian.
[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:14.820]   So yeah, you got.
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.300]   I have one.
[01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:18.460]   Jeff Jarvis replied to Arctic Tony 12 times last week.
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:22.620]   We were having a conversation and then it says time having good conversation is time will
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:23.620]   spend.
[01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:24.620]   Thanks, mom.
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:26.980]   The right below that has a big three minutes.
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:29.540]   What is the three minutes?
[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:34.660]   You know, we just we we did sort of an off the cuff estimation of about how long it takes
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:35.660]   to post a tweet.
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:38.540]   We we guessed about 15 to 20 seconds and we shad them off.
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:40.300]   It's not the aggregate time in conversation.
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:41.300]   That's really interesting.
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:43.580]   It's funny if you click that link, it takes you right to go to see.
[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:47.060]   So that's kind of a little Easter egg in there.
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:51.700]   Oh my gosh, if a Neil has has buried a go to see link somewhere in this source code and
[01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:53.540]   it passed my code review.
[01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:54.540]   That would be amazing.
[01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:55.540]   He's an obfuscated.
[01:30:55.540 --> 01:30:57.020]   It's an obfuscated goat.
[01:30:57.020 --> 01:30:57.980]   See, it's all in hex.
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:00.620]   So you would you won't see it.
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:04.100]   I don't think is that site still around?
[01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:05.100]   I don't think so.
[01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:09.540]   I don't even I don't even what do you laugh at that chat like it would it would disappear.
[01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:13.340]   Like someone would delete it from the Internet.
[01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:18.580]   They delete the goat's image from the Internet.
[01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:21.180]   I don't even want to look at you're googling it.
[01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:24.820]   Look at your screen.
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:28.100]   I actually tried the one I tried to find recently that I couldn't find classic Internet.
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:33.700]   Oh, the dude who was like dancing in front of his webcam was the new manuma kid.
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:34.700]   The new manuma kid.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:35.700]   You kids hard to find.
[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:37.260]   Because there's so many.
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:43.180]   Yeah, that's that's pretty much always no there's go see is not doing go see anymore.
[01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:47.380]   Well, for they've got a doge address.
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:50.060]   They want doge coin.
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:52.260]   I mean, it was always taking a chance showing.
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:53.820]   Yeah, I was yeah.
[01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:54.820]   It's just an image.
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:57.260]   Yeah, I used to be just an image.
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:31:58.820]   It wasn't like a URL.
[01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:01.380]   No, I had is a URL.
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:04.780]   Well, I mean, it could be, but no, it always wasn't a URL.
[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:08.380]   I guess you know what the SEC stands for.
[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:10.620]   I guess I I you just didn't know.
[01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:16.540]   No, no, I guess I experienced it in like second life and like other other other instances where
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:18.500]   it didn't have to be a URL.
[01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:21.940]   Yeah, I mean, you could do it on an image forum.
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:22.940]   You do it on.
[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:23.940]   Yeah, yeah, right.
[01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:26.420]   There was a site which is no longer go seeing.
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:27.420]   Right.
[01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:29.020]   In fact, it seems like it has an ad.
[01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:32.140]   It says a message from the go see lawyer.
[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:34.900]   I think that maybe it was taken down.
[01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:36.740]   Should I play this?
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:37.740]   It's on YouTube.
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:39.940]   It can't be bad.
[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:46.140]   Turning to go see dot C X. I have some good news and some bad news for you about go see
[01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:47.780]   dot C X.
[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:50.700]   I just got out of a meeting with the go see dot C X.
[01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:52.700]   I have a feeling there's going to be something.
[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:53.700]   No, I know.
[01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:56.060]   There's something on this.
[01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:57.060]   It's on YouTube though.
[01:32:57.060 --> 01:32:59.020]   They couldn't do that on YouTube.
[01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:01.780]   We're unable to show the go see image.
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:06.660]   He just said handed down by the island of the domain registrar.
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:09.300]   Yes, C X is a where is C X.
[01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:14.740]   The case simply cannot be taken to a higher court of law because there is no higher court
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:15.740]   of law.
[01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:17.620]   We have a stated by this news.
[01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:20.060]   Okay, that's enough.
[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:27.180]   And by the way, as our chat mods are saying, please do not post links to go see in the
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:28.540]   chat.
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:30.780]   What's wrong with you people?
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:32.140]   Leave it to the professionals.
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:35.420]   Oh, so new manuma is a while ago.
[01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:36.980]   Now I'm going to look for new manuma.
[01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:37.980]   Oh, I can find you.
[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:43.780]   What you do is you choose you search for an original new manuma right on YouTube or like
[01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:44.780]   that.
[01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:46.540]   If you put original, doesn't that work?
[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:50.900]   I mean, sometimes the thing was is that it existed before YouTube.
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:57.140]   And so I mean, I think albino black sheep is probably is the most here's a digitally
[01:33:57.140 --> 01:34:00.180]   digitally remastered and it has an ad for share file on it.
[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:01.420]   So you know it.
[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:02.420]   You know it's good.
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:03.420]   Yeah.
[01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:04.900]   I know you're right.
[01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:05.900]   You're right.
[01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:06.900]   You guys.
[01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:07.900]   It's totally the first result.
[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:09.380]   It's like the top of the Google search results.
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:10.380]   I don't know.
[01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:14.740]   But see, like this is a this is a rip from some other splash.
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:16.060]   Much like dancing baby.
[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:17.780]   That was pre pre YouTube too.
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:18.780]   Yes.
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:20.980]   Let me get pulled down because of this song.
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:21.980]   Yeah.
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:27.460]   Which makes you really what's impressive is that you could have a viral video before
[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:28.460]   there was a YouTube.
[01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:29.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:33.940]   Imagine how much harder that was in the old days.
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:37.540]   Kids today, you got it easy.
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:40.460]   The dancing baby was a was a gift, right?
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:41.460]   I think so.
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:44.860]   The whole idea the dancing baby was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:46.860]   was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it's
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:47.860]   okay.
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:48.860]   You say it anyway you want.
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:49.860]   You don't.
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:50.860]   It's Jotsey.
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:35:04.500]   No, the it's go side because the dancing baby was a project file on one of some 3d program
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:09.860]   way way way way back when like in the in the early 90s or the mid 90s.
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:13.580]   And I remember we played it on the site in 1992.
[01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:15.540]   I mean, this is like almost before the internet.
[01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:17.940]   Remember an Ally McBeale the TV show on Ally McBeale.
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:20.900]   She kept seeing the dancing baby dancing baby.
[01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:22.380]   Right is Ally McBeale.
[01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:23.380]   Right.
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:26.140]   But it but it predates it was it was early 90s.
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:28.460]   That's for that to be viral.
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:31.860]   I mean, what did you had to send around on a video on a VCR tape?
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:35.700]   How does she let me run let me run this DVD over to you this block.
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.700]   You get that over to your house.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:38.700]   Yeah.
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:41.100]   So go ahead and try to find that on YouTube.
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:44.900]   I think there are quite a few dancing babies, but the original I don't know.
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:48.940]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at personal capital who invite you to live

[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:22.900]   Are they very aggressive?
[01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:23.900]   The Maya.
[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:24.900]   Haha, people.
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:25.900]   New minuma.
[01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:27.500]   I don't think so about taking down.
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:29.260]   Just the algorithm will catch up.
[01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:31.060]   Oh, the algorithm is aggressive.
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:32.060]   Yeah.
[01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:37.220]   Ladies and gentlemen, Gina Trapani has our tip of the week.
[01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:40.580]   Google search now does public transit directions.
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:42.140]   I write in the search results.
[01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:46.540]   Of course, this works mostly well in big cities like here.
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:51.860]   But if I do a search for 2409 Fulton Street by train, that's the Brooklyn Shake Shack, by
[01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:53.860]   the way.
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:58.020]   Google search results will know my current location and will tell me that I need to get
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:59.580]   on the F train and go.
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:02.300]   Which is pretty cool right there inside the knowledge graph.
[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:03.300]   That's cool.
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:05.260]   I guess that would be considered the knowledge graph.
[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:08.820]   And it'll give you different, as you can see in the screenshot here, to give you different
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:11.460]   routes, tell you what time you're leaving.
[01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:13.820]   It's pretty awesome.
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:14.820]   Nice.
[01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:16.300]   And good for the room.
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:17.660]   And now I want to go to Shake Shack.
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:19.420]   Now Google knows where you're going.
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:21.420]   They know where you are, where you want to go.
[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:22.420]   Oh, shut up.
[01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:23.420]   They got too much.
[01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:29.300]   I want Google to know everything about me so I can get Google now cards all the time.
[01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:32.820]   You know what really frost me is people who complain about Google is invading their privacy
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:36.300]   and then say, "And Google now just really isn't useful."
[01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:37.300]   [laughter]
[01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:38.300]   Come on.
[01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:39.300]   Oh, man.
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:40.300]   Come on.
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:43.300]   You got some numbers, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:49.020]   All right, I got one of my favorite apps in the whole world is Ways.
[01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:50.180]   I depend upon it greatly.
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:52.820]   I use it to drive into work.
[01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:56.980]   For those of you in New Jersey, the British Dollar Crowd, the Kielasky Skyway is closed
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:38:57.980]   for two years.
[01:38:57.980 --> 01:38:58.980]   It's torture.
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:38:59.980]   It's hell.
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:02.460]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:05.500]   So I'm really using Ways now, but it also is a social act.
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.700]   You share things on it, which I think is really important.
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:09.100]   It's how we should think of news.
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:11.020]   So there's a feature on them here.
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:13.900]   I found just two numbers here, which I found interesting.
[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:18.220]   There are 80,000 active ways users around London.
[01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:23.100]   So on that basis, it's enough people to get a lot of really good data.
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:24.780]   My other favorite number here.
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:28.700]   Pardon me, I should turn off my microphone.
[01:39:28.700 --> 01:39:33.420]   Is that Ways has a thousand times more map editors than it has employees.
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:38.900]   It has 140,000 volunteer map editors and 140 employees.
[01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:41.580]   Does that mean somebody like, I mean, I'm a map editor, you're a map editor.
[01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:44.780]   Every time you see an accident or a cop hiding behind a billboard, you press that button.
[01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:46.300]   No, I think it's actually trying to fix the map.
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:47.300]   Fixing the maps.
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:48.300]   Wow.
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:49.300]   That's even, wow.
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:50.300]   Wow.
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:51.300]   Yeah.
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:52.300]   That's a lot.
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:53.300]   That's a lot.
[01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:55.180]   There are more board accidents and things like that.
[01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:56.900]   No, because that's so easy to do.
[01:39:56.900 --> 01:39:59.620]   Oh, I would expect every Ways user does that.
[01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:00.620]   Yeah.
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:01.620]   I'm loving ways.
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:04.180]   I'm going to see more of it in Google Maps.
[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:05.180]   Google owns it.
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:06.180]   Let's get into that map.
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:10.180]   They're talking the story about how they still really are independent of great measure.
[01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:11.180]   Silly.
[01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:12.860]   I don't use Google Maps when I'm driving.
[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:13.860]   I use Ways.
[01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:18.060]   I use Google Maps to find stuff, but I use Ways to navigate.
[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:19.060]   I am a...
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:20.060]   I'm going to Florida.
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:21.060]   Yes.
[01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:25.540]   I think the Google Maps will tell you to get in the ocean and swim south.
[01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:28.460]   I will take with me.
[01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:31.700]   I now take with me, not only my charger, but I also take with me the little thing.
[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:33.900]   I got this great little tiny thing.
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:38.700]   You know, the things used to have to use to plug in a phone to your car or these huge,
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:40.700]   gigantic things that look like those robots.
[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:41.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:42.700]   I brought the Apple Store.
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:43.700]   It's a simple little thing.
[01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:47.260]   It has a rubber thing in the back you put into the vent, and then it has this one little
[01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:50.780]   thing that squeezes out like that, and you put the phone in it, and that's that.
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:52.260]   Well, I take with me for rental cars now.
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:54.980]   Yeah, because every car is a vent.
[01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:55.980]   Exactly.
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:57.260]   And you find that I've seen those.
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:58.260]   Is it pretty solid?
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:40:59.260]   Very solid.
[01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:02.100]   It's so much better than that other clugey stuff.
[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:03.100]   Yeah.
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:04.100]   Yeah, the suction cups.
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:05.100]   So you put a...
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:06.460]   In fact, those are illegal in many states.
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:09.740]   You can't put something suctioned on the window and all that stuff.
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:10.740]   Really?
[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:13.100]   Yeah, I don't know if it's illegal in Brooklyn.
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:14.100]   Nothing's illegal.
[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:15.860]   You could put anything you want in your windows in Brooklyn.
[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:16.860]   You got a problem with that?
[01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:17.860]   Large sugary drinks.
[01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:20.380]   Zingo balls.
[01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:21.380]   Fuzzy dice.
[01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:23.140]   Whatever you want up there.
[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:25.540]   Just decorate those windshields.
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:26.540]   Godfather horns.
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:27.540]   Godfather.
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:28.540]   What is that?
[01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:29.540]   What is that?
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:30.540]   What is that?
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:31.540]   What is that?
[01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:33.540]   How would that go?
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:34.540]   Yeah, it does.
[01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:36.540]   It's the song with Godfather.
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:37.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:40.100]   You go to certain neighborhoods and down the bench on her.
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:41.100]   So, yeah.
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:42.100]   Really Godfather horns?
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:43.100]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:45.540]   See, here it's like ukara chal, like ukara chal.
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:49.140]   My wife is truly freaked when we first moved here.
[01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:50.820]   She was like, whoa.
[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:55.500]   That sounds like a weird one.
[01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:57.500]   I want to Godfather horn.
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:01.900]   Hey, I don't know why.
[01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:04.740]   It's good.
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:05.740]   Threatening.
[01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:06.740]   Threatening.
[01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:10.100]   Let me show you my tip.
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:11.100]   It's really not for everybody.
[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:12.620]   I've talked a lot about Sonos.
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:13.700]   We love Sonos here.
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:14.700]   We have Sonos everywhere.
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:17.580]   It's a wireless sound system.
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:19.020]   And they have a lot of different music things.
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:21.260]   They finally added Google Play music.
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:23.180]   I'm so happy.
[01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:24.180]   Google Play music.
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:28.660]   I guess now it's $10 a month, but $7.99 a month for $20.
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:29.980]   All the music in the world.
[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:31.780]   But it also uploads all of your music.
[01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:33.860]   So every song I have is on Google Play.
[01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:37.820]   And now I can play it through my wireless speakers.
[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:42.180]   Plus Google Play music has a really, I think, a very good radio capability.
[01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:45.780]   I think I was listening to this the other day.
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:49.460]   Hall of rock and roll Hall of Fame winning songs.
[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:51.500]   And so I pumped it to my Sonos.
[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:52.500]   Played it throughout the house.
[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:53.500]   It's so great.
[01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:54.500]   I love it.
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:57.220]   So if you have Sonos with Google, they work with Google.
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:42:58.540]   Like Google whitelisted them.
[01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:00.140]   They're not using the casting protocol.
[01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:01.140]   They're using--
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:02.140]   No, they're doing something interesting.
[01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:03.140]   Yeah.
[01:43:03.140 --> 01:43:04.140]   Yeah.
[01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:05.140]   Yeah.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:06.140]   Which is interesting.
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:09.060]   You know, on iPhone, you can play any content that's on your iPhone into the Sonos.
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:10.300]   You can't get through that on Android.
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:12.740]   I don't know what's holding that up.
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:14.540]   That would be nice.
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:17.900]   Sonos looks like a castable device.
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:22.060]   I've never tried casting to it, but I see it all the time in all cast.
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:23.060]   Mm-hmm.
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:24.060]   [SIGH]
[01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:25.060]   Hey, friends.
[01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:26.060]   Well, now it is.
[01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:27.860]   I mean, now it's a castable device with this update, right?
[01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:28.860]   Now it is--
[01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:29.860]   Does that make you castable?
[01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:30.380]   Yeah.
[01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:32.980]   Because in Google Play music, you tap the cast button.
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:34.220]   Is it only play music?
[01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:36.740]   I can't imagine that they were pointed to that.
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:37.260]   No, it's--
[01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:37.980]   Oh, you're right.
[01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:40.100]   Maybe not.
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:41.100]   I don't know.
[01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:42.980]   Because I think that it is the standard implementation.
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:43.980]   I don't know.
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:45.780]   I don't have a Sonos, but I think it's the standard.
[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:47.620]   It's just the cast button that you tap.
[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:50.820]   Well, this one's tied to my Sonos at home.
[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:51.820]   Mm.
[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:56.820]   But yes, so you're in Google Play music and you can cast to your Sonos, which is wild.
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:57.820]   Love it.
[01:43:57.820 --> 01:44:01.980]   Share your neighbors and start playing music now.
[01:44:01.980 --> 01:44:06.500]   We were rocking out today, and I don't think our neighbors complained.
[01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:09.980]   The peacocks might have minded it.
[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:10.980]   It's--
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:11.980]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:12.980]   Roll it.
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:16.580]   Pauli Walnuts, godfather, car horn, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:17.580]   Andy Williams does it.
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:18.580]   Wait a minute.
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:19.580]   No, wait a minute.
[01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:21.580]   Let's Pauli Walnuts, who was on the godfather.
[01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:24.660]   Let's check this out.
[01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:26.380]   After this ad in four seconds.
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:27.940]   An ad for Bitcoin.
[01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:30.100]   Wow, I've never seen that before.
[01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:31.860]   You guys, you're like, "For just too late."
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:32.860]   I'm your planner.
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:33.860]   I'll tell you if that works.
[01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:35.500]   Well, since it's actually on the Sopranos.
[01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:36.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:38.740]   I was going to say that's the me more go on the Sopranos.
[01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:40.620]   That triali's pork store cafe.
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:42.020]   That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
[01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:43.020]   No.
[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:44.020]   No, that's in Jersey.
[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:45.020]   Jersey.
[01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:46.020]   That's right.
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:47.020]   That's all Jersey.
[01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:48.020]   Jersey.
[01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:49.020]   Jersey.
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:50.020]   Jersey.
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:51.020]   Jersey.
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:52.020]   Jersey.
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:53.020]   Jersey.
[01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:54.020]   Jersey.
[01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:55.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:56.020]   Sorry.
[01:44:56.020 --> 01:44:57.020]   I'm sorry.
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:58.020]   I'm sorry.
[01:44:58.020 --> 01:44:59.020]   You should know better.
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:00.020]   Here he goes.
[01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:01.020]   Pauli Walnuts.
[01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:02.020]   He's going to keep the horn.
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:03.020]   Come on, beep the horn, Pauli.
[01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:04.020]   Remember the sex.
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:13.220]   Hey, I'm walking here.
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:16.300]   Gina Tarpani comes to us from Brooklyn.
[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:17.420]   She comes by and honest.
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:19.700]   She was born there.
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:20.700]   She's also--
[01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:21.700]   Yeah, none of this hyper-gentrification stuff.
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:23.100]   I was born here, OK?
[01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:24.100]   In 1975, people.
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:25.100]   Yeah.
[01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:27.100]   Oh, take her glass off, man.
[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:28.100]   Yeah.
[01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:29.100]   You give her a glass a little.
[01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:30.780]   Yeah, don't mess with my glass.
[01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:31.780]   I got your glass.
[01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:33.980]   I was born right by the Saturday night fever.
[01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:34.980]   Dance club.
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:37.900]   She did the glass.
[01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:38.900]   She thinkup.com.
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:40.180]   That's her place to go.
[01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:41.180]   Go there.
[01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:42.180]   Sign up.
[01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:43.180]   Subscribe.
[01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:44.180]   It's very useful and wonderful and I love it.
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:45.180]   Thank you.
[01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:46.180]   Thank you very much.
[01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:47.180]   Great show today.
[01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:48.180]   A lot of fun.
[01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:50.660]   She doesn't show up anymore as smartawear.org.
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:52.740]   She also hosts a couple of other shows.
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:56.180]   I don't like to talk about it, but all right.
[01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:57.180]   She's every Tuesday night.
[01:45:57.180 --> 01:45:59.100]   She's on all about Android, OK?
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:00.580]   That's a lot of fun.
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:03.300]   And then in beta on some other network.
[01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:05.340]   Oh, no, no, no, not anymore anymore.
[01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:06.340]   You stopped.
[01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:07.340]   I stopped.
[01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:08.340]   I stopped.
[01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:09.340]   Kevin is still doing the show.
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:10.340]   Kevin pretty still doing the show.
[01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:11.420]   He has a new he's a new co host.
[01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:12.420]   It was totally amicable.
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:14.180]   I just just got busy with think up.
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:15.180]   Yeah, I'm busy.
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:16.940]   I'm glad you didn't get too busy for us.
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:17.940]   Thank you.
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:22.940]   Yeah, I couldn't give up my weekly check to our possession.
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:23.940]   No.
[01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:24.940]   You guys.
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:28.860]   All right.
[01:46:28.860 --> 01:46:29.860]   We need you.
[01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:30.860]   We need you.
[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:34.420]   Otherwise, it's just two grumpy old men.
[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:39.300]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York, a dignified
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:41.140]   professorial person.
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:42.580]   Get your pipe.
[01:46:42.580 --> 01:46:45.580]   You could find them on Google+ as you could find all of us in Buzzmachine.com.
[01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:47.580]   Well, I'm not dignified now.
[01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:48.580]   No.
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:52.620]   Oh, so you have these are the eyeglass, the spectacle versions.
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:53.620]   Yeah.
[01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:54.620]   I don't know.
[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:59.060]   I still look stupid to me.
[01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:00.060]   Just me.
[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:04.860]   Although, if you're in the same room, I would rip them off your head, smash them on the ground.
[01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:06.700]   No, we don't do that, folks.
[01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:07.700]   It's not nice.
