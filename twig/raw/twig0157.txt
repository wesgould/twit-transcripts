[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Could it be true?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Rumor says Google's stopping all investment in Google Plus.

[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And you know I gotta say this right up front because sometimes people say
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   well you don't talk enough about Google.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   What's not just Google? It's a cloud.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   It's Facebook. It's Twitter.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   It's what's going on in the new world.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   I know and I'm not going to say of social but I'm just saying
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   in the new world up there in the space in the cloud.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Joining us from the cloud via the cloud Jeff Jarvis from the City University
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   of New York.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Blogger@buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And he's wearing a T-shirt of unknown provenance but maybe I can figure that
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   man woman Android.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It's the Ben case.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Google gift shop. That's awesome. That is cool.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I love it. Aaron Newcomb's also here.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   He works at Oracle but he worked his son before that and that's really
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   the real I'm not going to mention the O word.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   That's fine. You don't have to while I'm here.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   You've seen him often on Floss Weekly, open source expert expert on Java
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   and an Android user right.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   That's right. Absolutely. Big Android fanboy.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Okay. All right.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Drew Allenoff is also here for the next web.com.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Tech journalist extraordinaire.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Well that drew on the Twitter. Hey Drew, good to see you.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   It's good to see you again.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Welcome to the show.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Sorry I couldn't be there in person.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I know.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   But I understand.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Dude he calls.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   He's got a file or something like some sort of happy nonsense.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   He has a job or something like that.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Got to make the doughnuts.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So this just in.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Thank you to the chat room.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   It is not in our rundown.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It is a rumor.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Frederick Lardin law and Alexia Tsozis writing in tech crunch post of an
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   hour ago.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Rumor Google puts a hold on new Google plus acquisitions.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   The source from Google tells us Google is weary of both growing the
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Google plus team now and providing the product with any additional
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   resources until January.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Could this be the first crack in the Google happy face facade that
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Google everything is going great.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Google plus is fantastic.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   The Google plus Hawaii trip is apparently on the schedule still.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   They're all going to Hawaii.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   450 Google plus employees for an off site.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Maui in September.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   How much could that cost though really?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Right.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   You can afford it.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Maybe.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Maybe Lori and Sergey bought a yacht.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I mean 450 people is a lot of people.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Is that overly large for a team?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   It's pretty big.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   It's pretty darn big.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I mean when you need that many developers, I mean it could just there's a
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   couple of reasons you would do this as a company.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Right.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   So one is, you know, I guess the rumors here would be that, you know,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   the news are just getting too big or, you know, maybe Google is,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   you know, trying to de-emphasize Google plus a little bit.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I don't think so.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   The other reason you might do it is because you've got some sort of
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   big something big happening in the company.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Right.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So the execs come out and they say, you know what, we can't hire
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   anything else because something big internal is happening and we can't,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   we can't, you know, we can't do it anymore.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And it might just be about money.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   It might be.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Could it just be about money?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   It could be a lot more.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Could be a lot more.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   It's hard to tell what's going on.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Now what were the acquisitions?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   They, $100 million, Mibo, 15 thereabouts million for milk, Kevin Rose.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Mm hmm.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   That was more connected to Android, right?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Wasn't it?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Didn't they just acquire a, I don't know if this is for Google plus,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   but wildfire.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   That probably is Google plus, right?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   It's a social media.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   It's all about managing social campaigns for advertisers and that
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   includes the blog.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And it's like, I mean, it's like, I'm not going to go to the
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Google.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   It's like, I'm not going to go to the Google.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Which, you know, they do with acquisitions.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   So this is on the wildfire blog.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   We believe that over time, the combination of WireFire
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   and Google can lead to a better platform for managing
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   all digital media marketing.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   We continue to stay focused on helping brands run
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   and measure their...
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Now, if you're a brand using wildfire and it's now part of Google,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   does that make you nervous about how it's going to work
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   with Facebook and Twitter and Pinterest and LinkedIn?
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Or do you go still with that money?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Is Facebook going to say, no, you can't buy an ad on our service?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   That's going to be the interesting point.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   It's Facebook going to cut them off, right?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   They're cutting off revenue.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   That could happen.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Obviously, wildfire says it's business as usual.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Google says it's business as usual.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   We've heard that before.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   But any number of those services, Pinterest, Twitter,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   all the other services that wildfire works with,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   they could go, hey, hold on a second.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   We're going to monetize our platform.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Go away, especially if it's Google at the help.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   So, I don't think so.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   I think it's a service to advertisers.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   I mean, I talk to a lot of people in media.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   And when you get to some brands, they need help and services
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   in trying to manage across multiple social platforms.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   It's another advertising way.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And it's Google being rather, I think, lowercase C Catholic
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   about this in saying that we will now recognize
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   advertising, we'll place advertising elsewhere on the web.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   We'll share the money, we'll push revenue elsewhere
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   where it's good for the advertiser.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And I think that's a smart way to go.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   They also, I mean, it's kind of an interesting company
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   that was founded, according to its own about page.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   In 2008 by Victoria and Alan, who were New Zealand-based
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   adventure travel company, they wanted to give away free
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   trips to fans and they discovered doing it on Facebook
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   acquired them to create an application.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   So, they built one.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Right.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   It was a week-long side project that turned into a venture
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   of its own, its first product promotion builder.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   They had 10 clients by the fall of 2008, four years later,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   16,000 businesses, including 30 of the 50 top global brands.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Very interesting story, isn't it?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And what did it sell for, guys?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I think it was between 200 and 250 million.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Wow, good for them.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Yeah, around 250.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Good for them.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   It's an interesting, it's an interesting acquisition.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I have to think that there is something that Google's thinking
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   that, well, yeah, this gives us a window into how these 30 out
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   of the 50 top global companies are planning social media
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   interactions and purchases and marketing on the other guy's
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   site.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Right.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And I could see why Facebook may say,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   "We shall see."
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Right.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Could be.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   It could also be an enterprise play, not strictly enterprise,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   but it seems like Google's always looking for a reason or a way
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   to get into the enterprise space because there's so much on
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   the consumer side.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I just wonder if it's a way for them to have a bigger play in
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   this market.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Maybe they just see it as a growing market and they're like,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   "You know what?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Let's scoop them up and then we'll, hey, who knows ads better
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   than Google?"
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   So now, Mr. XYZ company, come to us and we'll handle all of
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   your social media marketing efforts.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Well, you already have the analytics.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Analytics is a huge part of this, too.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   With Google Analytics being able to track all those things in one
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   place, I mean, it's a huge plus for the brands.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   I think Google adds a lot of value.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   But I've got to imagine--
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Go ahead.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Actually, one of the tropes in my world these days is that media
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   companies have to become agencies.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Everybody has to become a media company.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   The media companies have to become agencies.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   It's a little bit overdone, but it's true that rather than selling
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   space and time to the advertiser, you've got to sell return on
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   investment, you've got to sell services, you've got to be able to
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   help them in their digital life all around.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   And they're too busy to go to 10 different places.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And he or she who can offer digital as a whole, wisely
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   packaged and be able to optimize across these platforms by having
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   knowledge of what's going on across those platforms is going
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   to have something valuable.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   So I think it's a very smart purchase on Google's behalf.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   And I think it doesn't exclude other people from doing the
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   same thing, but it's something they need to offer.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   And again, they're going to offer revenue to other players,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   which is a really interesting counterintuitive thing.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Come to Google to buy Facebook.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Right?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Yep.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Well, if there were any question about Google's commitment to
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Google+, maybe this would change your mind.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Google has replaced those Gmail video chats you might have done
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.760]   with Hangouts on Google+, we continue with that slow
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.000]   movement towards everything being a part of Google+.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.400]   I don't think there's any doubt that Google has totally
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.000]   committed to the success of Google+, even though there's no
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   evidence that Google+ is anything anybody wants except for a
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   handful of--
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Well, did you see Guy Kawasaki?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Guy loves it.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Guy loves it.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Guy did this whole thing this last week of-- he says that when
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Apple was down on the dumps with consumer review points, he
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   raised this whole thing to provide the counterweight to all
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   the arguments against Apple.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   And so now he's basically written a cheat sheet for how you can
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   defend Google+, against all these critics.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Well, so why do you need to defend Google+, if it's doing so
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   damn well?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Well, let's think about what well means.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   What are we-- what is the core-- is this a Google+ versus
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Facebook thing?
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   It doesn't have as many users as Facebook, therefore, it's a
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   failure, which is a lot of what--
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   what the quarter is--
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   I don't--
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Yeah, but I think that's obviously-- we know better.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   That's not about the number of users.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   It's about the amount of engagement.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Well, how do you track the-- how do you track the engagement?
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   That's the frustrating thing.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Well, you don't.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And the only thing I'm reporting is in my own experience that
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   nobody I know or care about is on Google+.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   I'm there-- I've got some people there who are great.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Hey, yeah, hey, hey, I'm there.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Mike Elegans, they're-- I find good conversation.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   They're still.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   I'm going to put stuff up there.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   It's mixed, but I find it's good and better than my blog.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Yeah, I find way, way better conversation on Google+ than
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   I do anywhere else.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And--
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   I won't deny that.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   I don't deny that.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And the other thing I think-- if I think the reason, like,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   people like Guy Kawasaki and other, I guess, Google+ fanboys,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   like myself, people that really love it, want to get more people
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   to come over.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Right.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   I've gave-- my problem is I gave up too early.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Maybe.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   I gave up.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   And I love Google+.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I love Buzz.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   I'm an idiot.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   I love Buzz.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And I just don't want to waste energy on a platform that is more
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   abundant.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   And I guess, if we could make it work, it's great.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   But you know what my conclusion is after thinking about this
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   for a while, is it's too complicated.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   People want hit and run social media.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   They want to go on.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   They want to post a status update.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   They want to scan pictures and then move on.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   And Google+, you're right, is there's more engagement.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   That's the problem.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   It requires too much participation.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   No, I don't know.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   But I've got to have a different thing.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   My use of Google+ is extremely different.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   I mean, the reason why I'm bullish on Google+ is because it
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   doesn't require a lot of my time.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   I feel like Twitter needs that babysitting.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   That's the groove I'm in with Twitter.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Facebook, for me, has so many features and so many things
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   going on.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   I don't even know where to start.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   So when I use Google+, I feel more comfortable because I check
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   my notifications.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   I can add something.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   I can do a search.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And then I can bull.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Right.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   So the tagline for you is Google+ the social network you can
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   ignore.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   It's not a social network.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Oh, it's not?
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Ah.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Maybe I misunderstand it then.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   It's not a social network.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   What is it?
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   It's a social layer.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   And people want to say that's PR crap.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Google's never referred to it as a social network.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   The idea of a social network, people attach that to Facebook.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Facebook is a social network.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   My space is a social network.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Well, guess what?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.500]   One of those companies had the footprint that Google does in
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.000]   other verticals and areas.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Right?
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   So when you think about integrating these social features in other
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   products, very successful products, that to me says they're
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   the companies just fine with making their products social.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   You know, you don't put plus features in YouTube, which is an
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   extremely popular and successful property.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   And then say, well, it's not doing too well.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   So we're going to have to yank it all back.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   You don't do that.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   It's not a zero or one.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   It's not a turn on turn off.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   It's not buzz.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   I have this vision of Prince, which changes named the onk.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   We're soon going to say plus the site formerly known as Google.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   It is like that, isn't it?
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   It's the site formerly known as Google.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   I just put up guys down at the bottom of the rundown.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   I put up guys post.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   That's all of his arguments and links.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Do you care?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   You know, and I know people say, you know, I'm being hard on it.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   I want it to succeed, but I just feel like I get the feeling having
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   been through this a number of times, most at least with buzz, that
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   is going in the wrong direction.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   I don't know.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   I don't think so.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   I think that good.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   For Facebook, I feel like that's the place I go to hang out with
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   family, you know, family friends, things like that.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   But especially for like what we do when we're building an audience
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   of people that want to follow us and see what we're talking about.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   There's nothing better than Facebook for that.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   I think Google+ is way better for that because I have people that
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   follow me on Google+ and they are engaged and they chat and it draws
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   them into what I'm doing.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   I started to hang out.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   In fact, kind of getting back to what we were talking about,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   about adding the hangouts in, there was an outage on G-Talk the other
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   day.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And I wonder if it was when they were trying to start some integration.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Yeah, I think they were starting to integrate at that point.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Maybe that's why the outage.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   No, they haven't really said.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   But anyway, so as part of that, I said, well, I'm going to start to hang out
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   to see if it's connected, right?
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   So let's see if hangouts actually work.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   So I started to hang out.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   And right away, I noticed that like three or four of the people that are
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   always following me or commenting on my posts and things like that were
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   like right in there in the hangout and they were, hey, it's so good to talk to
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   you.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   It's so good.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   I would have never had that experience on Facebook ever.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   But for some people, like Lauren Weinstein is just a brilliant user
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   of Google Plus.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   He just has great, great stuff.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Mike Elgin, obviously.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Something for you to name the teacher who is the mother-in-law of Sergey.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   I'll remember it in a second.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   But there are some people who are really masters of Google Plus and they
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   share things well and they use it in kind of a proper form using photos,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   using the kind of the right length, kind of right recommendation to share.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   And Google product that is definitely dead.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Definitely.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   I have no, well, we'll find out in just a second when we continue.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Our guest drew all enough from the next web.com.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Aaron Nukem, how should I, what should I, how should I introduce you?
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   I don't want to say from, yeah, let's say the source show.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Let's say the source show.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Yep.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Regular on Floss Weekly, all about Android.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Good to have you here also.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Jeff Jarvis from Buzzmachine.com.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   But first a word from our folks at squarespace.com.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   The new squarespace is here.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   The new squares, you know, I feel like Steve Martin jumping up and down.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   But really, truly, this is something we've been waiting for for some time.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   I've been a beta tester on Squarespace 6 for a few months.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   I know there's people who've been working on it for a year or more.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   And that's because Squarespace really wanted to get this right.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   A brand new code base.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   This isn't just, you know, a few new features.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   This is a new code base, 50 plus new features.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Huge move into the 21st century.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   For instance, things like the new thing everybody's talking about.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Responsive design.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   When you put an image into your Squarespace page, Squarespace automatically generates images
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   of six or seven sizes.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   So that went, here it is, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, so that whatever device comes to that page,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   they don't have a special mobile page.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   The page automatically resizes the images are appropriate for that specific device.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   It's just things like that make such a difference to your users, to you.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   The ability to drag and drop your layout, to create a unique looking page, of course, for all the great templates.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   There are 50 plus newer improved features in the new Squarespace.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Incredible.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   The new layout engine.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   You can share your social media accounts.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Plug that in.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Of course, if you're a blogger, it's awesome.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   You can even drag and drop things like Google Maps into your blog.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   I just think that is so cool to have that as part of the image palette in your blog.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   I want you to try this.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Now, the nice thing, as always, with Squarespace is it couldn't be easier to try it.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Just visit squarespace.com.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   You will see on there a try-it link.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Two weeks, absolutely free.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Squarespace.com.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Let me close this video so you can see where we're talking about here.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   It says get started now.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   That's it.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Get started.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Two weeks, absolutely free of Squarespace.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   If you decide you like it and only if you decide you like it, then get out your credit card and take a look at the pricing because it's really kind of amazing.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Eight dollars, this is if you buy a yearly plan.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   They do have monthly plans.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   It costs just a little bit more $10 a month a month.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   But get the yearly plan because it really is.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   That's the best saving.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   $16.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   What do you get for $16 a month when you pay for a yearly plan?
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage, unlimited contributors, unlimited.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   There's no limit.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   I don't know of any hosting company that can offer this kind of value and the amazing content management system that's Squarespace.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Give it a try.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Two weeks free.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   If you decide you like it and you decide to buy, use our offer code.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Twig eight and you'll get 10% off your first purchase.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   That's why.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Another reason why.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   The annual plan is a best deal.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And one more thing.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   When you get an annual plan, they will give you a free domain registration so you can have your custom domain and do all the back end hook up so that you don't have to.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   It makes it very straightforward to create a custom domain.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Do the whole thing.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Soup to not Squarespace is the best.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   I want you to try it.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   The new Squarespace.com.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Give it a try today and make sure you use the offer code Twig eight if you decide to buy.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   We're talking Google, the cloud, Facebook and the queue.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   I guess we don't have to worry about the queue anymore.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I guess that's it on the Google queue.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   For now.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   For now.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   I don't know.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   What do you think?
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   I think it sounds like it's dead, dead, dead.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   I think it might be.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   It's a little bit of embarrassment.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   I guess better for them that they pulled off.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   The news is, by the way, that the Google queue is not going to come out right now.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   They heard the bad reviews.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   They're going to give away what they have to people who asked for them.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   More than that, if you pre-ordered it off, I don't know how many people that could be for $300, they're just going to send you one.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   That to me sounds like they're not a dead version.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   You're going to say, "We're sorry you ordered one.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   You're for free on us."
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Sounds to me like that's the end of the line.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   We talked about this on all about Android a few weeks ago.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   It was just too little for too much.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Too little functionality for $300.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   You've got products like the "Oh yeah, oh yeah" coming out.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   That's good.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   No, okay.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   For $100.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Coming out, or it got its Kickstarter money.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Almost done a Kickstarter.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   There's a total of some of the Kickstarter money.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   As somebody who's invested in over a dozen Kickstarter products, of which I've only received one, coming out.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   It's a little ways from that, but I agree with you.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Who you will be an interesting product.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Let's just say it looks like it's going to be very successful.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   You've got a lot of 10 million plus dollars.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   They've got a ton of people that are signed up.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Not only that, not just people that are signed up that want one, but partners.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Right?
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   So people like...
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Well they have partners now for the...
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Even Vivo, whatever the movie, the music video is.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Oh, Vivo, yeah.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   They even signed up today, they said.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Wow.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   So they've got a final fantasy.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Oh, good for the present.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   For the present.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   I signed up for one, so I've been getting all the news.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   They send you the newsletter about every other day.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   So Uya was a Kickstarter project.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   They raised an amazing amount of dollars, $6 million.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   They asked for less than a million.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   In fact, it's not done yet.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   They have seven days still to go.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   One week.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   And the idea was it was an open source Android gaming platform for a hundred bucks.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Right.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Yep.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Plug's into your TV.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   I mean, much like the Q, plugs into your TV, comes with a controller.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Is this everything the Q should have been?
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   I think it's everything the Q should have been.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Of course they're concentrated on gaming, but if it comes to the end,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   there's no reason you can't install Netflix and things like that.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Unless for some reason they do something to lock those apps out, but I don't think they will.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   So you get all these great gaming platforms designed for the box and you get all the Android functionality that you, you know, kind of like a Google TV experience like you like.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   So you get all that stuff on a hundred dollar box.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   And I think it's exactly what the Q should have done.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Unfortunately, they missed on it.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And that's why they pulled it.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   I'm sure it was really hard for them over there to pull the Q.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   I mean, they gave it a lot of airtime on the, um, at I/O.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And I'm sure it was really hard for them to do that and then pull back.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   But that's the, that was the right decision.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Absolutely.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   In fact, it shows a lot of class.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   It was the only product that I owe where people walked away and were confused.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   And weren't exactly sure what to do with it.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   And Google's response was, well, it's open and developers can build things on it.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Right.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Which is, which is cool.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   I mean, it was hacked right away to run, um, Android, uh, I think it was 4.0.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   It was hacked right away.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   This guy with a very easy hack.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   This guy hacked it and hooked it up and he was like, look now I can watch Netflix on my,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   on my Q, which I couldn't do, you know, with the way it was shipped.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   So maybe it'll, maybe that's where the future of the Q is.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Is it is kind of a hackable device.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   The Monarch in our chat room is pointing out that Uya comes with its own marketplace.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Uh, does not come with Google play, but you could root it, but then you would, you lose the Uya marketplace, but gain Google play.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Right.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   So really the Q was an official Google play device that had music sharing and, uh,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   some nice features at an amp built in.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   I think the only thing, if it had been a hundred bucks, I think it might have been a competitive product.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   I think so.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   It was a price.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   They're selling on, uh, on eBay for, uh, uh, everywhere from 175 to 500 by it now.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   I wonder how that's working out for him.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And it's heavy.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   I like ridiculously heavy.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   I think when I was on the show, when I was out of the, you know, we, you brought yours.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   I like the picture on the verge of the, they have a picture of it as a doorstop.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   They're using it as a doorstop.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Yep.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   It's pretty clever.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   It's a subtle, they don't say that, but it's a very subtle way of saying, hmm.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   I have to admit, when I heard the price, even at Google I/O, when I heard the price, uh, I said that's a non-starter.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   That's, that's just too expensive for something that has such, you know, kind of confusing functionality.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Um, and what, the reason is heavy is has a 25 watt amplifier in it.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   So it has to have a big transformer in there.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Um, yeah, it makes me a little bit sad.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Uh, cause there was some neat design stuff.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   It was made in the USA, which is probably why it was a little pricier than you might have liked.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   Consumer is showing once again that, uh, both the choice between spending a little extra and, and enslaving Chinese children.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Uh, let's, let's slave the children.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   I know that was admirable of them to, to do a, you know, USA manufactured, you know, try to create some jobs here in the good old USA.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   But, uh, yeah, it was just too much.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   I don't know if it created any jobs.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Well, not anymore.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   You know who's creating jobs.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   I think it's a lot of severance.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   You know who's creating a lot of jobs?
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   YouTube, they, uh, have decided, according to the Wall Street Journal, remember they had the $100 million fund for channels.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   They were going to have a hundred channels, uh, Felicia Days, Geek & Sundries, an example, uh, of those channels.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Phil DeFranco has a channel.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   They ended up seeding those channels with $150 million.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   According to the journal, it's such a success.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Eight months later, the company is going to put another $200 million in 200, not clear whether that's 200 million going to the existing 100 channels, or if they're going to add channels.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Um, I think this is very interesting.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   That means it's a success.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Now I have to say I, I don't, I, there are 100 channels.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   And I don't, I don't know where they are.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Are you, is it, uh, I mean, am I missing something?
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Is Shaquille O'Neal launches channel yet?
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   I think you're right.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   I'd rather cook.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   No, I mean, you know, there's a lot of people doing really well by creating and curating their content and engaging people on the platform.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Well, I'd say where they're doing well is by caching that check from Google.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Right?
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   That too.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   I mean, people are getting anywhere up to $5 million to start these channels.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Mm.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Incidentally.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Oh, I'm just going to throw my hat into the ring, uh, Google, uh, um, actually we are going to, I don't know if they are going to open this up to new channels, but we, uh, we've already decided as a company that that's something we'd like to ask say what we realize is Google does not,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   you know, YouTube does not want us on YouTube, um, or YouTube live because we have our own advertising model, right?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Mm.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   And they want to sell ads.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   They don't want to have to compete with our own interstitial ads.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   So, um, could we, if they gave us, you know, a million, a couple million, three million dollars, create our own content specifically for YouTube?
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   Would it be worth our while you bet?
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Why not?
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Yep.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   You know, and, you know, short form, maybe a little bit shorter.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   It would be absolutely short form.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Yep.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   The requirement I'm told is 50, you know, 40 hours a year.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Mm.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   I think we could do that.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   That's not bad.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   That's not bad at all.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Give me a couple million.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   I'll make 80 hours a year.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   I think we'd.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   We'd.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   You know, just put the, put together the package piece, the best of and.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   I would probably, maybe that's one thing and we certainly would do that, but I think, because it would help promote it, but I think we'd also create new content, uh, for the YouTube medium.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   I'm becoming more and more of a fan of the idea and I know people have always told me this because I used to cross post to Twitter and Facebook.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Do it for the, do something appropriate for that medium when you're tweeting tweet, when you're on YouTube YouTube, when you're doing Twitter, do eight hour shows.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   What, you know, what's appropriate for YouTube, you think Leo, what makes it right besides not pixelating the way I do?
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Um, I don't know.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   You know, we were talking before the show about how disappointed I was that we took this really big chance and I thought made a great show, our gaming show game on, and it just, we couldn't make it financially viable.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   So I may not be a good judge of what people want to see. I thought people wanted to see that.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Um, but my guess would be on YouTube short.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   I think, well, I don't know, I think what we're going to do is short how to stuff.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   I think that's really what we should do.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   I think that's a great idea, but you know, there are other things on there like, uh, tabletop, this is the geek and sundry stuff.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   The tabletop gaming that Will Wheaton does is doing well and it's a long form.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   I wouldn't call that short form.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Right.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   So it has Will Wheaton.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   And occasionally some other stars of various sci fi programming.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   So yeah, I mean, maybe that's more interesting, but, um, you can send me, which of course, Tom Merritt and Veronica do a show on there called Sword and Laser has 16 million video views, 280,000 subscribers.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Uh, it's got Felicia Day.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   It's really the Felicia Day channel.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   So that helps.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   They've got a lot of good things.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Actually, one of their breakout hits is this written by a kid.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Um, where a kid.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Yes.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   It walks through a script and then they get the best, the biggest, the one that was the most popular was the written link, uh, did, did a written by a kid episode.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   That's hysterical.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   It is.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   It's called when I see if I can find it.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Goth boy.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   And they, and what they do is they not only, they get three or four videos out of it.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   So they get the making of goth boy, goth boy.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   But let me see how long these are.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   They're not very long.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Now those are short form.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Goth boy is two minutes, 55 seconds.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Um, by the way, pre-roll on most of this, this does not have pre-roll for some reason.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Did you tell everyone your name, please?
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   And then the, then the pop up videos, this is how Google's monetizing it.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   What is it called?
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   And I presume because they made so much money, you know, they put in 150 million and they got, if they're put in another 200 million in, that tells me it paid off.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   It paid off, right?
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Unless they're doubling down on a, on a, on a, we can, but I can't imagine them doing that.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Well, this is the company that made the queue.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   [laughter]
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   And killed it, and killed it quickly.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   And that's the Larry Page touch, by the way.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   I think credit to Larry Page, he is not going to suffer fools gladly.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   He is not going to suffer weak products.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   He's just going to go move next.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   And I think this ties in with, and I know we're going to get to this in a minute, but the Google fiber thing, right?
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Oh, that is a story.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Let's get to that.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   They want to provide content to their new audience, basically.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Right.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   And they're going to have a difficulty because they're competing with all the cable stuff.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   And they're like, oh, you're going to bypass the cable networks?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   You know, they're, they're not going to cable networks.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   I don't know how much there's a little bit of programming they're going to get, but not much.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Let's talk about what Google is offering with this Google fiber because it is more than we thought.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   So you remember about, what is it?
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Six months ago, a year ago, Google had a campaign.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   What city, we're going to pick a city would like us to wire it with fiber, gigabit fiber.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   And we can, I, we tried to do it in here in Petaloma, would have changed my business model, but we also, many other cities, Topeka, Kansas, renamed itself Google, Kansas.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   There was a really, a strong competition, but it turned out it also had to do with the infrastructure, utility infrastructure, things like that.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And Kansas City, Missouri, one.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   And Google is now, now they're not installing it yet, right?
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Right.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   They're, they're, the first thing they're doing is really smart is a campaign.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   You have to say, I will take it if you're in the affected areas and give them $10.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   And then if enough people in that neighborhood, they call it the fiberhood, do the same, then Google will roll into that fiberhood.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   So it's brilliant.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   It's really brilliant.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Talk about good marketing.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Like Kickstarter.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   It's, yeah.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   But I mean, Google.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   It's interest there.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   That's, it's interesting.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   There's also a $300 construction fee to get the fiber from the, from, I guess, from the curb to your house as well.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   But in some cases, they waive that.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Okay.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Good.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   You have 30, they have 39 days, seven hours and 57 minutes left to Kansas.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Oh, by the way, it looks like it's Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Yes.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   What?
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   What's the bunny?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   That's the fiber bunny.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   It's got very hot haunches, apparently.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Maybe that's not infrared.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   I don't know.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   I don't care where it is.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   I'm moving there.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   I know.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   I want it to get it.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   I'm ready.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   So you have to rally your neighbors to pre-register.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   September 10th, they'll announce the results.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Now, what's surprising is how much you get.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   Tell us about the pricing here.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   So 70, so either package, they have two packages and either one that you get.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   There's a free package.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   And there's a free package that includes five megabits per second down and one megabit per second.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   So, free package is better than your DSL provider.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Right.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Exactly.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Yep.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Okay.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Good start.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   And then if you go with, there's a $70 a per month package that gets you broadband only
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   or $120 package that gets you broadband plus TV.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Now, let me say something.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   When you say broadband only, you're talking about a gigabit.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Gigabit down and up.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Of course, what they say.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   A symmetric gigabit.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Right.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Right.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Which is, I mean, yeah, exactly.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   You see Leo's response here.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   That is, I mean, those two packages, those two packages, they waive the $300 fee.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   If you do that, if you do it.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Okay.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   So let me just say we have 150 megabits, one eighth as much coming into the brick house for about,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   I think we pay four or $5,000 a month for that.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   Jesus.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   So it's, it's, it's a seventh of the speed for a lot.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   I don't know.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   It can't even do the math.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   I'm so boggled 40 times the price.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   And if, and if you want the five megabit, then you pay the $300 installation fee.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   And then you pay nothing longer again.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   And that's it.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Well, I think for a couple of years, it's guaranteed.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Although we know how Google does that.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   You know, they say, they give themselves an hour.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   I, and now what do you get with TV?
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Are they, do they have actual contracts with cable company or whatever?
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   It includes, and now this is, this is from the Verge.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   This is what they say.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   It will include major broadcast network, hundreds in quotes, fiber channel, fiber channels,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   and on demand movies and shows.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   But what, what I haven't seen, and maybe this is in one of the other articles here,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   but I haven't seen actually how they're going to deliver this.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Well, you got to gig a bit.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   They have these three boxes.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   There's a TV box.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Are they a part of the name?
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   There's a DVR storage box.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   And then there's the network box.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   You also, we forgot to mention they throw in an XS7 tablet as your remote control.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Right.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Right.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   I love that.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   And isn't there a tool for, I've tie in somehow?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   You get a terabyte of Google drive space.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Sure.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Why not throw it in?
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.240]   Now, I'm looking at the Google, this is the Google fiber web page, and it says all your
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.000]   favorite channels and more.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.720]   And it looks like they have in fact done the deals.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:09.560]   You can pay extra and get HBO, skin, a max, stars, show time.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:13.720]   But it looks like you've got, well, it says Google fiber is always getting better.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.640]   We're constantly adding new channels.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.200]   So clearly they're, you know, these are, they've got the discovery channels.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.400]   They've got Comedy Central.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.400]   That's good.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.640]   They're going to be in the band three basic cable.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.640]   It's kind of like basic.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.640]   They don't have phones.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.640]   They're going to be in there.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.640]   No phone.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.560]   They don't have CNN.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.040]   They don't have MSNBC.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.440]   They've got Bravo, but they don't have AMC.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.800]   So there's, they're gaps.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.480]   You can't watch Breaking Bad.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.680]   They have MTV.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.280]   But I think this is early, right?
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.600]   Who knows what will happen when they roll off?
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.640]   Well, I would take it in the flash.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:51.640]   And with a gigabit up and down, you've got plenty of room to have very good HD content
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.720]   and still have unlimited, virtually unlimited bandwidth.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.120]   What I'm wondering, and again, I should have researched this a little bit more, is are these
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.280]   boxes Motorola boxes?
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.200]   They don't look like it, but that's an interesting question.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.680]   I wonder if the technology inside came from Motorola.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.680]   They own them might as well.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.680]   Right.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:07.680]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.680]   So there's, maybe there was a little bit more to this Motorola.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:14.200]   The TV box looks a lot like the Sony Google TV that they just announced, doesn't it?
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.200]   They've got to make a do, to handle that speed.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.360]   I mean, don't forget, cable boxes are the dumbest beast on Earth.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.640]   This is the purpose, right?
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.640]   This has to be new.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:27.320]   I mean, you know, some known card to throw into the box and the loss on this hardware
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.320]   has to do with it.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:34.000]   The network box also has three by three MIMO antennas and AO 2.11 ABG and N with dual concurrent
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   radios.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.520]   I mean, this is state of the art stuff.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.520]   It's a serious equipment.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.560]   Not AC, but at least N.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.560]   Yep.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:44.360]   Well, all I could say is want.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:50.600]   My real question though is, is this a business for Google that they plan to put in other cities?
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:55.920]   Or is this a Neenor Neenor Neenor ISP's warning them you ought to do better?
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.080]   Or we could, you know, Google's never going to say if it's not really a plan to go in other
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.080]   cities.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.080]   They may be a huge money loser.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.080]   We don't know.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.080]   I think it's the latter.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.880]   I think I think it, you can see the feature stories coming.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.400]   It says, wow, look what they have in Kansas City and everybody gets jealous.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.600]   And we have yet another reason to be really mad at our cable companies, not that they
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.600]   care.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.360]   I think it's an experiment.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.560]   I mean, I really think it's a business.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.040]   Is it a experimental or?
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.040]   Not yet.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.040]   Or demonstration.
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.040]   Which do you think?
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.040]   Yeah, there is a difference there.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.160]   I would say it's an experiment at this point.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.960]   I would say it's still in the experimental phase.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.960]   So what do they want to do?
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.160]   If it's an experiment, demonstration is Neenor Neenor.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.480]   Experiment is they want to learn things.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.840]   What do you think they want to learn mostly?
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.440]   Well, I think that they're learning.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.440]   I mean, they already started deploying a lot of fiber between their own data centers,
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.440]   right?
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.360]   So they've got a lot of experience in doing fiber.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.600]   I think this is an experiment to say, look, we think we can take this to the next stage.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.840]   Let's pick a city and see if we can actually deploy it number one, right?
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.520]   So you've got the technical requirements.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.520]   Does it work?
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.520]   Can we deliver the service?
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.760]   But then the big question is, does it make money?
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.040]   Does it pay off?
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.640]   And I think that's the experimental part.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:07.080]   Is this going to, I think this is a experiment to see whether they can actually do this at
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.440]   scale and turn it into a business model?
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.440]   They do have.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.440]   I might make a trip.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.440]   Yes, that's right.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.160]   I think it's to Kansas City.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:21.960]   They have opened the Google Fiber Cafe where you can relax and enjoy refreshments and discover
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.960]   your fiberhood.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.960]   They have a couple of Chromebooks there.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:25.960]   They have a Chromebooks there.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.160]   They make that word up.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.160]   They did.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.160]   It says, "Discover your fiberhood."
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:37.360]   Well, I mean, you know, this feeds into all of their products and all of their services,
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.440]   connecting the world's information.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:45.520]   You know, if they can wire everybody up with Superfest Internet, the peer-to-peer capabilities
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.360]   are just crazy insane and mind-boggling.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.920]   Does it make them money?
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.240]   Not the issue.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.320]   The more people use the Internet, the more Google makes that they don't have to worry
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.320]   about it.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.320]   So they don't have to worry about it.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.320]   It's just plain true.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.320]   Just use it and we'll worry about the rest.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.560]   Nexus 7, they're losing money on it for a reason because it's a single generator.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.400]   The more we use it, and by the way, I love it, the more they make money.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.400]   Period.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.400]   That's the rule.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.400]   That's a good business model.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.400]   I like it.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.400]   It is.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.400]   It is.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   Right?
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.400]   Eat as many as you want.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.400]   We'll make more.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:27.840]   Well, I just, it makes, it's no question that there's kind of general widespread awareness
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:31.080]   of this, even among the regular public, that it makes people want it.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.880]   They're getting very, you know, antsy.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.080]   They're saying, "Well, why can't we have that?"
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:39.360]   I mean, Google really should do, and they really should do a junket like Hollywood does.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.760]   And bring in tech people and have them come into homes and talk to little Johnny and
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.840]   then grandma and what they're doing with it.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.840]   Hi.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.840]   I'm George Kluge.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.840]   You can just imagine.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.840]   How is your fiber hood?
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:55.600]   I'm like every tech conference to automatically be in Kansas City now.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.800]   Like, can we move South by Southwest to Kansas City?
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.800]   You know?
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.800]   South City be cute.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.000]   Okay.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.640]   I mean, it's pretty clear.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:13.760]   I guess it's pretty clear that everybody wants it.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:19.240]   It's unclear whether Google is making money on this or it is a business model that makes
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.880]   sense.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:25.280]   It's also unclear whether Google's plan is to extend this anywhere past this area.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:33.000]   You can expect cable companies to come in and argue that this is an oligarchic move on
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.320]   Google's part and trying to prime the notion the economics are unrealistic and impossible.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.680]   Well, you know, what I haven't seen is any counter programming from other ISPs yet.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.680]   I wonder.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:48.440]   Or it's not because they know Google is not going to move right now and so they don't
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.440]   move.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.440]   Right.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.440]   I mean, it's the airline model.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.440]   Keep your prisoner.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.560]   And they were, I mean, I remember they fought pretty heavily against some of the other cities
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:02.520]   that were trying to do, you know, implement their own fiber services in towns.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.480]   Wasn't it Pittsburgh or Philadelphia, maybe?
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.360]   That was that definitely right.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.840]   And I remember one house to it.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:10.840]   And well, the other thing is it is happening though.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.840]   I'm wrong on this.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.840]   God, the pixelation.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:19.680]   So Verizon is now offering, you know, the higher speeds and the competitors Verizon are
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   stepping up there.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.680]   On the one hand, that's good news.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:26.760]   The other hand is bad news because it does start to create this precedent of having to
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.560]   buy the tears.
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.960]   And what's interesting about Google is beyond the basic level.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.120]   Once you bought the hundred or the gig, it's unlimited.
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.600]   They put no limits on you.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.960]   And that's a fundamentally different model from where the cable companies are headed,
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:44.240]   which is to try to tear you in speeds and then probably in usage.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.240]   Yep.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:54.840]   Well, it's, it's, I'm just surprised that it might, maybe the cable companies must believe
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:58.760]   that Google is not a threat or they would be counter programming.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.760]   That's maybe yes.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.800]   I just think they, they feel like they've got such a big lead right now.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.520]   Let's just wait and see.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.760]   Let's just see what happens.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.840]   But I bet you they're preparing ads right now.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.160]   What would an anti Google fiber had say?
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.000]   Oh, you see it right now.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   You see it with.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.800]   I can't possibly say.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.800]   Verizon.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:21.000]   Well, but they see the argue against, you, you, in my market, you watch cable vision,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.760]   argue against Verizon and see people come back or they have this frustration or they don't
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.880]   have this, they don't have that.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.600]   And then you see the argument against satellite and dish.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:33.640]   So they do a lot of negative political campaign against each other in this market.
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.640]   Right.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.640]   Right.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.280]   So I'm in an overbuilt market and I have Verizon.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:45.200]   Or does Comcast Verizon AT&T go to their man in Washington?
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.840]   Because this is what they did against Civic Wi-Fi, right?
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:54.760]   In Pitt in Pennsylvania, Philly, they, they rolled out against the Wi-Fi.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:55.760]   Well, I don't know.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.760]   It doesn't matter.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:57.840]   You just make one up.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:00.320]   They roll out of Wi-Fi.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:05.760]   And so Verizon and Comcast went to Congress and said, you know, so here's the story they
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.760]   made up for this one.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.640]   They said, well, you know, if the governments get into the business, that's very anti American
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.400]   because they're kind of undermining big, you know, businesses ability to make money
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:18.640]   in a market and government shouldn't be competing with us.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   And they got laws.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.240]   It's actually they got laws in almost every state of the union.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.240]   They didn't do it.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.240]   Congress.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.240]   They did it locally.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.480]   I mean, you can't have civic Wi-Fi.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.360]   Google's not government yet.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:37.120]   Well, you know, Google is in as a trust is a monopoly and they're using their monopoly
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:43.560]   on the internet to foster to get into a business that is they do not belong in.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.840]   And I think the FTC should investigate this.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:50.240]   It's probably a dumpy no have how long before the FTC investigation?
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:55.640]   Because second it'll be a dumpy on house in Kansas City, Missouri or whatever.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.000]   Why am I giving them ideas?
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.640]   The FTC or the FCC?
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:03.680]   Well, the FTC is gets involved in antitrust.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.880]   What could the FCC be?
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:07.440]   I think the FCC would be completely for this, right?
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.440]   Because there's the whole competition.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.440]   It's their broadband plan.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.440]   Is there a national broadband plan?
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.440]   Exactly.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.440]   Exactly.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:16.440]   Not only that, but you know, basically these cable companies have a monopoly in these markets.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:17.800]   It's not nationwide.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.960]   But most places you can only get one cable.
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.160]   I can't get two different cable companies, right?
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:26.360]   Most places you get Comcast or you get Time Warner or you get something else.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:32.840]   Now with Google coming in, you get, oh, not only are the cable companies in DSL, but
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.240]   now I've got this Google thing.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.480]   I mean, competition is good, especially for this type of thing.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.480]   Oh, we want it.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.040]   I think I see it with the FCC.
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.120]   Yeah, this is actually good.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.120]   It was the FCC.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.120]   No, this is the name of that.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.360]   They gave these companies their monopolies and duoples.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.360]   That's true.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:48.600]   Saying, well, you know, if you're going to install copper in the ground, you have to own that
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.240]   market forever and ever and ever.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.240]   So who knows?
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.440]   I think they've turned it around across with this administration.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.440]   I hope so.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.640]   Yeah, they got the national broadband plan.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.280]   They recognize the need to get internet everywhere, even in rural areas where there's
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.400]   no money to be made and they recognize the need for competition.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:10.440]   I think the FCC perhaps even recognizes that they blew it and they need to write that wrong.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.440]   I hope so.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.440]   Here's where you're right.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:16.000]   I think you'll have Congress, somebody in Congress will come and do a Saturday press
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:23.680]   conference saying that this is unfair competition and dumping of technology on a market by the
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.400]   monopolistic Google and they'll ask for investigations.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.840]   That's why you see this play out.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.040]   Dumping, that's it.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.040]   It's dumping.
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:37.040]   It's the list of who gets the most money from the cable companies and that's who'll be calling
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.040]   the press companies.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:44.160]   Somebody in a chat room said they saw on Google+, that somebody in the area was already being
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.680]   offered six months of free show time.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.360]   If you don't switch away from our fine cable company.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.360]   Interesting.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.360]   Let it begin.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.360]   I don't know.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.360]   Weeds is worth holding onto.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:58.000]   Well, God, I'd love to live in Kansas City.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.120]   Even if you don't get the fiber, you're going to have people throwing money at you saying,
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.680]   "Don't switch."
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:07.200]   We'd hate to have a happy neighborhood of fiberhood users.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.200]   Here's the ad.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:12.240]   This is the fiber ad that they were airing in some of those markets.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:24.800]   We're looking at a street, a guy's coming down it on a little moped and he's stopped
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.280]   in front of a home.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   He's looking around.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.160]   He looks kind of like the guy from Breaking Bad.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.400]   Oh, really fast broadband is the guy.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.040]   That's the really fast broadband guy.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.040]   He's going to move it.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.040]   Here comes a motorcycle.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.640]   He's a motorcycle.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:42.000]   I would guess this would be even faster broadband.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   Ooh, Google Fiber.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.440]   Oh, Google Fiber is on a motorcycle.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.680]   Compasses on a motorcycle.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:51.080]   Oh, they're going to race.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:54.040]   They're going to race.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:59.440]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.520]   And there goes the moped.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.160]   Pudding along motorcycle.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.160]   Huh.
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.320]   That's kind of a production ad.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.320]   Kind of a pedestrian ad.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.320]   It really wants Google Fiber.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.320]   I could have had that.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.720]   The hops don't like motorcycles like that.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.720]   Is that really the ad?
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.720]   Google Fresno.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:17.720]   What?
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:18.720]   Oh, this was no.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.400]   Oh, this was not a this was not this was Fresno.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.400]   No wonder.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.360]   That was part of their bid to get that out.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.160]   Forget I mentioned it.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:30.480]   I was misinformed.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:35.400]   Google Wallet overhauled support for major credit and debit cards.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.800]   Ah, big news.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.800]   Now a new remote disable feature as well.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.400]   So somebody steals or you lose your phone, you could disable a Google Wallet.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.240]   That's certainly going to be a concern for some people.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.280]   So it's an NFC enabled app.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:52.120]   And for the first few months, it was Citibank only, right?
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:53.840]   You had a Citibank card.
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.840]   Right.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:58.400]   Or the Google Google had their own gift card basically type thing.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:02.440]   But if I have but I have a Google account, but that wouldn't work, right?
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.440]   No, it wouldn't work.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.760]   So now MasterCard Visa, American Express, Discover, Credit, and Google.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:11.000]   And debit cards all supported.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Wow.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.840]   I'm going to download Google Wallet.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.040]   Do I have to have an X's phone?
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.560]   Can I put it on a regular Android phone?
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.000]   That as long as it has NFC.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:25.840]   Has to have NFC and they actually announced several different phones that this would work
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.640]   for now that it wasn't working for before.
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:28.840]   I have my Galaxy S3.
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.400]   Can I put it on there?
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.400]   It's got an NFC.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:32.400]   Yes, I believe so.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.040]   And by the way, it says now anything you use with Google checkout will work.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.360]   So if you have Google checkout and it's working for you, good news.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.360]   Yep.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.560]   So that's the big difference is that before they were kind of like two separate systems.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.560]   Yeah, I didn't even bother downloading it because I don't have a Citibank card.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.560]   Right.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:50.440]   One that you could use before and then you got that free $10 Google card.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:54.440]   And so I was putting money on that and then I had it my phone broke actually.
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:58.360]   And I got another phone while the Google Wallet is tied to your phone.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.360]   Right.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.880]   So I actually had to call a special number and get that money transferred over.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.520]   Luckily I thought about it before I sent the phone back because your account number, the
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.480]   only way you can get that is on the phone.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.280]   Just a heads up for those of you replacing your phone using Google Wallet.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:14.040]   And if you lose your phone, and so you should write your account number down.
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.640]   Yeah, I think there's a way to get it back.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:18.400]   If you call them and you're like, I don't have my phone anymore there, you can go through
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.640]   the trouble and get your account number and everything.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.640]   But I have my app.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.400]   There's ways to do it, but it's just a hassle.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.400]   But this is great news.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:30.960]   And the fact that they allow you to remotely disable, unfortunately, Google Wallet is not
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.880]   yet available for your device or mobile network.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:33.880]   That's a galaxy.
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.080]   Unlocked Galaxy S3 and AT&T.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.080]   That's probably why.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.080]   Aww.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:39.080]   What do you mean that's probably a lot?
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:40.880]   Well, if it's the unlocked version, did you get that?
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.280]   What are you searching for, Leo?
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:43.280]   Google Wallet?
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.280]   It won't work.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.280]   I just installed it.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.280]   It says I'm not supported.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.280]   You probably have to have the official one.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.280]   I have to have like an official one.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.360]   This is the unlocked European one and that's their punishment.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.360]   Yep.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.360]   Yep.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.480]   I spent $650 on this phone and they're punishing me.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.760]   There's ways around that, Leo, if you want me to help you out.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.760]   Should I root it?
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:50:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.800]   You can root it and make it work.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:05.440]   But the thing that's cool about this is the fact that you can also remotely disable.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.040]   That's a big feature, a big security feature.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.040]   Yes.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.560]   And they've really needed that for a while now because people lose their phones all the
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:12.560]   time.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.560]   They get stolen.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.040]   I think it's one of the more common things to steal right now.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.040]   So...
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.040]   Oh, it is huge.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.040]   Yep.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:23.960]   We talked about this a couple of months ago that New York taxi cabs, if you leave a phone
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:28.240]   in a taxi cab, the cab driver could return it, could call the police, give it to them,
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:31.520]   or could drive it to this guy who stands there on the corner waiting for cab drivers to
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.120]   drive by with phones.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.720]   And if you've wiped it, he'll give you whatever, 20 bucks.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.520]   If it's unwiped, he'll give you 50 bucks because all the data that's still on there
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.040]   is really useful.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.520]   So just a word of warning.
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:43.520]   Don't...
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.520]   It'll definitely get consumers more comfortable with the idea of...
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.520]   You've got to be able to wipe it.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:48.520]   ...taking money from...
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:49.920]   You've got to be able to wipe it.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:50.920]   And mine is rooted.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.840]   I have a unsupported version.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.400]   Mine says unsupported device, but it actually works.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:58.000]   And the new app is out now, so I'm going to have to go...
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   Now you have a Nexus.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Re-do this.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Yeah, this is a Galaxy Nexus.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   So you would think that that would not be a problem at all.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.600]   But this is Verizon's Galaxy Nexus.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:06.520]   So you have the opposite problem.
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:07.520]   You have a carrier phone.
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.760]   I have a non-carrier phone.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.760]   But neither of us can run it.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:10.920]   Neither of them work.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:14.120]   So, but if I root this, I should be able to...
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.120]   I believe it will.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.120]   All right, well, I'm just gonna...
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:17.120]   What about your Nexus 7?
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:20.600]   Yeah, it's available for the Nexus 7 as well.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.600]   That has NFC?
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.600]   Yes.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.600]   Yeah, it does.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.600]   All right, well, there you go.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.240]   But the problem with this is it's Wi-Fi only.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.200]   So it's going to be completely useless when I go to the coffee shop.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.960]   No, it's gonna take your back pocket.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.960]   Wait a minute, it will still work without internet?
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.520]   Yeah, I believe it will still work.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:40.080]   Because what it does is it tells the chip on the device how much money you've got.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.080]   And then it keeps...
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:42.080]   So there's two tracking mechanisms.
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:43.560]   One in the cloud and one on the device.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.520]   Dr. Momm is confirming what you said.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.520]   Say again?
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.520]   What am I looking up?
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.520]   Google Wallet?
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.520]   Yeah, Google Wallet.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.520]   There's a post in the...
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:52.520]   It comes up with somebody else's.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.520]   Show notes.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.520]   Oh, you know what?
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.000]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.720]   On the Nexus 7, they don't offer it.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.480]   It's not showing up in the store on the Nexus.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.480]   So, but all...
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.280]   Oh, that sucks.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:10.000]   Dr. Momm and our chatroom who has an official AT&T Galaxy S3 in a brilliant, beautiful nail
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.440]   polish red, by the way, says it does work on hers.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.440]   Yeah, it says it.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.440]   It's a count on one customer.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.440]   Congratulations, Dr. Momm.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:18.880]   The balloons are coming down from the ceiling right now.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.600]   I want the red one.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.600]   I'd buy the red one.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:25.240]   All right, one more time.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.040]   Here is the official, I hope so.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:31.080]   If this is from the city of Peoria, I'm going to really be peeved.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.080]   Google Fiber.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.080]   Is this for Google Fiber?
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.640]   Google Fiber at one more time.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:35.640]   Let's see.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.120]   This is the official one.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.120]   Modem sounds.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.120]   That's good.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.120]   Oh, he's a good sign.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:41.120]   Oh, these...
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.120]   You know what?
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.120]   This little car model is actually at the Fiber Cafe in Kansas City.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.120]   You can go to it.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:51.000]   So, there's a train going by with a song downloading, moving fairly slowly, maximum speed 56K.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.920]   So, that's the old days.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.920]   That's Modems.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.760]   These cars are moving around.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.000]   They're little play cars.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   I'm describing this for the home audience.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.560]   And they're waiting and waiting and waiting.
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:02.560]   Because they're still at 56K.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.200]   I love the green light that's loading.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.200]   That's hilarious.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.200]   Loading.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.200]   Loading.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:12.480]   And then the highway that you get on the information is super highway.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.400]   And it's moving in a very...
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.440]   Oh, there's a telephone.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:17.520]   This is cute.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:22.520]   This is actually a physical real model that you can go see if you live in Kansas City,
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:23.520]   Missouri.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:25.080]   Speed limit, 10 megabits per second.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.080]   Oh, things are speeding up.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.080]   We're getting broad now.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.920]   Things are getting better.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:32.560]   Still a traffic jam, but your inbox at least is moving along.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:36.040]   Little Gmail cubes there.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.200]   Spam, uh-oh.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:41.160]   Drop bridge up.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.160]   One gigabyte.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.160]   One and a half gigabytes.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.160]   Two gigabytes.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.920]   Two point to gigabytes is a little container ship carrying data.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.360]   Now we're going to tunnel in.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.360]   Here we go to Fiberland.
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:57.880]   Your speed, one gigabit per second.
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:54:58.880]   This is cute.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.800]   Yeah, that's pretty cute.
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.840]   It's just fun.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.040]   And the song is what we've got.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:10.040]   Just what I needed.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:15.040]   The next chapter starts here 100 times faster than at 100 times the possibilities.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.720]   Google fiber.com/fiber.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:18.720]   That was cute.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:19.720]   Yeah, that was good.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:20.960]   You got what I needed.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.800]   That's a subliminal messaging.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.960]   Yeah, you know, for some reason I feel like that's just what I needed.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.480]   I don't know why.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:31.120]   Me too.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:32.720]   We all do.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:35.080]   We all do my friend.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.920]   Google has partnered with NFL.com for Google Hangouts.
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:38.920]   Just another one of them.
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:41.320]   I tell you this hangout thing.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:46.520]   It will power the NFL.com fantasy football experience.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.680]   New York Times is one of those things that if you're wondering whether
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:57.880]   Google is bullish on going social or not, I think doing a deal with the NFL and embedding
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:02.880]   Google Hangouts for fantasy football is a sign they're sticking with it.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.960]   So you're going to see this everywhere on NFL.com.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:10.480]   Maybe Hangouts might be the real success of Google Plus.
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:16.640]   But I don't find people are just spontaneously hanging out, which is what Google always hoped
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:17.640]   for.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:18.640]   They're pushing it with these deals.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.280]   Well, the few times that I've gone in and said, "All we try to just hang out right now,
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:22.920]   nothing kind of really happens."
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:25.200]   It really wants to do that.
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.200]   That's hard to believe.
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:29.800]   I mean, someone like I was saying before with my experience was I started at OneUp, just
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.400]   made it public and all these people came.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.400]   I'm surprised, Jeff, with your...
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:36.400]   I haven't done it in a little while, but you know, yeah, I've just found that it kind
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:37.400]   of just sits there.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.400]   Wow.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:39.400]   Maybe it's me.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.000]   No, I would expect the opposite.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.800]   Yeah, you'd think.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:44.800]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.760]   No, you're enough of that guy.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:52.920]   The idea with this deal is you provide the context and the reason for chatting.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:57.840]   They've expanded it to 12 people, so you can get your whole fantasy team in there and
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:01.560]   chatting and talking smack and doing all that stuff.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:04.560]   So what do you think about that, Jeff?
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.560]   I mean, I heard you...
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.240]   It was yesterday on Marketplace.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.720]   I think you were talking about something similar with Twitter.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:10.720]   What?
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.720]   Well, the whole Twitter kerfuffle.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:15.720]   Oh, we haven't gotten here yet.
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:17.720]   We haven't gotten here yet.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:19.960]   Hashtag NBC fail, folks.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:26.560]   That, and then the Twitter fail, the huge thing, the NBC fail hashtag has been...
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.000]   is magnificently amusing.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.560]   It's almost better than a bad match.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:37.520]   People complaining about the opening ceremonies, about the tape delay, about stupid commentators,
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.720]   all kinds of things.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.200]   And I got into a huge discussion about that.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.840]   I've been in a huge discussion about this in terms of the models that, of course, people
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:46.000]   say, "Well, you idiot Jarvis.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.760]   Obviously NBC has to force the audience to prime time because that's what the money is."
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.760]   Well, yeah, and no.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:59.280]   The thing is now Twitter is a gigantic spoiler network and everybody knows what the results
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.280]   are long before.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.160]   Yet, NBC's ratings have still been record.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.240]   Now they would argue this because they're forcing us there.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:08.320]   I think that if people could watch the things they want to watch when they want to watch
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:13.200]   it, they would talk about it more in social and they'd have an even bigger audience.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:17.920]   And in any case, NBC is not giving the people what they want when they want it, which is
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:18.920]   very disturbing.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:22.040]   So this is a guardian reporter named Guy Adams.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.840]   No, independent reporter.
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.600]   Independent, sorry.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.800]   Did what?
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.640]   He went along and he fetched.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:32.720]   I'm actually a few of them are very mad because then he was labeled the number one NBC
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:37.440]   fail hater and by God, I wanted that gold medal myself.
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.720]   But Guy went and complained and complained and complained.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:43.920]   And then finally, he said, number for the guy's name, he put in the email address of the
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.080]   executive in charge of NBC's sports.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:49.080]   Gary Zellnick is it?
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.080]   Zinkle.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:51.080]   Zinkle.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:54.200]   And he put in an email address and the email address was pretty straightforward.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:59.520]   It was first name dot last name at NBC UI dot com, and uni dot com.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:02.640]   And next thing he knew was account was just killed.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:06.640]   Now then there was a lot of forensic effort to say, well, okay, well, did he violate the
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.640]   rules?
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:11.920]   So if you're not allowed to reveal personal information about somebody.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:16.000]   Personal email, and unpublished personal email, the argument here was, number one, it had
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   been published before.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.200]   And number two, it was very standard.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.200]   Number three was corporate.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:23.480]   And then number four, Twitter by its policy is supposed to come to the user and say, there's
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.840]   been a complaint about you.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:26.680]   Will you take this down before?
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.480]   And then instead they just cut it out.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:32.280]   Then it comes out that Twitter said this was a result of a complaint from NBC.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:36.400]   But then NBC said, no, no, no, Twitter came to us and told us to complain.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:41.160]   So we did because NBC and Twitter are, of course, in bed together.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:47.240]   In fact, if you've watched the Olympics, you'll see full screen and hashtag Olympics with
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:48.640]   the Twitter logo and everything.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:51.120]   I mean, there's definitely an excess between the two.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:57.200]   So then the chief counsel of Google did finally, they finally reinstated Guy Adams.
[00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.200]   Oh, they did.
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.200]   Yes, they did.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:03.400]   And they admitted that what had happened here was someone in the commercial team had
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.280]   gone to NBC.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.080]   And then the complaint team was not aware of this.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.680]   So when a complaint came from NBC, they just automatically just did it.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.680]   Now they still violated it.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.600]   And I think there's probably more lines of communication there than Twitter is admitting.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.200]   So you know, we're at Stasis again now.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.920]   The problems are that I don't think that I think the Twitter started down the road and
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:28.480]   did apologize and apologized for basically censoring content.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:32.040]   And Twitter has done honorable things politically when it came to the Arab Spring, of course,
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.400]   and WikiLeaks and Occupy Wall Street.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.840]   But when it came to a commercial relationship, this is the first test of their principles
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.480]   in church versus state.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.480]   And they fail.
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.240]   And they fail pretty badly, I think.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:48.280]   Let me underscore that he was not in violation of terms of service.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:52.360]   Even people might say, well, it's still an email address, but it's in the terms of service,
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:57.320]   it does say specifically if information was previously posted or displayed elsewhere on
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:02.680]   the internet prior to being put on Twitter, it is not a violation of this policy.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.960]   And that email address had been published.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:10.760]   He offered to Twitter a link where it was clearly visible.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.800]   So he did not in fact violate the terms of service at all.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.840]   No, and they still haven't admitted all that was wrong.
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:21.520]   They said what's wrong was that we went and we proactively looked at content and then
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.760]   initiated this complaint.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.920]   But I think there's a much bigger discussion here, obviously, about the responsibilities
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.400]   of a platform that, and some people say to me, Jarvis, this is a business.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.880]   It's not a free speech platform.
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:35.280]   No, it's a speech platform.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.360]   And if speech there is not free, then we're not going to trust it, then it's not a platform
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.360]   anymore.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.560]   And it's not just used for silly complaints about tape delays on the Olympics.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.960]   It's used for revolutions.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.200]   It's used for journalism and information.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.760]   It's used for people sharing information in crises.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.600]   It's now something that we depend upon.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:59.440]   And if we cannot trust Twitter to put us paramount above those sponsor economic relationships,
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:00.880]   then we can't trust it.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.360]   And it's not a platform.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.920]   And that is a discussion that we still have to have.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.680]   Twitter went a long way, but the discussion ain't over, folks.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.680]   Right.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:10.680]   And there's no us.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:11.880]   There's no tweets.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.440]   There's no sponsors, right?
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:19.120]   And we came to Twitter because we're all there talking about things and mentioning things.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.120]   And you can't have it.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:23.240]   You can't decide, oh, we only want it when it's good.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.240]   When it's bad, it's naughty and you should take action.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.760]   And plus there was already precedence on the site.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:34.480]   Celebrities have tweeted people's phone numbers and email addresses because they were being
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.080]   stopped.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.280]   And their accounts never disappeared.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:43.920]   So this was clearly a sponsor over a user decision like Jeff mentioned.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.760]   And what that means is they've got to come up with the culture.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.840]   The irony here is I think they've got to learn the lesson that newspapers had to learn
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:54.080]   long ago when sponsors came in to free us from ownership from political parties and
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.520]   sponsors gave us independence.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.800]   What we had to have independence from the sponsors in turns, we built what we called
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:03.120]   church state walls that you couldn't do certain things that you guaranteed no influence from
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.120]   the sponsor.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.480]   Now, of course, newspapers have lost most of their trust.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:10.240]   They've lost it for all kinds of reasons, like putting up crap and killing the products
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:13.680]   badly and not bringing the digital age and so on and so forth.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:18.760]   So I'm not saying any newspapers are pure, but I am saying that this is a discussion that's
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:19.960]   been had.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.320]   And the question becomes really, is Twitter just a tech company?
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.520]   No, Twitter is more than that.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.560]   It's something we depend upon.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.000]   And this is where people like Dave, why don't we come along and say, well, you're getting
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.840]   what you're what you sow here, folks.
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:31.840]   That's right.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.840]   You're putting your your lot, including journalism itself in the hands of a private company.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.840]   Private company.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.240]   And this is the whole thing with Bear hug camp.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.680]   And we talked about this a lot.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.200]   It's why I quit Twitter in the beginning was I really felt like it was a silo and they
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:50.840]   didn't seem like they really cared and that that's why I supported Evan prodromo's status
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.720]   dot net, which was an open source federated version of Twitter that wasn't controlled
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.520]   by any one company.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.880]   We we signed up for it.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.280]   We signed up for Twitter.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.160]   Is there a precedent, Jeff?
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.880]   For I wonder if there's a historical precedent and as our resident historian, maybe you can
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:12.440]   invoke Haber-Moss or Gutenberg, but is there a precedent for a private company becoming
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.560]   so critical?
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:20.800]   Is it AT&T perhaps critical to the nation and to the common wheel that it.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.920]   Is suddenly held to a higher standard and is no longer able to act as a private company.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:27.960]   But then there's the danger that I'm going to sound like a libertarian now, which I play
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.840]   one on TV, though I vote Democratic and voting booth.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.520]   And I also want to be careful about that.
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.320]   I don't want government to come in and say, "Uh-huh.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:38.360]   Now we have to take over and we have to have a role in this and we're going to we're going
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:42.200]   to start to manage Twitter and Google and Facebook as public utilities."
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:43.480]   I don't agree with that either.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.720]   I want to keep government out of this.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.360]   So that is the precedent AT&T.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:53.000]   It is the best company created long lines, created a way of communicating that became
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.480]   universal and the government said, "Okay, now you're a utility and we regulate."
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:02.040]   And the difference was that they were granted government polls and government space and
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:05.000]   franchises and so on and Twitter has not been.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.560]   But I do think that what has to happen, and I think it was the Neil Dash who said, "Let's
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.920]   have a constructive discussion about this."
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:15.400]   And I agree, there needs to be a discussion with Twitter about what the principles are,
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.440]   what principles do we hold them up to?
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.960]   What standards do we hold them up to in our community?
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.480]   Because we're the ones who have to do this.
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:23.600]   And this is the argument I made, pardon for the plug, in public parts, that we have to
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:27.680]   have a discussion about the principles of the tools of publicness, what we're protecting
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:31.000]   from government, what we're protecting from the companies and interests, so that we also
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.440]   give companies something to hide behind.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.880]   They can say, "Oh, sorry.
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:34.880]   This is what we have to do."
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:38.520]   When I worked on newspapers, it was very convenient for a publisher to be able to say
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:43.120]   to a pissed off advertiser, "I wish I could do something, but I can't."
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:47.360]   Because here are the rules I operate under, and you've got to understand our asset is
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.640]   credibility, and that's why it has to operate this way.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:51.640]   And I cannot go and influence that.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.840]   And we'll Twitter has to learn those same lessons, and I think we in technology have
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:59.800]   to hold some kind of discussion, some kind of sessions to be able to have that discussion.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.520]   So it doesn't just happen inside Twitter.
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.200]   It happens around Twitter.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:07.840]   I really feel like, I still want to get back to that idea of status net, that we really
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:11.960]   ought to, "Okay, granted, we might need some sort of internet-based signaling system that's
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:16.600]   as important as a phone system, but should it not be an open source federated system
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.240]   that no one company owns?"
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.600]   That's what I've always thought.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.720]   But of course, people go with what's convenient.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.600]   Nobody else is aware of this issue.
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:25.600]   Yep.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:26.600]   That's the problem.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:29.880]   I mean, Twitter is one of a handful of companies that I think is so ripe for a competitor
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.880]   like this, an open competitor.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.760]   Well, status net was really well done.
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:38.280]   It's so hard for them to get a foothold.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.720]   I mean, Twitter has such a handle on all of their users.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.520]   It's the network effect.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:46.400]   Once you have that critical mass of users, it's very difficult to unseat.
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.880]   Well, now you see why they're spending so much time and they have a team that works
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.760]   with NBC during the Olympics.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.760]   Right.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.720]   I mean, they've been building that relationship for years.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.960]   So they have that relationship.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:01.640]   It's not like someone's going to come along and say, "Hey, guys, you should put r#r symbol
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.640]   in."
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:07.640]   NBC is going to, if they see somebody else become as, I mean, NBC is just following where we're
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:08.640]   going.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.640]   Yep.
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.640]   It's not NBC.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.640]   You have to convince.
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.880]   They're not going to march into some social network where nobody is.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.880]   It's the people.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:16.880]   Yep.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:21.080]   But somebody asked me, I think it was Tonya, actually, a couple of days ago, "Well, is
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:26.160]   there going to be somebody that replaces Facebook as MySpace was replaced by Facebook
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.920]   or that replaces Twitter?"
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:31.960]   And I'm starting to think that we are getting out of the size where you will not see somebody
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.760]   come along and think the same thing happens with the people.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.080]   Well, here's the question.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:39.600]   If you were Marissa seeing this, I think you start to see an opportunity.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:45.080]   But I think that there was this, on the lineup earlier was Microsoft changing online mail.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.560]   I think mail was essentially broken.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.320]   I think Twitter needs a next generation.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:53.200]   Is there an opportunity there to take the critical mass that she has and rethink it?
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.840]   But how is that any better than it's just another private company?
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.120]   It's competition, at least it's competition.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:02.800]   Now Bill Gross has come along and full disclosure on a nano investor and what he's done in
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:07.360]   Uber Media, but he's basically, he would never put it this way, but he's created a
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.360]   bit of a shadow Twitter.
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:11.480]   It hasn't taken off, but it feeds Twitter.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.960]   It's another place where you can put things that have a life outside of Twitter.
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.640]   And I think that's still possible.
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:20.320]   But what Twitter is going to do is it's going to keep shutting down its API.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:24.720]   It's had all the statements about shutting down the developers even more.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.840]   Zuckerberg also said we may develop more things in-house.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:31.920]   So what happens to the notion of a privately held platform?
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.920]   Is it even possible?
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:38.840]   I mean, I would bring up Craigslist as another example, right?
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.840]   Exactly.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.000]   They're shutting down right now.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.320]   And the story this week, you want to tell about that?
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:50.440]   Well, I mean, the fact that they're suing the developers of these third party apps.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:53.920]   That and then they're also putting new conditions on when you give them content that you're basically
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.400]   licensing it to them.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.400]   Wow.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.400]   Yep.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.400]   And all their web 1.0 goodness.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:01.400]   Wow.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.560]   I mean, I don't know why there isn't another Craigslist.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.080]   I mean, I love Craigslist.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.080]   You know, I use it.
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.080]   It works.
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.080]   But I mean, why isn't there an alternative?
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:11.920]   There's so much I was thinking just after reading some of these third party stories about
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.560]   the third party developers and what they're trying to do.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.720]   I mean, these are all things that Craigslist should be doing.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:16.720]   Right.
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:17.720]   Hold on a second.
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:22.880]   So instead of compete, instead of improve, instead of innovate, lock down, shut down.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:25.720]   So what competes with that?
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:27.200]   I said, there's a few examples of this.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.320]   Netscape was going to own web servers way back in the day.
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.320]   What came along?
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.320]   Apache.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.600]   Microsoft was going to own browsers.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.600]   What came along?
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.600]   Mozilla and Firefox.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.600]   It was benign.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.440]   And it took Mozilla a while to get to get traction.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.680]   In fact, I remember thinking this is a failed open source project.
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.040]   They gave away the code.
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.840]   Nobody did anything to it for years.
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:46.840]   Yep.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:50.520]   And they don't need to win the whole market to have the good influence that they have.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.960]   Now what are the names of the kids who do the Kickstarter project or what's the...
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:54.960]   Diaspora.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.680]   Diaspora, which of course, I'm going to wear on Facebook.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:03.960]   Is there a way to create something that's big enough to keep Twitter honest?
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:08.320]   And even give them cover to say, well, you know, stockholders, we have to do this because
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.320]   look at our competition.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:12.320]   I mean, I guess the market's big enough you could divide it and have.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.440]   We created a status net.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.920]   I think we still have a status net stream called the Twit Army.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:22.080]   And it just didn't get traction because you go where people are.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.720]   Even if it's your Twit crowd, it wasn't enough.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.960]   You go where the people are.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:32.280]   But this is the interesting part about this is and might seem off topic, but you'll understand.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.440]   So Lady Gaga has her own social networks.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.440]   Right.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.440]   Little monsters.
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:38.440]   Yes.
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:39.600]   I thought that was a really good one.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:40.600]   There's an opportunity.
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.320]   It was a brilliant move.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.320]   Bring them in.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:47.800]   She can market to them directly, talk to them directly and not rely on all this noise.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:51.360]   And for that to succeed, I believe, I don't think people are going to be on two different
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.360]   places.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.560]   So people are going to abandon Twitter for Lady Gaga.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.320]   It's only the hardest core Gaga fans.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:01.320]   Good for Gaga doesn't really make a difference in the realm we're talking about.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.400]   People have limited time.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.160]   They have a little bit of attention.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.520]   They're not going to participate in four different Twitter-like social networks.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.520]   It's just not going to happen.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:12.480]   But the irony is Sarah Ross, who's part of the new Waywire company that Cory Booker's
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:16.960]   involved in, I met her recently, she helped, as I understand it, she helped really build
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.560]   on little monsters and she used Twitter to do it.
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.800]   What's exactly what Drew was just saying.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.960]   You find, you exploit Twitter.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:29.520]   So that network effect to get really huge, you're going to have to get the mainstream
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.000]   consumers over to it, right?
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.680]   Because you can get the people that started on Twitter very early.
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:39.000]   And it took years for us to be loud enough to bring people in, to bring brands in, to
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.160]   bring interest in.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.760]   How do you replicate that again?
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.800]   How does Facebook replicate what it created with starting with colleges and keeping it
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.000]   closed?
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.040]   Can someone come along and do that again?
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.160]   Or did they really nail it?
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.920]   I don't believe that innovation is over and it's them forever.
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:01.720]   But boy, it's not as easy as replicating technology.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:05.920]   And I think Google Plus has shown that, bringing it full circle.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:11.720]   Google Plus has shown that as good as it is and as much as us technologists like it for
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:16.280]   the conversations we have there, it's got a long way to go to get up to where, anywhere
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.000]   close to where Facebook is.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   Absolutely.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:25.160]   So how do we find out how well outlook.com, Microsoft's new email ventures doing on Twitter?
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:30.120]   They tweeted 1 million people have signed up for a new modern email experience at outlook.com
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:33.840]   and there's the growth chart, which, you know, when you go from zero to 1 million in
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.360]   a day, it pretty much looks like a straight line.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:39.280]   Microsoft keeps fighting yesterday's battles though, don't they?
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:45.160]   Well, they say we're going to reinvent email, but really it looks to me just like a skinned
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.160]   hotmail.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.160]   You forget what we actually did.
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.160]   It's what it is, isn't it?
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.160]   It's just a hotmail.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.520]   If you're going to reinvent email, you have to have a structure that gets me relevance
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:54.400]   and gets rid of spam.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:58.240]   Well they have a jockmail filtering as I see my spam.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.240]   I know, but it's still not.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.240]   It's not just spam.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:04.560]   It's also people who can bug me who I don't want to bug me.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.000]   It seems like mail is ripe for reinvention.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   Exactly.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.600]   And that's another Marissa operator.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.600]   AOL.
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.840]   AOL mail.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.240]   Just re-skinned.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.240]   Reskinned.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:18.320]   It's not bad.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.960]   Here's the deal with outlook.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:23.400]   It does integrate into Office 365.
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:28.480]   For instance, I see in my quick views in my folders, I also see SkyDrive documents.
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.760]   I see photos that I've shared.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:37.120]   I think that there is some potential there for somebody who's really sold into the Microsoft
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.400]   ecosystem.
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.240]   But it does not reinvent email.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:43.560]   It's the same exact thing as any email.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.560]   I'm going to reinvent the list.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.800]   This is Bob Lyman from Google, sat me down one day and he said, and I'll tell you, Jeff,
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.120]   when email was broken, we talked about this some time ago, it's when the decision was
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:55.080]   made to allow the sender to control.
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.560]   And that's what broke email.
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:00.800]   And so you need a recipient controlled infrastructure, which is an entirely separate infrastructure.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:05.120]   I allow you in to have conversations with me under these terms.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.120]   Yeah, but.
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.120]   I'll let you route.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.920]   You just said a guy at Google told you that.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.360]   What have they done to make it happen?
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.440]   I'll tell you exactly what they did.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.200]   That's the architecture of Google Plus.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:17.000]   So Google Plus is recipient controlled.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.480]   Well, it's not replacing.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.480]   We're not.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.480]   At least we're not.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:26.000]   It became spam where the things they've eliminated.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.280]   And so you are in full control of what you see on Google Plus and you can get rid of
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:31.520]   people, you can get rid of messages, you can get rid of other things.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:34.360]   The only thing that comes in is some measure of comments, spam, and they've made it very
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:35.360]   easy to deal with.
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.160]   Otherwise, it is fully recipient controlled.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:40.680]   So I think that Google Plus is the beginning of a holder for architecture for communication,
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:41.880]   but that's not the way they've set it up.
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.040]   They've set it up as social and be everywhere.
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:47.960]   But I think there's an opportunity to rethink in recipient control and take a subset of
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:48.960]   that.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:51.680]   The irony is Google Plus is actually fairly hard to send a direct message to someone
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.200]   and you're afraid they're going to miss it.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.120]   And it really just turns it into email.
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:57.120]   Exactly.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.120]   Direct messaging is not.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.120]   It's an email message.
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:05.040]   Did you guys see the video for the new outlook.com?
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.040]   No.
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:10.800]   It's kind of interesting because I signed up for this because well, now I need to replace
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.880]   my Hotmail account, which is where all my junk went.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:19.080]   But it was kind of interesting because they show this video of a chalkboard, right?
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:24.120]   And they draw basically a picture of Gmail and they cross out all this stuff.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.520]   And they say, "Oh, we want to get rid of this.
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.520]   We want to get rid of this.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:27.520]   We want to get rid of this."
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.840]   And then you get to the outlook page and it looks like what they just crossed out to
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:32.840]   me.
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:33.840]   Here it is.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:34.840]   Here it is.
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:35.840]   Here it is.
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:36.840]   Here it is.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.840]   Here it is.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:38.840]   Here it is.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:39.840]   Here's the picture.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.760]   Watch the picture.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:41.760]   And then you cross out that.
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.200]   A little bit of fluff at the top.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:45.200]   And they cross out.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.200]   Okay.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:50.280]   A lot of sidebar stuff, which by the way, they replace an outlook with ads.
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.280]   Exactly.
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.280]   Clean UI, intuitive.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.680]   Modern devices, office, SkyDrive, sweep.
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:55.680]   And there it is.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, the brand new outlook email.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:02.520]   You've got the blue paper engineered from the ground up to be completely different.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.520]   I love the use of metaphors.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:04.520]   You're right.
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.520]   It does look the same.
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.920]   It looks exactly the same as what they just crossed out.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:08.920]   Exactly.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:13.400]   And this is blackboard, not a whiteboard and a blueprint, not cat.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:19.560]   This is to me why Microsoft seems like they just, there's something wrong in Redmond.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.560]   What the heck?
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.560]   That's legal.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.720]   You're exactly right.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:25.720]   That's crazy.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.000]   I watched the video and I'm like, are they crossing themselves out?
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.640]   Well, look at, you know, look at mine because what they replaced, you know, they crossed
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.680]   out all those things on the right, the calendar and everything.
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:35.560]   They replaced them with context lens commercials, on lies.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:40.280]   It's like, I don't know why I'm getting glucosamine for dog ads.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:43.160]   But this is not what I want to see in my email, to be honest.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.840]   And I don't think that that's really solved any problems.
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:50.800]   And as for the left part, Microsoft's going overboard with the Metro thing.
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.720]   You're like, we're going to slap this Metro design on everything and you're just going
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:54.720]   to love it.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:59.120]   Well, they need to because they're trying to, this is their antidote to what everybody
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.920]   else, particularly Apple's doing.
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.280]   And so they need to go all in.
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:05.880]   You can't just say, we'll do some Metro in some places.
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:06.880]   This is this is the code.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:07.880]   Even their website.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:09.960]   From its from its very beginning, right?
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:16.600]   From CPM to MS DOS, from Word, Star to Word, you know, from Google search to Bing.
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:17.600]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.960]   It's it's the great cockers.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:23.360]   Microsoft has never ever ever innovated an entirely new product.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.840]   And I'm not criticizing that.
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.800]   It's kind of the Jason Calicon is model too.
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.800]   Right.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:29.800]   Ow.
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.000]   Hey, this is the new Microsoft website, by the way.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.280]   And even this, they stole from the Dutch subway system.
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.280]   So there you go.
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:42.640]   Hey, Leo, did Microsoft tweet out how many of those million users are still active without
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.640]   look back?
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:44.640]   Well, you had to switch.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:47.400]   I switched because I were on Hotmail, right?
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.480]   So Hotmail, by the way, is bigger.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.040]   I'm pretty sure still bigger than Gmail.
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:54.000]   I mean, it's huge because lots of people like Aaron use it for their spam, right?
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.040]   Their spam address.
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.840]   Everybody who has a Microsoft account has a Hotmail account.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:02.120]   So you just, you know, I wanted to get my name at Outlook.com, so I immediately signed
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.120]   up.
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:07.160]   But I'm not going to use it for anything substantial, but you know, it's you got to have it.
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.160]   Well, not only that.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:09.160]   There are some side benefits.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:12.640]   You get a free Office 365 account and stuff like that.
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.160]   Well, I thought I saw it.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.840]   I mean, one of the ways I think they got to this, maybe not.
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:18.080]   I mean, I could be wrong.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:26.360]   But I think that everybody that had a Microsoft live account or an existing Hotmail account,
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.520]   like automatically was in the system, right?
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:32.000]   So I mean, that's one way to get a lot of users is you just take all your existing users
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.440]   and say, boom, now you got it out.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.440]   You mean like Google+,?
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:35.440]   Well, okay, okay.
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:39.280]   That's why these numbers are meaningless at this point.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:40.680]   Yeah, but I think that's the way they did it.
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:44.240]   Now, one thing I will say that's good about this, I mean, as I looked at this was, I think
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.400]   that it needed rebranding, right?
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.400]   Everybody kind of used it.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:50.160]   Like I said, everybody kind of uses Hotmail as their spam.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.160]   It's an embarrassing email address.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.160]   You don't want to be a Hotmail.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.160]   Right.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.120]   I never give that out to a potential employer or something, right?
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.920]   So I mean, I think that they needed to rebrand, which is good.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:02.240]   And the tie in to Office 365 is also key for them.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:05.760]   So as far as business strategy, I think that this makes sense.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.600]   But yeah, we'll see.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.760]   It doesn't look very innovative to me yet.
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:16.040]   Fred Flintstone in her chat room says the top three email, webmail email clients are Gmail,
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.040]   Hotmail and Yahoo!
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:20.840]   So Gmail has built up its, it is now number one.
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:23.680]   What did you, Fred, if you can get me the numbers on those, that'd be great.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.680]   I don't think Fred Flintstone says his real name.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.880]   It could be Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo!
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:28.880]   Mail.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.760]   But then another, as you said, Jeff, opportunity for Merse Meire, Yahoo!
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:33.760]   Yep.
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:34.760]   Yahoo!
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:37.720]   Mail is a big player, could easily impress everybody.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.800]   I thought Yahoo! was number one.
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:40.800]   I thought Yahoo!
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:41.800]   I thought it was still a big good player.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.800]   I thought it was still a big good player.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:43.800]   Nothing were at one point.
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:44.800]   So maybe Fred...
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:45.800]   They are well still has stuff.
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:46.800]   Maybe Fred's living in the past.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:47.800]   It's bad.
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:48.800]   Maybe.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:57.320]   Here we go, Fred's giving me a link to emailmarketingreports.com.
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:04.000]   Often considered the definitive source for email and web statistics.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:11.240]   Google has, according to a blog post in June 2012, 425 million active users.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:14.120]   Comscorced as Hotmail is 350 million.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:15.520]   That was in October 2011.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.520]   Yahoo!
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.320]   Mail, according to Comscor, are 310 million.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:21.560]   So these are numbers, not official.
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:22.560]   Right.
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:26.960]   But that, you know, that I guess it would make sense that by now Gmail would finally have
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:27.960]   surpassed Yahoo!
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:28.960]   And I don't know.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:29.960]   Thank you, Fred Flintster.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:33.000]   Hey, we're going to take a break, come back with more and drool and office here from the
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   next web.com.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   Great to have you, Drew.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   Thank you.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   So nice to have you.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   Your sound is excellent now, by the way.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000]   Thank you for fixing it.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   Oh, good.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   Good, good.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   Yep.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.320]   Also, Aaron Nukem from the source show.
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:46.800]   The source show.org.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.360]   And so many programs here on the Twitter.
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.560]   Yes, we love having them.
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.920]   He also brings donuts, which is nice.
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:53.920]   Bagels.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:54.920]   Bagels, I mean, usually.
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:55.920]   Bagels.
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:56.920]   I brought donuts a couple of times.
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:59.800]   You know, for me, I'm carbohydrate challenge to donut bagel.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.240]   They look exactly the same.
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:02.240]   I can't tell the difference.
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:03.240]   They get a hole.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.240]   They're round.
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.240]   I don't know.
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.240]   What's the difference?
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:07.240]   Also, you're Jeff Jarvis from...
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.240]   And I never bring you anything.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.240]   Buzz machine.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.040]   No bacon, no burgers, not for...
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.240]   Thank you.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:17.000]   The source show, episode 14, Maker Fail 2011.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.520]   Yeah, I haven't updated in a while.
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.040]   It's time to get a new...
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.600]   You know, time to sign up for Squarespace.
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:23.600]   Yeah.
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.120]   I'm just teasing you.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.120]   Just teasing you.
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:28.320]   Still, hey, that was a great Maker Faire.
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.320]   It was.
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:30.320]   It was a great...
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.320]   And I got an interview with the architect guys.
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:32.320]   Kind of interesting.
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.320]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.320]   How they do their shows.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:35.320]   See, there's...
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:36.320]   You're pretty cool.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.320]   Maybe we should help you with this.
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.320]   Well, maybe you should.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.320]   Maybe we should.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.320]   Because we want to do more hacking or making.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.320]   Yep.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.160]   There's the way to get that in there.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.160]   That's what I do.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.160]   You meet.
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.160]   The whole thing.
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.160]   I'll have my people call your people.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.160]   Sounds good.
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.320]   We're brought to you today by Ting.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.320]   I love Ting.
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:53.080]   I'm not alone.
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:56.560]   I'm just looking at tweets for...
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:00.080]   Their Twitter handle is Ting FTW.
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:04.840]   Shivian says, "My 4G Wi-Fi hotspot from Ting and Nexus 7 arrived tomorrow.
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:08.080]   I might be even more giddy than he is."
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:10.880]   Look, Zach says, "Looking for a replacement for one of the Big Three carriers, pay for
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.920]   what you use at Ting FTW.
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:16.320]   I just think Ting is an amazing thing.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:19.320]   Go to Ting.com/twig."
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:22.000]   You can find out a little bit more.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   Ting.com/twig.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   What is Ting?
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   It's an MVNO, but don't let that confuse you.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.160]   It uses the Sprint network.
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:37.160]   If Sprint works well for you, Ting will work well for you.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:40.320]   What it is is you get your phone.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:47.200]   You create a plan, but the beauty of the Ting plans is you pay for exactly what you use.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:52.480]   You pay no extra if you go over, and if you go under, they give you a refund.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:56.200]   When you look at these plans, these are just to give you an idea.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:57.200]   Start with the phone.
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.520]   How many phones do you want?
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:03.400]   It's great for a family or even a small business because you pay $6 for phones.
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.200]   Let's get three phones.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:08.880]   Let's say among those phones, we've got 2,000 minutes.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.320]   We've got 4,000.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.920]   This is a month, text messages.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:14.240]   Let's get all the data we can afford.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:19.680]   The total cost of all of that is $124 a month for three people.
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:21.400]   But get this.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:22.400]   You don't use all that?
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:23.680]   They give you the money back.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:24.680]   You use more.
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:25.680]   No problem.
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.560]   They just charge you at the same rate.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:33.040]   And absolutely free voicemail, picture, video messaging, three-way calling, caller ID.
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:38.840]   I know you really want this tethering and hotspot included free and great phones.
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:39.840]   Two.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:43.800]   Just go look at the devices and you'll see you're not making any compromise when you get a Ting
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:44.800]   phone.
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:46.240]   Ting's the thing.
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:47.760]   I want you to try it.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:55.720]   ting.com/twig, you will get $50 off your device purchase when you use that website.
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:57.000]   So please do.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.880]   If you want to take a look at the savings calculator, this might bring it home.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:01.880]   Get your bill.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:07.360]   Go get your monthly bill and fill in all these forms and you will get a direct comparison
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:11.240]   of what your bill would be versus what the Ting bill would be.
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:13.800]   And it really is kind of spectacular.
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:21.400]   ting.com/twig, a great company trying to bring some clarity, some sense to mobile phone
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.400]   service.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.560]   And I know you're going to like them.
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.400]   ting.com/twig.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:30.560]   We continue on with this week in Google.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.680]   I think we're going to wrap things up.
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:36.760]   There are always more stories on this show than we have time to talk about.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:43.000]   FCC has told Verizon you cannot block tethering apps and find them $1.25 million.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   Yay.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   Yes.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.600]   Because they bought a spectrum that had that condition on it.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:52.680]   However, it does not affect my AT&T unlimited account where I still can't tether or other
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:53.680]   things.
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:55.480]   Important clarification.
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:56.480]   That's kind of a bummer.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.040]   Good reason to root your Android phone.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.040]   Yep.
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:04.720]   The Amazon has updated their cloud player to make it more like iTunes match you automatically.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:10.720]   When you have a matched file, get a 256 kilobits mp3 with no DRM.
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:13.040]   They're going to be on Roku and Sonos soon too.
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:16.120]   So another reason I use Amazon and Google and iTunes.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.120]   I don't care.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.840]   I'll use all three of them.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.800]   The new dig has launched part of the news.me service.
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:23.800]   It's pretty.
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:24.800]   It's nice.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:25.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:29.360]   I'm just kind of glad that that name is not, you know, just gone.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:36.280]   It's very rare for something to hit go away and then rise in front of our eyes.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.000]   It's going to be a thing to watch it.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.720]   They apparently, they say beta works.
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.720]   They rebuilt it from scratch.
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:43.720]   Yup.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.720]   Ground up.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.720]   Wow.
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.560]   I'm not sure why they needed to do that.
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.960]   I'm like, I'm going to leave it.
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:51.200]   Pardon me?
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.040]   I was saying it's hard to believe that they would, I mean, why?
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:56.800]   So they basically just paid for the name and the developers.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.800]   Well, no, they didn't get that's the funny thing.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:25:59.800]   They didn't get the developers.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.400]   The developers went to the Washington Post.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.400]   Oh, that's right.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.400]   That's right.
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.720]   So new team, and I guess they didn't want to deal with the old code.
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:09.320]   So they said, well, it's not that complicated.
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.320]   Hmm.
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:14.280]   That's funny because is this the right, is this the right page?
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:16.400]   Is it this is the old dig?
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:21.400]   No, yeah, it's because it's got a, it's got an interview I did with Matt Williams many
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.040]   moons ago.
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.040]   The site.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:25.880]   I don't know what it is.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.880]   Maybe it's, you think it's cash?
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.000]   You go to dig.com, it should be okay.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.520]   It's totally new, you know, dig.com.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.760]   Maybe I have a cached version.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.800]   Let me press the shift key and then go there.
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.880]   And that's funny.
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:38.800]   I'm going to do one.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:42.480]   Ah, yes, I had, I must have had a cached.
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:44.520]   Well, this is pretty.
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:45.520]   Isn't it?
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:49.680]   It's a little bit more Pinterest-y and it's kind of selected on top and then river below.
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:50.680]   That's for another day.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:51.680]   Sagan drew.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:53.480]   What did you say?
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.280]   I'm bummed that commenting is out of it.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.800]   Oh, you can't comment?
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.800]   Can you dig?
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.600]   You can dig.
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:05.880]   I wonder if I have to create a new account.
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:09.120]   Success, your digs will appear in your Facebook timeline.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.400]   I guess that's the only way I can do it, huh?
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:14.120]   Oh, well.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.440]   NBC accidentally broadcasts a bare breast.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:22.720]   Oh, I guess the dig is not so new after all.
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:26.600]   Okay, moving along here.
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:31.160]   I just want to make sure we don't miss any monster stories that are breaking in the world
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.960]   of the Google and the cloud.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:39.880]   Ora, which goes even too far for me, Mr. Public, is going to have a new structure to post what
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.320]   you've read publicly.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:42.320]   Why?
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:48.360]   Again, with a dig like that, it makes me, because I read a lot of guilty pleasure stuff
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.560]   and I don't want it on my social timeline.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.560]   Right.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:56.560]   And there's some exceptions, but the default is that, which I think is, I think the share
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.880]   range should be a explicit action.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:03.480]   So you mean, because I have a Quora account, if I go there now and start reading stuff
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:07.160]   without my approval or knowledge, it will start to share that.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:08.440]   I'm not sure of these extra, sure.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:09.440]   Oh, it doesn't.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:12.920]   If you come in from a link, it won't, but from within Quora, yeah, it's going to appear
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.760]   next to stuff.
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:19.160]   And will it, it's only going to appear on Quora, what I believe so.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.160]   I believe so.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:22.920]   But I have not studied this in depth, so I'm sure the chatroom or someone or their PR
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:26.840]   company who already emailed me will come forward and say something else.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:27.840]   Well, let me just.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:28.840]   I'm wrong.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:29.840]   Please do.
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:33.160]   Let me just read a Quora question.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:34.160]   Okay.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.520]   I've read this question.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:41.400]   And now is it showing up that I read this question for people who are following me?
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.400]   I don't even know.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.400]   I can't even.
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:44.400]   It's a rhythmic thing.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:45.400]   I don't know.
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:46.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.280]   This is a quora.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.880]   I don't really use Quora that much.
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:50.880]   Meaning.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:55.000]   Oh, Malek posted a way to get rid of views, but I don't know if this is the way to get
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.080]   rid of your, the stuff you view or right, but he says there is a way to go into the,
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:05.480]   into your profile, hit the settings, find views, and then choose no and these are turned
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:06.480]   off.
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:10.520]   So this article does say thanks to Quora, you cannot read anonymously, which is.
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:11.520]   Mm hmm.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.560]   Oh, yep.
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.560]   I agree.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:18.220]   He said that the lead on this is Quora, which I believe is one of the most over harps
[01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:19.220]   hyped startups.
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:20.220]   I always thought that.
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:21.220]   Yeah.
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:24.120]   How long, initially when people are excited and it's fresh and they want to spend time
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.780]   and they answer questions, it's great.
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:30.080]   But how long before people go, I'm not going to pour my heart and soul into this third
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:32.080]   party website.
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.080]   Yep.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:36.080]   Commodore 64, 30 years old.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.080]   Yay.
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:38.640]   Did you start on a C64?
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:39.640]   I did not.
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:43.320]   I started on a trash 80 trash 80 model.
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:44.320]   It was the two, I think.
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:45.320]   Two.
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:47.360]   The one or the two actually might have been the one might have been a modified one.
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:51.040]   Drew So Young, I bet he started on an IBM PC.
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.040]   I did.
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:53.040]   I did.
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:56.460]   But I did have a Tandy machine earlier on.
[01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:57.460]   Okay.
[01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:58.460]   Okay.
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:00.340]   And Jeff So Old, I bet he started with an abacus.
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:01.820]   Hey, hey, hey.
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:04.260]   I have my Osborne 1 in the office.
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:05.260]   Osborne.
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:06.260]   I loved that.
[01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:07.260]   That was an awesome computer.
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:08.260]   Great machine.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:09.260]   I coveted an Osborne.
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:10.940]   It is my pride and joy.
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:11.940]   Yeah.
[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:12.940]   We have one here.
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:13.940]   It's non functioning, but we have one.
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:15.500]   It's got to have a bit of history, isn't it?
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:16.500]   Yeah.
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:17.500]   We have a Commodore here too, don't you?
[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:18.500]   Yes.
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:19.500]   We got a Commodore.
[01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:20.500]   We've got all sorts of stuff.
[01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:21.500]   There's one back here.
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.500]   I think there's a Commodore right behind us.
[01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:23.500]   There's a pet.
[01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:24.500]   So there's a great video.
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:27.320]   I don't know if all of these links get put out on the notes, show notes, but there's
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:32.260]   a great video that the BBC did where this guy took a Commodore 64 and brought it into
[01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:34.260]   a classroom or brought some kids in.
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:35.780]   I think, oh, what do you think about this?
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:36.940]   You know, and what do you think this is?
[01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:39.660]   And he holds up the old Commodore joystick and the girl looks at it.
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:41.580]   She's like, is that a remote control?
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:42.580]   No one knows.
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:46.220]   And then she's like, is that actually connected to the TV?
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:47.220]   No one knows.
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:48.220]   It was great.
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:50.780]   Some of their responses were just classic.
[01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:53.820]   They didn't know what a tape was because he had a tape to load some programs.
[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:56.020]   They didn't know what the cassette tape was.
[01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:57.100]   People are very nostalgic about it.
[01:30:57.100 --> 01:31:01.740]   I have in my office a joystick that Jerry Ellsworth designed for sale.
[01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:05.420]   It was the idea was, and you've seen these since, a joystick, you plug into your TV and
[01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:07.260]   you can play Commodore 64 games.
[01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:11.620]   She put a backdoor into it that if you do up, down, up, down, left, left, it unlocks
[01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:13.580]   a full Commodore 64 with Commodore.
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:16.460]   Or basic, the whole thing is in there.
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:17.460]   That's awesome.
[01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:18.460]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:20.540]   She's so great.
[01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:21.540]   That's sweet.
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:23.100]   In that short.
[01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:24.380]   All right.
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:25.940]   Let's get to now.
[01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:27.260]   This is something we normally do.
[01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:32.660]   And I don't know if you were prepped for this or not, but normally Gina does a tip of the
[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:33.660]   week.
[01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:38.540]   Now, I know, Aaron, you could probably do an Android tip or you could do a Google tip.
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:39.540]   You want to do one?
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:40.540]   Yeah, I've got an Android tip actually.
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:41.540]   All right.
[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:42.540]   All right.
[01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:44.540]   So, the tip of the week is...
[01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:47.980]   You want to get Google Wallet on your Samsung Galaxy.
[01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:48.980]   Close.
[01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:49.980]   Very close.
[01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:53.620]   How to get Wi-Fi tethering on your Android phone.
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:57.700]   So, if you have an Android phone and you want to, you're one of the people that has to,
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:00.500]   there's a paywall usually like I have with Verizon.
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:03.500]   And you want to get Wi-Fi tethering working.
[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:08.260]   Life Hacker has a pretty good article on this that they just put out.
[01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:11.180]   And it turns out there's a number of applications in the market.
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:12.380]   Some of them require rooting.
[01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:14.620]   Some of them don't.
[01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:16.740]   But you can actually get Wi-Fi tethering to work.
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:17.740]   A lot of people don't know this.
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:21.580]   You can get Wi-Fi tethering to work simply by downloading an application.
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:22.580]   I've got an application.
[01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:24.820]   I probably don't have a camera behind me, do I?
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:26.660]   I know, but I can.
[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:27.660]   Maybe can I show...
[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:30.580]   Chad, can you get him a camera?
[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:31.580]   Let me check.
[01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:32.580]   We'll see.
[01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:33.580]   Chad's going to work on it.
[01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:34.580]   So, this is the camera that I have.
[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:35.580]   Oh, there you go.
[01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:36.580]   Look at that.
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:37.580]   Look at that.
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:38.580]   Perfect.
[01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:39.580]   So, sweet.
[01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:40.580]   Let me see if I move this over.
[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:41.580]   Look at this little awkward.
[01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:43.620]   It doesn't look bad, but it feels very awkward.
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:44.620]   Okay, so here we go.
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:45.620]   So, here's Wi-Fi tethering.
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:49.460]   This is actually one of the applications that does require rooting your phone.
[01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:51.220]   That's what it looks like.
[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:53.940]   And once you have it installed, you turn off Wi-Fi.
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:56.060]   The automatic Wi-Fi service is running.
[01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:57.540]   You click...
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:58.540]   It's actually sharing now.
[01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:00.580]   You can probably get it from your laptop.
[01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:03.220]   So, it's actually sharing a Wi-Fi signal now.
[01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:07.420]   And when someone connects, it gives you a little warning that says, "Hey, this person
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:11.980]   connected to your Wi-Fi," and then you can click the button to authorize or don't click
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:13.780]   it and they won't be able to get any internet access.
[01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:15.940]   Well, let me just see if I can get on your Wi-Fi.
[01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:17.140]   Yeah, see if you can find it.
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:19.780]   It's called Android Tether, I believe.
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:22.060]   Okay, here we go.
[01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:23.060]   Tap the Wi-Fi.
[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:25.940]   Oh, I got a little ping here.
[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:27.540]   Somebody else is trying to get on you.
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:28.540]   That's not me.
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:29.540]   Oh, call us phone.
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:31.820]   Oil stop free Wi-Fi, and Android tether.
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:32.820]   I see it.
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:33.820]   I'll give everybody access.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:34.820]   Nice.
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:35.820]   There, I'm connecting.
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:36.820]   Because I'm a nice guy.
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:43.280]   there that was you wasn't it or the companies said people we're all connecting to this
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:48.600]   phone. Let's bring it right to its knees. These are all people internally and trust you.
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:52.600]   Some Android phones have tethering in there. Some of the androids you can buy it. You can
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:34:00.360]   pay for the service from Verizon or from AT&T. So you can do that but actually there are
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:04.700]   other applications out on the marketplace where you can get which basically this one
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:08.520]   completely rewrites the functionality inside the phone. Like I said you have to be root.
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:13.280]   There's another service on the marketplace. I think it's called Elixir or Elixir 2.
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:16.840]   Yeah here it is Elixir 2. When you say service is not an app it's a service. This is an app.
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:21.380]   Sorry I misspoke. Yeah this is an app you can buy and this one actually does a lot of
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:25.560]   thing Elixir basically monitors all the sensors and everything on your phone giving you all
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:29.820]   kinds of stuff. But one of the other things they do is they have a Wi-Fi hotspot which
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:34.640]   allows you to basically get around that message that pops up from Verizon that says you must
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:39.780]   pay for Wi-Fi tethering if you want. So is it illegal to do that? I guess not after the
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:45.620]   Jabs. I don't know but they can't stop it. I'll just say use it as your own risk. I don't
[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:49.020]   think there's really a whole lot they can do to stop you from doing that. But anyway
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:55.460]   so if you are kind of in that group of people that want Wi-Fi tethering and you keep getting
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:58.180]   blocked there are a couple apps out there and you ought to take a look at them. Jonathan
[01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:02.720]   says that there's one called FoxFi that does not require rooting. Right FoxFi does not
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:05.900]   require rooting. And I believe that this Elixir 2 does not require rooting. That's kind of
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:10.420]   cool. But I like the one that actually that actually uses the root system. I trust it a
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:15.060]   little bit more. Right. And now we know that Verizon is no longer allowed to block these
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:18.340]   that's right or to charge. Well can they charge? They can still do it. I think actually
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:23.940]   I think they can still block on some of their plans. I think the just not I think the unlimited
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:28.500]   plan I believe they said they were still going to block the unlimited plan but some of their
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:33.480]   tears they're not allowed to because of this acquisition they had. So that's my tip. Jeff
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:38.960]   Jovis your number of the week. Well I wanted to do two quick first is a plug. The number
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:45.320]   is 7,000. That's how many people are going to campus party in Berlin. 7,000 people. That
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:49.880]   is incredible. It's it's they hold it normally down in South America and they're going to
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:53.440]   have one in Berlin. Next year they're going to have one in San Francisco down at I think
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:58.380]   in NASA. They're going to do it the Temple Hough Airport which is a closed gigantic airport
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:04.140]   from the 30s and five hundred hours of programming just really unbelievable and they've asked
[01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:09.220]   me to come over and keynote on the last day about freedom of the internet and so I wanted
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:12.140]   to give them a great plug. It's really an amazing program. There's a slight chance that
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:15.380]   the transportation may not work out but my hope is that it will and I really recommend
[01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:20.020]   looking up campus party for Berlin and if you're in Europe it just looks amazing. One
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:24.160]   is just like really easy for you to go to Germany. You seem to go like for the weekend
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:30.360]   all the time. I'm just going to say you get to school but I am more of a brand in Germany
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:35.560]   than I have here. What's really? Yeah. I know it's really weird. People say, oh you
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:41.400]   are Jeff Jovis. We love that that that Bozo American has a lot of being naked. Yeah he's
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:46.960]   a David Hassel. What is it that your brand is in Germany? What do you know as that I
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:50.520]   complain about their privacy and government and I kind of stop some crazy American. Oh
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:55.560]   it's a crazy American. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway so that's I just wanted to give them
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:59.480]   a plug so campus party in Berlin and then next year when it hits America I think it's
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:05.880]   really I got the name rundown from Lisa Lang and it's incredible that they gave three thousand
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.860]   scholarships and they're picking buses to campuses around Europe and then bringing in
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:15.300]   three thousand people and they sleep intense at Temple office like the world biggest food
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:23.460]   camp and so it'd be quite amazing. So for a number let's see here. 97% of the conversations
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:27.780]   that occurred about the opening ceremonies according to the Telegraph of London occurred
[01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:32.900]   on Twitter which goes back to our earlier conversation where I think that that's an important thing
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:38.820]   in terms of its power in there. That's where our conversations are and that's pretty amazing.
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:44.380]   So that's me. I wish we could do something about that.
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:49.500]   My tool of the week is just a note that if you have not tried Spotify and you use Android
[01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:54.300]   this would be a very good time to try it. They've made it free for all Android users.
[01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:58.780]   That means you get all the Spotify premium features without paying a monthly fee. It
[01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:02.500]   spotifies worth the ten bucks a month. I use it on every device. I think it's my favorite
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:07.740]   music platform but maybe you want to try it and see whether you like it. This is a Spotify
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:11.420]   running on the Nexus 7. They have a very nice tablet interface and one of the things you
[01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:17.260]   can use now that the full version is free is their radio which is really cool. It's kind
[01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:23.380]   of Pandora style radio. Let's listen to some black metal and unlike Pandora if you like
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:29.020]   the song that you're listening to you can actually save it and put it on your device
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:35.020]   and have it there even offline. Spotify is really cool. So if you like a song give it
[01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:41.660]   a thumbs up and then it's saved to a like from radio playlist on your desktop so you
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:46.020]   can listen to it wherever you are. I don't know how long Spotify is going to offer this
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:51.620]   for free but it's really my favorite music service. I have a lot of playlists on there.
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:56.300]   The ability to share and save playlists and share them. If you go to Google+ you'll see
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:39:02.260]   a lot of Spotify playlists. Andy Enoco did a fun thing on Google+ he said if you could
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:09.100]   just pick one song, the song what would it be and I subscribed to that playlist on Google
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:13.620]  + because it's great it's called the Andy Enoco's one song playlist. Now it's 161
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:17.940]   tracks of songs and people say this is the song in my life and so that's fun right?
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:21.460]   I mean what a neat idea and it's a social playlist so it could even grow some more if
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:25.100]   people find that posting and add some more stuff to it. That's cool. Yeah Spotify is
[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:28.580]   really neat if you've never played for it with it and you have an Android device or
[01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:34.820]   phone here's a chance to try it for free for however long they continue to offer that.
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:39.860]   First that buy always download. Yeah isn't it great big fan. That's what Spotify is.
[01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:46.140]   I follow you on Spotify. Hey thanks for following us on this week in Google. We do this show
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:52.740]   every Wednesday 1 p.m. Pacific 4 p.m. Eastern time 20 what did I forget something? Drew's
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:59.100]   tip. Oh Drew has a tip too. I have a tip. I didn't mean to leave you out. No it's cool.
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:05.580]   Oh Drew all in off from the next web what's your tip? Everyone Google metal count. M-E-D-A-L
[01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:11.620]   count and you get a nice display of how the countries are doing in the Olympics. Oh that's
[01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:16.060]   cool. Yeah and then you get the knowledge graph on the right hand side with some cool
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:21.660]   schedules and stuff. This is for the Olympics metal count. What a great tip I love that
[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:28.620]   so China is leading with 30 but we're right in the pack with 29. That's awesome. What fun
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:34.100]   and you can see all the events there's a schedule links and more. Of course if you click watch
[01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:44.780]   online you have to have a cable account if you live in the United States. Thanks NBC.
[01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:50.220]   You know I finally realized that in fact I'm getting more than enough Olympics. I don't
[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:57.100]   really need all 5,335 hours. Just a couple hours in prime time every night really is enough
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:00.620]   Olympics for me personally. You don't feel like you're missing out on all the badminton
[01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:05.380]   that's crazy badminton fans. Not really I guess if you're really fan of a sport. You
[01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:10.140]   had a huge scandal. Yeah what? Yeah. Yes they were there were throwing games so that
[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:15.060]   they could get change the lineup or where we call the brackets right. They got thrown
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:19.220]   out with what four teams got thrown out. Really. Yeah they were taking dives so they get a
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:26.500]   better match in the finals. That's not bad. That's not bad. Who knew? I think some of
[01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:30.260]   the fun went at it when I realized that once it was under 60 degrees Fahrenheit they didn't
[01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:33.540]   have to they could cover up the bikinis in the beach volleyball. That's what I just lost
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:41.420]   interest. Yeah. No kidding. You're your your dig at heart. Yes. Yes. I'm going back to
[01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:46.340]   that dig article right after the show by the way. Hey thank you for joining us. Jeff Jarvis
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:51.860]   Buzz machine.com his book is public parts. You must buy it. You must buy it. We also
