[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   The show where we talk about the latest Google-ish-ness, Facebook-ish-ish-ness, and Twitter-ish-ish-ish.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Jeff Jarvis is here from the City University in New York where he teaches in the journalism program there.

[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Hello, Jeffery.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Hello, hello, hello.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Sorry I missed you last week.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I was flying.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   We missed you so much.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   But it was a fun show.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   But it's always...
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   It's not this week in Google without Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I'll show this.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   By the way, I'm going to be in New York in two weeks and I'm hoping we can do the show from CUNY.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   It will be a lot of fun.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   As soon as the Dean gives us a go ahead.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Well, all the technicians who need to actually do the work, I just emailed all of them.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   We can help to fray the costs maybe.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Much excitement.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Yeah, for cost.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   That should be okay.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Yeah, wouldn't that be fun?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Also with us Aaron Newcomb, great to see you again from NetApp and of course a regular on Floss Weekly and all about Android.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Yep.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Glad to be here.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   He brought some projects as he always does.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Yes.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   You never stop.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And this is why things never get documented.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   If anybody, people are always asking me after the show that...
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Right off the blog post.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Where's the instructable?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Where's this?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I'm like, you don't understand.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   That's done and I moved on to three other things.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I can't like that.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So, just get it done.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Get it done.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Get it done.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Big news just at press time as they say.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   (laughing)
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Waking news.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   What do they do?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   They call down to the stop the presses.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   We've got to rack it up and relay the page.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   What is it they say?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I only got to yell stop the presses once in my career.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Really?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Did I tell that story?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   No.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So on the San Francisco Examiner, Sunday edition, there were two pictures.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   One was of the California condor, one was of the Pope.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   The captions got switched.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Under the Pope it said, soon to be an endangered species.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   (laughing)
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   After presses!
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   After presses.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   That's awesome.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   What a great story.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   How come you got to do that?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I was a Sunday editor.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Editor Pro Tem?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   You had this Sunday paper?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So we had the Sundays.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And so they chipped off the caption literally so they get the presses back on.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Wow.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   You mean like with a chisel?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Basically.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   They were still using hot lead?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   No, no, no.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   This was the plates.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   The plates were, you know, metal that stood up so you just tamped the metal down and that
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   was that aluminum.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Wow.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   That's kind of cool.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   There's no caption.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I have, now I have all plates.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Let's see if you can see this.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Oh, I'd love to see this.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   See that, that, that, that coffee table back there?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   That's made of plates?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   That's two newspaper plates.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   No, very heavy.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Very, very heavy.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Oh, that is so neat.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   That's cool.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   That, that thick.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   That's, that's, then they switched to aluminum.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Wow.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   That's really cool.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Newspaper geeked them.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   You saw the very sad post in, um,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   there was a bill Moyers blog about.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Oh, you didn't write it, but yeah.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   But all the journals who are gone, you know, out of, and they're, and most of them because,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.080]   as these newspapers close and they're, they're folding right and left, most of them are middle-aged
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.840]   and they're just not getting another job.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.160]   What happens?
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.920]   It's a Dale Maha Ridge's article.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.560]   What happens to journalists when no one wants to print their words anymore?
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.560]   And most of them are, you know, ending up doing something else PR or if they're lucky PR,
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.840]   they're not so lucky working on a hot dog card.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.840]   Wow.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.840]   Look at that sad picture, too.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.840]   That was under paper folded.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:37.400]   Rocky Mountain News, February 27, 2009, 150-year-old daily paper shut down, 200 staffers lost their
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   jobs.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.000]   That is a very,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.320]   Boy, did I hijack us into the unhappy past.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.320]   Sorry.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.320]   It's not the past.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.320]   That's the sad thing.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.320]   It's the present.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.400]   Papers are closing right and left and there's not a lot of places for these talented journalists
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.560]   to go, is there?
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.800]   What do you tell your kids when you read an article like this?
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.440]   You're teaching kids to be journalists.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.800]   Oh, they're 90% of them get employed with six months because they do the new stuff.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.320]   They're doing not burial journalism and they're using all the new tools and they're going
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.520]   to do places like Vox and BuzzFeed and Fusion and Quartz.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.480]   Those are the places.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.480]   We've seen, of course, this is the story of technology and of the internet in particular
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:29.720]   is that businesses change and fail and re-jigger themselves.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.480]   I'm sure similar scenes played out at Kodak.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.680]   This one really, I don't know for some reason it's really affected me.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.680]   It's happening everywhere.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.680]   It's happening at Disney.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.080]   A good friend laid off at Disney because Disney decided to replace all of their engineers
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.200]   with H1B visa people they've imported.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.200]   They were cheaper.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.840]   The sad thing is they were kept on for six months to train their replacement.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.120]   If they want the severance, you got to stick around and train your replacement.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.120]   That is horrible.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.200]   That's not supposed to work that way, by the way.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   Is that against the law or something?
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.200]   You have to have a need.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.480]   You have to say we can't fill this position with another guy.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.120]   We're going to apply for the visa and then you get it.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.640]   You have to prove that you looked and you couldn't find the guy or girl that you needed
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.520]   and then you can get the visa.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.800]   It's definitely not supposed to be a wholesale replacement method.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.600]   The story is, of course, that Disney doesn't do it themselves.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.280]   They hire companies that do this.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.520]   Of course, there are many lawsuits.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.160]   Here's an article from last month in the Times Lawsuits Claimed Disney Colluded.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.640]   To replace US workers with immigrants.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.760]   Keith Barrett, who's a good friend of the shows and comes by all the time, he was very
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.960]   proud that he worked at Disney.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:56.440]   He was an IT guy, but he and 250 others of his colleagues fired and replaced.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:02.840]   Because what Disney does is as many companies do, they go to a consultant company that hires
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:08.360]   foreign workers on H1B visas to displace them.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.360]   Disney is just outsourcing its IT.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.080]   It's not Disney's fault.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:18.360]   They say it's very sad.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.920]   The other sad thing, and it talks about this in the article, is that many of these displaced
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.280]   workers applied for other jobs at Disney.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.160]   In this case, one of the women who was training a replacement applied for 150 other jobs at
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.400]   Disney and did not get one.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.640]   It seems like they should have had some priority, but apparently not.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.680]   There's a big lawsuit going on.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.840]   Anyway, let's talk about something happy.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.720]   V-5, 4, 5.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.760]   I smell the blood of a newspaper bun.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.840]   This is what happens.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.240]   This is the kind of displacement.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.000]   I think it's important for us as we celebrate technology and celebrate the internet and
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.920]   the new economy, that we understand that there's a very human cost to this.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.480]   All the more important for companies and even individual professionals to invest in their
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.520]   own future as best they can.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.280]   And be aware of what's happening.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.640]   It's a reality to deal with.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.120]   I don't mean it's out of cold hurt.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.120]   I'm not.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.120]   Well, it is the reality.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.760]   It does no good to ignore the reality.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:24.480]   If you're a young person coming up, it does a lot of good to think about what you're choosing.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.720]   We did a great interview on triangulation about a month ago about the professions, because
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.960]   I think it's always been thought, well, if you're a doctor, a lawyer, an accountant,
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.120]   you're not at risk.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.560]   And of course, they are also at risk.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.880]   But in a different way, the jobs aren't disappearing, but they're changing significantly.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:47.280]   What does expertise mean in an era where you've got Watson?
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.480]   Speaking of which, did you see the Google Go computer won its first game yesterday?
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.480]   Oh, I didn't see that.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.480]   We should be watching.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.480]   That's awesome.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.240]   This is about the most boring video ever created, though.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:57.260]   It's a multi-
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.760]   But the video is spultified.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.560]   Well, it's a slow game.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.640]   And I love Go.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.640]   I play chess.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.320]   And of course, we've seen this happen years ago.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.920]   We saw this happen with chess, but it was always thought, well, chess is one thing, but
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.920]   Go goes hard.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.600]   The difference right is that you can calculate every possible move at a remove and chess
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.600]   and you can't with Go.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   Right.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.600]   So the difference.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.600]   You could.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.920]   It's just a much more complicated, computationally.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.000]   And so there are many, many, many, many, many, many more options in Go.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.480]   So you know, but presumably at some point you can make a machine with enough RAM and
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.560]   enough processor power to do the calculations.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.240]   In this case, AlphaGo, which is the program Google developed, didn't in fact look at all
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.560]   the moves.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.800]   It used intuition.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.840]   AKA intuition.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.880]   It used previous experience.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.880]   Previous experience.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.840]   Because they had this thing playing itself.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.840]   Right.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.520]   Many thousands of games.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:11:01.680]   And of course, computers have beaten good amateur players, but this was Lee Sadowl, who was one
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.400]   of the top professional Go players.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.400]   He's not.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.400]   He's the explainer.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   I think.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.400]   Not that guy.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   The little screen.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.960]   Lee is a nine Dan Go player, which if you know Go is very good.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.000]   I mean, Grandmaster Plus.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.360]   It's a one million dollar prize, a five game match.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:27.920]   So I think I don't know if game two is today, but yesterday on game one, he was beaten.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.280]   He said I was very surprised.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.280]   I didn't expect to lose.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:35.360]   I didn't think AlphaGo would play the game in such a perfect manner.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.320]   Wow.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:45.560]   What's interesting is AlphaGo made a bad move early on and go more than chess maybe even
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:51.840]   is a game of emotions and intimidation.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:57.160]   And normally if a player or human makes such a bad move early on, he gets demoralized
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.920]   and he's easier to beat.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.480]   And Lee said that didn't phase the computer.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.480]   It just kept on playing.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.480]   Right.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.480]   And in fact, played a game move towards the end of the game.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.320]   Lee said I never thought it was even possible.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.240]   Such an unexpected game.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.160]   A move that he said I wouldn't ever have foreseen this.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.880]   This is the 19 by 19 board that they play on.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.800]   One player is black, obviously one player is white.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.920]   The idea is to occupy territory by surrounding the other player's pieces.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.960]   It's a beautiful game and a simple game.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.320]   Why does it keep doing that?
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.320]   What is that?
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.720]   They didn't start it yet or something.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.720]   I don't know.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.720]   Just fast.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.720]   They're thinking, Lee's thinking right now.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.720]   Oh, I said no, sorry.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.720]   Right.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.720]   All you're almost there.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   I'm captivated.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   No, not at the end.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.040]   At the end when you have all the pieces or many of the pieces, the board will be full.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.360]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.840]   So what you're trying to do is occupy territory.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:13:00.600]   The game ends when there's no more to occupy.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.080]   So a human obviously is moving the piece for AlphaGo.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.040]   I don't regret accepting this challenge said Lee, I am in shock.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.040]   I admit that.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.040]   But what's done is done.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.600]   I enjoy this game and look forward to the next.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.760]   I think I failed in the opening layout.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.760]   So if I do better on the opening aspect, I think I'll be able to increase my probability
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.640]   within one game is not.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.080]   No, well, it is and it is evidence.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:29.160]   The fact that a computer could be the nine Dan player in any game at any time is phenomenal.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:38.400]   So today, Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday at 11 p.m. Eastern, the night before.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:46.920]   So tonight, I think at 11 p.m. Eastern or 8 p.m. Pacific.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.760]   Huge.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:54.600]   And if it wins the match, then it's even huger to coin face.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.600]   It's huge.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.000]   So this, what is it?
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.720]   Fon Hui is a European champion.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.680]   So I'm assuming he that was the last one.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.560]   That was not a professional.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.040]   He was just a very good amateur.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.040]   Okay.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:13.840]   He is nine Dan, which is as good as it gets.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.040]   This is big.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.960]   But this is equivalent.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.680]   It's not like beating the world champion.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.760]   I don't even know if there must be a world champion.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.760]   I think there is.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.640]   I mean, they said on the radio last Sunday, this guy was, if you had to rank it, you
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.360]   know, like you'd just like normal start something for.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.360]   For four.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.680]   They said four in the world.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.440]   But I'm just wondering, having studied a little bit of Asian culture, whether this is
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.560]   how demoralizing this is, I mean, this is not not, you can't say what's the big deal
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.560]   in chess.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.120]   I was a very serious chess player and tournament player.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:54.000]   And it's a big deal in chess when deep thought, IBM's deep blue computer beat the world champion.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.720]   It was initially the demoralizing.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.480]   It was like stop playing the game, demoralizing.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.400]   What's the point?
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.600]   And then humans got over it and in fact play better and harder than ever before.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.280]   And now they use computers very heavily in preparation.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.600]   You're not obviously allowed to use during the game, but in training, it's really a big
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.600]   deal.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.600]   So the matches tonight.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.520]   Yeah, 11 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.600]   In some ways I'm still more impressed by Jeopardy, because I am stupid about this stuff.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.600]   There'd be.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.800]   Jeopardy is harder in some ways too.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.600]   Well, the linguistic layers.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.600]   Right.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.360]   Yeah, this is kind of a classic computer problem like chess is.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.360]   Chess is solvable.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:40.160]   Chess, you can, you know, there are almost infinite number of positions, but computers
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.400]   are able to calculate so deeply that they can pretty much make the perfect move every
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.960]   time.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.160]   If you apply enough power to it, go is 19 by 19.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.840]   There are many, many more possibilities.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.240]   It's very deep game, very difficult game.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:00.800]   Although I always thought go would be not so difficult to crack because it's pattern focused
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.040]   and computer is a good at pattern matching, but not as good as humans.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.320]   Humans are the kings.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:12.320]   So this would be, this was for a long time thought to be insolvable.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.120]   Like no, like this isn't going to happen.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.040]   No compute, but that's, we know that that's not.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:24.360]   So add two journalists and Disney IT, add go masters.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.360]   You're out.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.040]   Get a new gig.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.160]   I'm sorry, that was mean.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.640]   And when we come back, there's some breaking news that I said we would talk about.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.400]   We're going to talk about that.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.800]   Now we're going to talk about it.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.800]   When I come back.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.760]   Yeah, I don't know if it goes older than chess.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.000]   I think I'm pretty sure it's a lot of.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   It must be.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   It's a very simple game.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   It's a beautiful game.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.720]   And as serious as I was about playing chess, I always found go extremely challenging because,
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.440]   you know, there's, there's not different kinds of pieces.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.840]   There's one kind of piece and it's all about strategy.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.840]   Right?
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.840]   So it's chess.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.960]   It's just hard.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.880]   It's a very hard game.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.600]   Really amazing.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.440]   I should point out though that there's still calculation.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.440]   It's about calculation.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.280]   This is some computers are good at.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:19.120]   Probably you're right, Jeff, in some ways playing Jeopardy well is harder.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:28.520]   And in fact, I don't think I think there were a lot of caveats in Watson's win in Jeopardy.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.080]   Right?
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.240]   Like they helped it out a lot.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.240]   Chris is the same thing about the chess about the deep blue.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.920]   Our show today is brought to you by Atlassian.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.400]   I don't know if you're a programmer, you don't have to say anything more.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.040]   You know Atlassian.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:49.960]   And every great human achievement is a team mapping the genome, 3D printing, space exploration,
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:55.120]   renewable energy, or planning your next offsite team.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.920]   How do you bring everyone together to build what's next with Atlassian?
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.120]   We've used Atlassian in many ways.
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.560]   We use Jira when we were designing our website.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.880]   We used HipChat.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.320]   We still use HipChat all the time to meet.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.400]   We have about eight or nine HipChat channels.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.480]   What's neat about HipChat is it supports, of course, lots of integrations.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:19.560]   We installed a little bot that tells us now when services are down, in fact, we told one
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.280]   of our partners that their service was down for 10 minutes last night.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.480]   They said, "Oh, we didn't know."
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.640]   They said, "You should be running HipChat in Atlassian."
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.920]   You can assign, track, and manage tasks for any project with Jira.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.080]   That's what we used for the website.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.200]   It was really great.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.640]   You can create and share content, organize results, bring team members up to speed with
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.160]   confluence.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:48.680]   You can get instant messages or video chat with your team from any device with HipChat.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.960]   You could test review and manage code in real time.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.680]   That's Bitbucket.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:58.160]   Atlassian is the king of this stuff.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:03.120]   It's helping teams in every industry from startup to enterprise make great ideas real.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:12.480]   Go to Atlassian, A-T-L-A-S-S-I-A-N.com to learn more and see how Jira confluence, HipChat,
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.400]   Bitbucket, give your team everything you need to organize, discuss.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.240]   We love it.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:25.360]   Atlassian.com unleash the potential in your team and build what's next.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.120]   About an hour ago, this was like a shocking announcement.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:36.680]   The Android beta of N became available not just for developers, but for anybody using
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.160]   a Nexus device.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:50.320]   If you have a Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 tablet, a 5x, a 6p, a Nexus player, or, and this is
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.400]   an interesting one, the Pixel C, I know you do, Jeff, I do too, it's time to put N on.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.400]   Is N Nutella?
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   What did he say?
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.400]   What did Hiroshi say?
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.160]   Of course he said, we're not saying.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.840]   We're not saying.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.320]   Not noting right now.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.800]   I thought NuGet would be a good one.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.120]   Oh, nice, you're a brave man, that's on your Nexus 6.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.000]   That's on my Nexus 6, my big old Nexus 6.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.800]   Is this the one you're moving to 5?
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   It's already on 5.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.800]   Oh, nice.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.800]   As we speak.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   Is this helpful?
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.800]   For now?
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.800]   Hey, hey.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   Hey.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:28.360]   Well, it's a big change besides the fact that it's not just for developers.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.960]   It's an over the air update.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   That is huge.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.960]   That's huge.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:32.960]   That's easy.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.960]   It's easy.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.960]   You just click on.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:41.280]   Yes, so you go to Android.com, I'm sorry, google.com/andrite/beta, and then if you go
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.640]   with, you logged into your account, you'll see which devices you have that are eligible.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.080]   You see I can, and then you have to enroll that device in the beta.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:53.400]   So I can, I'm definitely going to do the Pixel, because one of the things that's cool about
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.040]   this is a split screen, which the Pixel really could use.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.320]   That would make it up.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.280]   That might by itself make the Pixel be the device, right?
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:09.400]   And anytime you're using Android on a, in a desktop fashion, like I've done with this
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.520]   little thing here, you miss the windowing.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.000]   You absolutely miss the windowing.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.760]   So side by side is going to be great.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.760]   Right.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.760]   I'll do it on my Pixel.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:20.760]   You're doing it on your six.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.040]   So this must have been your experience.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.040]   So I said enroll.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.560]   It says device enroll.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.680]   A system update will soon be offered.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.680]   So you got that right away.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   And then it comes right away and we'll be done.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   Wow.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.120]   You could check to see if an update is pending by.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.120]   Well, I'll be a style boy.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.120]   You're still down.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.120]   What do you see?
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.120]   It's 850 bags.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.120]   It's not going to be big.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.120]   It's not going to be any progress bars.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.120]   I'm a little worried.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.120]   850, man.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.120]   That's small.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.120]   Why is that so small?
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.120]   No, that's about right.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.120]   Is it?
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.120]   That's about.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.120]   It's still sitting there.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.120]   All right.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:56.000]   So questions, answers, Hiroshi Lockheimer, who's the head of the Android team wrote a medium
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.200]   post, not a Google+ post.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   Sorry, kids.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   Another nail in the coffin.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.360]   Well, we'll be getting to that later.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.080]   And yeah, actually there's some interesting.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.800]   There's Google+ News.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.360]   And as in not so early, it's not named yet.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.840]   A lot of people thinking Nutella, but that's a commercial name.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.840]   I think Nougat.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.160]   Well, they've done it before.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.160]   Kit Kat.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.160]   Not roll.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.160]   Not roll.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.480]   That's not a dessert.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.480]   That's a thing.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.800]   What is a nut roll?
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.680]   What can they have had candy bars?
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.840]   Somebody says Nestle Road.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.120]   I don't even know what a Nestle Road is.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.120]   Nougat.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.120]   I think Nougat.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.920]   I like Nougat.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.480]   He said, it's what do you say?
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.960]   It's not ready yet?
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.960]   It's the last line.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.320]   I love it the last time.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.320]   All right.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.400]   Going all the way down to the end, he says, so the burning question that's on everyone's
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.160]   mind, what will the end release be named?
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.880]   We're not telling you.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.880]   That's the top highlight.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.880]   That's good.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.360]   So this is big.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.360]   I'm just stunned.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:10.200]   This presumably timing wise would be Google I/O would be, here's what's new in N.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.560]   So to do this now.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.320]   So you've got all these developers in the room who have N, who have it, they'll start
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.920]   playing with it.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.920]   Does that take the window of the sales or does that make I/O yet more developer?
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.920]   I mean, maybe they'll ship it at I/O.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.920]   Right.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.440]   And they must feel very confident about it to roll it out this way.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.200]   What are the features that we know?
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:37.240]   By the way, this is the earliest preview yet, according to Hiroshi.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.520]   You'll be able to act on the feedback while still being able to hand off the final and
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.840]   release device makers this summer.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.840]   So they get their hands on it.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.720]   So for fall, like in your new--
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.240]   Yes, I won't release it at I/O then.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.240]   No.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.440]   Let me see.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.280]   I'm not sure what's new.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.160]   There's multi-windows, which one we were talking about.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.320]   There's also direct reply notifications.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.320]   Direct reply.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.080]   Oh, so when you get a notification, you can-- but a lot of the third-party manufacturers
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.080]   in the UAMs have been doing that.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.160]   The third-party apps.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.040]   There's also bundling notifications.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.040]   Oh, that's good.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.040]   So you've got 23 notifications.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.040]   Right.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   It just doesn't show up in a big list.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.040]   It's like right there.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.040]   Oh, yay.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.040]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:30.280]   Every four to six weeks until the public launch of N. You could take as long as 24 hours to
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.080]   get.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.080]   So here's the timeline.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:38.160]   Yeah, they say preview updates March, April, May, June, July, and the final release in
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.160]   Q3.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:45.080]   So they have a pretty clear matte roadmap for this.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.840]   And I think the rationale here is they're going to get a hell of a lot more feedback
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.840]   on it as they're--
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.480]   Oh, that's great.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.480]   That's wonderful.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.480]   But as you said, they also must feel very confident.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.480]   Yeah, because this is an unlimited rollout to certain developers.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480]   Right?
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.480]   Half the world's going to do this, right?
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.480]   Yeah, real quick.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.160]   If you've got an exos phone, this is why-- you know what?
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.040]   This is a big selling point for an exos phone.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.720]   I was switching over to my new Galaxy S7, and then I thought, well, maybe I'll hold on
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.720]   there.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.160]   And they actually go back.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.880]   Didn't they give a discount on the-- on the Nexus was a five?
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.880]   Because--
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.240]   Well, no, now I think it would be spot.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.240]   150 bucks.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.240]   Because of five.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.240]   Because of five.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.240]   Yes, no more.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.520]   You don't need an invitation anymore.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.240]   If you buy a phone, they'll say, oh, you want to put five on this?
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.240]   Right.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.240]   And it comes deliverable five, right?
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.880]   I think it's interesting that the Nexus player is getting this, too.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.160]   Yeah, that's a little weird, isn't it?
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:47.040]   Because why would you want any of-- notifications don't care on an Nexus player.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.400]   So those two features are out.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.400]   What screen?
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.400]   Probably don't care, because you got the leanback experience.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   It may not even work on the-- so I'm curious why.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.520]   What is in there that's going to help Nexus player?
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:02.480]   I moved off the default operating system for Nexus player, and I'm using somebody else's
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.840]   mod, because it's so much better just to run stock Android.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.840]   But I don't know.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:07.840]   Maybe I'll go back.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.640]   I'll back it up and try this, because I'm curious what could there possibly be?
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.520]   150 bucks off when you buy an Nexus 5X.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:21.880]   And although the 6P is really the phone that you want, is there a deal on the 6P?
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.360]   I haven't seen it.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.360]   It's a little big.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.600]   Maybe people don't want it as big of a screen.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:32.120]   So Dieter Bohn has been playing with N over there at the Verge.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.120]   He said, "We just finished flashing the preview just to kick the tires and beak under the
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.120]   hood.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.840]   Everything is zipping around the screen much faster than we're used to.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:47.000]   Animation speeds radically sped up, but there also seems to be very high level of care dedicated
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.240]   to the movement of basic OS elements."
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.760]   How does split screen multitasking work pretty well?
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.760]   You operate it by holding down your finger on the top of a window in the main multitasking
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.240]   view and dragging it up to a highlighted area once you do.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.680]   The other half gives you a second view to pick another app.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.680]   Kind of how Samsung works.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.680]   Samsung, you go into recents.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:16.880]   If the app supports split window, it'll have a special icon, which you tap.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.120]   Once there, you can adjust the splitter up or down in portrait mode or left and right
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.720]   in landscape.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.920]   This worked with third-party apps like Twitter that weren't built for it.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.920]   Interesting.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:33.000]   Although Android has of late, really been focusing on screen resolution independence,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   that's built in.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   By the way, chat room is saying picture in picture for Nexus player.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.400]   So that makes a lot of sense.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.120]   Wow, that's the two windows.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.120]   Got it.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.000]   And especially if that goes out to the TV manufacturers as well.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   It makes a lot of sense.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Right.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.360]   If it's built into your TV, you've got Sports Center up here and then you're watching the
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.600]   Martian or something.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.720]   Deeter says some crashes here and there when we were messing around, but overall it's much
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.880]   more solidated than you'd expect from an early preview.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.320]   But that's important to know if you can put in on your main devices.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   You just did, Jeff.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.320]   No, no, I put it on my Nexus 6, I put a Nexus 6P.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.320]   Oh, good.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.360]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.360]   I'm crazy.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.800]   Oh, you know me, I'll come lighting to you.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.720]   Yeah, I'm working.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.880]   Quick settings have changed.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.320]   There's a short row of icons at the top of the notification shade.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.320]   That's always been there.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.200]   Hitting one of those buttons will directly toggle, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or whatever, but
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.720]   pull it down farther, you can change what appears in quick settings.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.360]   Is there a app drawer?
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.360]   Right.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.360]   Yeah, people were room.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.360]   The rumor was there's an app drawer.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.160]   Of course, I haven't seen that.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.920]   I was halfway through downloading.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.440]   I finally found the status bar.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.120]   Main settings also refreshed.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.880]   Each line shows more information now.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:55.440]   There's a suggested area for settings that Android thinks you want to pay attention to.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.720]   Notifications, much more information, dense, almost to the point of distraction says Dieter
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.920]   Bonne.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.280]   It does mean you can get a lot more done in there.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.840]   That's the quick reply feature.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.240]   And other nice bits and bobs.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.240]   For example.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.800]   What about Google now?
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.240]   It doesn't say anything.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.000]   I haven't used now on tap hardly at all.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   I never think.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   I hardly ever do it.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Never think to it.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.560]   I don't know if that's because now on tap isn't that useful or just because it's whatever
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.440]   you have a new interface feature like that.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.880]   You kind of remember it.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.840]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.760]   Wow.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.760]   Big news.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.160]   You have one of the-- Oh, there is an app drawer.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.960]   Yeah, of course there's an app drawer.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.560]   That was a non-starter to begin with.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.360]   That was a marketing image that somebody-- Yeah, it was badly done.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.800]   Yeah, I forgot the app drawer.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.520]   Well, I'm not the most giggle there.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.000]   Oh, we put a panic through the giggle.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.880]   Well, and also, if you didn't like that, you just use one of the third party launchers
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.600]   of which there are many, and they'll have an app drawer.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.960]   Can't imagine them doing that.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.680]   So it would be an idea to do that.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.080]   Or it could be an option, right?
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.080]   It could be an option in the settings you want to app drawer or not.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.080]   Wow.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.680]   All right.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.480]   Exciting news.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:17.600]   Whatever it goes, I'll-- I want to run home and get my Pixel C of--
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:22.080]   Of all days, you know, I normally have the 6P with me, but of course now I'm doing the
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.080]   Galaxy.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:28.920]   And by the way, I still love this, but a word of warning if you buy the Galaxy S7, it's
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.920]   slippery.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.920]   It's like a little fish in your hands, and I've already cracked it twice now.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:38.200]   Which I have never done-- I haven't cracked the phone in years, but it hit on the sidewalk,
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.280]   and you see that?
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:45.400]   This back, which is heavily shellacked, I guess, cracks very easily.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.400]   And so there's a nice big--
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.640]   Yeah, it's like a mirror.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.680]   And I have another crack down here, a scrape or something.
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.680]   I don't know where you've been.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.400]   Better the back to the front.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:57.160]   Well, the funny thing is, of course, I ordered a case.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.120]   Although this is a phone you'd love to keep out of the case.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.120]   It's so pretty.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:06.240]   And of course, I ordered a case, but because I got the phone so much earlier than the normal,
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.440]   the case is going to come Friday, a little too late.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.640]   But yeah, I'll just put it in a case, and I won't know.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.760]   Last night on All About Android, Flo talked about how her--
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.880]   Her wrist was cracked too, on the front by the home button.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.800]   Her screen was scratched.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.280]   So this is a very fragile phone.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.280]   I love it.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.120]   It's still my favorite Android phone I've ever used.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:28.400]   The camera is mind boggling.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.120]   I've seen some of the reviewers-- all the reviews came out yesterday.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.600]   I see some of the reviewers say, oh, it's as good as an iPhone.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:39.080]   No, it's like 10 times better than an iPhone.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:39.920]   You heard it here?
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.120]   Not even close.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.760]   Yeah, some people found negatives that I just did not agree with.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:55.600]   And yes, of course, the iFixit folks tore it down and said, this is unrepairable.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.960]   They gave it a three out of 10, which I thought was generous.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.360]   They said, we don't see how you could replace a cracked screen.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.080]   It's all glued.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.440]   It's just not.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.960]   They said repairs will break it.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.960]   That's not a tear down that went through how they water resisted it.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.200]   Yeah, that was cool, wasn't it?
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:15.920]   Yeah, did you see that?
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.420]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:20.040]   They talked about all the gaskets they put around the power button in the USB
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.680]   and all that kind of stuff, and where all of the features were.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.680]   Oh my goodness.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.920]   We are ready to go.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.560]   Jason.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.560]   This is the one.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.560]   This is the one.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.560]   This is the one.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.560]   He's so fast.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.240]   You can see the water test strip there.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.760]   There's three of them in there.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.840]   There's three water test strips.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.960]   And the phone we now know if the charger port is moist, we'll say, mm-hmm.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.680]   It's wet in there.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.680]   Don't plug it in.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.680]   Which is good.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.680]   Yeah, that's just what you want.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:54.360]   But it's kind of surprising how little you need to do, right, to get that water resistance.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.360]   Why didn't they do that before?
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.480]   They didn't want to go in there by nature anyway, so you just need a little bit of...
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.040]   Seal that sucker.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:06.880]   Well I know that was a big deal, and people were really upset that the S6 didn't have
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.880]   waterproofing.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.880]   Mm-hmm.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.880]   I don't know.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.040]   What are people dropping the toilet a lot?
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.040]   Is that what's going on?
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.040]   I have...
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.040]   I'm pretty good with my phones.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.920]   I rarely break or drop them.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.840]   This was a little bit sad, and it was only because it's so slippery.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.840]   I mean, I would not have dropped it.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.240]   So what were you doing when you dropped it?
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.600]   I thought I'd put it in my pocket.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.720]   And either it didn't go in all the way or something, because I wasn't bending over
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.720]   anything.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.960]   I just got in the car and I heard clatter, clatter, clatter.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.840]   And then I looked and I couldn't see it and I thought, "Oh God."
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.760]   And it was out in the street.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.760]   Jesus.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.120]   I snagged it before a car ran over it.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.120]   Oh wow.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.400]   But it hit this corner and it shattered the glass.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.400]   It's almost...
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.400]   It's like glass.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.400]   It shattered the...
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.640]   Whatever this is, it's a little shattered in and then it's cracked across.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.640]   You could feel it.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.640]   It's rough there.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.640]   The police will cover that up.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.640]   And you know what?
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.000]   You need a case on this because this edge, you hit it all the time.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.880]   Every time I give my phone to Lisa to show her something, it launches a different program
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.800]   because you can barely hold this thing without tapping the screen somehow.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.720]   Because the screen is all the way around, which just makes it beautiful.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.680]   It's an interesting...
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:16.880]   It's form over function where it's really about how...
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.000]   I mean, it's a gorgeous phone.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:27.680]   But so the case that I got from case mate will go around to cover it up, protect it.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.000]   And I wish I had it.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.560]   It's a sign of old age.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.640]   It says, "Hobi in the chatroom."
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.640]   Yeah, you start dropping things.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.000]   You forget where they are.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.200]   "Hey, where'd I leave my phone?"
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:41.600]   Where'd I leave my patch?
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.600]   That's what I feel like.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.080]   I've got a quarter of some shot in my finger.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.080]   Oh yeah?
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.080]   You've got a little spacey.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.080]   Look at that.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.080]   That's what they did to me.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.080]   Wow, what'd they do that for?
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.080]   Well, they...
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.120]   These all bruise done as a wedding.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.120]   They hit a vein, a vessel.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.120]   And it's all numb.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.760]   I can't type either.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.520]   So if I'm a little slow, it's not my fault.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.120]   The one thing you get a quarter zone or you have a tennis elbow?
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.800]   Trigger finger, that's what they're saying.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.800]   Trigger finger.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   You're shooting too much.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   Yeah, that's much.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.040]   No, I'm working in the shop too much.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.560]   I'm working in the bigger space too much.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.680]   And so my finger will...
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.680]   Wow.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.600]   Oh, I've had that.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.760]   It's hell gettin' old.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.760]   He's not even old.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.760]   He's a sad thing.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.760]   He's a young man.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.760]   Well, they say he's...
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.760]   Well, they say he's...
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.760]   A little preview for you, man.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:28.120]   They say it's more common in people with diabetes and I'm a type 1 diabetic.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.320]   Oh, there you go.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.320]   Sure.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.320]   I do.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.320]   So I've got an out.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.320]   I'm not getting old.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.320]   I got diabetes.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.520]   I'm getting old and I have diabetes.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.520]   I got a diabetes shoe now.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.520]   The diabetes.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.520]   Are you really?
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.520]   Really?
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.280]   So I'm really trying to cure myself by eating better and losing weight loss 30 pounds.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.280]   Good for you.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.600]   Working hard to get back to normal because now the doctor said it's a cascade.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   Yes.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.600]   They kept giving you other drugs.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   Now he says, "Well, we really should put John Statins."
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.600]   "No, I don't want to be on Statins."
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.600]   Me neither.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.600]   I say that every time.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.600]   No.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:57.600]   They tell me every time.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.600]   I'm like, "No, wait."
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.760]   He says, "Well, if you can bring your LDL down, you don't have to."
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.840]   David, David Agus, you know, doctorate of the stars, doctorate of the gods.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.920]   He's the guy says, "Everybody should be on Statins."
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.480]   He says, "Because of him, he personally said to me, well, I have all these things that
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.480]   are about inflammation."
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.880]   And he said, "Why the hell are you on it?
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.880]   It's about inflammation."
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.880]   Take him.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.880]   And I am.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   Really?
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.760]   He said, "I don't want to be on the side effects."
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.000]   He wrote a book.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.160]   He was Steve Jobs' doctor.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.920]   Although that's not really a good recommendation.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.680]   Well, no, he's the guy who tried to fix things.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.920]   He has a little late, I guess.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.240]   He wrote a book called The End of Illness, which I own.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.440]   And it turns out the whole book is, "Take Statins."
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.200]   And don't take vitamins.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.840]   And don't take vitamins.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.840]   So what am I doing?
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.840]   Take a lot of vitamins and no statins.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.760]   David, who also advised me personally on my prostate situation is the easy-
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.760]   Wow.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.760]   He's a doctor, dude.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.760]   Well, that's the whole.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.760]   I'm very grateful.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:50.920]   He's the world's nicest guy.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.120]   I see him at Davos every year.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.560]   Isn't he Obama too?
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.560]   Doesn't he do Obama too?
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.400]   He does a lot, a lot, a lot of people.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.960]   And he also did Robin Quivers.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.960]   And will I am?
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.960]   Oh, Robin Quivers had cancer.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.640]   And she had a huge, really bad, bad thing.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:13.480]   And Howard Stern got ahold of David and said, "These help, my dear friend is dying."
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.640]   And he advised her.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.640]   And he's amazing doctor.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   He's just a great guy.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.080]   But anyway, yeah, he says, "Take statins, statins."
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.080]   And don't take vitamins.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:24.400]   Yeah, I don't remember the full rationales of the vitamins.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.680]   I stopped because of him, but I can't remember the rationales.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.680]   I think he has numbers.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.840]   It's all dated with him.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:34.120]   Well, data also says you shouldn't eat every day, every other day.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.120]   You know that, right?
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.120]   That's the newest thing.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.760]   It's fast every other day.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.760]   No.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.760]   I do intermittent.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.000]   Well, he argues strenuously that you have to be on a regular schedule of food.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Oh, see.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Nobody.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.480]   I don't know what to do because nobody agrees.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:51.560]   Right, Dr. Mom?
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.800]   People on a healthy diet don't need vitamins, she says.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.360]   I'm on a healthy diet.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.240]   I don't mind expensive urine.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.320]   I feel like that's...
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.480]   I've earned that right.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.480]   This week in your health.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.920]   What were we talking about before we got on that?
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.760]   We had old...
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:09.760]   Can we rewind?
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.760]   Yeah, I know.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.760]   I was gonna talk.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.760]   I was gonna talk about the Google Doodle.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.960]   It was young Aaron at his finger.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:17.960]   At his finger.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:18.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.160]   Fickle finger of fate.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.240]   So have you seen the Google Doodle today?
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.240]   It's awesome.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.920]   I couldn't get it to work.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.320]   It's maybe the anniversary of the Theoremen or something?
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.520]   I don't know.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.960]   So you get Theoremen lessons.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.440]   She says, "Please repeat after me."
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.000]   And then you do it.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.240]   Lesson two.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.000]   Now she's gonna do a little more.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.800]   By the way, you have to apparently go through this in the Theoremen lesson in order to play
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.680]   the Theoremen, which we'll be able to do as soon as I...
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.120]   I've done this on a different machine.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.560]   I hope they save a cookie.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.960]   So there I've done the three notes.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.760]   And now there's one last.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:02.000]   G F sharp B E D.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.320]   So let's see if I can master the Theoremen.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:11.640]   G F sharp B E D.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.240]   Now she's gonna play a little song for us.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.160]   On the Theoremen inevitably.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.920]   Sounds like a science fiction movie.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.920]   Who invented it?
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.920]   Was it Tesla?
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.360]   There's an Inventive Theoremen.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.960]   There's a graphic that comes up at the end to find out about her.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:34.440]   Oh, she's the famous Theoremen player.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.440]   Not a great instance.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.440]   Of course, Leo.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.440]   The Inventive.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.440]   Oh, the guy's name was Theoremen.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.440]   Yes.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.440]   Doiit.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.200]   I know Moge used it a lot.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.200]   He was started in that before.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.240]   And that was Clara Rockmore.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.200]   Oh, it does not rock, in fact.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.600]   She inspired Led Zeppelin in the Rolling Stones, however.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:40:00.680]   A pioneer in electronic music and a Theoremen master and today is her 105th birthday.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.680]   And if you want to hear...
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.600]   It's the easiest doodle ever.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.600]   More of her music.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.640]   It is, in fact, on Google Play.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.640]   Here we go.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:09.640]   The Clara Rockmore.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:14.440]   She was a Lithuanian virtuoso of The Theoremen.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.440]   Let's...
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.440]   What do you want to hear?
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.320]   A little box suite for orchestra?
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.440]   Burke just pointed out the Star Trek theme.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.440]   Ahhh.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:30.840]   Now remember, this is before Moge.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.440]   This is before Frippa or Tronix.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:39.880]   This was done in the air between the two.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.360]   So the way it works is your hand.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.320]   I got to go back to the page because I want to...
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.400]   I hope it remembers that I had my lessons.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.400]   It doesn't.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.400]   Oh man.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.400]   It doesn't?
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.400]   You got to go again?
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.400]   Oh no.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.400]   Son of a gun.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.480]   Why does it do that?
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.680]   You know, maybe we should remember also George Martin, Sir George Martin who passed away.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:01.680]   Yes, that's true.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.680]   Really, at the rightful age of...
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.680]   50.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.680]   90, of course he was the fifth Beatle.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.720]   He was the sixth Beatle because it was already a fifth.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.040]   Right, exactly.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:16.200]   But really instrumental, not only in signing the Beatles after everyone else had turned them
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   down, but in helping craft them into the legends that they were.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:26.320]   You know, if you want to hear some of his best work, go see The Love Show in Vegas, The
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.760]   Cirque du Soleil Show.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.760]   It's a Beatles show.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.760]   But he remixed.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:34.960]   And then remixed all the old Beatles music and the tapes and stuff they had in the library
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:35.960]   to make it the music.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.920]   And it's incredible.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.880]   The Beatles and surround sound.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.880]   Wow.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.880]   We're wide ranging.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.880]   We're wondering all over the place.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.120]   I like a show.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.120]   So how about Google+, okay.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.760]   Let me hear what you're thinking about this.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.960]   So are you talking about the fact that Moot?
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.960]   Yes.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:03.240]   Chris Poole, the founder of 4chan, has apparently taken a job at Google working under Bradley
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.320]   Horowitz.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.320]   And it's not sure.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.560]   It's not clear what he's doing.
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.480]   Chris Bradley is running what is it called?
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.600]   Streams and streams and interests or streams and weird.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.600]   Something weird.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:18.440]   But Moot, some say, I've seen tweets say he's working in the photos part of this.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.520]   He's not the social network.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:25.000]   Although, man, the guy who started 4chan would really be a good person to have working on
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   the social network.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.200]   And you don't think about, I've met Moot at a Google event.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.840]   Nice, the most unassuming guy you can imagine.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.560]   Oh, you can't blame him for slash beast.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:35.560]   Not at all.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.560]   Not at all.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.120]   But people I think, you know, so just a wonderful, wonderful guy.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.560]   And very smart, obviously.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:45.360]   And experience that where things can go wrong, which is valuable experience.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.360]   You know?
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.360]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.400]   I mean, if you're doing a social network, I don't know about photos.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.880]   I don't, is he a programmer?
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.880]   What is his?
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:53.880]   That's a good question.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:54.880]   What is his skill?
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.640]   He says, today in his blog, Chris hates writing.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.800]   We know that's one thing that is not a skill.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.120]   Today I'm excited to announce I've joined Google.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:07.000]   When meeting with current and former Googlers, I continually find myself drawn to their intelligence,
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.880]   passion, and enthusiasm, as well as a universal desire to share it with others.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:15.240]   I'm also impressed by Google's commitment to enabling these same talented people to tackle
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.680]   some of the world's most interesting and important problems.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.680]   Yada, yada, yada.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:24.760]   He does mention his own experience from a dozen years of building online communities.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:29.480]   So gosh, it'd be really cool if Google hadn't given up on Google+.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:33.080]   And said, who could we bring in to reinvent this?
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.120]   Right.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.200]   What does the world need?
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.160]   What could Google+ be?
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:42.160]   I think an antidote to Twitter is a good start.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.360]   So Twitter was not going away, and we need Twitter.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.680]   But what's wrong with Twitter?
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.240]   Well, one anonymity, right?
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:53.200]   And as long as you have somewhere to do anonymity, you don't have to be in.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:57.680]   So I think the real name's policy on Facebook and Google+ is fine.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.000]   So real names.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.280]   And the other thing, Twitter does very well as conversations, which is only really kind
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.760]   of an afterthought on Twitter.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.920]   Groups of people is what they pride themselves on.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:16.160]   Yeah, but boy, that was a flop, I think, because how many-- I mean, circles was a great
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.160]   idea.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:21.040]   Okay, so the other one is interests and the one thing that didn't work so terribly well
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.480]   was photography.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.880]   Why did photography work well, just because they had Trey Radcliffe, because there was
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.880]   functionality that made the thing that Trey liked, I know, because I've talked a lot with
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.240]   him about it, is how they displayed the images.
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.240]   They displayed them big.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.400]   They didn't unlike Facebook.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.600]   They didn't squinch him down.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:42.120]   But even Trey made sure that he posted not just on Google+, he posted everywhere, including
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:44.120]   Twitter and Facebook.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:48.120]   Yeah, interests are really the key, I think.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.440]   They tried to capitalize on that a little bit, but I don't think they did it well enough.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:58.040]   What brings you back to Google+, for me, I can tell you, it's that because I'm into
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:01.880]   technology and because most of the people on there are into technology, anytime I want
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.720]   to know anything about what's going on in the Raspberry Pi or making something or anything.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.320]   And you follow those particular groups?
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.320]   Is that how that happens?
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.320]   Or I just do a search.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.320]   Or you just do a search.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.320]   There's just a wealth of knowledge on it.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.320]   And I do follow those groups.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.880]   So I follow Raspberry Pi, I follow Arduino, I follow, you know, people that-- and people
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.440]   that I know that are makers, that I want to see what they're doing.
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.440]   I do follow those things.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.600]   And so when my feed comes up, it's full of stuff that's so interesting to me.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   I almost have to avoid it sometimes because I know as soon as I open it up, I don't go
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.600]   there as often as I used to.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:33.000]   When I do, I'm going to get stuck there for a couple of hours because I'm going to be
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.560]   following up on all of these things.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.440]   So for me, it still works really well.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.440]   So they should be less engaging?
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.440]   Maybe.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:45.160]   It is a good place if you want Google information.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.720]   You know, that kind of stuff.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:47.720]   Kind of stuff.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:48.720]   Geek stuff.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:49.720]   It's great.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:54.120]   I find the board game group that I focus on, I like board games.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.840]   And just people love it for that.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:01.520]   Well, it's really the case with Facebook too, the more you put into it, the better it is.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.280]   I've gotten getting a lot of spam.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:09.960]   And for some reason, Google, you know, that they surface popular posts, not from people
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.800]   you follow or circles of yours.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:18.040]   And for some reason, the popular posts are all right-wing, Adjut prop.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:22.640]   They're not even like, you know, just conservative, I don't mind a conservative post, but they're
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:23.480]   like horrible.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:27.880]   And I don't know why I keep getting those in my feed.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.000]   Is there something I did?
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.080]   But that's a sure way to get you out of a site, right?
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.880]   By forcing you to look at something bad.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:38.880]   Mm-hmm.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:43.280]   The problem is I basically got about five people I know who are left posting them.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:47.280]   Lauren Weinstein is like, that's like-
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.160]   90% of the post I see.
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:50.160]   And he's great.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.160]   He's great.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.160]   And Peter Volgull.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:56.040]   There's just like a handful now are still posting there.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.240]   Even Mike Elgin, I don't see as much.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.240]   No.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.240]   So can I-so Twitter?
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:04.280]   Let me go back to that for a second, if I may.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:08.520]   I found the weirdest thing the last couple days is suddenly I'm getting-last maybe two
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.920]   weeks actually.
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.280]   I start getting tagged in other people's conversations.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.520]   They're like, I'll tweet something, somebody else will retweet it.
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:17.360]   And then five people get into a conversation.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:22.840]   And the next five days I'm getting their goddamn conversation until they untie me or they just
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.760]   get tired and move on.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:25.760]   That's recent.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.760]   Really?
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.760]   You didn't use to get that?
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.760]   Anything, not like this.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:35.000]   Was there any change in the UI in the last few weeks that would make that different?
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.760]   I can't figure out why suddenly it's happening.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:37.760]   It's happening like crazy.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:38.760]   And of course it's all-
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.960]   And are you included in an at-tag?
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.400]   Yeah, but included in an at-tag.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:44.560]   So they reply, they reply, they reply, they reply, they reply.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:47.120]   They end up with four people tagged in it.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.120]   And it's always-
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.120]   It's a canoe.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.120]   It's a right-wing political thing.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.120]   Oh.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.120]   So maybe they're using some-
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.120]   They're harassing you.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:56.320]   No, it's not so much that they just go back and forth and back and forth.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   Yes, he did.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.320]   No, he didn't.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.320]   Yes, he did.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.320]   No, he didn't.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:01.320]   Yeah, and you don't want to be in that conversation because you don't want to see it.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.840]   And how would you get rid of it only by muting those people, right?
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.840]   Right.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:10.240]   And I don't want to do some client that they use or that's popular in that world or what
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.240]   it is.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.240]   That's not weird.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.160]   Well, everybody likes to bait you.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.160]   That's why.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.800]   No, it's not aimed at me even.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:17.800]   They're having their own conversation.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:18.800]   That's why you're in it, though.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.600]   I'm trapped in the elevator.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:24.960]   That doesn't sound like fun.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.920]   Can you ignore a conversation or temporarily mute a conversation?
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.640]   That would be a nice feature.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.200]   Now we're fixing Twitter again.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.200]   Yeah, well-
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.960]   We tried to fix Google+ and we switched to Twitter.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.440]   That's the problem right there in a nutshell.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.440]   I don't know.
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:44.160]   I'm getting nostalgic for Google+.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.160]   I haven't been in a while.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:49.080]   I'm going back to this and it's pretty and it's nice and it's easy.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.360]   I really liked it.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.320]   Got it.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:49:00.640]   If there is a threat to my social network participation going back to 2006, it's that
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:08.400]   I always go to the place where threaded conversations flourish because to me, and by the way, nobody
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.400]   wants that.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:15.920]   That's why Twitter has succeeded and Jai Ku and Buzzfeed and Friend Feed and Google+ seem
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.720]   to have all failed because it's a threaded conversation.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.800]   It's like too much info.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:26.120]   You know that Google knows that because in the most recent redesign, they kind of hide
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.120]   the thread.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:32.120]   You only see one comment that you're rotating through.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:35.120]   It says, "No, there's no thread here."
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.720]   That's just the post.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:41.000]   But to me, it's the comments, the threaded comments that are what make.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.600]   That's why I liked message boards and forums.
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:49.040]   But I actually like the way they do it because it doesn't always...
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.040]   This is interesting.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.240]   It doesn't always suck into it.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.240]   You suck into it.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.240]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.600]   I'm just pulling apart a seven segment in display last night.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.600]   This is a four segment.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.600]   Eight or three segments.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.720]   Anyway, that's why I love Google+.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.680]   I actually like the way they do the comments because before I was feeling on the really
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.120]   popular, the Mike Elgin post...
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:07.120]   You get long.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.120]   My word.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.240]   It was like you get buried in it.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.240]   No, this is an improvement.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.200]   So it's an improvement for me anyway.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.200]   And if I'm really interested in the topic, I will go ahead and click on it and then scroll
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.200]   down to the comment.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.520]   You still know there's a threaded conversation there.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.960]   Yeah, I think Google+ did that pretty well where the post is foremost.
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:23.960]   It's visual.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.360]   That's one thing that they do very well.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.440]   There's always images and the images pop.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.480]   They're big.
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.640]   They did that right.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.640]   I don't know.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.640]   Why did Google+ not succeed?
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.520]   Well, circles, I would say.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.640]   As good an idea as that was, nobody wants to do it.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.560]   Well, because people couldn't get their friends and family into it, basically, right?
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.360]   I mean, they couldn't get them off Facebook.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.360]   They couldn't get the network effect.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.080]   Yeah, they just couldn't do it.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.080]   But this is not...
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:52.320]   I mean, Facebook not be as engaging as Facebook for most people.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.320]   Really?
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.320]   Do you think?
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.520]   It's way more engaging for me, but I'm not a people person.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.680]   You know, I don't...
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:50:59.680]   That's the problem.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.880]   It's a social network for people who hate people.
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:02.880]   Well, yeah.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:03.880]   There you go.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:04.880]   You nailed it.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.280]   That's why you and I and Jeff like it.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.800]   People from Google work.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.000]   The Commodgens like it.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.720]   I mean, you were talking about getting the right-wing stuff on your Google+, I get way
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.600]   more on Facebook.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:21.000]   And so, I tend to tune it out and turn it off and not go to Facebook because I hate seeing
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   it.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.280]   Yeah, but in that case, at least for me on Facebook, because I followed all, you know,
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:31.240]   Cruz and Rubio and Trump, and I wanted to see those posts.
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:32.560]   And I don't mind those discussions.
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.760]   But I don't like to be forced.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.120]   And this is what Google+, and you know what?
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.360]   It looks like they've stopped doing it.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.120]   But you know the hot...
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.320]   The hot was always stuff I did not want to see.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.320]   Right.
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.960]   And I didn't even say, "Why is this hot?
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.040]   It's got three comments and two likes.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:49.160]   Why are you surfacing this in my hot feet?"
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.160]   You know what?
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.160]   I don't see them anymore.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:55.360]   Well, I just saw what was hot on Google+, think dragons are a myth.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.960]   This tiny real life dragging is causing an uproar.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.000]   See, I don't want to see that.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.520]   I met Be Hot on Google+, I'm not following.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:03.520]   I'm following this person.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.680]   I don't want to see this post.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.160]   But here's the paradox.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:11.520]   The more people abandon it, the more they need to fill your feed with stuff like that.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:16.680]   This does have 521 pluses, so that's probably why it's in there.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.560]   I don't know.
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:20.560]   You would think that Google...
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:25.160]   Here's another one, trending on Google+, giant grizzly bear attacks workers in their
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.080]   trucks in terrifying video.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:31.400]   It's exactly what I don't want to be in my Google+ feed.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.400]   Right.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.360]   It only has 33 pluses and 6 comments.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.320]   Why is that trending?
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.320]   Conspiracy club.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.320]   I wouldn't follow conspiracy club.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.960]   Well, it's definitely not as terrifying as a dragon.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:44.960]   You're right.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.440]   I haven't been doing a hot thing.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.440]   I almost never did.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.440]   I can turn that off, right?
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:51.440]   Can I turn that off?
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.600]   Maybe I should turn that off.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.800]   I just go to my home.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.800]   How do you turn off hot?
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:57.400]   Well, I'm on home.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.400]   Oh, you're on home?
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.920]   Can't you...used to be, you could say, turn a...push a slider.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:03.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.720]   That was actually a good feature.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.720]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.720]   It's gone.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:09.520]   See, we don't even know how it works anymore.
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.520]   You see, Google?
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.520]   You know, they're listening.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.520]   They're waiting for us to solve this problem.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:17.080]   We're not going to need us.
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:21.640]   I'm not solving a single problem for you until you solve the multiple-sided problem.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:23.840]   I'm holding any problem solving hostage.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:24.840]   Leo, and I...
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:28.920]   And Jordan and I, we know solutions to guns and problems.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.520]   But we're not letting them out until you solve that.
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.520]   That's right.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:35.720]   Yeah, that's so annoying.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:40.800]   What we're asking is what moot could bring to the table.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.760]   If indeed, moot is working on Google+, what he could bring to the table and how he could
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:48.320]   take his vast knowledge of what makes us online communities work.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.320]   What were the startups he was working on?
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.760]   He was working on two that didn't work.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:57.560]   Well, there was some irony because even though he's so strongly associated with 4chan,
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:00.600]   4chan lost money like never made any money.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:04.600]   And so he had to fund it with his own startups.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.600]   And eventually...
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.600]   So he started...
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.600]   ...retired from...
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:08.600]   Canvas.
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:09.600]   Canvas...
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.600]   This is...
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:11.600]   Oh, Canvas was...
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.360]   I wasn't that a Google acquisition?
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:15.360]   It was a 2014...
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:16.920]   Canvas was great.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:17.920]   Canvas was great.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:18.920]   Oh.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:22.120]   What did it do again?
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.920]   Mmm.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.920]   It's DrawQuest.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.760]   It went out of business in 2014.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:30.400]   And there was another one, I think, that he did.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:34.120]   Give it all the hoo-ha about identity in Google+.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:40.600]   It was just someone who was so much around the notion of anonymity there.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:44.440]   You know, it wasn't until 2008 that anybody even knew who moot was.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:46.880]   Wall Street Journal added him.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.360]   Right.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.360]   Hm.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.360]   Cute guy.
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.360]   He's not very old.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.360]   Oh, okay.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.360]   He's in his 20s.
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.360]   47, 28.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:55:00.240]   Canvas Networks was a website centered on sharing and remixing media, particularly images.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.160]   I was in Canvas.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.160]   I used Canvas.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:04.160]   You've been in everything.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:05.160]   You've been in everything.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.160]   Canvas was cool.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.160]   I didn't realize anyone had a business.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.160]   That just shows you.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:11.160]   I hadn't used it all.
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:17.840]   It had funding from Andreessen Horowitz, his beachal, Lehrer, Hippo, founder, and Joshua
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.400]   Shachter.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.400]   Good people.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.800]   Shachter, of course, from Delicious.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:29.840]   It was an image board that allows for anonymous and anonymous sharing and commenting on media
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:34.040]   as well as the remixing of posted images and the adding of music to animated GIFs.
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.040]   Interesting.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.040]   Oh, right.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.040]   So this becomes really interesting.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:43.920]   If you try to take just a static photo thing in an age of GIFs and remixing where photos
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:46.680]   still are, Google Photo is the killer.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:51.400]   What if you really amped up Google Photo with the ability to share things more and do
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.000]   things more things to it?
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.320]   Or even, I mean, it's reasonable to assume that Google realizes that the visual element
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:01.440]   is the reason that Google+ had as much traction as it did.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:02.920]   We've just talked about that.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.960]   And they extracted photos from it.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:11.040]   So maybe putting some sort of visual element back in or support for visual back in.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.040]   I just realized something.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:17.000]   I was holding on to the fact that I was a Google+ user for all the time and I wouldn't
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.120]   switch over it because of the damn Jewick.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.120]   Ouch.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:23.120]   Now what I care.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:25.120]   Yeah, I'll switch over to the apps.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.080]   Well, it's fixing so much as I can.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.880]   I'll move over whatever I was going to move over.
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.480]   It's fixed because you don't care anymore.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.480]   Yeah, I don't look care.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:32.480]   Whatever was I was going to lose.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.480]   I don't care anymore.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.480]   So I'll just move it over.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:39.440]   There is some good stuff in here, actually.
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:40.960]   Mine is always filled with good stuff.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.960]   So I think this format is a little bit of a great.
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.640]   It's not as easy as much as it's all.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:46.640]   Oh, here we go.
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.520]   Ladies and gentlemen, we're going.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.080]   What happens?
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.080]   Nutty buddy.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.080]   Seven seconds.
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:56.000]   Six, seven, five, five, six, six, four seconds.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.880]   Three seconds.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.600]   All right.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.120]   There it goes.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:04.000]   Into inland.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.140]   We're off to inland.
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:08.060]   We could do it in inland.
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:11.620]   Never never land.
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.560]   Hmm.
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:15.680]   Do we talk about fire opening up, by the way?
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:16.680]   Yeah, we didn't.
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:17.680]   Which is great.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.680]   We didn't.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   We didn't.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.680]   We talked off the air.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:25.000]   But you can now buy a Nexus phone and get fine with it.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.960]   In fact, you'll get a discount on a Nexus 5X.
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.040]   Which I think, you're a fire user.
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.040]   I'm not.
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:34.040]   Because my phone is on the corporate land.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:37.000]   I have been getting my six P's on five.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.600]   My six was before that.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.800]   It's the best deal in the cell service.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:45.880]   You pay 20 bucks for unlimited voice and text in the US.
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:56.080]   And then $10 a gigabyte and it's sliced pretty thin or fractional usage is also counted.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:00.200]   I'm, my bill never goes over 30 bucks because mostly I'm on Wi-Fi.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:06.040]   It also does a great job of seamlessly handing off calls in call from Sprint to T-Mobile to
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.080]   Wi-Fi, whichever is better.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:16.320]   And I mentioned a couple of weeks ago the signal spy program that lets you know what
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:17.560]   your carrier you are.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:22.520]   And one thing is interesting is T-Mobile was always on T-Mobile in pedal and until Sprint
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:26.360]   got better than suddenly I'm on Sprint some to a lot more here.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:30.520]   So I think that this system really works for them.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:35.680]   And of course overseas it's going to work too because both Sprint and T-Mobile offer unlimited
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:39.720]   data and texting overseas and you'll get that benefit as well.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:43.240]   You didn't find that that, I mean I must be doing constant polling in the background
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.240]   of those networks.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:46.520]   You didn't find that your battery, or your battery?
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.520]   No.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:50.080]   I would like battery life to be a little bit better on the six P.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:51.080]   Sure.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.640]   But no, I don't think that that was part of the problem.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.800]   Fi is a really, I highly recommended it.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:02.240]   If you're looking for kind of a no nonsense carrier, it's really ironic that the MVNO's
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:09.440]   which this is, Ting is one of our old sponsors, Straight Talk, all of those networks are
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:11.520]   MVNO's, a resell version.
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:12.520]   Virgin.
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:16.440]   Well, Virgin is owned by Sprint now so I don't know if it's an MVNO as much as just an off-brand
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.880]   version of Sprint.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:23.600]   But in almost every case they do a better job than the carriers are reselling.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:27.520]   The experience on Ting and Google Fi is so much better than the experience with Sprint
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:29.520]   directly or T-Mobile directly.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.880]   It's a really, it's funny.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.040]   Now anybody in the US can sign up for it.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:35.160]   I wonder if they'll go international with this.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.160]   Fi is great.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.160]   Highly recommend it.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:39.160]   I've been very happy with it.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.080]   And what a deal.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:44.000]   I have three different, four different carriers.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.800]   I have experience with everything.
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:48.560]   I finally got rid of Verizon.
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:50.680]   I just couldn't take it anymore.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:54.840]   Mostly because of you, Jeff, in protest of Jeff's poor treatment.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.480]   So you gave up Verizon.
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.320]   Who you were playing with?
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.400]   Oh, no, I was low enough Verizon.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.720]   I've been on AT&T, but I had devices on Verizon.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.720]   My wife's tablet was on Verizon.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.440]   My things were on Verizon.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.480]   And I had a MIFI and I got hacked.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:15.240]   So people were using it to add phones that just exist from an account.
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.400]   Yeah, so I had to go around and around and around.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.400]   I went through like four times.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.400]   I had to re-cancel things.
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.800]   They were trying to build me.
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:20.960]   I finally had it.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:21.960]   I tweeted about it.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:27.600]   So it went up to those nice ladies and corporate who have to deal with the jerks.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.520]   I said, listen, all I want is to go away.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.240]   All you want is for me to go away.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.040]   That's not divorce, divorce, right?
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.040]   So please, please.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.040]   Please.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.040]   They did it.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.040]   They took me off entirely.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.040]   It's okay, but I'm gone.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.040]   I'm gone.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.040]   I'm free.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.040]   And then what happens?
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.680]   Two weeks later, Verizon announces they're testing 5G in my town.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.040]   Oh, no.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.040]   I want it.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.040]   Oh, no.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:53.560]   So I'm almost tempted to email the nice ladies and say, if you want to try and have us
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.440]   make up, what a kiss and make up here.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.040]   Can I have 5G?
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.040]   Yes.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.040]   Wow.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.440]   That would be one of the first places in the country.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.440]   That's very early.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.440]   It is very early.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:09.000]   So I live in the, what is the former headquarters of AT&T?
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:17.960]   And then has a huge Verizon facility and Verizon wireless facility within a mile of my house.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:23.200]   And the old knock is about four miles from my house.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:29.040]   So this was, I mean, there's got to be fiber all over this place.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:41.520]   So I want the 5, but now if I've been to me, do I regret my waves?
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.520]   Let's see.
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:46.800]   Well, we didn't solve Google+ at all.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.520]   It was worth a try.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.880]   We haven't fixed Twitter either.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.240]   We really got to get to work here.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.120]   We're not doing our job.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:02:01.800]   Google had 75 million takedown requests last month.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:06.520]   That's a 3,000% increase over the same time in 2012.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:09.760]   This is of course, DMCA, not right to be forgotten.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:16.080]   I'm sure that number is going up to 75 million DMCA requests.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.000]   That's 100,000 links an hour.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.240]   How do you even do that?
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:27.880]   Torrent Freak says partly this is because the amount of pirated content is increased on
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:35.280]   the internet, but also because the MPAA, RIAA, and other copyright holders are using algorithms
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.200]   that spot pirated content quickly.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:47.600]   My friend, the guy I worked with in Toronto, he calls himself the blind gamer.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:51.320]   Let me see if I can find the image he posted.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:03:00.520]   He got the sweetest image from YouTube.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.940]   A takedown notice from...
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:05.440]   What was exactly a takedown notice?
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:15.480]   It was saying the Universal Music Group has said that you're using their music in this
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.480]   video.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:23.360]   I hope you don't mind, but they've turned on monetization and they're taking the money.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.360]   I hope that's okay.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.400]   If this is wrong, please let us know.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.400]   That was from YouTube?
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.480]   Yeah, it was really.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.480]   It was super sweet.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.120]   Yeah, I got one of those too, I was surprised.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:41.200]   I did a little video of Fallout 4 and I put Radioactive to the trailer for Fallout 4 and
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.200]   everybody on Reddit hated it obviously.
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:48.040]   I felt the wrath of Reddit, but my kids liked it.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.840]   They said, "Dad, that's awesome."
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.840]   I was happy.
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.120]   But yeah, I got a monetization notice.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.120]   It was nice.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:59.200]   It was like, we're so sorry, but just letting you know.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.480]   Well, you know what can be civilized?
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.480]   Yeah.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.480]   It can be a neutral benefit.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.480]   That's the way it should be.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.360]   It's just gotten way, way, way too out of control.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.760]   Too easy.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:14.720]   There should be some sort of process you go through when this happens.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.680]   It's just way too easy for someone.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:21.000]   If you've been spending any time on Reddit lately or any of the social media networks,
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.960]   you'll see that people are getting really mad because their content, this one guy I
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.600]   saw just recently got his video taken down for absolutely no reason.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.120]   He was outside in his front yard videotaping himself.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.120]   What?
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.840]   And he got his videotape, he got a takedown notice.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.080]   He's like, "There's nothing here.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.040]   It's my front yard and me."
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.960]   How can you claim?
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.960]   So I really feel bad for content producers.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:42.960]   Well, it's done automatically.
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.160]   It's happened to us too.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.680]   We've always appealed it and saying, "No, we're a news operation.
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.000]   That's fair use."
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.400]   And they've always backed down.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:56.680]   And I think then at some point after a while, they flipped a switch because it's kind of
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.240]   hardly happens ever anymore.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.240]   It's very rare.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:00.800]   So you got an algorithm for that?
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:01.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.800]   All these errors are news.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.800]   Don't bother.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   Right.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.800]   So they're trying to do it.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.800]   Right.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:14.160]   They're either not, the notices are not accusatory or mean.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.760]   They're sympathetic, which is interesting.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.840]   And then they're trying to make it better if it's by mistake.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:25.680]   Don't worry if this is a ripe business opportunity though for the right person.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:26.920]   Don't think so.
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:29.240]   Come up with the next YouTube.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.240]   No.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.520]   I wonder if there was a viable alternative.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.040]   I wonder if people would say, "See ya.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.760]   I'm going someplace else where I don't give birth.
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.000]   That's what Facebook tried to do, right?
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.720]   I don't know if that's working.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.000]   I like Vimeo, but they don't have the...
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   I love Vimeo.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   Never really took off.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   Never really took off.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   It's still out there.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   I love going.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   I use it whenever I can.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   People still use it.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.080]   Although it's owned by Hollywood, it's owned by ICM.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.080]   Mm-hmm.
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.080]   So...
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.080]   You didn't know that.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.080]   Yeah, by the big talent agency.
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.080]   I think it's ICM.
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:03.560]   Google has extended the right to be forgotten to everywhere.
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.800]   Well, almost everywhere.
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:06.800]   It's hostile.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.280]   Wildly complicated.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:12.200]   So the EU and various countries in Europe were after Google because Google, they thought
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.920]   cynically just said, "If you're taking down the right to be forgotten in Spain, we'll
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.680]   block the link in Spain."
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.440]   "Well, no, it's blocked worldwide."
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.160]   "Well, no," said Google probably.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.520]   We're not doing that.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.520]   So then it's a complicated formula where...
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.040]   I can't remember the exact formula.
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.400]   But if you try to get to it in Spain, you won't get to Spain.
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:34.440]   If you try to get to it from a Google browser in the EU, you won't get to it.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:39.720]   But if you get to it from a non-EU browser in, let's say, the United States, you will
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:44.440]   still get the link because they won't block the rest of the world.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.400]   So if you're a European customer in Europe, it's blocked.
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.760]   And if you're a European customer in that country, it's blocked.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:55.040]   And if you're a European customer outside that country, you're using a European browser.
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.280]   I think it gets blocked.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.360]   But if you're using a non-European browser, it doesn't.
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:01.080]   Or you can just use a friggin' VPN, ignore it all.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:05.000]   And act like you're American where we have a friggin' First Amendment and believe in
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.880]   free speech and not trying to rewrite history.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:11.080]   It is complicated.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.080]   I'm going to...
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:15.080]   The reason I'm going to be in trouble for next week is because I got invited to go to
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.600]   Seabit in Germany.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.080]   Have fun in Hamburg.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.920]   It will be in Hanover.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.920]   Hanover, that's right.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.800]   As they say, pardon me.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:29.080]   And I'll be doing a keynote at Seabit itself, but before that, I'll be on an EU/EC.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:35.600]   Two panels there on the same stage afterwards with Güntje Itenge, the vice president of
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.480]   the European Council, who's the one who's threatening to bring the right to be forgotten
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.040]   to all of Europe.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.600]   So it's still very much a hot issue there.
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:47.600]   And I'll come over an all finger wag like the obnoxious Merritt.
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:51.880]   So it's worth noting that that's there and I'm going to cause trouble next week.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.880]   Good.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.640]   And but we'll miss you.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.640]   I will be best.
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.800]   Yes, we're going to now have to look far and wide for a replacement.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.280]   However, I have the week following.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.320]   I'm hoping I'll be in New York.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.680]   I have good news.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:03.680]   Yes.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:07.640]   George Castorani, who's the head of our all of our studio operations and all that is
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:08.640]   a wonderful guy.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:13.120]   He came back excitedly and said, we're on.
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.920]   So I presume what we will get details there, but I presume what we're doing is we're basically
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.920]   doing the three of us.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:20.320]   We hope Gina's there live before our cameras.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:22.680]   Switch it in New York and just feed it to Petaluma.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:23.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.080]   And we'll apply lower thirds locally.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.080]   I think we have to do that.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.000]   We were talking about that yesterday, right?
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.920]   Jason Klandt, we can do that.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.440]   We apply our local thirds here, lower thirds here.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.800]   Oh, you'll do it back there.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.440]   It's a little tricky because you're switching it.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.440]   So right.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.640]   Jason's going to have to be really quick on it.
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.160]   I mean, Jeff just said they could do it.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.160]   We could maybe do it.
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.320]   No, they don't have our assets.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.320]   Oh, got you.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.720]   I mean, we could try, but it seems complicated.
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.560]   I don't know what kind of switch they have.
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.440]   I don't know what their asset formats need to be.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.640]   I think what we'll do is for the live feed.
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:00.440]   We won't do lower thirds for live and we'll apply them after the fact.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:01.440]   That's what we're going to do.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:02.800]   We'll just do it like this for the lower third.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.800]   There you go.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.800]   The live feed.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.280]   And then we'll drop in the names as they need.
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.280]   Yeah, we'll fix that.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:09.280]   So let's contact some New Yorkers.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:12.920]   You must know somebody lives in New York to see if there's anybody else wants to be
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:13.920]   on the show.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:17.560]   Certainly Sarah Bartlett could be on the show, but you're Dean.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:24.440]   But Jay Rosen, if he wants to come over, Emily Bell, I'd love to see if we can get Baratunde,
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:29.440]   maybe Osparettunde if he wants to go.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.440]   He works on the daily show now.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:35.440]   The Starwood Baratunde would be great to have Baratunde.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.440]   It'd be fun to get into things.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.440]   It's hard to get them.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:43.080]   But since we're in his neighborhood, we don't have 30 cameras like you.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.680]   Well, we can huddle together.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.680]   We leave and share mics.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:47.680]   It's really as plenty.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.680]   So we'll have, and then we'll offer actual operators, which we can do.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:51.680]   Wow.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.680]   Fancy.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:53.680]   Shmancy.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.440]   But we've got really good people.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.440]   Yay.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.440]   I'm very pleased.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.400]   So that will be on the 23rd, March 23rd, a special New York edition of this week in
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.400]   Google.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.040]   Now you don't have room for an audience in there.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.640]   You probably have security issues, right?
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.400]   People can't just wander in.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.040]   If you have like five friends, that's easy.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.040]   Well, I'm going to bring my wife.
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.040]   Yes.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.040]   Son, but no, no.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.040]   So we won't do actually.
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.400]   Actually, Jake might be home.
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:20.840]   I'd love to see Jake, but we won't do a studio audience.
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:21.840]   Just so we're done.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.120]   Yeah, unless we did the newsroom, and that's too much effort.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.120]   Yeah, we're a studio.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.120]   We're a studio.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.120]   We won't have everyone else.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.360]   However, students are set, it's not designed yet.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.080]   Students will want to watch, and our new producer will want to watch.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.080]   Yes.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.080]   Yes.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.720]   And the entire cast of Hamilton will be there.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:36.720]   Yes.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.720]   Performing.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:38.720]   Performing.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.720]   Those are good news.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:41.720]   Thank you, George.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:42.720]   Thank you, George.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.720]   Thank you, George.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:44.720]   Hey, that's great.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:45.720]   The 23rd.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:46.720]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:49.320]   Come back with more Google and Facebook.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.320]   There's some Facebook news.
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.640]   Big hack.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.280]   Don't worry, it's been fixed.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.280]   Coming up, but first a word from Gazelle.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.280]   Maybe now.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:02.320]   Maybe now you listen to me about selling that old phone and getting yourself maybe one of
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:07.480]   them nice new Google five phones, or perhaps you're excited about the new Apple phone,
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:10.040]   which is supposedly coming out in a couple of weeks.
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:14.360]   Gazelle's the place to get a quote today on your old phone.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.880]   Reason is, no consumer electronics devices going up in value.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.120]   Do not delay.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:26.280]   If you want to upgrade, then you better get a quote today.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:30.000]   And the nice thing is every quote on Gazelle is guaranteed for 30 days.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.320]   So you could get the quote now and decide later whether you want to actually take advantage
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.320]   of it.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:42.840]   You're not locked in just they are G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, top dollar for lots of different used phones,
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.760]   tablets, computers, monitors.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:49.880]   And then if you're wondering, well, what happens to the stuff Gazelle buys?
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.200]   Well, some of it gets recycled and some of it gets sold and the very best stuff gets
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.200]   sold on Gazelle.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:59.400]   It is not just a place to trade in your old device for cash, but you can also buy a certified
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.000]   pre-owned one or do both.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:11.440]   Gazelle offers the best iPhones, the 6s, the 6s plus, iPads, and even Samsung Galaxy
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.320]   phones to choose from.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:18.520]   Everything Gazelle sells you is fully inspected back by a 30 day return policy sold without
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.320]   carrier contract, although they do work.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:25.320]   Of course, they have devices on all of the major carriers, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.040]   Sprint.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:29.560]   Go to Gazelle.com.
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.280]   Take a look at the stuff they're buying.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.360]   Great for a replacement phone for a kid, you know?
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.920]   And by the way, they do financing now.
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.360]   All devices, you can get financing from a firm and you do that in the checkout just
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.960]   as you just provide the basic information and they'll approve you instantly.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:51.320]   You can pay it off in three, six, or 12 months with easy payments through bank transfer,
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.400]   check, or debit card.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.360]   Just select financing with a firm as you check out.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:59.680]   They also offer 12 month warranties for cell phones and iPads.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:04.240]   Those are powered by assurance solutions that cover water damage and cracked screens and
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:07.120]   hardware defects and more.
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.120]   Help is available 24/7.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:11.280]   A process claims a return to device ASAP.
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.040]   And of course, anytime you buy a certified pre-owned device at Gazelle, besides the 30
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.200]   point checkup, there's a 30 day return policy.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.200]   So you're never on the hook.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.880]   You're going to love Gazelle.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:25.720]   Don't miss out on getting the best value on certified pre-owned devices and selling
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.640]   your old device.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.640]   Pay it forward.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.080]   Pass it along to somebody who really can give it a good home.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.880]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:39.000]   Give new life to use electronics traded in for cash or buy certified pre-owned devices
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   at Gazelle.com to day.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:54.240]   A little bit of a flaw, not a huge flaw, a little bit of a flaw in the old Facebook.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:58.160]   Some guy figured out how he could hack into any Facebook profile.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:03.960]   Steve Gibson talked a little bit about this on security now yesterday.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:10.920]   The good news is the hacker, instead of passing it out to all his bad guy friends, alerted
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:11.920]   Facebook.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:16.440]   In fact, they paid him a $15,000 bug bounty and Facebook has fixed it.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:21.400]   And on Prakash is a security engineer from India.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:26.920]   He had a great blog post titled, "How I Could Have Hacked Your Facebook Account."
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.160]   And all the Facebook accounts.
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:39.560]   Turns out, and Steve was really dismissive of this, when you do a password reset on Facebook,
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:47.560]   they send, they text you a code, a six digit code, and then they let you keep entering
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.480]   that code 10 to 12 times.
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:52.680]   Steve thought that was a bad idea.
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.520]   He said, "If you just got the phone, the code texted to you.
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.080]   If you can't do it three times, you should have to do it again."
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.080]   And he said, "I'm not going to do it.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.080]   I'm not going to do it."
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.080]   And he said, "I'm not going to do it."
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.080]   And he said, "I'm not going to do it."
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.080]   And he said, "I'm not going to do it."
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.080]   And he said, "I'm not going to do it."
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:15.080]   And he said, "I'm not going to do it."
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:18.080]   And he said, "I'm not going to do it."
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:21.080]   And he said, "I'm not going to do it."
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.080]   And he said, "I'm not going to do it."
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:28.080]   Admittedly, that's still a million codes or, you know, on average half a million codes.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.080]   But you can use software to do it.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:34.080]   He even made a video of him doing it on his own account, and he did get in.
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:37.080]   He brute-forced his own account.
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:44.080]   So he did notify Facebook and they were able to patch it, so it won't work anymore.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.080]   In fact, he must have been really happy when he got this message on March 2nd.
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:53.080]   "Hi, Anand, after reviewing the issue, we reported we decided to award you a bounty of $15,000."
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:58.080]   Nice job!
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:01.080]   A lot more hackers be working on Facebook bugs.
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:03.080]   That's a good payday.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.080]   Yeah, it is.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.080]   But everybody does it.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.080]   Google does it.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.080]   Everybody does it now.
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:11.080]   That's the way to get people banging on your site.
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:17.080]   Instant articles is going to be open to everybody soon, right?
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:18.080]   Which I think is really important.
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.080]   Because it also means not only can we all create content there, but also means we don't get
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.080]   revenue there.
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:26.080]   I mean, maybe enough to buy a cup of coffee to add a cup of coffee to get from Google
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.080]   ads.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:29.080]   But I've been arguing to publishers right and left.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.080]   They should consider starting an entire new media properties on Facebook.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:37.080]   And even before they open it up, why, if you have a WordPress blog, you can do it right
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.080]   now.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.080]   Oh, that's already open.
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:42.080]   Oh, that's not going to be April for that.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.080]   Well, I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:45.080]   Okay.
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:47.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:49.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.

[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:56.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:57.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:58.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.

[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:47.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.080]   I'm sorry, April 12th.
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:50.080]   Maybe there's an option for that or something.
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:51.080]   Keep the set.
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.080]   There probably is.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:53.080]   There's a lot of Samsung.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:56.080]   So when the drawers fully open, the gear is gone.
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:02.080]   Yeah, all I can do is edit my quick launch settings or press the arrow and I get the gear back.
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:05.080]   So do you have any idea how I do the multiple?
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:06.080]   Yes.
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:08.080]   What do we read?
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.080]   We read it.
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.080]   Did we read it?
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.080]   Yes.
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.080]   You have to go into...
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:16.080]   We'll put a few apps here.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.080]   Yep, window.
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:18.080]   We read it.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.080]   I can't remember that.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.080]   You have to pull up the...
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.080]   The multi drawer.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:22.080]   Yeah, the multi drawer.
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.080]   Is that recent?
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:24.080]   Yes.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:25.080]   What's the multi drawer?
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.080]   You know, we have multiple apps open.
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:28.080]   The...
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.080]   The thing on the lower right.
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.080]   The recent.
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:32.080]   Stack.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.080]   They call that the multi drawer?
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.080]   The stack, whatever.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.080]   It's recent apps.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.080]   Recent apps.
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:38.080]   That one.
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:45.080]   Now, pick one bar and drag it somewhere.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.080]   Oh, okay.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.080]   Yep.
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:48.080]   There I got.
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:49.080]   Right?
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.080]   And then the other one you can do something else with.
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.080]   The other one.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:54.080]   Pick the other.
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.080]   On the chrome.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.080]   And I do the same thing with another one to the lower half.
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:58.080]   So...
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.080]   Oh, that's going to be nice in the seat.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:03.080]   I'm never ahead.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.080]   I'm never in the vanguard.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.080]   You're in the vanguard.
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:06.080]   You're in the vanguard.
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:08.080]   You're a leader.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.080]   Follow that man.
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:12.080]   The one with all the arrows in his back.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.080]   Nice job, Jeff.
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.080]   Oh, well, I'm not.
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:18.080]   Now, so let me drag the other one.
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:20.080]   I guess I just go back.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.080]   Oh, I see.
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:22.080]   Just tap the second one.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.080]   Well, then I know now.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.080]   The bottom, that little thing, now is like a little hamburger.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.080]   It's got two.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.080]   Ah.
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.080]   It's a little hamburger.
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:32.080]   I tapped that.
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.080]   It's a two-line hamburger.
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:34.080]   It's all but...
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.080]   It's something there.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.080]   The all but...
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.080]   Well, multi drawer.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.080]   Now, I want to go play burger time.
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.080]   So...
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:42.080]   I'm going to go to In and Out.
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.080]   Multi...
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:44.080]   Multi pass.
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:45.080]   Multi pass.
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:46.080]   Multi pass.
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.080]   Absolutely.
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:50.080]   This is a folder that's for itself.
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:53.080]   So, Facebook on the top, Google+ on the bottom.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:54.080]   Oh!
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:57.080]   That's a social network nightmare.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.080]   Maylange.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:01.080]   App may not work in split screen.
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.080]   It tells me.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.080]   Which one?
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.080]   They still trying to do it.
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.080]   Otherwise, if the story...
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.080]   Oh, there's a funny story.
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.080]   Funny.
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.080]   I shouldn't laugh.
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.080]   I should not laugh at the story.
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:17.080]   West Virginia lawmakers signed a new law allowing the sale of unpasteurized milk, raw milk.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.080]   They all opened it up and had a drink.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.080]   They got sick.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.080]   (Laughter)
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.080]   I shouldn't laugh.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.080]   The poor guys are sick.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.080]   (Laughter)
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.080]   Anyway, so yeah.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.080]   So, there's Facebook.
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.080]   It's terrible.
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.080]   It is awful, isn't it?
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:35.080]   There's Facebook and Google+ on one screen on an Xbox.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.080]   I'm not in consequence.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:38.080]   I know.
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.080]   It's just too...
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:40.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:41.080]   I shouldn't laugh.
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:42.080]   That's why I said any point.
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:43.080]   I shouldn't laugh.
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:46.080]   By the way, events 360 tells me in the chatroom.
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:48.080]   The three lines is a hamburger.
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.080]   Two lines is called a grilled cheese.
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.080]   (Laughter)
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.080]   It's not right.
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:55.080]   It's got the grilled cheese.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.080]   So then how do I turn this...
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.080]   How do I stop this?
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.080]   (Laughter)
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.080]   Now you're asking...
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:02.080]   I could close one of the windows, right?
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:03.080]   No.
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.080]   Your recent screens appear here.
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.080]   Yeah, I know that.
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:06.080]   How do I...
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:09.080]   Double tap the top of the Facebook, maybe?
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:11.080]   It's always about the double tap.
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:14.080]   Now we have to send the Twitter app back into testing.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:16.080]   Try pressing the whole button.
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.080]   I just hold the grilled cheese.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.080]   I'm using that now.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:20.080]   I like it.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:23.080]   Hold the grilled cheese and it takes your back.
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:28.080]   Oh, and all you do is if you hold the...
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.080]   Title bar.
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.080]   Red Lopes.
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.080]   (Laughter)
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:34.080]   I mean the square thing, the reasons that the grilled cheese.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.080]   It goes back to grilled cheese.
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.080]   Nice.
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.080]   Live demo.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.080]   Sounds like Minecraft.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.080]   Good job, Jim.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.080]   My live demo's never worked.
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:45.080]   Amazon, air, air, air, air.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:46.080]   Yeah, it doesn't like it.
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:48.080]   I could be happy with some of these new...
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:50.080]   This is nice.
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.080]   This is so cool to be in the vanguard.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:57.080]   Are you happy that Verizon Wireless has to pay a $1.35 million fine?
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:02.080]   Oh, Leo, now that I want to get tryout five.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:03.080]   Five.
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.080]   No, I think Verizon's a wonderful company
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:08.080]   and I would be very happy to work with them
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:11.080]   and see the wonderful things they are working on.
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:13.080]   We're not easily influenced.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:14.080]   We can't be bribed.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.080]   Not at all.
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.080]   This was...
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.080]   You remember, in fact, really, this was a good reason to switch off of Verizon.
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:20.080]   They were doing a super cookie.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.080]   They were doing a carrier cookie
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.080]   and that would not...
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:26.080]   You couldn't do anything about that would identify you.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:30.080]   Use your identifier to websites.
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:34.080]   And we were selling this valuable information.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:39.080]   It inserted unique tracking codes into your traffic for advertising purposes.
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:45.080]   The FCC said Verizon failed to disclose the practice from late 2012 until 2014,
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:50.080]   violating a regulation on internet transparency.
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:54.080]   So under the agreement, consumers must opt in
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:57.080]   to allow their information to be shared outside of Verizon Wireless
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.080]   and have the right to opt out.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:03.080]   That's something new until March of last year.
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:05.080]   You couldn't opt out of the super cookies.
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:12.080]   But I have to point out, as our friend Steve Gibson did yesterday in security now,
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:18.080]   that a $1.35 million fine to Verizon is like cigarette-only.
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:20.080]   That's a penny a user.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.080]   They made, certainly made far more than that on this.
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:26.080]   And in fact, Steve said, if you said to Verizon, look,
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:30.080]   you can do this, but you have to pay us $1.35 million every year.
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:34.080]   They gladly say, "Yeah, good deal, we'll take it."
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:36.080]   Who did they pay that to? I can't find it.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:39.080]   The FCC was the plaintiff?
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.080]   Yeah, well, that's a fine.
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:43.080]   I don't know how the fine goes to.
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:46.080]   Not to us, to the government.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:51.080]   And a three-year consent decree in which they'll be watched carefully.
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:55.080]   I mean, they're lucky that wasn't in class after that.
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:58.080]   You have $1.00 million users, and...
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:59.080]   Shh.
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:03.080]   I am so glad that Verizon is now doing the right thing.
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:04.080]   Yes, indeed.
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:09.080]   I'm sure that will make their YG service very, very good.
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:13.080]   I can't wait until I get a chance to try that.
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:14.080]   They always carry.
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:16.080]   I am not being held hostage right now.
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:20.080]   I am not a prisoner, even though my lower third is flashing.
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:22.080]   Is that the fake me?
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:27.080]   [laughter]
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:32.080]   Just reading about the San Francisco House of Latitude,
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:33.080]   a secret society.
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:35.080]   I figured that out the same as sold.
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:36.080]   Yeah, you know what?
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:39.080]   This is just a way to get your money.
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:41.080]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:46.080]   Shopping subscriptions have exploded
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:51.080]   thanks to social media, says Business Insider.
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:56.080]   US Dollar Shave Club, Harry's, Birchbox.
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:58.080]   Many of our advertisers.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:01.080]   In fact, our next advertiser, Naturebox.
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:12.080]   Companies that deliver goods to you for a monthly fee are growing at an astronomical 2,963% year over year.
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.080]   Wow!
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:19.080]   Wow, and the reason is, I think not just Twitter and Pinterest,
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:21.080]   but Twitter.
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:22.080]   I'm going to take credit for that.
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:23.080]   Yeah.
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:24.080]   Yeah.
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:27.080]   And while you're out of here, you can subscribe to a mattress.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.080]   Yeah.
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.080]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:36.080]   Social is driving much bigger increases in retail traffic than any other online channel.
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:44.080]   Social media increased its share of e-commerce referrals 200% from 2014 to 2015.
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:48.080]   For retailers to maintain these gains, they need to pay special attention to mobile,
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:53.080]   or social engagement with retail content is still kind of weak.
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:32:00.080]   Social media users are 35% less likely to share a brand or retailers social post on mobile than they are on desktop.
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:05.080]   Well, it's a lot easier to retweet and reshare on desktop, isn't it?
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.080]   Facebook is the dominant platform in this.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:15.080]   It accounts for 50% of all social referrals, 64% of all social revenue.
[01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:19.080]   Pinterest also big, 16%.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:22.080]   Well, given its size, that's actually per capita.
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.080]   That's probably much higher.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:27.080]   Instagram doesn't drive significant sales.
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:30.080]   Where is podcasting in this report?
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:33.080]   Let me, I'll just prove to you.
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:40.080]   Let me prove to you how effective podcast advertising could be for subscription services.
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:50.080]   How would you like a nature box coming to you every month full of delicious snacks like garlic plantains?
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.080]   Actually, I'm going to let you, Aaron, choose.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:53.080]   I would give you one, Jeff.
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:55.080]   I'll bring one out to you if you want.
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:57.080]   Strawberry Greek yogurt pretzels.
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:58.080]   I want those.
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:00.080]   Wait a minute, there's more.
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:01.080]   Salt and pepper.
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:02.080]   I know it.
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:03.080]   You know what?
[01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:09.080]   Sarah Lane was such a fan of these that when the nature boxes, we ordered four or five a month came.
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.080]   She would take all of them.
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:12.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:15.080]   There wouldn't be any the next day.
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:16.080]   She's so sneaky.
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:17.080]   They're so good.
[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:24.080]   They have hundreds of snacks in a whole variety of flavors, sweet, savory, spicy.
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:28.080]   You can, of course, say I want vegan or gluten conscious.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:33.080]   There's never any high fructose corn syrup or artificial flavors, no trans fats.
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:36.080]   Artificial colors are just good stuff.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:38.080]   Watermelon mini stars.
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.080]   These to your kids.
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.080]   What's in this?
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:43.080]   Tell you what's in this.
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:47.080]   Concentrated apple puree, concentrated apple juice, natural flavor, pectin, black carrot
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:52.080]   juice, that's the color, and citrus fiber for chewiness.
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.600]   Nothing bad's in here.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:56.080]   No red dye number three or anything.
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:59.080]   They don't even add sugar on these.
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.080]   So you say you want the Greek yogurt?
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:02.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:03.080]   Here's the deal.
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:07.080]   You're going to get 50% off your first box when you go to naturebox.com/twit right now.
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:08.080]   Healthy smart.
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:15.080]   Don't go buy a candy bar or eat that leftover French fries.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.080]   Go to naturebox.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:20.080]   Naturebox.com/twit.
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:22.080]   We love these.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:26.080]   This is our employee retention program in a nutshell.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.080]   You're so good.
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:28.080]   I know.
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:29.080]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.080]   I know.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:31.080]   Would you ever leave a company?
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:36.080]   I think Sarah must have been stocking up because she knew she was going.
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:43.080]   She took all of them so that she wouldn't have to worry about that.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:45.080]   Naturebox.com/twit.
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:46.640]   But you know what's great?
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:51.000]   It's fun because so we, I don't know if you know this, we separated the agency part, the
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.920]   ad sales out from Twit.
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:55.000]   So Twit is just a content company.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:00.200]   And then Lisa's running an agency artisanal.
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:03.080]   Yes, because that way there's a clear dividing line.
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:05.480]   It's just a separate business.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:10.200]   But it's also given her, and she's selling, and by the way she's going to other podcasts
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:16.320]   and saying, you know, the formula we invented here, we don't do it like anybody else does.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:20.120]   You know, we do a whole, it's really a very different relationship with our audience and
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.400]   with the advertisers.
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.240]   We're very careful about the advertisers.
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:28.480]   But what's great, what's fun is all the new startups, all the new businesses that come
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:32.480]   to us, because they, this is an opportunity for them to reach an audience, a sophisticated
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:37.440]   audience, that can really help them grow very quickly.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:41.760]   Yep, it's kind of cool.
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:47.600]   I think we could start to wrap things up because we've got some fun stuff that you brought.
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:52.360]   But before I do, Aaron, and Nokum, before I do, is there any stories, Jeff, that we left
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:53.360]   out our area?
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:58.120]   No, I think I would recommend for future reading Danny Hill's piece on, from the Enlightenment
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:35:59.120]   to the Entanglement.
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.600]   I love Danny Hill's.
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:01.600]   What is it?
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:06.480]   So he's writing at, arguing that the Enlightenment was, was about us learning the laws of the
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:09.280]   universe so we could then figure out how to understand what it was.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.280]   And the entanglement, we're entangled with technology now, we're creating new worlds
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.120]   and new things.
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:18.320]   And it's just one of those Danny Hill's moments, it's not going to work in 20 seconds on the
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:19.320]   show.
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:21.720]   But for the rundown, folks, take a look at that.
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:25.560]   It's not his, uh, in a job, it's not him.
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.040]   I thought you did.
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:30.080]   I feel like I have, and I should if I haven't.
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:36.100]   He's involved with the clock of the Long Now Foundation and really smart, uh, I like
[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:37.100]   that.
[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:39.100]   What is, what is he doing?
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:42.840]   Oh, I should know that because I think a friend was working with him on something.
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:47.920]   I mean, just Google.
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:54.080]   He was thinking machines, of course, was one of the first super computer guys.
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:59.880]   Long Now Foundation does the clock of the long now applied proteomics.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:04.080]   Okay, he's too smart and he's a professor of engineering and medicine at the University
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:05.800]   of Southern California.
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:08.200]   He's at USC.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:09.600]   Uh, he wasn't a manager.
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:12.600]   I don't know if he's still an imaginary, but a very smart guy.
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.720]   Studded under Marvin Minsky and Claude Shannon.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:15.920]   That's a good start.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:16.920]   Good.
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:18.720]   I will read that.
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:19.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:20.720]   Read that.
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:21.720]   I thought I just got a little plug on.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:22.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:26.680]   And oh, he left his knee way back when in 2000.
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:30.800]   That's when they found another company called Applied Mines.
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:34.680]   Semantic data storage infrastructure for the internet.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.160]   Wow.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:38.840]   Deep stuff.
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:39.840]   Yeah.
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:45.240]   Some people are so smart that you just go, okay, I'll never understand a thing you do,
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:47.240]   but I'm sure it's neat.
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:49.760]   Uh, all right.
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:50.760]   We you know what?
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:51.760]   I'm going to talk about next week.
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:53.200]   Jeff will not be here two weeks though.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:55.200]   I will go into Jeff land.
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:58.200]   From the city university of New York.
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:37:59.360]   Gina's scheduled to join us.
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:02.640]   I'm sure we can get her to come over the bridge.
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:03.720]   And that'll be a lot of fun.
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:05.480]   I can't wait for that.
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:08.520]   Um, Jason, would you warn her so she needs a babysitter or anything?
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:09.520]   Yeah.
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:10.520]   Well, of course we're going to warn her.
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:11.520]   Yeah, that'd be great.
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:12.920]   She doesn't need a babysitter.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:18.000]   She should bring I would be thrilled if she bring her family because I have never met
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000]   her baby.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000]   That's a good point.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000]   Yeah.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.920]   So don't babysit.
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:23.920]   Forget that.
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:24.920]   Bring the kids.
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:25.920]   Have you met her wife?
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:27.920]   And sure I have.
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:28.920]   Have I?
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:29.920]   I've not.
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:30.920]   Maybe not.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:31.920]   Maybe not.
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:33.120]   So bring the fam.
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:38.360]   Um, we got Matt cuts next week and we'll get another to fill.
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.360]   Good.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.360]   Sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:41.920]   I'm rushing in.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:45.200]   I might make it on tell room, but don't come on me.
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:49.960]   No, but if you if you showed up, no one would be upset.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:50.960]   That's what we're going to stop here.
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:53.560]   I'll leave the Skype machine warm for you.
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:54.560]   Thanks.
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:55.560]   Well, that'll be it.
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:58.800]   If it's in if I'm in Germany, it'll be the, oh, no, I guess I could.
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:02.880]   I don't know what your pixel C suddenly gets more interesting, doesn't it?
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:03.880]   It does.
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:06.720]   I can just keep on the pixel C. Yeah.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:12.200]   Scooter X is going to give me my my tool of the week.
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:13.200]   So why don't I start?
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:16.920]   You can do a number, Jeff, and then leave plenty of room for Aaron Newcomb and his because
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:20.440]   he's brought a couple of little projects along with him.
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.200]   This isn't running, which is too bad.
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.960]   Scooter X passed along.
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:25.840]   Chrome experiments, you all know we've talked about it before.
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:27.320]   Chrome experiments.com.
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:35.040]   This is Google's place where amazing things you can do with Chrome and WebGL.
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:37.240]   And like this, this is a dominoes.
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:41.320]   So if you want, you can, I guess, place dominoes on here.
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:45.120]   Let's look at a gallery of dominoes and and, oh, you know what?
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:50.080]   This is nice because if you ever wanted to knock over dominoes but not spend the time
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:54.000]   to set them up, just tap that.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.760]   Oh, with the wrong way.
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:57.360]   Oh, I tipped it the wrong way.
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:58.360]   If I did.
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:39:59.360]   Oh, there it goes.
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:00.360]   I got one of them.
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:01.360]   There you go.
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.000]   Oh, that is cool.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:08.000]   This is this is failing in all sorts of unusual ways.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.200]   Oh, it's way down.
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:14.640]   Oh, endless fun.
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:15.640]   Endless amusement.
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:17.200]   Will we get them all though?
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:19.720]   No, I think there's going to be a little bit left over.
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.600]   Wow, that's cool.
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.120]   But I scooter X, can you get the music one working?
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:25.840]   This is their newest.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.000]   And it's not working.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.080]   The Chrome Music Lab.
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:30.240]   Music is for everyone.
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:33.520]   Play with these simple experiments to explore how music works.
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:36.760]   Does it just take a long time to load?
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:40.080]   Or is it because I'm just not getting anything?
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:41.080]   Is it do I have?
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:42.760]   Oh, I know what it is.
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:45.360]   Let's turn off my ad blocker.
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:47.080]   I was going to say.
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:50.720]   Oh, I'm a bad man.
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:52.320]   I'm a bad man.
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:54.960]   The ad blocker was blocking it.
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:59.000]   So here's a little monkey drum.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.160]   Little monkey drum loading up here.
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:02.160]   Puppy monkey.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:03.160]   Puppy monkey.
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:04.160]   Baby monkey baby puppy.
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:05.160]   See how quickly we forget?
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:06.160]   Puppy monkey baby.
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:07.160]   Monkey baby.
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:08.160]   Puppy monkey baby.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.160]   Puppy monkey baby.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:10.880]   What was it ad for quick?
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:11.880]   Mountain Dew.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:12.880]   You're too good.
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:13.880]   I drink it.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:14.880]   They're kick start.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:18.440]   They already got you.
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:20.280]   These ads don't have any effect on me.
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:21.280]   Not at all.
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:23.480]   Where's my Mountain Dew?
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:24.480]   I drink it.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.200]   I don't know why.
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:27.200]   I feel like I should.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:28.200]   I feel the urge.
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:33.440]   I just feel like I need to wake up in the morning with a puppy monkey baby.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:41.480]   So this is a spectrogram showing us music and how it looks on a spectrogram.
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:43.600]   I couldn't get the monkey to do anything.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:44.600]   Here's chords.
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:46.000]   Press any key.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000]   Whoa.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000]   Major.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000]   That was a G.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000]   Now you see major?
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.200]   Oh, it's cool.
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:54.600]   It's going to be great for kids.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:55.600]   Kids would love this.
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:57.840]   How about some arpeggios?
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:05.280]   Ah, I'm a maroon.
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:09.160]   It's funny.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:10.480]   You ended up singing church music.
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:12.480]   I was about to do the righteous brothers.
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:15.280]   That's what they need for those conferences.
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:17.800]   And they guy walks around with a little ding dong thing.
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:23.600]   That's what they need.
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:26.080]   So this is musiclab.chromexperiments.com.
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:33.240]   Or just go to Chrome Experiments and you can see this is for music in our schools month.
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:34.240]   So these are for kids.
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:37.840]   They're experiments that let anyone at any age explore how music works.
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:42.840]   That's called collaborations between music and musicians and coders.
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:43.840]   Fun stuff.
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:47.160]   Going to my kids music in our schools event tonight.
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:50.560]   Music is great and unfortunately, especially in California, but I bet it's true in other
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:54.160]   states, we just don't fund the schools very well in the first thing they go.
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:55.160]   The arts.
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:56.160]   Yep.
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:59.760]   And I know STEM is important, but boy, so are the arts.
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:00.760]   It's steam.
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:01.760]   Steam now.
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:02.760]   Yep.
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:03.760]   Because you put the A in STEM.
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:04.760]   That's right.
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:06.120]   And you get steam and then it is arts.
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:07.120]   I always try to crack.
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:08.120]   I'm a here STEM.
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:09.120]   I always try to crack.
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:10.120]   But boys are where the arts.
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:11.120]   What?
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:12.120]   Steam.
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:13.120]   But boys are where the arts.
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.120]   We made a record.
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:16.120]   But boys are where the arts.
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:17.120]   Wait a minute.
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:20.520]   You know, we're sealed.
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:21.520]   What the what?
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:22.520]   This is great.
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:23.520]   That's cool.
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:24.520]   But boys are where the arts.
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:25.520]   It's you.
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:26.520]   Boy, so what do you ask?
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:27.520]   It's you.
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:28.520]   Boy, so what do you ask?
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:29.520]   It's you.
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.520]   Boy, so what do you ask?
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:31.520]   It's you.
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:32.520]   Boy, so what do you ask?
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:33.520]   It's you.
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:34.520]   Boy, so what do you ask?
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:35.520]   It's you.
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:36.520]   Boy, so what do you ask?
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:38.520]   The kids today don't have those records.
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:39.520]   They don't have tapes.
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:40.520]   They can't.
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:43.560]   So to be or not to be.
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.560]   That is the quit.
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:52.440]   Gotta be quick.
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:44:00.480]   We can do some scratching.
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:01.480]   That's cool.
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:02.480]   That's voice spinner.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:03.680]   Anyway, have some fun with that.
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:05.360]   Jeff, you got a number for us?
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:10.040]   You got a wonderful Danny Solvin piece who says that R.I.P. and good riddance to page
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.040]   rank.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.320]   Yeah, tell me what that all means because I saw that piece.
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:17.840]   Bit by bit, it's kind of a disappearing, but he said that in the coming weeks it will
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:19.640]   be completely hidden from public view.
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:25.160]   However, the impact of page rank, which he thinks is nefarious, but I know it certainly
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:26.160]   wasn't.
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:27.640]   He says ruin the web.
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:28.640]   Ruin the web.
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:30.560]   Ever gotten a crappy email asking for links?
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.840]   Blame page rank says Danny.
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:34.080]   Ever had garbage comments with link crops?
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:35.080]   Blame page rank.
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:40.120]   You're farad out the how and why of why you should make use of no follow attribute on
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.360]   links blame page rank.
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:45.560]   Page rank, of course, was a little bar that appeared on top of pages and said this is
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:47.840]   how I haven't seen that in right.
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:48.840]   In right.
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:50.760]   It's still existed, right?
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:52.560]   But it motivated everybody.
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:54.240]   It's the it's the under the consequences.
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:59.240]   It motored everybody to game the system once everybody says Google should make its algorithm
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:00.240]   public.
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:04.040]   This is one tiny example, one data point, the Google made public that meant everybody
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:10.000]   created an industry of SEO around trying to improve your page rank because it was the
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.200]   one thing that Google did make transparent for a while.
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:14.200]   Very simple score.
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:17.960]   I don't know what the numbers were, like zero to seven or nine.
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:21.440]   I can't remember.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:24.200]   And it was zero to 10, zero to 10.
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:25.400]   So you found out with a page rank.
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:29.440]   And of course, remember folks, the page rank was established by the value of the ranks
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:32.240]   to you and the value of ranks to them.
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:37.240]   So it was a, you know, a collective little Django power.
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:43.680]   So anyway, they were going to just completely make it invisible.
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:45.720]   It still exists.
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:49.160]   It's there, but you won't be able to learn what a page rank is anymore, what your page
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:50.160]   rank is anymore.
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:51.160]   Right.
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.160]   So that was that.
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:53.160]   That's sad.
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:54.160]   Kinda.
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:55.160]   Kinda.
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:00.360]   Well, as soon as you give a number, remember how much people cared about your Twitter follower
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:01.360]   number?
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:04.640]   And so you give a number, everybody who says, Oh, it gets competitive.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:06.200]   I got to get that number up.
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:10.480]   Well, while we're here, I think I'm going to count 3D as a number.
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:11.480]   Does this hold?
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:12.480]   I haven't seen this before.
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:13.480]   3D pancake printing.
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:14.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:15.480]   Yeah.
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:16.480]   I've actually.
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:17.480]   Of course you would have seen it.
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:19.640]   Can you eat them afterwards?
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:21.640]   Yes.
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:27.580]   You're just printing the batter out with the sciency, you know, couple axes and pancake
[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:28.840]   bodage on Kickstarter.
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:29.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:31.600]   You can turn any image.
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:33.080]   How did I not?
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:35.920]   I've paid for so many Kickstarter campaigns.
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:38.680]   How did I not buy this?
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:41.200]   But because no one's got one yet, right?
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:45.000]   Well, maybe you can make your own getting closer.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.000]   This is another one of those someday.
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.560]   We'll get your pancake bought.
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:52.560]   That's fun.
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:53.560]   It's fun.
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:54.560]   Yeah.
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:59.680]   Actually kind of a related story we talked again about this on security now, but some
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:07.520]   students made a, um, it was at MIT students.
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:16.440]   They made a ink jet ink and paper that you could use to print circuits, integrated circuits
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.040]   on this paper.
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:22.240]   But it turns out that it has another side effect.
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:24.960]   It can also print conductive fingerprints.
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:27.160]   It was Michigan State.
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:29.160]   Oh, that's how they did it.
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:30.160]   Yeah.
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:31.160]   I saw the headline go by.
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:37.360]   So the idea originally was to print circuits, right, on conductive paper and so forth.
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:42.240]   But it turns out because these fingerprint readers, at least on the iPhone 5S and the
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:49.840]   Samsung Galaxy S6, which they, or which they had copies of that because it's capacitive,
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:57.360]   you could print your fingerprint and put it on these phone and it would work.
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:58.960]   Wow.
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:02.960]   So a scan or I guess if you know, you could take a photo of somebody's finger, you could
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:06.320]   probably figure out a way to print it out.
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:10.000]   So these are, these are because it's conductive ink.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:13.080]   These are fingerprints that actually work.
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:14.080]   Watch this.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:15.080]   He's going to unlock.
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:16.080]   Oh my God.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:17.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:18.080]   You can get it.
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:19.720]   LAPD forensic style with some clear tape.
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:20.720]   Yeah.
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:23.880]   But you, the reason it has to be conductive is because these are to get the print.
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:24.880]   The print.
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:25.880]   Oh, the print.
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:27.880]   You could lift it from a lot of things.
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:32.200]   So printers, is there anything they can't do?
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:36.320]   Did you see the story about the new HP ink?
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:37.320]   No.
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:41.600]   Oh, so what it's going to do is basically kind of spray the page with the ink and it'll
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:42.600]   only conduct in certain places.
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:44.040]   It'll be much faster and better.
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:45.800]   However, it's proprietary ink.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:48.360]   Oh, of course it is that way.
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.400]   You have to buy it from HP.
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:57.280]   HP's pigment ink for office printers can't be bought for cheap because it's proprietary.
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:00.600]   Of course, they figured out an ink that they could patent.
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:03.920]   Well, I won't be buying one of those printers.
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:09.560]   Cartridge is $40 each.
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:11.640]   That's why I like our sponsor Epson.
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:13.160]   They don't play those games.
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:14.160]   Yep.
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:15.160]   Yep.
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:17.200]   I, I, I, I, listen to their sponsor, I'll say about HP.
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:19.840]   I refuse, refuse HP printers.
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:21.440]   Trying to set them up is the worst thing in the world.
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:22.440]   No, I've never had my Epson printer.
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:23.440]   I'm very happy with it.
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:24.760]   And I don't say that because they're a sponsor.
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:25.760]   I happen to have it.
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:26.760]   Yep.
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:28.440]   So Aaron Nukem brought in this.
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:33.000]   Now, if you're a nerd, an old school nerd, you'll recognize a 20-sided dice used for
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000]   Dungeons and Dragons.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000]   You should play D&D.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.000]   It's a die, not a dice.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.000]   But this is a little bit of a different kind of a, why don't you turn it on?
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000]   Yeah, let's turn it on first.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.560]   Because we didn't want the battery to die because Leo would sist some playing with it.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:45.560]   Yes.
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:46.560]   You have been too.
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:47.560]   I have been.
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:48.560]   So it's good you turn the battery.
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:49.560]   Yeah, you've been.
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:50.560]   It would have been talking at us the whole time.
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:51.560]   Okay.
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:52.560]   So here's the inside.
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:53.560]   I don't hear.
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:54.560]   Actually, yeah, you want to show that?
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:55.560]   Yeah.
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:56.560]   Can I show the inside?
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:57.560]   Get it the outside.
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:58.560]   Yup.
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:49:59.560]   I'm careful the magnets will.
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:00.560]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:01.560]   We have a, we have a shop for you.
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:02.560]   See you over there?
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:03.560]   Oh, look at that.
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:04.560]   Okay.
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:05.560]   So you guys are way good.
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:06.560]   Yeah, you guys are really good.
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:07.560]   So here's the, here's the 20-sided die.
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:08.720]   We, this was 3D printed.
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:12.760]   And by the way, there's a tutorial on how to do this on Adafruit.
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:13.760]   So it's in the rundown.
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:14.760]   Okay.
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:16.840]   If you want to go check that out.
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:17.840]   But I'm a cheap skate.
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:21.200]   So what I did was instead of buying Adafruit, I love Adafruit by the way.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:22.200]   Nothing against Adafruit.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:23.560]   That's where I got my Raspberry Pies.
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:25.360]   But you can also go online.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:29.360]   As you can get stuff from China, you know, for, you know, tenth of the price.
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:30.360]   So that's what I did.
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:32.560]   I had some stuff, I had an old accelerometer laying around.
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:34.360]   I had this sound card thingy laying around.
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:35.560]   There was a couple bucks from China.
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.960]   An old battery that I could use.
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:43.160]   So I took their design and I changed it, updated it a little bit, and saved myself about 30
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:44.160]   bucks.
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:46.160]   So what you do is you turn this thing on.
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:47.360]   I'm going to do a adventure.
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:48.360]   What?
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:49.360]   Did you get that?
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:50.360]   Yeah.
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:51.360]   That's adventure.
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:52.360]   Is that you?
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.360]   That's not me.
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:54.360]   These are the Adafruit sounds that I'm using.
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:55.760]   You've got a wire in the way here.
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:56.760]   There we go.
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:59.020]   So it's kind of me because the magnet holds it together so it's very easy.
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:00.640]   Now switch over to, what?
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:02.760]   We could continue to use it either way.
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:03.800]   So roll that thing and see what happens.
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:05.800]   I have a microphone.
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:10.360]   And it is.
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:11.360]   Wow.
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:12.360]   That's.
[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:15.360]   Oh, that's awesome.
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:16.360]   Oh, well.
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:19.360]   Well, it, so I've got to adjust the timings.
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:22.360]   Sometimes if you hold it too, it'll, it'll, it's too.
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:24.360]   It's too still.
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:25.360]   It'll, it's too.
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:27.360]   It'll think that you're, it's done rolling.
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:30.360]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:31.360]   Oh, too.
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:32.360]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:33.360]   Yeah.
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:35.360]   So it's a lot of fun to use.
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:36.360]   It's an accelerometer.
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:38.360]   So it's a good project for a lot of reasons, right?
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:41.360]   It teaches you, it uses an Arduino, uses an accelerometer.
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:43.360]   And bring this to your next D&D.
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:44.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:45.360]   You'll be a superstar.
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:49.360]   Of course, they'll, they won't let you use it because it's not, you know, official, weighted,
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:50.360]   die.
[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:51.360]   But it is a lot of fun.
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:53.360]   And kids really love it.
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:58.360]   Interesting problem to solve though is, so I've got this thing connected to my computer,
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:51:59.360]   right?
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:03.360]   And I'm reading the, the, the, the data that's coming across the accelerometer.
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:08.360]   But the problem is when the die is open, your coordinates aren't going to be right.
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:09.360]   Oh.
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:10.360]   So how do you do that?
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.360]   It took me a while to figure out.
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:15.360]   I'm like, well, maybe I'll put Bluetooth in and read the coordinates that way.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:17.360]   And then I'm like, okay, stupid.
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:20.360]   You've got all the numbers as sound files already in the thing.
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.360]   Right?
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:26.360]   So what I did was you can flip a switch in the program and it'll read out the coordinates
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:28.360]   that it lands on instead of reading the numbers.
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:29.360]   Oh, you're brilliant.
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:34.360]   Then you can program those back into your Arduino script and it'll actually play the
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:36.360]   right, the right sound when it lands on the right thing.
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:37.860]   So I've made some improvements to it.
[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:40.360]   I think this one I will definitely put up on Instructable.
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:43.480]   I know at the beginning we said I don't do that, but I'm going to do it with this one
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:48.680]   because I think it's going to be a lot easier for some people to implement this.
[01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:51.280]   But if not, you just go to the Adafruit site.
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:52.360]   Because they sell all the parts.
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:53.360]   They sell all the parts.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:54.360]   They make it easy.
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:55.440]   So just go to their site.
[01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:57.400]   You can buy all the parts and make one yourself.
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:52:59.720]   They even sell the 3D printed die.
[01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:00.720]   I don't think so.
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:01.720]   I think you've got to print that.
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:05.000]   Or you can, you know, there's plenty of places that'll do 3D printing for you.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.440]   So you can go out to, I think even Adafruit might do it.
[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:11.520]   So you can go out and have somebody 3D print it and just ship it to you.
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:18.600]   Now somebody's very sharp-eyed in the audience and said, is that a Raspberry Pi over there?
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:19.600]   On the table.
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:21.600]   But no, it's not.
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:22.600]   Okay.
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:24.600]   I rolled one.
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:26.760]   It looks like a Raspberry Pi.
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:28.000]   It's got all the connectors.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.040]   But I've ever seen heat sinks on a Raspberry Pi.
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:31.040]   Right.
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:32.040]   So this is actually brand new.
[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:33.040]   They just started shipping this.
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:34.480]   This is an O'Droid C2.
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:39.040]   And I've talked about O'Droid before, I think, maybe on all about Android and some other
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:40.040]   things.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:42.440]   O'Droid is from a company called...
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:43.440]   HardCurnall.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:44.440]   HardCurnall.
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:46.120]   Thank you very much.
[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:47.720]   And they do a couple of things differently.
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:52.000]   Number one, if you're just going to compare it to a Raspberry Pi 3, that was also just
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.200]   recently announced, this one has two gig of RAM.
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:56.200]   Oh.
[01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:57.200]   It has...
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:58.200]   It has Cortex-A53.
[01:53:58.200 --> 01:53:59.200]   Yup.
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:00.200]   Yup.
[01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.200]   And it also has...
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:03.360]   Two gigabytes of RAM is big.
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:04.360]   Two gig of RAM versus one.
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:05.360]   Two gig of ethernet.
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:06.360]   HDMI.
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:07.360]   Yup.
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:10.360]   And it has a serial UART.
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:12.560]   It has a built-in infrared.
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:14.440]   So you can actually...
[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:16.160]   If you want to use a remote controller.
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:17.160]   Oh, a receiver.
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:20.760]   You could use a remote controller on it.
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:22.160]   And it's just a really, really nice device.
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:27.680]   The other critical thing it has is it has EMMC on the back here.
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:28.680]   Flash storage.
[01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:29.680]   Flash storage.
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:30.680]   And that makes a huge difference.
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:31.680]   So remember...
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:32.680]   That's a lot faster than an SD card for a Raspberry Pi.
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:33.680]   Right.
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:38.200]   And we were talking earlier about what I use this for, what I use this for is to run Android.
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:40.720]   It's very difficult to run Android on a...
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:42.400]   Ah, that's a nice, tight shot.
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:43.400]   Look at that.
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:47.080]   It's very difficult to run Android on a Raspberry Pi because the drivers aren't there.
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:50.400]   So you need three things to run Android on one of these SBCs.
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:52.680]   You need the drivers.
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:57.400]   You need a lot of RAM because Android likes a lot of RAM and you need fast storage.
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:54:59.040]   And you've got that on this device because here's the...
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:00.040]   That doesn't come with it.
[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:01.040]   You'd have to buy...
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:03.960]   You have to buy this separately and it's a little more expensive than a Raspberry Pi
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:04.960]   3.
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:05.960]   So this is $40.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:08.640]   And then I think this module was like $18 here.
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:09.640]   For how much RAM?
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:10.640]   For storage.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:11.640]   For 8 gig.
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:12.640]   8 gig.
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:13.640]   8 gig.
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:14.640]   And you get a lot.
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:15.640]   But it's not a lot but it's enough to run Android.
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:16.640]   But it's so fast.
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:20.080]   I mean, it's like the experience you get on a tablet or your phone.
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:21.080]   Oh, interesting.
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:24.000]   And if you don't have that, you're going to start slowing down, especially when you run
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.080]   some of the apps like Chrome and other things.
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:31.120]   So think of this as like a little bread box for Android for Android phone devices.
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:32.880]   Yeah, and you can run Linux on it as well.
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:35.920]   They have images for Linux so you can do that.
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:40.320]   But because it's not the Broadcom chip, you know, a Broadcom ARM chip.
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:41.320]   It's an ARM logic.
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:43.320]   Yeah, so you've got all the drivers for Android already.
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:45.920]   So it's really, really nice.
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:48.920]   So what I'm doing with this, and this will be another project I'll bring maybe at some
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:51.720]   point is I'm building a Pytop with this.
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:52.720]   What's a Pytop?
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:57.440]   So Pytop is going to take a laptop, take the stuff out and put a Raspberry Pi inside,
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:58.440]   right?
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:00.160]   But I'm going to turn it into an Android Pytop.
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:01.760]   So I guess it's an Android top.
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:03.360]   I don't know what you want to call it.
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:06.440]   But it's going to be, it's going to have this board on the inside and I'm doing a lot
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:09.480]   of work to get the keyboard to work and the mouse, the touchpad to work.
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:11.080]   I've already got the screen working.
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:16.840]   So I'm retrofitting an old laptop and I'm going to turn it into a desk to a an Android
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:17.840]   top.
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:18.840]   I don't know what you want to call that.
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:20.160]   But that's what I'm going to do.
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:22.240]   It's the Ojoid C2 from hard kernel.
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:23.240]   Ojoid C2.
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:24.240]   And they make a lot of other things too.
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:30.760]   They make an Ojoid 0, which is not as cheap as the Raspberry Pi 0, but it's a small board,
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:32.640]   25 bucks, I think.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.520]   And you get a lot of horsepower out of it, but it's really small so you can embed it
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:38.360]   into your projects a little bit easier.
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:42.200]   And then they have all sorts of other models too if you want to step it up from there.
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:47.000]   So if I wanted to do with my dream, which is to make a Harry Potter style portraits
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.240]   of our hosts, this Ojoid C0 probably perfect for that.
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:53.720]   Yeah, because you could bake that into the back of the frame.
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:54.720]   Put it in the back.
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:58.040]   Yeah, I'd prefer to have pancakes made of this.
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:04.920]   All right, so there'll be portraits of all the hosts moving, winking, and then a pancake
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:07.400]   with Jeff Jarvis's face on it.
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:09.800]   And you figure out why.
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:13.280]   Just make sure you hold the grilled cheese.
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:15.400]   Jeff have a great trip to...
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:17.480]   Sorry, I rolled a 12.
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:20.520]   Have a great trip to Hanover.
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:21.520]   So you say Hanover.
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:22.520]   Hanover.
[01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:23.520]   Hanover.
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:24.520]   Hanover.
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:25.520]   Hanover.
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:26.520]   What is the food of Hanover?
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:27.520]   I see a bit.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:29.480]   I have no idea, but it says fried.
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:30.480]   Whatever it is, it's fried.
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:31.480]   Yeah.
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:32.920]   Seabit is the big.
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:34.480]   It's bigger than CES.
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:35.480]   It's huge.
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:36.480]   It's gigantic.
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:41.480]   So I go in, I do the panels on what I fly on Tuesday.
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:44.800]   I'll have to get a report to us a little bit from Seabit.
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:45.800]   Do a final report or two?
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:46.800]   I can try it.
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:47.800]   I can try it.
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:51.200]   I got half a day to wander around a gigantic seabit, and then I do my keynote, and then
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:52.200]   I go to the airport.
[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:53.200]   Wow.
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:55.160]   Jeff's wastes no time.
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:56.160]   He's a busy man.
[01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:57.960]   Yeah, I don't like it back home.
[01:57:57.960 --> 01:57:59.920]   Maybe though we could get a Skype or something.
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:00.920]   You know what?
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:02.120]   Shoot some stuff on your smartphone.
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:03.120]   Okay.
[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:04.320]   And just send us the video.
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:06.320]   All right.
[01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:12.480]   Now that I have my fire working, yeah, the notifications are very nice.
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:14.760]   I'm going to do my Pixel C tonight.
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:15.760]   I'm excited.
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:19.280]   So when you read a notification, you can act on it at the notification.
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:20.280]   So they've improved notifications.
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:21.280]   That's nice.
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:23.760]   So those are the changes so far.
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:25.520]   Jeff Jarvis City University of New York.
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:28.480]   We will be back together in two weeks at Kenny.
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:29.480]   Wait, can't wait.
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:32.800]   Our first show from the CUNY Studios.
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:33.800]   All of us.
[01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:34.800]   That'll be great.
[01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:35.800]   I can't wait.
[01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:38.680]   Jeff, Aaron Nukem, regular around here.
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:39.680]   We love having him on.
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:40.880]   He's been on the screen savers.
[01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:43.960]   He's been on floss, all about Android.
[01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:48.760]   And he always brings fun projects, works at NetApp and of course has his own makerspace.
[01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:49.760]   That's right.
[01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:50.920]   Where you two can get trigger finger.
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:51.920]   You can.
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:52.920]   Absolutely.
[01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:53.920]   Absolutely.
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:56.240]   And we've got a mini maker fairs coming up.
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:57.560]   I think I mentioned it last time I was on.
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:58.560]   Talk about it.
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:00.640]   Mini maker fairs coming up on April 16th in Benesha.
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:04.600]   If you're anywhere in the Bay Area and you want to check it out, it's a smaller fair,
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:05.760]   not like the big one down in San Mateo.
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:08.760]   A lot of people like that because you actually get to interact with people.
[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:09.760]   It's not crazy.
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:12.640]   You don't feel like you're if you're claustrophobic, go to a mini maker fair.
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:14.120]   You'll really enjoy it.
[01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:17.000]   And if I mentioned this, but I'm going to anyway, there's a special offer.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.560]   If you're a Twit fan, you can actually get a discount right now.
[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:25.920]   If you go to if you go buy a ticket and put in the promo code Twit, you'll get 20% off
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:27.280]   your tickets.
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:31.320]   So I thought I'd make that available for our great audience because they're awesome.

[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:39.920]   Thanks to a Jason Klanthus, our esteemed producer.
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:40.920]   And thanks to all of you.

[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:50.280]   We do twig this week in Google every Wednesday afternoon, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern.
[01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:54.960]   Now remember, our clocks are changing on Sunday and UTC doesn't move.
[01:59:54.960 --> 02:00:00.400]   But since we are moving, we'll still be at 130 Pacific and 430 Eastern, but we'll be
[02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:04.520]   at 2030 UTC starting next week.
[02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:07.120]   So please adjust your brain.
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:09.760]   Since you can't adjust UTC, adjust your brain.
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:13.520]   Now if you do miss the show, you of course, audio and video always available on demand
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:20.800]   at twit.tv/twig and wherever you get your podcasts, including all those great free
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:24.600]   Twit apps and paid Twit apps on the app stores of every platform.

[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:32.760]   run any of them.
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:36.160]   They're all from our third party, fabulous friends, developers.
