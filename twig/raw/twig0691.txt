[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.520]   Oh, I know you've been waiting all week long for this one.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.680]   It's excitement city here at Mastodon Central.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.240]   Joining us in filling in for Stacy who is out this week.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.600]   Matthew Ingram from the Columbia Journalism Review who is very much involved in all of
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.360]   this stuff you see his new Mastodon URL,
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.560]   Journer.host/Matthewi.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.160]   Hello, Matthew.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.160]   Hey.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.600]   Great to see you.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.960]   Sorry about Canada.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.000]   It's for having me.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.800]   Yeah, me too.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   That's kind of great.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   Just glad we got it.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.240]   That's way too generic of a thing.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.200]   We're talking about the World Cup, which I am actually, this is the first time I have
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.720]   the words have come out of my mouth because I'm so angry at FIFA and think it's so
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.760]   reprehensible for so many reasons.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.240]   I'm boycotting it, but I did see on Mastodon I saw a number of Canadians being sad.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.120]   So I'm sad for you.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.040]   Well, you know, we're just glad to be invited.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.520]   Yeah, it's just an honor to be nominated.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.600]   That's Jeff Jarvis, Chortlin away.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   Chortlin.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.600]   He is a professor.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   That's how come he chortles.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.960]   He's the Leonard Dow Professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.960]   Craig.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960]   Newmark.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.880]   Graduates will turn us into the City University of New York also in Journer Host.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.520]   Hello there, Jeff.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.520]   Hello, hello, boss.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.520]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.520]   You've got Mastodon.social as your, as your.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.520]   That's what I am.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.520]   Most of them.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.320]   You didn't, you didn't, you want to move to Journer.horse?
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   Host.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.320]   Hurst.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.320]   No, I'm just just just hanging there.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.320]   Just hanging there.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.600]   Mastodon.social is the big one.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.240]   That's Gargarn's that and I think I got four Oh before the rush to the world because it's
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.240]   his.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.240]   Yeah, it's his.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.240]   That was good to see.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.360]   Brr, what from hands on photography.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.360]   Hello, aunt.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.760]   Hello, Mr. Leopold.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.280]   Also community manager at our fabulous club twit discord where you have announced.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.960]   Wow, that's fast.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.040]   They already made a meme.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.880]   Wow, that is fast.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.880]   That took no time.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.880]   That took no time.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.760]   And you said that three minutes ago is on it.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.760]   Unbelievable.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.680]   You have announced we have three events coming up for then.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.120]   Fleischer in December 15th.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.360]   He'll be back from Germany.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.280]   I hope by then he's in Germany right now with.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.280]   Yes, he will.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.800]   I had to confirm Stacy Higginbotham's book club.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.880]   She's going to do project here.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.880]   Mary Harold Mary.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.880]   We've all read that.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.320]   I will be there for that January 12th and look at that the week after the La Porte is
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.480]   side in the ports.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.880]   It's a puts.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.400]   It's an inside twit all coming.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.520]   La Porte.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.360]   If you are a club twit member, you can also do this.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.720]   Unlike Twitter, you can mock me on club twit.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.720]   Just make sure you put parody in your handle.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.720]   That's funny.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.760]   It says I'm the only one who's expendable at this point.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.960]   Leo La Porte, which if you didn't know, I said that might be actually scary, but it's
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.960]   not.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.040]   It's true.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.760]   I don't want to make this almost, you know, I want to boycott FIFA.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.640]   I don't want to talk about the World Cup.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.320]   I kind of want to boycott Elon Musk and Twitter at this point, except we can't.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.120]   News is news, right?
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.760]   It's an ongoing session.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.760]   Sorry.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.760]   Plus, rough.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.760]   What's the latest?
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.840]   Should I just go to Twitter is going great.com?
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.840]   You know what?
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.000]   If you really care about this stuff, just go to that website and you'll always be up to
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   date.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.120]   Twitter's trust and safety capacities massively reduced.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.720]   You saw that Joelle Roth left.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.440]   And Jeff, you were saying how great it was that you know, you're all still there and
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.440]   tweeting.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.000]   He tried as long as he could, but there came a point when you just give up and Joelle's
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   brilliant.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.720]   I mean, I have most respect for him.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.040]   I think about 80% of the safety and security team has gone.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.000]   That's what the Washington Post said.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.480]   And now they're telling us a story that on the November 10th, the trust and safety team
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.600]   conducted a sick out, but that was before...
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.200]   No, no, I guess it was after Elon took over, but it was last week.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.400]   How long has it been since he took over now?
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   I don't know.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   It feels like years.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.600]   Been almost a month, right?
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   Oh my God.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.640]   It was October 27th, I think.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.200]   I know because all I have to do is look at the mastodon graph and it suddenly goes right
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   out.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.160]   He's a hockey stick.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.360]   So the virtually the entire team, according to the Post, dedicated to rooting out covert
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.400]   foreign influence operations was fired or quit.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.200]   We had an interesting conversation though on Sunday and I want to throw this in.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.840]   Phil Libbon was here, CEO, founder of Evernote.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.720]   He's also been a venture capitalist.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.760]   He has his own incubator called All Turtles.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.680]   It's an AI incubator.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.400]   Certainly somebody who knows a lot about running businesses, running large networking
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.760]   teams.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:12.680]   He was of the opinion that it's very possible that this is Elon just rebuilding Twitter.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.680]   He said, "Don't give up on it yet."
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.240]   He doesn't believe Twitter will go down or have a major security event.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.200]   And there have been, in fact, there have been articles now saying, "This is what Elon
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   did at Tesla."
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.200]   It's a space event.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:32.200]   What I said, long time ago, gay man, a chain.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.200]   Okay.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.840]   But what is he rebuilding it as?
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.840]   What's it going to be?
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.800]   Well, there doesn't seem to be a lot of vision, but Twitter 2.0, maybe the X, everything app.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.800]   I don't know.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.800]   Oh, come on.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   Oh, come on.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.560]   So this is what we've got to hold everything app.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.040]   I get where he's coming from.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.200]   I don't know if it'll work here, but I still like the idea of someone saying, "You know
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.160]   what, this business has not been profitable at all.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.680]   Let me give it a shot and see if I can make it profitable."
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.680]   True.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.680]   None of us would do this, but how?
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.680]   All the advertisers.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.680]   All the advertisers.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.880]   You know, we may disagree with some of the practices, but at least he has in his mind,
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.000]   "I want to make this business profitable."
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.600]   Yeah, but, but, but, but, but, you can't have profitable without revenue and the revenue
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.000]   is through advertisers and their advertisers are all leaving because he's driving them
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   out.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.960]   And, and he's driving the sales team out and without the sales team, you don't have
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.960]   a sale.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.040]   No, wait, not all of them are leaving because people were still using Twitter, sir.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.040]   Yeah, I know.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.040]   Everybody's been talking about they're going to leave.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.040]   But wait a minute.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.680]   It doesn't, what if he doesn't want to be an ad supported service?
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.080]   Yeah, in fact, he's talked about that too.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.880]   And I have to say, it's not like anybody would say, "Oh, Twitter was so well run and
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.880]   so successful."
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.880]   Right.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.560]   They only had one profitable quarter in 15 years.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.680]   And there were going to be huge cutbacks even if he didn't buy it.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.280]   I mean, they were talking about 25%.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:03.240]   So in 2018, as, as Tesla was trying to build the Model 3, he had massive layoffs.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:10.680]   He micromanaged the company, moved into the factory, spent the night there.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.520]   He, you know, he did something very similar, talked about, you know, a new mission where
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.960]   you got to, you know, whatever, you know, I don't want to say the phrase, but he, you
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.200]   know, worked very hard.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.360]   One of his former employees, a senior engineering manager, David Deak, and as quoted by the
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.240]   times saying, "Musque thrives in existential circumstances.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.840]   He quasi creates them to light a fire under everybody."
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.840]   Mm-hmm.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.560]   SpaceX similar.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.240]   It's not the, look, nobody would say it's the best management style in the world.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.080]   I wouldn't want to work for it, but maybe this is what Twitter needs.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.880]   If he pissed everybody off and did that, but I think that what he's, I still think that
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.640]   the fundamental strategy here is, is political chaos, because that's what he's really doing.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.360]   And he doesn't have to do that to do everything else.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.360]   Mm-hmm.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.920]   He's a really kind of an edgelord meme poster.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:16.840]   Like this, the, I was, I left Twitter when he did the thing about master Bader Don.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.000]   That was, that was enough for me.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I said, that's fine.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.680]   The Nazi thing.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:27.080]   But just the other day he posted a picture of a young woman with a scannily clad, you
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.080]   know what I'm talking about.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.080]   It was horrific.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.200]   It was horrific.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.520]   What's wrong with this guy?
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.920]   If that, somebody posted that on any of my sites, I would have banned him immediately.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.720]   It's not just that though.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.240]   I mean, he's defending all the worst people and he's allowing them all.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.040]   Marjorie Taylor is back Donald Trump is back.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.160]   And I mean, Marjorie Taylor Greene is like, that is Bugs Bunny compared to some of the
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.240]   people that he's allowing back on this platform.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.880]   Well, he just said he was going to let everybody back on.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.760]   That, that, that, unless you committed a crime, I needed one of his stupid non poll polls and
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:02.760]   said that.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.520]   What happened to the, what's he going to do a committee?
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:13.960]   So he's claiming that that was a deal with advertising groups and they re nagged and so
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.160]   he's not going to do it.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.320]   He uses that's the same as activists like others use Antifa.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.360]   It is this kind of generic term for people who are un, you know, secretly undermining
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.360]   Twitter.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.120]   He sounds like a nut.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.120]   Yes.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.120]   Okay.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.120]   I don't know if it's in the rundown, but there was a guy who worked at Tesla who talked
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:40.440]   about how Musk engaged in all this same kind of stuff and how there had to be basically
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.320]   adults around him.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:49.320]   So there was a whole group of kind of people just below him who, whose job was to prevent
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.880]   Elon from wrecking everything, which Twitter does not have.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.280]   So maybe they'll get them.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.600]   I've worked at mobile companies, Matthew, right?
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.120]   I worked for Matt, Robert Maxwell, who was, who was a nutty mogul.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.480]   I worked for good moguls.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.480]   I worked at Hearst.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.440]   I worked for the new houses.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.160]   But when you have a guy like Maxwell, yeah, you were constantly in a position of thinking
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.320]   that he was on the edge of doing something horrible.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.320]   And how do we kind of stop that from happening?
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.320]   Right.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.000]   And you definitely see that dynamic happening.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.200]   He, according to New York Times, has stopped paying vendors and he travel expenses incurred
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.800]   before he bought the company.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   Sorry.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.440]   We're not going to pay you, including former employees.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:36.240]   I think Elon's like his strategy, if I can sum it up, amount it to, I'm going to buy
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:41.040]   Twitter and I'm just going to stir it up and I'm going to...
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.040]   But why?
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.040]   You know, just cause chaos.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.040]   But why?
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.800]   Because I think that's, he finds that interesting and amusing.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.320]   I don't think he actually thinks it's going to be a great business at all.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.800]   In fact, my favorite conspiracy theory is he's trying to drive down the value of Twitter
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:00.240]   so that the bonds are cheaper and then he can buy them.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.600]   That's the first, that is the single first time I've heard a sensible strategy.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.440]   Well, it's not, you know what?
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.440]   It's what he did.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.440]   It could work.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.400]   When he first started acquiring Twitter, he didn't tell anybody, he was buying a 9.5
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.920]   stake percent stake in Twitter.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.080]   He illegally didn't tell anybody so that he could keep the price low.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.160]   And then he announced it.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.640]   And then he announced 54.20, which was a much inflated price more than he had paid twice
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.080]   what he had paid, which looked like a great strategy at the time.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.680]   Now he's going to sell the stock and he's going to recoup a 100% profit.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.000]   He didn't though.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.400]   He left out that part.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.480]   It's a fascinating soap opera.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.560]   It's very entertaining.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.160]   It's sad because Twitter is an important resource.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.520]   I rather continues to stay top of mind and...
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.840]   Is that, is he like Donald Trump?
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.480]   He just wants to stay stop a pop?
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:58.760]   He's going to continue to stay top of mind and not us, but normal folks, quote unquote,
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:04.160]   normals are going to continue to go over to that platform just to see what he does.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.320]   He does say traffic is an all time record.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.320]   And bots.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.320]   And continue to just...
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.320]   Bots.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.840]   You know, I almost don't want to say this, but it makes Donald Trump look sane because
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.720]   Donald Trump wants to stay in the headlines so he can continue to fundraise.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   Right.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.160]   So he's got a real, like, a sensible motive.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.760]   Well, you can call it narcissism or whatever.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.760]   Just like the attention.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.760]   Right now.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.760]   $44 billion to get attention.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.480]   And all of a sudden everybody's still using the platform.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.120]   Yes, there's people leaving.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.720]   There's brands that decided they're not going to do it.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.720]   Apple has left.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.720]   Apple has left.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.720]   There are other brands that are saying, "You know what?
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.280]   Okay, we're back now."
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.280]   So it's...
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.280]   C.B.S. left for five seconds.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.000]   And by the way, the weirdest thing, of course, immediately.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.040]   Elon posts a meme from Brokeback Mountain with C.B.S. telling Twitter, "I just can't
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.040]   leave you."
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.680]   He says, "Weirdest meme lord ever."
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.440]   I mean, he belongs on Reddit or Fort Chan.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.440]   He doesn't...
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.440]   I don't...
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:14.480]   The interesting thing someone said to me was, you know, with Tesla and SpaceX, he treated
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.120]   people terribly and his management's not was garbage.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.040]   But they knew companies were terrible.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.600]   But everybody was united by the goal.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.600]   Because there's a vision of people in the space, you know, have a reasonably priced electric
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.440]   car and change that industry.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:37.800]   But Twitter, you know, to be frank, there is no goal at the center of it.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.800]   There's no...
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.800]   What is the goal?
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:46.760]   It isn't even free speech because he's basically shut down everybody he wants to whenever he
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.000]   wants to.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.920]   So free speech, just free speech is defined as whatever Elon thinks when he gets up in
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.160]   the morning.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:02.840]   Phil Libben was reluctant to say that Elon was anything less than savvy and a good businessman.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.440]   Of course, everybody points at Tesla and SpaceX.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.920]   Others say, "Well, yeah, but with considerable federal subsidy, they succeeded."
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.920]   But they did succeed.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.200]   Both Tesla and SpaceX and federal help.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.080]   No federal funds coming to Twitter, I don't think.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.080]   I doubt.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:26.320]   Well, federal, Russian federal funds perhaps.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.880]   You think there is some secret thing underneath this all that we don't know about that would
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.880]   make it make sense?
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:31.880]   Because it doesn't make sense.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.880]   It just doesn't make sense.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.880]   No.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.880]   No.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.880]   It's just crazy, crazy time.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.240]   I do think that there may be a political agenda, the chaos agenda.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.720]   I think it's quite possible that that's what he's thinking.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.720]   He's never...
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:50.400]   I mean, he didn't used to be a Russian puppet.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.240]   This is where Kara Swisher...
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.080]   I don't trust her either.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.080]   I don't either.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:00.280]   She's been on TV saying, "Oh, I know Elon because he knows everybody."
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.040]   He was actually not this insane and it's right wing media.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.040]   No, no, no, no.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.040]   Look what's on her Twitter.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.040]   Look what's on her Twitter.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.040]   She wants her header.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.280]   She's standing next to Elon.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.280]   Twitter.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.280]   Twitter.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.440]   She's just as crazy as he is, if you ask me.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.440]   I think he has been red-pilled to some extent.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:25.200]   I think it feels to me as though he's been surrounded by all of those types of people
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.680]   who are sick of cancer, who just want to be around him because he's rich or whatever.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.680]   I think he has...
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.760]   He's glad Rien Walleik in that sense, isn't he?
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.600]   Yeah, in a way, I think.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.160]   Look at this exchange between Kara and Elon.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.280]   This is three hours ago.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.280]   She's talking to Elon.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.920]   There was a time when you cared about the truth that is long gone.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.440]   I'll add, playing to the cheap and dirty seats is no way to live.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.560]   You may be my greatest disappointment in 25 years of covering tech.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:01.080]   Well, you and having interviewed Jeff Bezos on a segue once, to which Elon responds, "There
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.440]   was a time when you cared about the truth that is long gone."
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.560]   This is days of our lives.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.920]   Who's writing this stuff?
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.920]   This is terrible.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.920]   This is terrible.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.920]   This is a terrible...
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.920]   His show to thread.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.920]   What does that reply say?
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.920]   There was one reply.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   I replied to him.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920]   Oh.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.260]   Oh, of course it's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.260]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.260]   No, I...
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.260]   Okay, no, there's a lot of people.
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.260]   Oh, now a lot of people.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.260]   There's a lot of people.
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.260]   A lot of reply to Elon.
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.380]   There's Julie Childshaking, Turkey.
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:35.880]   There's Kara talking to Elon wearing a weird scarf around his throat.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.280]   I don't know.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.280]   I mean, of course, I'm not to cover this, but I'm sorry we have to because Twitter is
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.440]   important or was.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.320]   I go to Twitter now.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.320]   It was.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:53.000]   Okay, so maybe it's because of who I am following, but I go to Twitter now and it feels like
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   a strip mall.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   It doesn't...
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   You know what?
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.720]   I figure a lot of people in my Twitter community say, "You know what?
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.160]   I opened up Twitter and all I'm seeing are Elon Musk posts.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.160]   His actual...
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.160]   His actual feed.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.760]   I have not seen that.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.640]   I wonder why that is because I don't follow him and I...
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.640]   Yes, I've got a lot of me.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.880]   Oh, well, if you don't follow him, you won't see him.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.880]   Maybe that's all of them.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.000]   I follow him, but I've seen a lot more of him than the algorithm is throwing him over
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   the algorithm is pushing him.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.520]   I don't follow him, but I see him all the time.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.320]   Because people are responding to him?
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.320]   You shouldn't see somebody...
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.320]   I guess...
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.320]   I guess you don't follow, right?
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.320]   Well, my friend says...
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.320]   But Twitter's been doing that a lot.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.320]   Twitter's been doing this a lot.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.880]   I barely use my Twitter account.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.520]   I don't follow Elon Musk, but yeah, I keep seeing Elon Musk pop up.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.520]   They actually...
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.800]   Yeah, Twitter will actually alert me and say that Elon tweeted something.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.800]   Oh, God.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.520]   Because you don't want to miss that.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.880]   So I have mute words in here, and I'm pretty sure he's a mute word for me.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.880]   Yeah, that's what it is.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.320]   Oh, that's what it is.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.440]   I'd be curious if you unmuted for just a bit, and what you just...
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.440]   What you'd see.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.440]   Oh, here's...
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.440]   Okay.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.440]   I just opened mine.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.440]   I had logged out.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.440]   Wow.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.440]   Wow.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.440]   I found...
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.120]   I went to a closet and I found a bunch of #staywoke shirts.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.120]   Right.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.520]   So now he's releasing a "stay at work" shirt.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.720]   Elon, nobody's going to stay there if you beg them.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.640]   I don't know how to find a new t-shirt stuff.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.680]   Here's the stay woke shirts.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.000]   Here's the stay woke shirts.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.600]   He doesn't like that word, does he?
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.600]   Woke.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.600]   He doesn't like that.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.600]   I don't either.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.600]   Well, and then he started...
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.280]   He's not supposed to be mad at me for saying that.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.320]   He started relitigating the shooting of...
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.920]   I think it was Michael Wilson.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.160]   Like he had a whole thread about how...
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.880]   So it seems like he's...
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.840]   That's the sort of red-pilling that I'm talking about.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:56.240]   I think he has actually been kind of converted by whoever into anti-woke-ness.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.240]   Here's a...
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.160]   Here's a must tweet from 12 hours ago.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.160]   "I'm going to turn over time as we hue closer to the truth.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.160]   Twitter will earn the trust of the people."
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.160]   Oh, that just means clap-crap.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.160]   Which people?
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.080]   Hue closer to the truth.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.880]   I don't subscribe to it, so I couldn't read it before in policy.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.880]   I'll just...
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.880]   The headline is amazing.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.360]   Twitter's destruction will be a geopolitical catastrophe.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.360]   Wow.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.160]   Now that was to the United States, but also for the democratic world.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.160]   You can't get more...
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.640]   I'm not elliptic than that around the truth, though.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.640]   Is that of course, I mean, yeah.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.640]   I don't think so.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.640]   But it does say it's more serious than...
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.960]   You've treated us a good advertising for Twitter in that headline.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.640]   Well, I just looked at my muted words.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.480]   Elon Musk is not in my list of muted words.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.480]   Nothing...
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.480]   Just lucky then.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.480]   Yeah, your feed is...
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.400]   So, it is the case, I believe.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.400]   I saw this.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.400]   Maybe it was an Elon Musk tweet.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.000]   80% of Twitter users are outside the US.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   It's...
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.760]   They're very big in Japan, for instance.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.840]   Massive penetration in Japan.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:02.680]   So it may not be an overstatement for foreign policy to say, you know, it's a geopolitical
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   catastrophe.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.680]   It's not...
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.680]   Or an issue at least.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.480]   Yeah, issue, not catastrophe, maybe.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.120]   Yeah, that's been strong.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.960]   You know, it is possible...
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.720]   But is it as a democracy in danger?
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.280]   No, of course not.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:22.880]   In fact, it might be the best thing ever if Twitter got deprecated and we had conversations
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.520]   in other spaces that were less...
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.840]   A competition in spaces, yes.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.840]   Like TikTok.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.840]   Yeah, like TikTok.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:33.360]   Okay, let's talk about TikTok because now Mark Warner, Senator Mark Warner is saying,
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:38.680]   "TikTok is the worst thing that ever happened and..."
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.680]   What the hell?
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.680]   That's been going on for a while.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.680]   That's been going on for a while.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.360]   He says Trump was right about banning TikTok.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:51.800]   Warner, take those words out of your mouth and just look at them, you know, as a bubble.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.800]   Trump was right about anything.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.640]   Mark Warner is right.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.960]   He's a respected Democrat, right?
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.440]   Yeah, but he's a...
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:06.200]   I think there are some genuine concerns about TikTok accessing the accounts of American
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.240]   users and their data.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.680]   And there are fears that the company is basically lying about that.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:17.080]   And the fact that the Chinese government is pretty much curating its citizens TikTok.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.080]   Right.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.080]   But maybe that's true, but they're not curating my TikTok.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.080]   No, they're not.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.080]   Pretty apparently.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.320]   If they are, they must really want me to see girls in bikinis.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.320]   Right.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.880]   Maybe they're trying to undermine our Tik.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.880]   You will.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.080]   It's a bread and circuses.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.080]   Bread and circuses approach.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.920]   No, it's very clear that TikTok's algorithm is not motivated by politics, but what you
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:43.600]   look at because you can modify it very easily if you just pause it.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.720]   My daughter is a master of modifying the TikTok algorithm.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   She's explained to me.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.800]   She says, "Oh, God, don't stop on anything.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.560]   If only stop on good stuff, just swipe by in his fast-pause.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.560]   It's hard, though.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.560]   It's hard."
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:02.600]   Well, even if you just pause for a few seconds, then all of a sudden your feed is full.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.600]   You got the bikinis.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.840]   We're talking about bikinis here.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.200]   Yeah, if Stacy were here, it should be rolling her eyes.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   Well, or sandwiches because my son, who is very successful because of TikTok, thank
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.200]   you, TikTok.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.440]   FCC commissioner, we reported this before, Brennan Carr said it should be banned.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.440]   FBI director.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.440]   He's a nutjob.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.920]   FBI director Christopher Ray says, "This is a little far-fetched.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:30.840]   It contributes to China's status as the number one thief of US data in the world."
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.480]   Okay, let's break that down.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.480]   First of all, that could be true.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.480]   That could be true.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.480]   What are they stealing?
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.480]   And that's your cue.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.480]   World.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.480]   Oh, dang.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.480]   I don't know what I'm doing there.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.480]   Thank you.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.480]   That's all right.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.480]   I'll do it.
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.480]   You're losing it, man.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.200]   What kind of data are they stealing?
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.720]   They're stealing your Leo likes bikinis.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.720]   They're stealing crap.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.600]   I mean, is that helpful to them somehow?
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.400]   Yeah, I don't think it is.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.560]   I don't think that that's...
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:00.680]   I think the one thing you could say about TikTok is perhaps it could be used as a propaganda
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.400]   machine, but I don't think there's any evidence that is being done.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   That's being done today.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.000]   I haven't seen anything about China in my TikTok feed.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Nothing.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   No.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Or geopolitics in general.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   No.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.600]   People, though, do you get their news from it?
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.080]   People my daughter's age use it to search.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.080]   We talked about this before.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.880]   I said, "You can't search for effects on TikTok."
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.880]   Oh, yeah, you can.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.880]   Just said, "Give me effect."
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.120]   I said, "How old's it going to get bridge?"
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.920]   She said, "Search for that."
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.920]   Instantly.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:32.320]   The thing is, though, what we are seeing is the fact that once most people pick up TikTok,
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.680]   they can't put it down.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.680]   That's the problem.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:39.160]   Well, TikTok addiction is a problem, but so is Facebook addiction at one time.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.360]   So, so in the day was book addiction.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.160]   The Chinese one of her time had addicted and then they'll move in.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.160]   Right.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:51.000]   Because we'll be so busy, glued to our phones that they can just march in.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   It's over.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.240]   I think that it really is moral pain.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.000]   I'm not one to say more.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Definitely.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   But that's definitely moral pain.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   I want one.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   You get that one.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.200]   Lee, I'm just on my side.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.840]   It's not like people are dancing in the background.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.320]   It's weigurs are bad.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.320]   Weigurs are bad.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:13.200]   It's like, I mean, I haven't seen anything even Chinese related.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.920]   If they're doing it, it's very subtle.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.520]   If they're crushing related or pick your country.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.440]   Honestly, by the way, that Mark Warner story was in Fox News.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:29.760]   If you want to talk about somebody advancing a political agenda using propaganda, it's
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.760]   Fox News.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.160]   It's Rupert Murdoch.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.640]   Or I guess if you're on the right, you could say MSNBC and that's probably true.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.200]   No, they're not equivalent, but not at all.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.200]   Pardon it.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.200]   Well, that's just because you're a leftist.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.200]   Fine.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.440]   I mean, they have a very strong agenda, don't they?
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.440]   Democracy, yeah.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.440]   Okay.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.440]   Okay.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.080]   Anyways, lose you a few more viewers.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.240]   No, I haven't had anybody yell at me recently.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.160]   Yeah, because they're all gone now.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.160]   They're all gone.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.160]   There's nobody.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.120]   There's a guy speaking a TikTok.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.640]   There's a guy who I idolize now.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:11.080]   He wrote about his or shared his a few things from his feed.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:17.320]   And he said that he only clicks on things that are bizarre and unexplainable.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.800]   And so his feed is just chaos.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.800]   Like he shared a few clips and I honestly cannot figure out what is going on in them.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.200]   So it's like an anti feed.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.200]   I admire that.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.880]   He clearly puts some work into it.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.320]   So there is a kind of a drum beat of people.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.040]   Maybe their Elon Musk stands or maybe they know something who say, no, wait a minute.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.040]   Just hold on.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.600]   Elon has a plan.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:49.840]   He yes, he's destroying Twitter.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.800]   But this is a medium post.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.200]   He has so little use for what was there.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.680]   He prefers simply to get rid of everything he considers bad, lackluster or dead weight
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.960]   and start from scratch.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.000]   It's creative destruction.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   Okay.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.400]   Is there anything wrong with breaking something down to build it back up?
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.720]   You know, just totally got the cash flow to do it.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.680]   Maybe apparently does.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:21.280]   This is Enrique Dan's writing on on a medium.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:29.880]   I don't know who he is, but I bookmarked it so he must be somebody.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:34.120]   He says, Musk knows Twitter and wants to transform it.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.200]   To do that, he first has to take it off the market.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:41.280]   Secondly, he has to get rid of so many of its employees and of a culture that in his
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.600]   eyes does not work to the point of changing everything, even the decoration, even the T-shirts.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.040]   Thirdly, he's only going to keep those employees are excited about a radical change to the point
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.000]   of dedicating more hours to it than they have ever done.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Or can't leave.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.800]   Or can't leave because they're H1B and their visas would force them to go back to Canada.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.880]   But people can be replaced.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:07.080]   Fourthly, he's shredding users who don't like the way he does things.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.120]   He's happy to see us go to Mastodon or wherever or Hive or wherever people are going, who
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:16.800]   don't like where they think the government is headed and who are not willing to pay to
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   use Twitter.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   Okay.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.160]   That middle clause, I think it doesn't make any sense.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:26.520]   Finally, he's going to take out the trash by removing fake inactive or annoying accounts,
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.520]   not doing that.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.520]   Sorry.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.520]   That would be great.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:35.760]   In fact, when he had the vote on whether Donald Trump should be invited back, it was
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.440]   clear that he made no attempt to keep bots from voting.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.360]   Well, say it was the latest one, should I let everybody back?
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:46.000]   Should I take everybody who was suspended and just put them back on?
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.520]   What's to say that's against not Russian bots?
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.520]   Of course not.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.520]   Of course.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.920]   And all his claims of growth are not bots.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.120]   He's by the way, he was all worried about bots until he owned it.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.120]   Now he doesn't even talk about him anymore.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.120]   Right.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.120]   Right.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.120]   Good point.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.760]   He just wanted the price to go down.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.120]   Yeah, that was just that was.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.040]   And see, that's the thing to remember.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.440]   He is willing to do misdirection to get what he wants.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.440]   He doesn't.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.920]   Yes, Musk is destroying the company he bought.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.760]   This goes on and he's doing it on purpose and consciously carefully.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.320]   Oh, carefully is a big word.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.240]   When he finishes his demolition job, he'll begin his project, which for now, because it's
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.760]   only of getting rid of a corporate culture that is of no use to him.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.640]   I might agree he's doing that.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.800]   His Twitter will initially be much smaller than its previous iteration, and which will
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.400]   have a few completely different characteristics, culture, features and leadership.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.400]   Okay.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.120]   I can't say that's not true.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.120]   Okay.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.120]   He is moving fast and breaking things for sure.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.640]   But what will be the thing left?
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.720]   A professor of innovation at IE Business School.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   Okay.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.720]   Okay.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.560]   Which I think is international.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:58.000]   That's in Spain because he writes in Spanish on his blog.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.480]   I mean, he could rebuild it and it could be GAB.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.320]   That doesn't necessarily mean he didn't have a vision.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.600]   It is possible that you're right.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:13.120]   He got red-pilled and he's now just a diluted QAnonner and he just wants to remake it in
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.120]   that image.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.680]   That's possible, I guess.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.560]   I mean, that's what his tweets would suggest.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.560]   Wow.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.560]   That's the attention he wants.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:27.240]   I mean, that's what I know people who have become QAnonners.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.440]   And they are you do too.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:33.480]   And there's no, you can't, they are fervent believers.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.280]   Once they're there, they're there.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.840]   And if that happened to Elon, this may be exactly what you would want, what you would
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.720]   expect from him.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.920]   You can't bring facts to a culture war.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.920]   No.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.720]   But why wouldn't he just, somebody's in the chat.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.880]   I'm saying this is a good point.

[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.880]   We thank Melissa for their support.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:07.880]   And encourage you, by the way, to use that address so they know you saw it here.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.880]   Melissa.com/twit.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.880]   Okay.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.880]   Okay.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.880]   Thank you, Melissa.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:18.880]   Before you launch into Journer, may I do my full disclosure?
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.880]   Yes, please.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.880]   Which is that through the auspices of the Townite Center that I directed at the Craig, Craig,
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:30.880]   Craig, Newmark, Graduate School of Journalism, I have granted money to Journer.host for its
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.880]   Aloud Pocket expenses.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   I saw that money came months.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.880]   And that was you.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.880]   That's me.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.880]   Good for you.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.880]   The New York Times first said it was the Townite Center at Colmy University who has a lot of
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.880]   money and we don't.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.880]   We're a public school and they didn't give any money.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.880]   We did.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.880]   But everybody don't have that.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.880]   Fix that time.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.880]   Oh, it was CUNY.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.880]   They did fix it.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.880]   It was the Newmark, Craig, Craig, Craig, Newmark School of Journalism.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.880]   And also I just got another grant from someone to carry that on.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.880]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.880]   You didn't know that.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   So you gave them a lot more money than they need.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.880]   I just wanted to point that out, but okay.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.880]   It lasted a last of maybe a year.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.880]   Okay.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:11.440]   I read our server with 6,000 people for $385 a month.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.440]   But okay.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.440]   That's fine.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.440]   They have staff, right?
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.440]   They have people.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.960]   Well, they brought people on to do some tasks.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:17.960]   Yeah, they've had to.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.840]   And I think what we're trying to do, this is, he's talked about it publicly.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:26.920]   So Adam, I set up a bat signal to people to say, Adam, we can't keep doing this forever.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.480]   And so he was doing it on his own.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.480]   Is that right?
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.480]   Well, he has a seven now volunteer.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.480]   Wow.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.480]   And others were going.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.480]   But they're volunteer part time moderate.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.120]   They'll only volunteer people who watch the stream and then say, oh, we're going to block
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.120]   that.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.560]   And more than that, they're the approvals and all that.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.200]   But we talked to the Pointer Institute, which is probably likely to take it on.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.200]   Good.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.400]   So how many people that are in a host now?
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.000]   I think he's up to 2000.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   Okay.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.800]   Because he said the same thing.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.520]   If he improved everybody, he was trying to be like 30,000.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.520]   I talked to him this afternoon.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.960]   Oh, I'm very careful.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:04.960]   We have 6,000 members, all of whom I have individually approved.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.520]   And I quoted you in my spare time.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.520]   In my spare time, we don't have any additional moderators.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.520]   You Leo also said that you were going to download limited to the club, which I think
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.520]   is very smart.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.000]   So just for people to understand, first of all, there's a common misunderstanding about
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   Mastodon.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   The thing that you're joining is the Fediverse, which is much bigger than Mastodon.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.800]   And it includes Pixel Fed, includes Plaroma.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.400]   It includes peer tube.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.840]   There's a lot of other things, microblog, Mastodon, Reese's, microblog.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.840]   There are a lot of other things, including, by the way, WordPress.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.240]   And I know you want to talk about it, Jeff.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.240]   So we'll mention it.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.240]   Tumblr has said we're going to get on the Fediverse as well.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:51.560]   So all of these are part of a group of interconnected social sites that communicate using something
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.160]   called Activity Pub.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:58.440]   So what really is the key technology here is Activity Pub, Activity Streams, that allows
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:04.440]   individual sites using various software on these sites to communicate.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:08.360]   And for you on any one site to follow people on all other sites.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:16.200]   So for instance, going forward, I would be able to follow a Tumblr account on my twit.social
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.200]   account.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.360]   Cool, right?
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.360]   It's not Twitter.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:24.120]   It's not designed to be Twitter, but it does have some of the features of a Twitter-like
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.880]   service.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:33.080]   So Adam has created his own home on the Fediverse, uses Mastodon software, but it's a Fediverse
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.600]   site for journalists only.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.240]   And he has to vet everybody, right?
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.000]   Everybody has to provably be on what?
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.200]   With a journalistic organization?
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:46.920]   Or journalists with their freelance, they send in, they show clips and so on.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.440]   You could get in, Jeff, though, as a professor of journalism?
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.520]   Yeah, well, also on the board.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.520]   So I think I can get in that way.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.520]   Okay.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.400]   But yeah, I think other professors are on Jay Rosen's.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.400]   They're pretty sure.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:01.760]   So the key is for any Mastodon site, except for the biggest ones, which are trying to
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.000]   be Twitter.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.600]   And by the way, that's a little problematic, is to create a local community, because you
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.480]   have a local feed that is somehow connected.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.720]   In our case, it's all the people.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.520]   This is the middle thing here.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:18.560]   All the people who listen to twit in journal.host to be all the journalists talking amongst each
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.560]   other.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.560]   That's a great thing.
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:24.040]   There's a secondary value to journal.host because you can presume if I see an account on
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.120]   journal.host that they're vetted journalists.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.120]   Right?
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.120]   Yes.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.120]   Yes.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.120]   That's the idea.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.640]   But there is a downside, as I'm sure you are.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:38.960]   Well, the downside is any other Fediverse member can block any other.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.240]   So I block GAB.
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.000]   I block there are some sites that I don't.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.680]   If somebody, if people will start brigading us, this is a very big important part of this.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:54.800]   If a site starts brigading us, we just block the whole site from my site, and I don't
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.560]   see them anymore.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.400]   Individuals can do this too, by the way.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:03.720]   Anybody with an account on the Fediverse can say, I don't want to see anything from that
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:07.960]   site or from that person.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.800]   That could be done to the individual.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.960]   And I can do that as somebody as a host.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.840]   Matthew Rolensky, who was a little, I think, over the top and blocking because one, well,
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.520]   Matthew, you should explain.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:28.480]   Yeah, I think that one of the sort of problematic aspects is when a server or instance blocks
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:35.480]   an entire other server or instance, which obviously is one of the things you can do if
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:41.280]   that instance has a whole bunch of people that you don't like, like GAB, for example.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:49.040]   So a whole bunch of Mastodon instances blocked JOURNAL.host, and they had a bunch of different
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.200]   reasons for doing it.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.960]   Some of them just don't like journalists.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:04.280]   There were trying to look at, oh, clickbait, tabloid, journalists who will collect search
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:11.320]   through and misinterpret anything you say, enabling hate and harassment, surveillance
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.960]   capitalists was another comment.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:22.320]   There were, I seem to remember some problems with some of the people on JOURNAL.host.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.800]   When he turned it on, he didn't understand what was going on.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:29.840]   And he briefly got smashed because he thought that once he turned it on that anybody could
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.840]   come in.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.480]   So he said, oh, my God, he stopped.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.640]   That was point one, point two.
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.720]   He let in a writer from National Review Online.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:41.240]   And that's what pissed off, especially one server in Australia.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.160]   And said, because of that, you're all awful.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.960]   I'm going to block everyone there.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.960]   So that's just that practice.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.360]   But anybody who runs a server can do that.
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:53.240]   And if you are on their server and you don't like that, first of all, they should publish
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.400]   that information.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.400]   Not all do.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.640]   So there were two other aspects.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:05.440]   And one I sort of got caught up in because I used a link in my piece in CJR that someone
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:10.480]   shared that showed how many people blocked JOURNAL.host.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:16.560]   So that software that shows you how many people blocked a certain instance was created by
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.560]   Kiwi Farms.
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.560]   And so...
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.000]   Adam used that Kiwi Farms tool as well.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Right.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.600]   Most people use that as evidence.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.360]   Kiwi Farms was clearly a person.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.560]   It was a kind of a troll.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.560]   Trolls.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.560]   Yeah, it is.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.040]   Yeah, they're still around.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.840]   Most people block Kiwi Farms.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:42.520]   And using a Kiwi Farms tool, even though it doesn't by itself have any point of view, was
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.080]   seen by some people on the Fed.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.080]   Right.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:51.240]   The thing you have to say about the Fediverse, first of all, it's kind of like a health food
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.240]   store.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.240]   You know?
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.240]   You're watering.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.360]   And a quiet taste?
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.360]   Is that what you say?
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.880]   No, but you're wandering into...
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.880]   There was a culture before you all came.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:02.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.880]   And you're wandering into this culture.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.360]   And this culture was very different than a mass culture.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.080]   You're bringing your hamburgers, dammit.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.080]   I agree.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.080]   There's actually a really good...
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:14.280]   I'm trying to remember the guy's name now, but he wrote a piece exactly like that talking
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:19.120]   about how this was to be expected.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:24.600]   That's just the journey.host thing, but just people from Twitter, Twitter refugees showing
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:31.560]   up not understanding the culture, behaving in all sorts of ways to try and get their
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:37.840]   toots to go viral or whatever that they're used to on Twitter.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.840]   And...
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.000]   Yeah, we know why you made some good points.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.880]   That people had a thing going on.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:50.280]   It's like they're having a basement party with just half a dozen people and they're playing
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.680]   songs on the mandolin or whatever.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:56.680]   And all of a sudden, 3000 frat guys show up with a kegher or whatever.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:57.680]   That's better than the first store.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:58.680]   It's more apt.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.680]   But at the same time, that happens.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:05.480]   Remember when AOL was allowed onto the internet and it was this...
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   The long September.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.480]   The long September.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.360]   But I just got the book about that.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.360]   Netwars.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:14.600]   And in fact, the guy uses that analogy in his piece about Masbod.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:18.280]   But I have to say, can I just read this real quickly?
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.280]   I think it's about Matthew might have been referring to.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.600]   People grumbling the Masbod on is slow at the moment.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.920]   You've just turned up with one million people in a tiny rural village and you're complaining
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:30.120]   there's a queue to get into the only tea room which is run by gay pensioners Babsmore
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.120]   Reen as a retirement hobby on Monday through Wednesday.
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.120]   Relax!
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.120]   Yeah, it was good.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:39.360]   But to its credit, actually the Fediverse has expanded quite well.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.800]   Oh yeah, and handled this onslaught quite well.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:45.160]   I think there's seven or eight million new users all of a sudden.
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:48.040]   It's imagine what Eugene's life has been like.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:52.040]   Well, Eugene gets a lot more attention than he probably deserves.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:56.400]   He wrote a client which we all use which they call Mastodon.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.400]   But there's others.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.400]   There's Pluroma.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:03.240]   Oh yeah, by the way, I asked today, I asked somebody, a fortunate reporter called me before
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.320]   interviewing him and I said, "Do me a favor.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.080]   Find out how he pronounces it."
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.560]   He's an Oigene the German way or Eugene.
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:14.680]   He said, "Oigene's right but I go by, I give up and I take Eugene."
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:17.640]   I actually always call him Gargron because that's his Mastodon.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:18.640]   It's easier.
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:19.640]   Right.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:20.640]   And everybody knows Gargron on Mastodon.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.360]   Now it's because he's been in Time magazine.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.840]   It's such a...
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:32.240]   But I should mention in my story, I mentioned that a guy on Mastodon had mentioned something
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:36.480]   to me about however many instances blocked, turned it out.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:40.800]   He reached out to me and said, "Excuse me, I'm not on Mastodon.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.800]   I'm on Pluroma."
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:44.800]   Which I had never heard of before.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   Right.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   It's a Fedodon.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   People keep calling it Mastodon.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   It's not.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:49.800]   It's the Fedodon.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:50.800]   No, it's not.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.400]   It's really important to make that distinction for a variety of reasons.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:58.840]   But best practices in the Fediverse is not to block a whole instance unless that whole
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.480]   instance is provably problematic.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.400]   Remember, as I said, each individual on your server and every other server can be
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:10.880]   blocked in an entire instance if that person doesn't like it or an individual.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:15.560]   They're very good tools for an instance to block an entire instance is really extreme.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.400]   I only block about seven or eight.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:18.400]   That's...
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.600]   Yeah, it feels like that's kind of a nuclear option.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.440]   It's very much so.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.440]   And so maybe...
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:28.160]   But again, it's also the privilege of the instance runner.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.160]   It's coming out of our pockets.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.600]   I just think it's coming out of my time.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.320]   I'm doing it if I want it.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.320]   But everybody who is on the instance should know what you're blocking.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:41.000]   And in fact, some people I've seen have left that server specifically because it did that.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.480]   That's the way they were on to it.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.480]   That's the way.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:44.480]   Which is your option.
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.480]   It's a little bit of a hassle.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.720]   I mean, it's a big hassle and it's also you lose your toots from that server.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.240]   You lose it or does it just stay there with the old URL?
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.240]   Yeah, it stays there.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.240]   It stays there.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.240]   It stays there.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:59.760]   And in fact, if people go because I moved from Macedon.social to gerona.host.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.240]   Your stuff's still on the Festa.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.880]   So I exported my file list, imported it.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:11.480]   And now when people click on the old link, they just see my old profile and it says I've
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.480]   moved to this.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.760]   Also, your old posts are there under the old profile.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.760]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.760]   That's good.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:19.960]   The other side of this is I'm sitting here in Twitch social.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.800]   I don't see any.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:24.440]   I don't, there's a lot of other stuff in the Fediverse that I don't see.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.080]   I only see people.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.880]   I follow people.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:28.880]   That's the home.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:32.240]   I'm using an advanced web interface, but this is the same thing.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:35.160]   If you click the buttons, I see who's people I follow in home.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.160]   Oh, you caught me.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.680]   I boosted something during the show.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.680]   That's fine.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.680]   I see.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.880]   That's allowed on mass.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.320]   I see the local timeline.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:46.960]   And by the way, you don't have to follow anybody who's in your instance because you're already
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.040]   can see everything that's going on in your local timeline.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.480]   And then the federated timeline is not everything.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.520]   So I don't see Gabb or I don't see anything.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:55.600]   I don't see all the other stuff.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.960]   I only see people who people on my instance are following.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.120]   So that's a somewhat self-selecting group.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.880]   If you have a good instance.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:07.440]   And then if I do see something coming over the federated timeline, if I see nudity or
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:10.280]   pornography coming over, I'll block that person.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.600]   I won't block their instance.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.240]   But if I...
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.160]   Instance blocking is really if you're getting brigadeed.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.840]   If like 100 people from an instance are coming over to your instance and harassing people.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:25.400]   The thing that interests me partly is in terms of behavior and sort of culture is things
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.080]   like the content warning.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.080]   So when I first...
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.240]   That takes a while to get used to.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.760]   I noticed that's going away though.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:31.760]   People aren't using it anymore.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.920]   It is going away and yet people are getting more upset about it as it's going away.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:42.640]   I thought it was interesting when someone explained to me, don't think of it as a content warning.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:46.240]   It has to be super serious or it's going to trigger someone or whatever.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.240]   Think of it as a headline.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.720]   Yeah, that's what I use.
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.840]   And so people, once I started thinking about it in that way, then I used it differently.
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:51:00.240]   So if someone sees bird sight info as the headline.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.240]   Yeah, I don't want to see it.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.240]   I don't want to see it.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.240]   I don't want to see it.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:04.240]   You know the best use I've seen of it?
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.240]   This is going to sound a little trivial.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:10.240]   I don't mean it because the best use is something that truly is triggering or offensive to people.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.480]   And especially as journalists we should be kind of aware of that.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:17.760]   Though we shouldn't be content warning things about equity and justice in my view.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:22.480]   You know what makes me so sad on Twitter is dead and Facebook is dead pets.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.480]   Yeah, you want to...
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.480]   You want to...
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:27.120]   Somebody's putting the content warning on the dead pet because I really just don't want
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.120]   to be word oppressed.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.120]   I'm sorry for you.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.120]   But I understand...
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.120]   But I don't need to...
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.440]   Just as you feel that way about dead pets and bridges, there are people who feel that
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.520]   way about eye contact.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:39.360]   For a long time that was considered to be inappropriate.
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:40.360]   Really?
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.360]   So...
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.360]   Really?
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.360]   So I think it's...
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.360]   You're coming into this new community.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:50.080]   Content warning is probably going to go away only because there's so many people who don't
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.080]   do it.
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.080]   It's kind of...
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.080]   Well, you can turn it off in your...
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.520]   I, as an instance, moderator, don't...
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.320]   I expand everything because I want to see it.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:59.320]   I turned it off.
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.320]   Right.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.320]   And you can do that, but it should do.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:05.560]   And I wish everybody used content warning, but I mean all the time for every post, but
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.560]   they don't.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:07.560]   So that's fine.
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:13.200]   Someone also pointed out that it's easy to think because we're used to Twitter where
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.840]   it's this kind of monolithic thing.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.000]   They said you can't assume that...
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   That's right.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.360]   Just because people on one instance do something or say that this is supposed to be done that
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:27.480]   way, that that's the way everybody in the Fediverse does it.
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.480]   Because lots of people have different opinions about this.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:35.160]   But remember that Maston, particularly, but the Fediverse in general, was originally
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:40.360]   people were fleeing Twitter because they were not safe on Twitter.
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:44.240]   And so it has a disproportionate number of people who fell unsafe on Twitter.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.160]   And that's where that whole culture came from.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.440]   And I had a couple of people explain that to me when I was...
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.000]   No, I noticed nobody's using it anymore.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   Sure.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   No.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   I see it.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   It's funny how...
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   It's a lot rare.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.280]   I also see a lot of people saying, "Well, we want the quote tweet.
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:03.560]   We want the quote tweet."
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:04.800]   We talked about this last week.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.360]   I think that would be bad.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:10.080]   I think it's a little rude to come into a place and say, "We want it to be more like
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.080]   the old place."
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:14.760]   Let me give you a contrarian view of that.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.440]   And here I'm quoting somebody named Jonathan Flowers.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.760]   Dr. Jonathan Flowers, who I think has been brilliant on the topic.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.760]   I follow him.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:23.120]   It's about Black Twitter.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.560]   And he's explained a lot of things.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:28.760]   The first is, we talked about this last week, how quote tweet ended up being used is calling
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:29.760]   a response.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.360]   And it's a cultural use.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:33.080]   And he explains very well how it's used.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:35.640]   And the other thing that happened was he was talking about this.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:43.200]   And then Adam Curry came in and said, "Flowers has something about white tech bros."
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.600]   And then Adam came in all defensive.
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:50.120]   As white people tend to do and said, "Well, just name some and this is what I know what's
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.120]   what they're doing."
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.280]   This, by the way, is why I block no agenda socially is one of the few places we don't
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.280]   federate with.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.280]   Wow.
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.120]   So it's good to know.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:01.900]   So Adam then, if you want to follow no agenda or Adam Curry, don't come to Twitter social
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.960]   partly because they were brigading us.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:10.080]   They were the chief source of trolling all the Twitter stuff.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.080]   So he was doing that.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:14.200]   So then he ended up answering flowers that way.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.560]   And I said, "Why don't you listen to people?"
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:23.040]   And what Adam then said was, the same standard was, "Open your own instance."
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:29.680]   And I thought flowers came back with brilliant response, brilliant response, which was, "That's
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.680]   your way to say FU.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.000]   That's your way to say go somewhere else.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   That's your way to say, "Well, I have the tools and you don't."
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.520]   And he didn't say it this way, but I will.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:40.040]   It's almost saying separate but equal.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:43.400]   Okay, if you want to do all that stuff, go off in your own place and do it.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:49.160]   Rather than saying, "Do we value the experience and the mechanisms that people and other cultures
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.120]   are bringing to this?"
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.600]   And so it's not just about everybody adapt.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:58.520]   Yes, listen, adapt, learn what's there, but also listen, adapt, and learn to the new value
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:01.200]   of diversity that's coming in.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:05.760]   And this is nothing but society adapting this norms and figuring this out, not doing very
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:06.760]   well at it.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.640]   We'll see if we can do it better in Master Don or not.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.640]   I don't know.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.280]   Time will tell.
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:14.720]   It's interesting though.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:19.800]   You know, there's Hive now, Hive.com, which I have not joined.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.240]   This is an op-it, this post.news.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:23.000]   There's a lot of places people are still.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.360]   Let's talk about post.news for a minute.
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.360]   Yeah, what is that?
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.360]   It's inviting me now.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:30.000]   Next, so, well, okay, that's Noam Barton, founder of Waze, has started an effort.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.480]   Let me do another full disclosure here.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.960]   He contacted me some time ago.
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.000]   He asked me to put together a board of advisors.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.160]   I had a lot of conversation with him.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:38.160]   I liked Noam.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.160]   He's very, very smart.
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:43.360]   For various reasons, I backed out and I have no official relationship to post.news.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.320]   It's current, but I'm on it.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:46.960]   I'm on it.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.640]   It's his effort to have people.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:49.640]   I think I have an invite.
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:51.640]   I think I said it a few times.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.560]   You all do that.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:56:02.280]   So, by the way, Kara Swisher is an advisor/investor and has not, and so has Scott Galloway.
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.760]   I don't know if they're talking about that or not.
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:05.760]   That was part of my rationale.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:09.440]   Kara did not mention it when she spoke about post.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.800]   So, but she evidently did say it on her podcast.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:22.320]   Anyway, It's Noam's effort to have a pool of money that's going to go to creators.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.440]   And by creators, he means in great measure news organizations.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:30.160]   Well, that means he's got to do deals with the news organizations to get their stories
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.160]   up on here.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:34.960]   All he has raw, I think, now is Reuters.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:38.960]   And he's got to be able to have that deal.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.600]   So, the pennies that you give can go to that news organization.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:44.560]   So, it's part of his belief is that we'll work out.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:48.000]   It's interesting that the first day I was on, it was a bunch of Reuters and a bunch of
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   Sherry Reuters.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.800]   Now, most of us not news.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:54.800]   Most of us, it's just for a Twitter like, and so here's my pet.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.080]   You know, here's my party.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.080]   Here's my other stuff.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.920]   It's that social reflex.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:03.440]   There's more news discussion I'm matched on than there is on post.news to me.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.440]   Interesting.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:06.800]   Matthew, so you haven't gotten on yet?
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:09.440]   What have you been hearing about it in your news world?
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:15.960]   Well, it seems, you know, the same things I've heard about Jerna.host, which is it's
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:22.360]   elitist and journalists should, you know, just quit thinking they're special and having
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:25.040]   their own little social clubs or whatever.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:28.240]   And just, so I've heard some of that.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:35.400]   Yeah, I think maybe there's a lesson that we can all learn now about centralized things.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.480]   I think micro payments need to happen.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:39.360]   And that has to be centralized, I guess.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.840]   But I kind of like decentralized.
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:44.960]   I don't like it that, you know, Elon came along and took this thing called Twitter and
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:51.400]   destroyed it because it was centralized because he had money that can never happen to the
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.400]   Fediverse.
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:58.000]   And in fact, if Elon took over like, mass it onto a social or something and turned it
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   into something.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   We just defetorate it.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   Just defetorate it.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   Go on with your life.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.840]   And I should, and this is one of the reasons Gargron slash Oigen is less important.
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:12.400]   That's an open source project with many people working on it.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.600]   He started it.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:14.600]   God bless him.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:15.600]   Thank you.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.760]   But there's a lot of people working on it.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.840]   You could fork it and create your own.
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.760]   Pleroma, I think, is a fork.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:24.040]   Truth social is a fork, by the way.
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:31.200]   So open source software is another example of decentralized that everybody can play and
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.960]   play how they want.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:37.280]   And I really, I, I'm, I've always strongly preferred that.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:42.800]   I realize I was running against the current, you know, but maybe we've kind of learned
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:48.200]   a lesson here that there's some value in something that nobody can own and that any,
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:52.160]   any norms that we develop or developed as a group by consensus.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.080]   It is funny to me though.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:59.320]   It's funny how, you know, people, it's, it's popular, particularly on Twitter to talk
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:06.240]   about how hard massed on is and how nerdy it is and how it's all just nerds with on their
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.240]   computers.
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:13.520]   And, and yet, you know, email and lots of other protocols people use all day long are distributed
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.680]   and networked and no one owns them.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.960]   And yet everyone forgets about that.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:22.480]   And they think that social networks and the way that Twitter and Facebook have operated
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:27.040]   is the norm and that that's the way that things are supposed to be.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:33.520]   It's funny to me as I heard how nerdy Google plus was to the same, same phrase as a bunch
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:34.520]   of nerds.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:36.880]   Yeah, well, I kind of like wave.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:37.880]   That's where I want to wave.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:38.880]   Yeah, wave.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:39.880]   That's where I want to be.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.320]   So wave was great.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:43.760]   I was never comfortable.
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.760]   It was great.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:46.760]   I liked it.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:49.560]   Instead wave Google plus I did.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:53.160]   No, plus well, I'm sure Google's kicking themselves right now.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:55.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:55.160 --> 01:00:01.640]   What was the guy he went on to do a cardia that was, um, oh, I forgot his name, but
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:05.080]   he was the champion at Google plus and when he left Google, that's when Google plus kind
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.800]   of died.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.320]   He was a guy who went to Larry and said, we've got to do social social social.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.320]   Victor Dottra.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.320]   Victor Dottra.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.320]   Victor Dottra.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.320]   Right.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.080]   We got to do social is the next big thing.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:20.840]   And I bet you Google kind of wishes they, they were positioned to do this.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.080]   Somebody saying, uh, well, look what happened to parlor.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.640]   Uh, AWS shut them down yet.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:27.400]   Cause it were centralized centralize centralize.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.680]   They were centralized.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:34.160]   So I don't know why, but for some reason I'm running on a server in France, but, which
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:39.240]   somebody pointed out to you that you may be in better shape on some law, because France
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:43.200]   has a law that would consider you a news organization and you're in better shape there
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.200]   in some ways than others.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:50.440]   Maybe that's why, uh, uh, our, our, uh, I'm on masto.host, which is a managed a mastodon.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:57.320]   Maybe that's why, um, Hugo, who runs it, does it, because he's in Spain, I think, but anyway,
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.160]   we're running off French servers.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:03.600]   But if I, but, but I could take the whole thing, I got copies and I could put it on a different
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:04.600]   server.
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.160]   So it's not a, that's the beauty.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.400]   There is another centralized.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.240]   There is another journalist oriented server I should mention.

[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:39.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:40.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:41.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:42.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:43.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:44.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:45.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:46.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:47.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:48.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:49.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:51.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:52.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:53.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:54.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:55.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:56.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:57.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:44:58.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:44:59.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:00.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:01.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:02.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:03.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:04.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:05.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:06.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:07.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:08.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:09.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:10.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:11.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:12.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:13.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:14.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:15.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:16.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:17.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:18.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:19.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:20.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:21.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:22.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:23.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:24.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:25.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:26.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:27.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:28.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:29.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:30.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:31.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:32.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:33.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:34.800]   I'm not sure if you can.
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:40.560]   Google is using now GAN models, the generative adversarial networks that Stacey loves so
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:46.800]   much to improve translated text with Google lens.
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:51.120]   Okay.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:55.160]   Launching later this year before the end of the year.
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.400]   Looks like the same exact text.
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:58.240]   I don't know how it's improved.
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:03.520]   But anyway, Google shopping with AR shoes.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:09.160]   Google's releasing shopping features to help you see shoes in augmented reality right over
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:10.960]   your own shoes.
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:15.440]   This is so sad.
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:17.280]   This is like straight out of adocracy.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:20.320]   Google says this new shopping AR experience for sneakers.
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:26.800]   Oh, not even any shoe, just sneakers or trainers, as you might be saying in other lands, allows
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:31.040]   you to spin, zoom and see shoes in your space.
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:37.960]   So we're cross brands like Sockney Vans and Merrill starts rolling out in the US today.
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:40.440]   Here is a screenshot of what this looks like.
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:43.480]   Don't put your shoes on the table.
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:45.160]   Where's Adidas or Adidas?
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:48.760]   They were working on this several years ago with Adobe.
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:49.760]   Yeah.
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:52.160]   Do you call him Adidas?
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:57.360]   No, I just said that for the European folks because that's exactly how they pronounce
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:58.360]   it.
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.360]   Adidas.
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:01.360]   I thought he does.
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:02.360]   That's his name.
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:03.360]   That's the correct pronunciation.
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:04.360]   That's his Deutsch.
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:05.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:06.360]   Adidas.
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:07.360]   De Stempt.
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:08.840]   I'm going to call him Adidas from now on.
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:09.840]   I like that.
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.560]   But Oigun is Eugene.
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:14.320]   It's so confusing.
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:18.040]   New shopping models for AR Beauty.
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:26.160]   Augmented reality search features for you to try on products like skin tones, 150 models
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:27.160]   representing diverse.
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:31.800]   Oh, so you tried the makeup on a skin tone that matches yours or face shape or ethnicity
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:32.800]   or skin type.
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:36.280]   So you can test foundation shades and see what that's going to look like.
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:40.120]   Google Maps has added a live view search.
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:43.840]   So it's kind of like lens as well.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:51.400]   So you open it up, turn on the camera and it'll say, oh yeah, over there, that's a nice
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:53.800]   place to get some hotpot or something.
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:54.800]   What?
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:55.800]   I don't know.
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:59.480]   London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, San Francisco, and Tokyo.
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:02.040]   I don't know why I came up with that hotpot.
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:03.040]   Hotpot.
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:04.040]   It's good.
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.040]   Google Maps.
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:06.040]   Yeah, it's my goal in.
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:11.000]   Google Maps adds EV charging filters and wheelchair accessibility.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000]   Good.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000]   Lots of new features.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.560]   See, you thought this change log was just going to be some lightweight crap.
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:21.360]   No, no.
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:22.360]   That's it though.
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:23.360]   Wait a minute.
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:26.640]   This is in-depth podcasting guide with best practices.
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:30.800]   I bet you were in a rich, you might have had something to do with that, don't you think?
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:37.440]   And you can now ask Google Assistant to search and play podcasts by guest or episode.
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:43.600]   So you could say, I want to hear Matthew Ingram on this week in Google and it will play,
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:47.280]   you know, whatever it wants really.
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:55.840]   We're there any rumors of YouTube pulling a Spotify, forest, or podcast where all goes?
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:56.840]   And doing what?
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:59.040]   Oh, you're saying you'll be exclusive?
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:00.040]   Right.
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:03.080]   No, I haven't heard it, but I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:06.440]   They've got the one that was the first thing that came to my mind when I saw this piece
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.440]   about, you know, the best practices.
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:10.440]   Let me see.
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:11.440]   Best practice.
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:13.520]   Don't put your podcast anywhere else.
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:14.520]   That's a bad practice.
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:16.520]   Put it on RSS.
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.840]   RSS with podcast.
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:22.600]   Is Dave Weiner would say podcast without RSS is not a podcast.
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:23.600]   I agree.
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:26.440]   It's not a podcast, it's something else, but it's not a podcast.
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:29.800]   It's a Spotify show podcast.
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:35.480]   Have Dave on and now I've given Adam Corrion and you could, they could talk about who invented
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:36.480]   podcasts.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:40.440]   Yeah, they did it together, but Dave somehow has decided he doesn't like me now.
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:41.440]   So I don't know.
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:42.440]   Really?
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:43.440]   Yeah, he's mad at me.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:49.520]   He says, well, I'm just going to have some other journalist try feedland.org.
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:51.280]   Dave Weiner is that what Dave?
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:52.800]   Yeah, he said the mastodon.
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:55.080]   He said, yeah, I like Dave.
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:56.040]   I got nothing against him.
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:00.200]   I guess I guess that made him mad that I didn't like feed land or something.
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:01.200]   I don't know.
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:03.560]   What do you want from a feedland?
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:04.560]   It was in mastodon.
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:05.560]   Feedland.
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:06.560]   Well, give it a plug.
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:08.280]   Feedland is an interesting idea.
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:14.120]   I did say it would be nice if I didn't have to use Twitter to authenticate, but that's
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:15.120]   fair.
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:17.520]   Yeah, because it's the only way to do it.
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:18.520]   You got it.
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:21.200]   But, and it's not working because I probably signed off.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:27.400]   But anyway, the idea is you, you have a feed like you're, it's like RSS feeds, but it's
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:28.880]   social.
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:30.400]   Like I see your feed and you see mine.
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:33.280]   And I just, I don't, that's not what I use RSS for.
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:38.200]   I use RSS to prepare the shows to find the big stories about Yada Bytes and Leap seconds
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:42.680]   you, you're not going to find those anywhere else.
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:44.160]   You got it.
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:47.200]   You got to do your, your work.
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:50.960]   And that's the Google change law.
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:57.160]   All right, we're going to take a little break, come back and your picks of the week are next.
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:01.080]   So prepare them with diligence.

[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:37.680]   And we thank CDW for their support of this week in Google CDW.com/HPE.
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:42.120]   So nice to have you, Matthew Igram, the Columbia Journalism Review.
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:47.240]   He's on matjourna.host/mathewi with one T.
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:48.480]   One T Matthew.
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:49.480]   One T Matthew.
[01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:52.600]   He's the one, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:57.080]   Do you have a thing of the week this week?
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:58.520]   I have a number of things.
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:52:59.520]   Oh, thank you.
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:00.520]   Thank you.
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:01.520]   Let's do the one we made a choose from.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.000]   I love the one.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:09.040]   So one that just occurred to me when we were talking about who's verified on Twitter.
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:13.680]   I saw someone bought one of these, I think it was Ryan Broderick who has a great newsletter
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:15.360]   called Garbage Day.
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:17.400]   No, I love Garbage Day.
[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:18.400]   I love it.
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:19.400]   It's fantastic.
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:22.560]   So if you had a picture of this, there's a plaque in it.
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:29.840]   It says in honor of @ Broderick or whatever who had a verified Twitter account before they
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:31.840]   were available for purchase.
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:33.400]   Oh, I'll get that plaque.
[01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:35.760]   That's a great one.
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:36.760]   I had it.
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:37.760]   It's $80.
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:38.760]   I have a verified plaque.
[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:39.760]   Oh, wait.
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:40.760]   There you go.
[01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:41.760]   Oh, wait.
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:42.760]   But you have to buy it.
[01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:44.960]   You have to verify that you have Twitter.
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:45.960]   Wow.
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:48.320]   Should I buy it?
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:49.320]   It's a great little.
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:50.320]   That's awesome.
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:54.400]   I think someone gave it to him anyway, if you're into that sort of thing.
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:55.400]   Oh, look at that.
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:58.640]   Offerize, verify forever to access my account.
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:53:59.800]   This is like serious.
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:01.640]   OK, wait a minute.
[01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:06.360]   It's generating my plaque.
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:07.560]   Lasers are firing up.
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:08.560]   Oh, look at that.
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:09.560]   There you go.
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:10.560]   There you go.
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:11.560]   Oh, see?
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:12.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:14.560]   Just if I copy the image, maybe that would be.
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:16.560]   Hey, it's a little for hanging.
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:20.600]   Well, for hanging them, I'm going to share.
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:22.040]   You are verified.
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:25.120]   Check out below to claim you're black.
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:26.120]   That's pretty funny.
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:27.120]   This is funny.
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:28.120]   Cool.
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:29.120]   Yeah, that was funny.
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:30.120]   All right, I'm going to buy it.
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:34.920]   I want to support a proposal when I worked for Advanced, the newspaper company, for a function
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:35.920]   we called Placket.
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:36.920]   Yeah.
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:41.480]   And my idea was because people love when your kids are on the kids' names in the paper,
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:42.480]   you want that.
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:45.080]   So it was a whole thing where you could see a story and you could say, give me a plaque
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:46.080]   of that.
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:48.240]   You're a guy who had a whole trophy company.
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:50.360]   We were going to do that, but it never turned out.
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:51.360]   What else you got?
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:53.120]   You said you had more than one thing.
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:54.120]   So the second thing--
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:56.000]   That was pretty good, though, by the way.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000]   Nice start.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.000]   That was good.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000]   The second thing is a little weird, but I, you know--
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000]   Where is that?
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.080]   It's a rabbit hole that you can go down if you want to.
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:14.520]   It's research into a common parasite called toxoplasmosis gondi, which is commonly transmitted
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:15.520]   by cats.
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:21.160]   That's the one that turns people into cat people.
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:23.160]   Well, more than that.
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:29.400]   So the theory is the parasite is trying to make you more attractive or get you to have
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:30.440]   sex with a lot of people.
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:33.160]   So then it can pass itself on.
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:37.280]   So it makes you more appealing to the opposite sex.
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:42.080]   It's not clear to me whether it makes you more appealing to another person with teagondi
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:45.520]   or whether it just makes you more appealing in general.
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:50.360]   It also, research shows that it encourages risk-taking behavior.
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:51.360]   So I think that's one--
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:52.360]   Elon Musk hasn't.
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:54.120]   That's how we figured it out.
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:55.320]   You've got a nose to it.
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:56:02.960]   So this, you get toxoplasma by contact with feline scat.
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:06.200]   So cleaning kitty litter or eating it.
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:07.600]   And don't eat it.
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:10.800]   But if you did, some high proportion of cat owners already have it.
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:12.720]   And I've heard before--
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:14.120]   Very damaging your pregnancies.
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:15.880]   Yeah, it's not good.
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:21.720]   But the life cycle of this parasite is wild because it grows in your brain.
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:26.640]   And then the idea is a cat eats you like a big cat.
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:27.640]   And it gets it.
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:30.200]   So it's a cycle that goes around and then it poops it out.
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:33.080]   And then another human eats it and it grows in your brain.
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:34.120]   And then the cat eats you.
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:39.600]   So the thesis was for a long time that if you have this infection, you will suddenly
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:42.720]   want to be around cats a lot.
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:45.360]   And that eventually a big cat will just eat you.
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:46.840]   And then the parasite goes on.
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:50.200]   But so now this is a new thing.
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:52.240]   This is-- and you know what?
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:54.240]   I find my wife extremely attractive.
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:55.840]   So it might be real.
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:56.840]   Because she definitely--
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:57:03.360]   So the guy's extrapolating from behavior that is seen in rats, for example, they actually
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:07.400]   instead of being repulsed by cats, they're actually attracted to them.
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:10.120]   And of course, makes the cat eat them.
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:12.120]   I think that's not about--
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:13.120]   I'm just trying to fascinating.
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:14.120]   It's about edible.
[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:19.520]   I find the fascinating that the idea that this little parasite is controlling people
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:25.320]   and making them engage in certain types of behavior that's more appealing theoretically
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:26.520]   to a sexual partner.
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:32.760]   There is actually a-- you know, a must connection because a more recent study found people infected
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:39.360]   with Toxoplasmus, Plasmosis Gondi were more likely to engage in risky entrepreneurial
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:40.360]   behavior.
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:45.760]   They have a lower risk of fear of failure.
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:47.760]   And multiple sexual partners is also--
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:49.760]   And he's got--
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:50.760]   He wants to have as many children.
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:51.760]   Like 12 characters.
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:52.760]   I think we figured it out.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:54.760]   I think we're on a something--
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:55.760]   He's got--
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:58.400]   All there's a book by Robert Norton, the great cat massacre.
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:00.200]   They occur in Silicon Valley.
[01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:02.560]   Like so, Plasmosis.
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:08.760]   I'm going to apply for funding to look into this in greater detail.
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:11.200]   I keep telling Lisa she's got it.
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:12.960]   By the way, I bought the plaque.
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:13.960]   Do you have cats?
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:14.960]   I bought the plaque.
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:15.960]   You bought the plaque.
[01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:16.960]   I bought the plaque.
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:17.960]   Good on you.
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:18.960]   You should have put up on your desk.
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:20.960]   I'm going to put it right here on the desk.
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:21.960]   Yeah.
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:22.960]   It was a little pricey, but you know what?
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:23.960]   It's for a good cause.
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:24.960]   It's worth it.
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:30.240]   My own self-worth.
[01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:32.080]   And then there's one more.
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:33.080]   Can you stop now?
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:34.080]   Yeah.
[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:37.680]   So the third one is about a T-Rex skeleton sale.
[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:38.680]   Christy was going to--
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:39.680]   What?
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:43.560]   And so these skeletons go for $15, $16 million.
[01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:47.840]   This one I think was expected to go for $20 plus.
[01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:51.720]   And so they had it listed.
[01:58:51.720 --> 01:59:01.560]   And then apparently this previous skeleton that was sold, T-Rex skeleton, a company retained
[01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:06.400]   the rights to that skeleton, the rights to make replicas of it.
[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:07.920]   And so they alleged that--
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:09.720]   Is it an NFT skeleton?
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:10.720]   How do they do that?
[01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:13.600]   No, no, they cast the parts.
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:17.960]   And then you can buy a cheaper version that's plastic.
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:20.560]   It's only 600 grand or something.
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:28.480]   And so they alleged that the owners of this other skeleton basically cast replacement parts
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:30.360]   from the previous T-Rex.
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:31.360]   Couldn't you tell?
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:35.360]   I mean, plastic's not like a pretty fossilized bone.
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:39.520]   So a lot of T-Rex skeletons, like there's very few that are complete.
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:42.000]   So they all have replica bones.
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:47.720]   So their argument was the replica bones that they created were identical to the ones in
[01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:52.760]   this other skeleton to which they have the intellectual property rights.
[01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:54.920]   Who owns the T-Rex?
[01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:57.920]   Hmm.
[01:59:57.920 --> 02:00:02.920]   Well, Matthew, you've earned your place here on the Twitter tab.
[02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:03.920]   Yeah, geez.
[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:08.640]   I mean, it's no rotta bite, but OK, it'll do.
[02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:10.080]   Jeff, your pick of the week.
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:11.840]   Actually, you have a number?
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:12.840]   I do have a number.
[02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:20.160]   I could have gone back to the listings and talked about perhaps unstable diffusion and
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:22.160]   AI porn generator, but I won't do that.
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:23.160]   Oh, geez.
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:24.160]   Thank you.
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:25.160]   Thank you.
[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:26.160]   Thank you.
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:28.680]   Yeah.
[02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:33.280]   Instead, Pew has a new survey of teenagers and the Internet, of course, what you expect
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:35.320]   is it's ruining their lives.
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:36.760]   They'll never be the same.
[02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:38.640]   The future is dead.
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:39.640]   They're all in fear and hatred.
[02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:43.040]   But of course, you're gonna hear me saying no, that's not the case.
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:47.760]   Eight intense teens say that what they see on social media makes them feel more connected
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:49.560]   to what's going on with their friends' lives.
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:50.560]   Oh, that's nice.
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:54.880]   Well, 71% say it makes them feel like they have a place where they can show their creative
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:55.880]   side.
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:01:01.360]   67% say these platforms make them feel as if they have people who can help them help support
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:03.240]   them through tough times.
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:07.920]   A smaller share, there's still a majority say the same for feeling more accepted, more
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:08.920]   accepted.
[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:14.760]   These positive sentiments are expressed by teens across demographic groups.
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:19.600]   When the overall impact of social media on them personally, more teens say its effect
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:23.880]   has been mostly positive, 32%, than mostly negative, 9%.
[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:26.080]   The largest share say that it's neutral.
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:31.240]   59% believe that social media is neither positive nor negative.
[02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:36.520]   Teens are more likely to view social media as having a negative effect on others than
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:37.520]   themselves.
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:40.600]   So that's the number of the third person effect.
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:42.800]   This is like asking an alcoholic.
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:45.760]   Do you think alcohol is causing a problem in your life?
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:47.320]   Oh, isn't it?
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:48.880]   These teens are self-reporting.
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:50.880]   This is not even a problem.
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:55.680]   How is that different from the moral panic, get ready, Ant, that says, oh, it's 15 say
[02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:56.680]   it's terrible.
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:01:58.080]   It depends on how you do the survey.
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:00.480]   It's so for a period of time.
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:03.120]   I don't know if you should.
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:07.840]   Yeah, self-reporting is the worst way to find out how people really feel about it.
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:09.480]   Just remember what Homer said.
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:15.600]   Alcohol is the cause of and the solution to all life.
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:16.600]   Well said.
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:17.840]   Well said, my man.
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:19.840]   Well said.
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:23.320]   What's your thing of the week?
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:24.800]   I've forgotten.
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:26.360]   Oh, Boris FX.
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:30.640]   Of course, this is now the Black Friday and holiday shopping season.
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:35.160]   Boris FX have a discount going on for their package.
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:36.720]   What are Boris FX?
[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:37.720]   5%.
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:45.480]   Boris FX is a group of plugins that you can add to various video editors as well as some
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:53.800]   photo editors like Photoshop to do different special effects and motion tracking and even
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:57.360]   green screening for composites.
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:02:58.800]   I really, really nifty tools.
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:04.440]   I've used their particle package before particle illusion.
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:08.680]   I'm pretty interested in getting the continue on package and playing around with that.
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:09.680]   What is a product?
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:10.880]   Just give us some idea.
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:16.280]   But particle illusion allows you to say you want to just create a graphic of something
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:17.680]   exploding.
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:21.720]   You can create the particles to make it look realistic.
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:22.720]   Oh, that's cool.
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:29.480]   I used it for one of the hardheads videos where he was running and I just put a trail
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:33.000]   of sparks behind him because he was running fast.
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:36.640]   That was with particle illusion.
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:39.560]   Their interfaces is pretty straightforward.
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:42.880]   It allows you to create these particles quite quickly and easily.
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:45.560]   So I thought I'd give them a shout out.
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:53.280]   Like I said, it's 25% off starting today through the 27th or something like that for
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:58.320]   their Black Friday deal.
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:00.280]   That's my pick and then I want to give a shout out.
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:05.080]   We had a heartbreak and loss with the boys.
[02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:10.760]   We had a great game still, four touchdowns, two pass and two rushing.
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:12.560]   It's not his fault.
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:16.160]   In other words, we lost 42 to 41.
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:18.520]   It came down to the wire.
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:21.040]   We went for two at the end of the game.
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:26.120]   He went to throw it a pass to go for the two point conversion.
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:30.680]   Our guy, the Cal commit, he was wide open and hard hit through the ball.
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:34.560]   But it was batted down at the line by a very tall defensive lineman.
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:36.960]   It was a great play, great game.
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:39.000]   That sounds like a great game.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:45.160]   It was an unbelievable game against Campolendo down to the wire.
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:49.160]   We got a shout out from several different newspapers and what nine.
[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:50.800]   I was proud of them.
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:55.640]   I had a great view of one of his touchdowns and it just really made me proud of them because
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:05:00.400]   it's something that we've talked about for years and years of his training far.
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:05.440]   Just having grit and wanting to be better and wanting to do better.
[02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:09.240]   He proved it on that particular run.
[02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:13.920]   It's online, 127 there.
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:16.480]   I had a nice view of this effort.
[02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:17.960]   Oh, a short.
[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:19.200]   They put it on Twitter.
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:23.360]   Well, how am I supposed to know that?
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:27.600]   He's running along and he's about to get sacked and he steps away.
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:28.800]   He's like, "No, excuse me."
[02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:31.040]   Oh, nice touchdown.
[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:33.040]   He says, "Look at that."
[02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:36.560]   That's just the kind of stuff that I've always tried to put in his head.
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:37.800]   It's like, "Go get it.
[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:39.640]   You got to want it."
[02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:42.560]   Sometimes you got to make the play yourself.
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:44.000]   Really, really proud of them.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000]   Proud of the whole team.
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:49.400]   They played hard and I appreciate the coaches and all of their support this year.
[02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:50.400]   So that's end of it.
[02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:51.400]   Are they eliminated now?
[02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:52.400]   Is that?
[02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:53.400]   We are out.
[02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:54.400]   We finished this season.
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:58.320]   San Palendo is playing in the championship game.
[02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:00.920]   They're 12 and they're playing against San Ramon.
[02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:03.080]   Some schools are San Ramon.
[02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:04.080]   So we'll see how that...
[02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:06.920]   Well, the bright side is he can eat as much as he wants a Thanksgiving.
[02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:09.720]   Well, he needs to because I need him to gain more weight.
[02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:12.800]   That rascal still won't gain enough weight.
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:14.720]   It's driving me crazy.
[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:16.720]   He can't win.
[02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:20.440]   Lastly, I want to say big thank you to the whole Twit family.
[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:24.360]   Thank y'all so much for coming out and supporting Queen Pruitt on opening.
[02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:28.640]   It was open at night while I was at that game and we lost.
[02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:32.840]   She was so, so diagrammed and happy to see y'all.
[02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:35.680]   There's Queen Pruitt in her SpongeBob.
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:36.680]   Yeah.
[02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:38.320]   I want a great picture.
[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:43.440]   This is opening night and there's Anthony Nielsen and Jason Howell.
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:44.440]   There's Micah Sartin.
[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:47.480]   The only one in a mask.
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:48.960]   Megan Moroni also.
[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:50.120]   Some old timers.
[02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:51.120]   So many.
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:52.120]   Yeah, I'm curious.
[02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:53.440]   I was there.
[02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:54.440]   It's nice.
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:55.440]   That's great.
[02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:58.360]   She was so diagrammed and happy and thank y'all.
[02:06:58.360 --> 02:06:59.360]   Really, really appreciate it.
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:02.400]   I'm going to go Sunday to see it.
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:03.800]   You still haven't seen it, huh?
[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:06.200]   I haven't been able to go yet, but I will be going Sunday.
[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:08.400]   It's memorized it, but he hasn't seen it.
[02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:10.440]   It's so true.
[02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:13.200]   I do have it memorized by now.
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:14.200]   We're looking forward to it.
[02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:16.440]   Me and Arthead, we're going to go Sunday.
[02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:17.440]   Very nice.
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:18.440]   Two o'clock to check it out.
[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:21.920]   Everybody's been saying a lot of nice things about the show in general.
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:24.040]   So we're looking forward to it.
[02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:25.440]   But thank y'all.
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:27.880]   Thank y'all so much for inviting my heart.
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:31.680]   Oh, because she was over the moon to see everybody there.
[02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:33.480]   Very nice.
[02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:34.480]   Very nice.
[02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:35.480]   Congratulations.
[02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:37.320]   Yeah, let's do it.
[02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:41.880]   Mr. Ant Pruitt, you find him on hands on photography twit.tv/hop.
[02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:46.760]   He's also very active in the club twit discord because he's the community manager in there.
[02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:50.200]   By the way, we all feel like you do such a good job.
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:51.200]   Thank you for doing that.
[02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:52.520]   Thanks for big difference.
[02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:54.000]   Yeah, I try.
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000]   I try.
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.000]   Thank you.
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:57.000]   Thanks to Jeff Jarvis.
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.400]   He is the director.
[02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:03.000]   I mean, the big shot, the director of the townite center for entrepreneurial journalism
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:12.200]   at the graduate school of journalism at the city university of New York.
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:13.880]   His book is almost out.
[02:08:13.880 --> 02:08:16.080]   Be out in a couple of months, but you can.
[02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:19.800]   June, but more than a couple, but.
[02:08:19.800 --> 02:08:20.800]   Couple could be eight.
[02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:21.800]   Could be.
[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:22.800]   B.I.T.L.Y.
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:26.160]   slash by Gutenberg.
[02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:28.640]   If you want to pre-order that.
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:30.680]   B.I.T.L.Y. slash by.
[02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:31.680]   Thank you boss.
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:32.680]   Have a wonderful Thanksgiving.
[02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:33.680]   You too.
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:34.680]   What do you want?
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:35.680]   What do you want?
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:36.680]   What are you preparing tomorrow with what machines?
[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:39.800]   I am doing nothing for the first time in several years.
[02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:40.800]   I usually do it.
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:42.680]   Your son should be cooking dinner.
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:46.800]   I wish my son were.
[02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:48.160]   He did some amazing stuff.
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:50.160]   I'm watching his turkey day stuff.
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:53.320]   He's not bringing any of it up here.
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:57.120]   We're going to Lisa's sisters, so that'll be fun.
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:08:58.320]   What are you doing for Thanksgiving?
[02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:00.320]   A little kachoey pepe?
[02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:02.400]   Costco chicken.
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:03.400]   We love Costco chicken.
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:04.400]   I picked up two of them today.
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:05.400]   That's your Thanksgiving.
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:06.640]   Is it just the two of you?
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:07.640]   No, no.
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:09.480]   My father and my sister will be here.
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:10.480]   Is Jake coming home?
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:11.480]   My kids.
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:12.480]   Yeah.
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:13.480]   Okay.
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:14.480]   Just arrived.
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:15.480]   Yep.
[02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:16.480]   Oh good.
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:17.480]   We'll have a wonderful holiday.
[02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:18.480]   What are you doing, Ant?
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:19.480]   You having a good family gathering?
[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:20.640]   I'm going to do ham.
[02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:24.400]   My sister-in-law will be here for a few days.
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:27.440]   I'm doing ham again.
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:35.080]   Is there a North Carolina or South Carolina tradition for around Thanksgiving?
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:38.000]   It's just like everywhere else with the turkey or what-heavy.
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.800]   But I don't want turkey.
[02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:40.800]   Give me a pig.
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:43.640]   Ham is a nice Virginia thing.
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:44.640]   Yeah.
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:45.640]   Give me the pig.
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:48.360]   And I'm totally following that pig.
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:49.360]   Mac and cheese.
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:50.360]   Mac and cheese.
[02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:51.760]   He had his beer.
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:54.200]   I have oh, Doc, as Mac and cheese recipe.
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:56.400]   It's a pretty amazing.
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:09:57.880]   I made it for the first Thanksgiving.
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:09:58.880]   What Jesus?
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:09:59.880]   Mostly velvety.
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:00.880]   No, no.
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:01.880]   I don't need that.
[02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:06.080]   I made it a couple of years ago for Thanksgiving and it was quite popular.
[02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:08.480]   Oh, mine's good too.
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:10.840]   No, ain't no velvety in it, but it's good too.
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:11.840]   Maybe there's not.
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:12.840]   Maybe I'm doing it with this service.
[02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:14.440]   There's several kinds of cheeses.
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:20.240]   All I remember is you take chunks of white cheddar and you thrust it in the middle of
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:24.360]   it so it's going to melt so you get a cheese bomb in the middle of it.
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:26.160]   Oh, you know that trick.
[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:28.280]   Oh, all right.
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:32.520]   Now I was going to ask Matthew Ingram what his plans were, but he had Thanksgiving last
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:33.520]   month.
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:35.520]   Yeah, yeah, it's over.
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:37.320]   It was good though.
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:38.320]   Okay.
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:41.240]   We had all the usual stuff, you know, turkey and stuff.
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:43.800]   Canadians do it earlier.
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:51.600]   Matthew, of course, is at the Columbia journalism review CJR.org and he's on journa.host.
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:56.840]   So make sure you follow him on your Twitch social instance or wherever you are on the
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:10:57.840]   Fediverse.
[02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:01.800]   journa.host/at-mathu.mat.
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:06.000]   Thank you for spending some time with us, Matthew.
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000]   I appreciate it.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.400]   Thank you for having me.
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:11.400]   Yeah, I'll send you a selfie with the plaque.
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:14.440]   Okay, you can frame put on your wall.
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:17.800]   I get a kickback for every plaque.
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:19.480]   Somewhere that money's gone somewhere.
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:25.040]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 2 p.m. Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern 2200 UTC.
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:30.240]   If you want to join us live, you can at live.twit.tv.
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:31.840]   There's audio and video there.
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:34.520]   You can if you're watching live, you probably should chat with us.
[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:35.920]   A couple of places you could do that.
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:41.120]   Of course, the IRC opened all IRC.twit.tv.
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:44.160]   Or in our club, Twit Discord.
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:46.440]   If you're a member of club Twit, of course, you already know how to get there.
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:50.240]   If you're not, can I encourage you to join the fun?
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:53.800]   Club Twit is a mere $7 a month, but boy, you get a lot for that money.
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:55.800]   Add free versions of all of our shows.
[02:11:55.800 --> 02:12:00.560]   Plus shows that we don't put out in public like Hands-On Macintosh with Micah Sargent,
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:04.400]   Hands-On Windows with Paul Therrot, the untitled Linux show with Jonathan Bennett, the Giz
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:06.360]   Fizz with Dick D. Bartolo.
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:10.840]   That's going to move once I stopped doing the radio show December 18th to right after
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:15.200]   this week in Google on a Wednesday evening, but it will be in the club only.
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:18.480]   So if you're a Giz Fizz fan, you've got to be a club member to watch.
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:21.200]   There's also the Twit Plus feed with shows that we don't bits.
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:22.680]   We don't put out anywhere else.
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:24.560]   And of course, the Discord as well.
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:27.040]   All of that for $7 a month.
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:30.160]   And it really, I, you know, these days we need it.
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:32.160]   It helps us out an awful lot.
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:33.160]   You can let it be known.
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:34.160]   Let it be known.
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:35.160]   Let it be known.
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:36.160]   Two as members.
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:37.160]   You get one.
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:39.160]   I discount in the in the store.
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:40.160]   Yeah.
[02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:43.520]   I'm now a paying member.
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:45.480]   I felt bad promoting it.
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:46.480]   You don't have to do that.
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:51.440]   I know I had a freebie and I felt like, you know, I was a moocher at the party and I loved
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:52.680]   Twit as much as anybody else.
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:54.400]   The least I could do is really join.
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:55.400]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:58.200]   Really, I really appreciate that.
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:12:59.840]   It does help us out a lot.
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:00.840]   Times are a little bit tight.
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:04.120]   Lisa and I are going with that salary this month, which is fine.
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:05.120]   We do it sometimes.
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:09.160]   Oh, this was the one that I want to put this in the Elon's closet.
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:13.040]   The real chief, Twit.
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:14.040]   This is all in the Twit store.
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:17.640]   Yeah, you get 10% off as a club Twit member.
[02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:19.640]   We thank everybody who has already joined.
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:21.120]   I mean, the club is fantastic.
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:24.400]   It's a great social event and that money doesn't just pay for the shows.
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:25.840]   It pays for everything else.
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:28.840]   All our staff salaries, it pays for the master's on server.
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:29.840]   It pays for the business.
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:30.840]   Look at the Christmas card picture.
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:31.840]   That's a lot of staff.
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:32.840]   Yeah.
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:36.640]   Well, it's we're down a lot from our peak.
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:43.440]   We're down a 15 people, but still, yeah, we still a lot of miles to care about them.
[02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:47.920]   And we want to keep them gainfully employed, making good stuff that you like.
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:52.080]   Twit.tv/clubtwit if you're not already a member.
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:56.240]   After the fact on demand versions of the show of all of our shows, all the public ones,
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:13:58.040]   anyway, available at twit.tv.
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:00.040]   In the case of this show, it's twit.tv/twig.
[02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:01.240]   It's easy to remember.
[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:03.720]   Just the short version of the show name.
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:08.840]   You can also watch us on YouTube, youtube.com/thisweekingoogle.
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:09.840]   Or subscribe, really.
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:10.840]   That's the best thing to do.
[02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:13.680]   For my point of view, if you subscribe, you'll get it every week.
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:19.680]   The minute it's available, just find a podcast client uses RSS and we're there.
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:23.640]   You know, I think we probably are on Spotify and other places too.
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:25.560]   But RSS, love that.
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:27.680]   And it means we can't spy on you.
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:29.200]   You can't spy on us.
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:30.200]   It's fair.
[02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:31.200]   Exactly.
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:35.000]   But if your podcast client, whatever it is, allows for reviews.
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.280]   If you would just leave us a nice review, tell the world about this week in Google,
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:41.080]   that would be really great.
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:42.080]   Thank you all for joining us.
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:45.400]   Have a great, if you are in the US, have a great Thanksgiving.
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:48.920]   And we will see you next week on This Week in Google.
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:50.920]   Bye bye.
[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:52.960]   So you're doing another show after this on Wednesdays?
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:53.960]   I won't be.
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:54.960]   Dick will be.
[02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:55.960]   Oh, I see.
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:57.320]   No, I'm not on that show.
[02:14:57.320 --> 02:15:00.800]   I'm scared because you would be really grumpy by that.
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:02.800]   I don't love Grumpy.
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:06.200]   Another show.
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:08.160]   The world is changing rapidly.
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:11.000]   So rapidly, in fact, that it's hard to keep up.
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.200]   That's why Micah Sargent and I, Jason Howell, talk with the people making and breaking the
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:18.440]   tech news on Tech News Weekly every Thursday.
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:20.720]   They know these stories better than anyone.
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:23.840]   So why not get them to talk about it in their own words?
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:28.080]   Subscribe to Tech News Weekly and you won't miss a beat every Thursday at twit.tv.
