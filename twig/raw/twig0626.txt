[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   @prud has the week off, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Stacey Higginbotham are here.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   We are because they are journalists.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Gonna talk about journalism and what Facebook has revealed about the number one
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   most popular COVID-19 post on the platform at the beginning of this year.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   The answer might surprise you.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Only fan says, "Yeah, we like sex.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   They're bringing it back."
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   We'll also talk about Airbnb.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   It's the new WeWork.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   It's all coming up next on This Week in Google.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   [Music]

[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   and points out.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Joining us all the way up in the north, from the Pacific Northwest,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Stacey Higginbotham of StaceyOnIOT.com.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Hi, Stace.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Hello, y'all.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   You're having a nice big bowl of soup, Cheerios, Cap and Crunch.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   What was that?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   It is delicious, corn and basil pasta from the New York Times.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I was like, "Oh my gosh, this is delicious and easy."
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I have to make that.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   It's in the New York Times.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Good.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I should get it.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   It's corn basil pasta.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Do it while the corn is fresh and the basil is fresh.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Now is the time we have a little basil plant in the kitchen.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Everyone's going to go to Trader Joe's and get the plant
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   and just basically it's eviscerated until it's gone.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It's cruel, but it's a cruel well for basil.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   That's all I could say.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   That's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   He is in Florida this week visiting dad.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   He's a candle for me, people.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Let me handle it.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And of course, Jeff is officially the Leonard Tal Professor for
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   journalistic innovation at the Craig Numok Graduate School of
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Journalism.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Craig, it's hard to do it without Ant here at the City of
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   the University of New York.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Ant has the week off.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   He's vacationing as one does in August.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Not all of us.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Good for Ant.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Yeah, he needs a little time off.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Good.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Good.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I guess we should do this.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   It's funny because I don't use Facebook.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I often eschew the Facebook stories just because they don't
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   matter to me, but I guess they might matter to other people.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   So I think we should probably do them.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   They matter to Jeff.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   They matter to Jeff.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Well, sometimes it matters that we don't do them because Leo is
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   going to yell at me, but no.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Well, this one I have no, I've literally no opinion on.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Actually, I'll tell you, it is kind of interesting.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Okay.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I thought you might.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So Facebook says that it was really one post that cast out on
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   the vaccine that was the most popular in the first quarter of
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   2021, this after a long struggle over whether to share the data
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   at all with the public.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   But here's the thing that's fascinating.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And I think it's the reason probably Facebook shared it.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   The article or it or didn't share it at first because they knew
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   what crap would ensue, but go ahead.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Well, okay.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   This is interesting.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   The article was seen by.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Was it 2.8 billion people?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Oh, no, that's the Facebook's total user count.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   So that's confusing.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   That's confusing.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   The most popular thing is we see it about like 0.01%.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   But keep going.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   It was the most shared, the top performing link in the United
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   States on its platform January through March, but it was from a
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   legitimate news organization.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   The South Florida Sun Sentinel was distributed by the Chicago
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Tribune and it was a completely legitimate journalistic
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   story about the CDC investigating the death of a doctor who passed
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   away two weeks after getting the coronavirus vaccine.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Now, months after this was widely shared on Facebook, the
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   medical examiner's office found that there was not enough
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   evidence to say whether the vaccine had played a role in the
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   doctor's death.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   You know, people die whether they get the vaccine or not.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   It's not necessarily cause and effect.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   However, it was, I think it's safe to say, shared widely shared on
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Facebook as evidence that the vaccine kills.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Well, I shared it with people.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I showed it to people.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   It was, it was a, an O story in any case, and it was early in the
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   vaccine days.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   But it was, as you just said, it was a problem.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   You shared health misinformation, Jeff Jarvis?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Well, that's exactly the point is that where is that line and how
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   do you decide this is misinformation?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   So the story of the Facebook report got presented as Facebook didn't
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   reveal information about the most popular thing on the platform
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   being vaccine misinformation.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And then it was buried in all the media stories that this was
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   a story from the Chicago Tribune Company.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   They say we'll take down outright false information, but they
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   argue conversations about factual articles.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Should be super aggressive.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Right.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   People are perfectly legitimate to be curious about it and read it
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   and share it.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   There's no, there's no issue there.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Stacy.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And I'm curious, Jeff, what you think about this, but I feel like
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   media right now, we're in this weird era where we don't know how
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   to deal with stories that change over time.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   So if we think about like the scientific uncertainty around
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   COVID, you know, it's one thing when we used to have, you know,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   you printed it on paper and then it was thrown away.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And so you could change that and people, it was harder to go back
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   and look for stuff, right?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   You know, you were a universal source of truth.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   You and your morgue with all your clips, right?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Right.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   But now we put stuff out there.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   It gets shared out of the context of the date or whatever.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   We're learning new things.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   We don't necessarily update everything.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   So how do we do journalism when things can be ripped from the
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   context?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   How do we try to?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   I really don't know.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   This is a conversation I had with the doctors and scientists I
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   interviewed out of my COVID list in the early days of the
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   platform and asked them just this question.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   And the problem that I've learned about journalism and I was
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   guilty of this in my day and I've said this like on the show
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   before is that we take the latest word as the last word.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   There's a new study that says coffee will kill you.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And then a week later, coffee will save your life, right?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And we never put it in the context.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   We don't understand the process of science.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And it's not just the process of science.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   We don't understand the process of politics.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Like look at the coverage of Nancy Pelosi.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Oh my God, she's lost.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Oh, she won.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Look at the process about the withdrawal from Afghanistan.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Oh, it's a horrible thing.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Oh, we got 80,000 people out.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And we wanted to declare, you know, this line that we write the
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   first draft of history means we ignore history.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   We ignore context.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   We report the here and now.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And surely we should have learned better than that by now.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   But we haven't.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Journalism is awful at reporting process.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Whether that process is that of learning in science, we should
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   have warned everybody.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   We don't know what the COVID vaccine or COVID virus is yet.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   We don't know what it's going to do.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   And responsible journalists did at stat news.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Really good reporters there.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Helen brands will people like that really explain this.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Kai Koopferschmitt is a great scientific reporter out of Germany
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   who writes for science.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   There are some very good examples, but there are also tons of
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   terrible examples.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And just this story kind of illustrates that.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Right?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   It was one episode, one thing, one fact that in and of itself
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   doesn't teach you anything, but is of interest.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Is of legitimate interest and legitimate for explanation and
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   discussion.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And the funny thing about this one is the reason I think Leo did
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   the story is because it's not about media at the time, nor is
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   it about Facebook at the time.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   It's more a story about media's reaction now because they
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   wanted to go after Facebook and oops, turned out to not be the
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   best indictment of them.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said it considered making the
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   report public earlier.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   But since we knew the attention it would gather exactly as we
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   saw this week, there were no, there were fixes to the system
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   we wanted to make.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   They didn't say what those fixes were.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   You got to think that Facebook must have wanted to make this
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   public because it really does kind of thumb its nose at this
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   criticism.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   No, except, but Leo, look at the coverage that came out of the
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   York Conference of the Washington Post.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   They buried the fact that it was legitimate.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Interesting.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Wasn't until the next round a reporter said, "Oh, big guys,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   you kind of buried the lead there."
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   This was a legit article.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   No one, I don't think at this point could say Facebook should
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   have blocked that, right?
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   No, absolutely not.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   If they did, they would have gotten holy hell.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   But that's the matter what they did.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   They could have holy hell.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   No, I think Facebook handled this badly.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   That's usually my preamble talking about Facebook stuff these
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   days.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   They're not as bad as they're screaming, but they could have
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   done a lot better.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   They could have released this report and used as an
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   opportunity to say, "Look, folks, this is process.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   This was legitimate media.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   You can't knock us for doing this."
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Yes, it was popular because people were talking about this
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   and they were scared.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Now, what do you do about the question of both of you?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Had the article been published in, let's say, the epic
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   times, which has been very aggressively anti-vaccine.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   They're a Falun Gong sponsored kind of less than credible
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   source.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Had it come from those guys with the same set of facts,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   would that have changed?
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   What do you think?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Yes, I tend to, actually, the first thing that came to my mind
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   when you mentioned that it was the "Sun Sentinel," I was like,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   "Is that a Sheldon Addison paper?"
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Right, right.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Is that legit or not?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   But that's a good question.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   That's what everybody should ask.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   That's what your daughter should ask.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   What's the source, right?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   So, yes, the source does actually matter, I would say.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   And yet the facts are the same.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   The facts are the facts.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   I guess you could say the article may have used them to advance
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   the agenda.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I mean, yes, you could say advance an agenda.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Like, I actually, I was tweeting about this, but I'm seriously,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I'm thinking about volunteering slash taking over my local paper
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   because--
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   back in the leads, speaking of back in the leads, what is the way,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Stacey Pulitzer, Hagenbotham, Stacey Randolph Hearst,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Hagenbotham, what's going on?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   No, I'm just, I'm frustrated.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   You're gonna call more of them.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Or more like, who is Roger Ailes' wife who took off her
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   their local paper because she didn't like it.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Yes, exactly.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   I'm like, "Oh, okay, I'm gonna go to the garage."
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   No, no, this is just as a journalist living in a place,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   and I have, there's an island newspaper, and it's not a bad
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   newspaper.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   I just, I'm not getting, it's very much,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   the loudest person driving it.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   There are very few facts and a lot of opinions.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Boy, some good journalism and a local newspaper.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   What a concept.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Well, no, and I don't, like, you know, again.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   I want you to do this, Stacey.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   I would love all of what it is.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   I'll kick in 10 grand to help you do this.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Oh, no, no, I'm not gonna.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   I'm just gonna, I'm gonna start by seeing if they'll let me
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   write for them and make cover something,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   because I have an actual job too.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   But I'm just like, as I look at this, this is-
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   What's your actual journalist?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   This guy is an actual journalist.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   The guy who runs the paper is an actual journalist.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I think he's probably, he's like all one person.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   He's like a one man newspaper.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   He's like I have stone, kind of.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Yeah, well, or like-
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Or those of you who are glad as Kravitz.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Oh, I feel like this Kravitz.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Yeah, whoever.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Pick your favorite small town newspaper who's got like
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   a part-time photographer.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   It's probably pictured in a grizzled old man who,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   you know, runs around all over the place or-
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Yeah, but we all love that.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   He was like, we all loved I have stone when he did that,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   because he was, well, we all, we left these, loved it,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   because he was progressive.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   I'm sure there were plenty of people on the other side who said,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   this is Craig Pond who has his newspaper.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   He's driving us crazy.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And I think, I think actually if I report things with less,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   we have a real issue on the island with, um,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   big nimby's own big opinions.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Sure.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Everything is like evil.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   I mean, it's very polarized.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   So I'm wondering if I can put facts first,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   and then like he leads with the most inflammatory quote, right?
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Well, he probably has some experience on what sells newspapers
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   and paper at Giant.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Well, exactly.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   So I'm like, this may be all for now.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   You might be a good businessman as opposed to a-
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Exactly.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   So, yes, so I'm going to just see what I can do here,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   and maybe I won't be able to do anything.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   I'm not going to like, take over the paper.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   I mean, maybe- I mean- I don't know.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   I'll just walk through your point,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   you're going to, it's going to happen.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   It's going to happen.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   What would you need these days?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Seriously, what would you need to do, first of all, I guess a print newspaper
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   is a recipe for disaster?
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   They have a web, they have a web.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   They have a local local local.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   It's on the web.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Yeah, I mean, this serves 20, the island has a population of 24,000 people.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Right.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   I mean, this is, and it's part of a chain-
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   A perfect, hyper-local.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   It's always been my fantasy to do that with a radio station,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   because that's the medium I know.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   And to have a, because radio stations have become less and less local,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   more and more nationalized, and all the broadcast and the same stuff.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And I think small town newspapers and small town radio stations are vital.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Not that anybody would ever listen to a pedal of a radio station.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   I have a vision, if you want, if you want that vision of the small town paper,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   there was a great episode of the Twilight Zone called "Printer's Devil"
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   in which Burgess Meredith played the devil as a watch out for this,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Lanotype Operator.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   [laughter]
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And what he typed into the Lanotype effect changed the future.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   So this is my vision from Stacey, is that she becomes the all-powerful print mogul of the island.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   What would you do, Stacey, to keep yourself from becoming that which you currently abhor?
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Ah.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Wow, I don't abhor, like, I mean, I abhor, like, super, I don't abhor the local paper.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Oh.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Okay, maybe I'm overstating it.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I'm like, good lord.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   But you have some curative purpose in mind, yes?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   I do.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Well, I think I would lead with the facts.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Right now he's leading with the most...
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And if you did that, do you think that would protect you down the road from becoming an advocate?
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   I do.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   So here's the deal.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   It's very easy for me in the tech world because I can be an advocate.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   I am a consumer advocate when I think about...
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   And I'm totally comfortable with that.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Yes.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   If I am reporting on city council, especially at the local level, I can't report for consumers
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   because, you know, it's meaningless for that.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:58.280]   And I can't say, you know, I'm pro-environmentalism because then, you know, the thing is your
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.280]   anti-development.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.680]   But really what I want to do, I mean, I want to do...
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.240]   I want to straddle the middle that I try to straddle here and bring the nuance to each
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.240]   of these ideas.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.600]   And this is probably terrible for journalists.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:14.960]   The reason I ask is it feels like it would be hard not to have some mission creep where...
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:22.440]   And I admire both of you as real journalists who are able to put their feelings aside and
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.960]   do good journalism.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:30.000]   And I'm always fascinated by how you kind of keep on the straight and narrow with that.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.960]   You have to recognize that there's no such thing as objective reporting.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   Yes.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.960]   Like who gets places and where.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.960]   Yes.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.960]   So as long as you know that...
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.960]   So as long as you know that...
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.960]   So as long as you know that...
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.680]   ...that it's totally arising in some way.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:47.320]   So, you know, but I do think there's room for improvement in things like our city council
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.320]   debates.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   Right.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.320]   And...
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.320]   So we'll see.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.320]   You can't ever...
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.320]   It's a...
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.320]   It's a...
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.320]   It's a...
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.640]   ...species to say that there is a perfect center where you...
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.480]   You can't do that.
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.480]   It's worse than that.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.480]   There's a wonderful...
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.240]   And I think I mentioned this show before, but I have so many things to mention.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.760]   I'm out there in the New York Times by Wesley Lowery.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.900]   Peel and Surprise, winning Washington Post reporter who left the post because he disagreed
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.760]   with the editor about social media and the idea about the activity.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.880]   And he argues that objectivity is a power structure and power structure is a common race.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.880]   That's right.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.880]   And it is...
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.640]   Wait, is the editor in charge of looks like me who says that's objective and that's biased.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.640]   That's right.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.280]   And you can't cover that because you have that bias.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.800]   So that's a power relationship.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.800]   And he said...
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   And so this is...
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   In other words, it's impossible...
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.440]   There's no one that's...
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.200]   It's impossible not to have that in some way.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.200]   I argue.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   It can be aware of it.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   Yeah, certainly awareness.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   Oh, yes.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.020]   And you'd be transparent about it.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.180]   But also, it's also about valuing lived experience.
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:55.180]   Lewis Raven Wallace, who's a trans journalist who got fired from NPR because he wouldn't
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.780]   tow that line, says that when they fired him, they lost his experience.
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.780]   They lost his perspective.
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.220]   They told him that, "No, you can't cover these things because you're biased."
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.100]   Well, the other way to look at this is, "Who better to cover this because of your experience?"
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.740]   And it's a bias to say, "You can't cover this."
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.740]   It's a bias.
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.740]   Exactly.
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:20.580]   This is that famous risk of situational ethics.
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.980]   But I think the argument is, all ethics are situational.
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.380]   Is that kind of what you're saying?
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.380]   So there's...
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.380]   Yeah, not all ethics.
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:34.900]   People who use the phrase situational ethics use it to kind of say, "Well, there is an
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.420]   actual ethical truth."
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.140]   And then there are people who hedge it because they say, "Well, the situation means that
[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.300]   you can't...
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.020]   adultery is okay here."
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.780]   But are you saying that...
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:55.420]   So you said, sounds like Stacy, you do believe that there is an ethical truth that...
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.860]   I think you should attempt to report an ethical truth.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.020]   Like that is what I try to do.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:05.220]   I recognize that there are probably more than two sides to lots of issues.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.420]   There are sides that are worth highlighting.
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:14.020]   There are sides like random troll guy that probably does not get violated.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:19.340]   You would agree with locations in our chatroom that the effort alone is worthy.
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.980]   Yeah, and you're never going to get it all perfect.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:23.980]   Right.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.300]   I mean, that's the other thing.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:31.500]   And with community journalism and community, like local news, a journalist is very much
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.660]   part of the community.
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.740]   You can't be objective about the place where you live.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:43.020]   So you've got to be the type of person who's willing to meet people where they're at and
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.700]   be a part of that community and that will influence your coverage.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.780]   We're actually very fortunate in Petaluma, a little larger than Bainbridge Island, about
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:51.780]   50,000.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.820]   Well, not a lot larger, but twice as size, that we have a local paper, The Argus Courier,
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:03.220]   which is run by the big city paper, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat, which is owned by the
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.700]   really big city paper, The New York Times Company.
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:07.700]   But I...
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.100]   Not anymore.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.100]   Not anymore.
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.100]   Do they divest?
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.500]   I don't know who owns it then.
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.460]   But they've done a really good job.
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:24.660]   I feel very fortunate that we have a small town paper because they cover the city council
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.660]   meetings.
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.180]   They cover the controversies in the town.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.940]   And they take letters to the editor that say things like, "You're so full of it!"
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.780]   Which is great.
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.100]   I feel very fortunate, but I have a feeling there are a lot of towns in this country that
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.820]   don't have anything like that.
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.860]   Who's going to cover the city council meetings?
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.580]   God, they're so worried.
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.580]   We better.
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.580]   We better.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.580]   We better.
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:51.100]   Because we know how Stacey thinks on this show, she's going to come at this and say,
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.540]   "Have you thought of this angle?
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.500]   We should really discuss this part of it.
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.140]   Here's a different perspective that you should see."
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.940]   That's what's going to be really valuable.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.460]   Oh, you're right.
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:06.740]   We were bought by something called Sonoma Media Investments.
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:11.820]   After Halifax Media bought it from the Times Company.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.820]   That's a group of old white guys.
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:14.820]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:15.820]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.980]   They're Sonoma Media Investments.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.980]   But yeah, we're going to cover it.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.580]   Actually, they look like middle-aged white guys.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.980]   Sometimes white guys can...
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:22.980]   Yeah, there's a...
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:23.980]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:24.980]   Sometimes they can do a good job.
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.980]   Anyway, I think they are doing it.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.820]   They bought the press Democrat, the Argus Courier, the North Bay Business Journal from
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.820]   Halifax.
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.820]   That's right.
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:35.820]   How'd you know that, Jeff?
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:36.820]   Cool.
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.820]   Oh, you Googled it.
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.820]   That was because I'm impressed.
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.180]   She's a journalist.
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.180]   He looks up facts.
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.180]   I knew I was old.
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.180]   Okay.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.340]   I am living in the town where five years ago or something the Times sold it off and didn't
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.820]   even pay attention.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.900]   But I have to say, I would love...
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.700]   I know that's what Craig Newmark's all about, right?
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.740]   Is trying to preserve this tradition of journalism.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:07.340]   Well, what's worth preserving but also challenge what's not worth preserving and make it better.
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.860]   I mean, Craig pushes for trust in news.
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:13.940]   I think he recognizes that too often we've lost it and that's what I recognize too.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:15.820]   So, my sister is...
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.860]   We're in my father's apartment right now and she just brought me...
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.220]   She's starting to go through his stuff as we pack up what's necessary for him and she
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.140]   just came across this.
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:30.060]   Take five on page five daily with Jeff Jarvis, the man with the beard.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.060]   Is that the examiner?
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.980]   That was the examiner.
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.100]   That's a little bus card that...
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.100]   Or a subway card.
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.460]   In fact, it's still got the curve from being on the bus.
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.460]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.460]   That's awesome.
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.980]   And the San Francisco Muni, back when the examiner was not a rag...
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:46.980]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:47.980]   Now it's...
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:48.980]   The world is pink.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:49.980]   Now it's a giveaway.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.580]   It's a giving newspaper.
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.580]   It's not...
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.580]   I don't...
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.580]   I think, I don't know.
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.580]   Obviously, I'm not up on local media anymore.
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.580]   But obviously not.
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:02.180]   San Francisco just had a morning paper, the Chronicle and an afternoon paper, the examiner.
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.700]   And they were arch-rivals and they were both great.
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.740]   And they had columnists like Jeff Jarvis.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.740]   It was...
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.740]   Herb Kane.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.340]   Herb Kane, the legendary Herb Kane.
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.340]   I missed that.
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.580]   And they, by the way, they probably had Sudoku puzzles, both of them.
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.460]   God bless them.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:25.860]   Hey, speaking of journalism, our favorite columnists, Zaneb Tuficke, has joined the New
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.500]   York Times as an opinion columnist.
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.460]   Congratulations to Zaneb.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.340]   At the time.
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.340]   And the times.
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.340]   I think she's...
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.980]   I've been kind of a religious reader of her opinion pieces, both in the Times and the Atlantic,
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:44.380]   because she was the first person, as the Times points out, to tell people in March of 2020,
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.940]   you know, masks might actually be a good idea.
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:52.460]   Back when the Surgeon General was saying, "Don't wear masks!
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.300]   Save them for the medical personnel."
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.820]   Well, that's a question, though.
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.740]   I wonder whether...
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.220]   When the history is written, presumably we all survived to write it.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:10.540]   I wonder whether we might find out that that was a strategy just to save the masks for
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.540]   the doctors who needed it.
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.540]   Oh, it was.
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.540]   It was.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.540]   But what they should have said is, "Don't wear N95.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.380]   Don't wear medical quality masks."
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.300]   But you know what?
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.060]   That mask you make yourself is better than nothing.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:26.420]   But even at the time, doctors were dying to get any kind of masks, because they had no
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.420]   PPE.
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:35.060]   But I think it was Croatia, where they started an on-the-ground effort to get all the grannies
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.860]   to sew masks, and they would keep them on the streets on mask trees for anybody to take.
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.980]   It had a huge impact on the spread of the virus.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:43.980]   We could have done that.
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:50.220]   And by the way, the Times points out that a month later, the CDC reversed itself partly
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:54.140]   because they said, once senior scientists at the agency said, "St.
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.100]   Essay was key to that decision."
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.100]   So she had some.
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.580]   This goes back to what Stacy was talking about before, and you were talking about too, is
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.580]   the process.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.700]   We didn't know.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.820]   We legitimately didn't know at the time.
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.620]   And as evidence came out, and as people like to say they've talked about this, it was
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:16.300]   re-examined, and the opinions changed based on different evidence and data, not based
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.700]   purely on emotions.
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:23.580]   So we've talked about the idea that maybe it would be best if you have a COVID-19 Twitter
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:27.540]   list, which is made up of epidemiologists and physicians, people who are experts in the
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.060]   field.
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.580]   And I think you've always made the case that those are the people who we should listen
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.380]   to, and we should really be careful about listening to people not like sociologists who
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.700]   are not experts in the field.
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.700]   But there is-
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:38.700]   Or journalists.
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:39.700]   Or journalists.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.660]   But I think there is, and this is where journalism has an important role, that's what a journalist
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:49.900]   can say is, you know, there's a lot of different opinions even in the medical community.
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.660]   Here's a summary of them.
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.900]   And why you can't make a decision based on-
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.260]   That's a good role for right Stacey.
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.420]   That's a role for a journalist should be playing.
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:00.780]   That's the role for a journalist.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:08.340]   And I would also say that, I mean, experts are great, but you also, the value a journalist
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:13.260]   should provide, doesn't always, is the ability to understand those experts and translate
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.220]   what they're saying to something normal people can understand.
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.940]   That's what you do in technology.
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.460]   No, but that's what you do.
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.460]   Because it's trying to come up with like, and then put that information into context, but
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:28.460]   to do that, you need to have a historical understanding of like, in this issue, I may
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.580]   not be an epidemiologist.
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:35.820]   But if I learn enough about it and talk to enough smart people, I could play one on
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.820]   TV.
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.820]   No, I would have the context.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:40.820]   I have the context.
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:45.980]   No, because listen to me, having done this with incredibly technical fields, so like
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:52.300]   software-defined networking, semiconductor manufacturing, freaking wireless.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.020]   I cannot build you a network.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:27:00.420]   I understand at a really fairly technically deep level how those things work and happen.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:05.500]   And I built that up over 20 years of talking to people who are way smarter than me.
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.980]   And that's the context that I bring to talking to those experts.
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:14.860]   And it is inherently valuable because I can compare what two or three other people say
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.380]   about something to what I know.
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:25.660]   And that doesn't make me less important or valuable than that particular expert, because
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:30.740]   I'm an amalgamation of a bunch of different thoughts and all this context that even they
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.300]   might not have, because I'm old.
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.860]   I would use the word synthesis, right?
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.860]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.180]   I certainly agree with that.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.700]   But my butt is this.
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:48.860]   We are also bombarded with cyber boys becoming armchair epidemiologists with their hot takes.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:53.900]   And then the next, they're experts in evacuating war zones.
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.500]   And the next week, they're the experts, something else.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:01.220]   And the hot takes spread not just from social media, but they spread into media itself,
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:06.060]   into proper media, where some journalists, I think, get too taken with themselves.
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:10.340]   Yeah, that's a problem in our field in technology reporting as well.
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:17.380]   There's a lot of people on YouTube who are not expert, who may even be on the take, so
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:22.500]   to speak, from companies they cover because they don't have any journalistic code.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.380]   But they're also some very good people.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:29.620]   Isn't that always the responsibility of the reader to try to fair it out?
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:30.620]   Wow.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.620]   Who's responsible?
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.620]   I agree it is.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.580]   But I think that's where we get that.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.660]   No, we're here, people say, no, this goes back to your first story.
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.380]   The platform should get rid of that bad stuff.
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.980]   But then that's just as bad as somebody else.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.100]   That's some other person telling you what to think.
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.020]   So yes, in the end, it is the reader's responsibility.
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.020]   I agree.
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.780]   But I don't think right now the commentary about that agrees because media feels as if
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:53.780]   they're being displaced.
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.180]   So I agree with everything.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.500]   That absolutely.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:03.260]   But it's an ecosystem that includes cyber boys and their hot takes.
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:08.140]   So we get back to that thing that I've always felt was a little pat, but everybody always
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:13.220]   says, well, you just have to teach people to have critical thinking and have.
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.300]   I would argue that you have to fund journalists.
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:21.340]   So they can, I mean, one of the reasons why we don't have this is because there's not
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:25.740]   enough to admit like I have a deep knowledge of peering.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:32.580]   It only comes up in as relevant, you know, maybe three times a year for a major everybody
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.700]   gives a hoot story, right?
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.740]   And the rest of the time I've got to work on other stuff, but I still have to keep sort
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:42.220]   of up to date on peering if I ever want to use that when it next comes up.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.780]   And those are the sorts of things we don't fund.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:49.540]   I mean, I'm a hugely expensive writer to have on your publication.
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.660]   And it's true.
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:58.660]   And the stuff that I know about and can add value on is it's not, it's not large, right?
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.660]   For the mainstream reader, they don't care.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:02.220]   They care right now because the chip shortage.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.460]   So I would be really valuable for like the next few months and then poof.
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.620]   I'm gone again.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.620]   So this is well, that's okay though.
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.780]   Don't you think that's kind of okay?
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:17.180]   That people have a that you're only as good as your last article that you're that, you
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:22.020]   know, I'm just saying they can't afford to pay for the context that older beat journalists
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.660]   provide like you can't afford to become an expert right now.
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.180]   There's definitely an issue with that.
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.180]   Yeah.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.180]   Right.
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:33.540]   And you got your own person and you end up doing every story you can possibly get assigned.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:38.540]   And then your as thin as a as a dollar bill on everything you cover.
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:39.540]   And that's where it is now.
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:43.020]   You're expecting to do week blog posts today as we used to put it.
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.620]   And yeah, it's not easy.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.620]   Let's take a little break.
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:46.620]   This is a good conversation.
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.820]   You guys are, you know, this is always a good maybe we'll talk about Google later.
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:50.820]   Good be.
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.900]   Oh, we have lots of there's lots to talk about.
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.540]   Our show today brought to you by CrowdStrike.
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:03.580]   This is I think a very innovative, very smart and very effective way to fight ransomware.
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:04.780]   We've all seen the headlines.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.060]   We all talk about it on all of our shows.
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:12.020]   Ransomware attack of after ransomware attack holding businesses hostage.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.020]   I saw a statistic.
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:17.140]   There's a ransomware attack every 11 seconds.
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.100]   Every 11 seconds.
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.300]   It's fact.
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.140]   I don't wouldn't blame you.
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:25.500]   If you feel like it's just a matter of time before they come for you and you're going to
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:29.580]   have to decide, do you pay or do you lose everything?
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:35.700]   There is a third option to feed adversaries before the fight even starts with CrowdStrike.
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.300]   You're not alone in the battle against ransomware.
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.860]   The secure future demands a shared defense.
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.260]   Get the, get the idea.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.260]   Crowd strike.
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:49.300]   That's why CrowdStrike's Falcon platform uses something they call their threat graph.
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:54.940]   It uses advanced AI to analyze behavior on your devices, servers and cloud workloads to
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.700]   find the threats and stop them.
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:03.100]   But it harnesses the power of every click, every action and even every ally to grow stronger
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.700]   and stop the cyber threats before they can harm you.
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:12.660]   Their security platform delivers the industry's most powerful set of tools to fight today's
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:17.540]   most sophisticated cyber attacks all delivered via the cloud through a lightweight, intelligent
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.540]   agent.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:24.700]   Forrester did a study on Falcon Complete, cloud strikes, Falcon platform.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:31.940]   They found out it was delivering 403% ROI and of course 100% confidence.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.300]   Falcon Complete stops breaches every hour of the day through expert management, threat
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.940]   hunting, monitoring and remediation.
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:41.780]   It's backed by CrowdStrike's breach prevention warranty.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.140]   They put their money where their mouth is.
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:48.620]   They guarantee for Falcon Complete managed customers who receive a warranty covering up
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:53.740]   to $1 million in the event of a breach, terms and conditions apply.
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.780]   Gartner Magic Quadrant named CrowdStrike a leader for endpoint protection platforms in
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:58.780]   2021.
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.140]   I think you'll be very impressed.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.140]   Join the fight.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.660]   Experience the power of the Falcon platform.
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.500]   Do it for free today.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.940]   CrowdStrike.com/twit.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:09.940]   CrowdStrike.
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:29.700]   Well, big turnaround for OnlyFans.
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.300]   We are sex positive now.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.340]   This is just the weirdest story.
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.540]   You may remember OnlyFans.
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:44.820]   Which really I think started as a platform for sex workers to sell direct to their customers.
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:50.340]   Not sexual acts, but videos, pictures, that kind of thing.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:55.140]   Then because of pressure, it turns out from the credit card companies and rules changes
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.740]   that were imminent announced last week, no more porn.
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:07.140]   You can put tasteful nudes up, but no more explicit content.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.060]   There was a hue and a cry.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:14.940]   I think somewhat legitimately, I'm not, I don't have an only fan subscription, but I
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:19.380]   think some of it legitimately from sex workers, I don't think sex work should be illegal.
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.260]   I think in many places it's not.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:27.580]   From sex workers who said, look, this was a safe way for us to make a living and all
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.580]   of a sudden we're cut off.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:33.820]   It can be in control over our fate and not in the hands of certain bad actors, a past
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:34.820]   and such.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:39.100]   Same with the campaign that went after Craigslist and went after other platforms.
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.100]   It shoved it back underground.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:45.100]   Yeah, you know, adult content's not going away.
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:49.460]   It's not illegal, by the way, in most jurisdictions.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.420]   But there's still a very big stigma against it.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.340]   So, Lissa Gerek is one of the best writers on this.
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:06.340]   She's on a book leave now, but she's really taught me about this, that air is an important
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:09.220]   provider of rights.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:14.340]   And I saw, I don't forget, can I say this tweet safely on our air?
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.980]   Say it, we'll believe it if it's probably.
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:23.220]   No, no, it's just, when they took it down, somebody said that they thought that the founder
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:31.420]   of the OnlyFans must have taken it down in a moment of guilt after a moment of rapture,
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.420]   shall we say.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:38.220]   Yeah, and that's a puritanical point of view, isn't it?
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.300]   Oh my goodness, I'm enjoying this.
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:45.100]   This must stop.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:52.260]   The credit card companies, and I think I understand this, don't want to be liable.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:59.060]   They did this already to Pornhub because Pornhub was accused of, in a very famous, talk about
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:04.140]   opinion pieces, very famous opinion piece by Nicholas Christoff in the New York Times,
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:09.140]   pretty much ended Pornhub because he said there's revenge porn on there, there's non-consensual
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.740]   stuff on there.
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.020]   Credit card companies immediately cut them off, and that was that.
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:20.380]   And then it's now kind of, I guess what they're going to do.
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:26.260]   Somehow I'm not sure how OnlyFans has figured out how to get around that.
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:36.220]   I don't know, I think the credit card companies aren't changing their tunes, so I don't know
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.220]   what they're going to do.
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.220]   Bitcoin.
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.220]   Bitcoin.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.220]   Bitcoin.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:45.700]   Companies, people use credit cards to buy porn all the time.
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:49.620]   Yeah, but when, yeah, I don't know.
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.780]   We wouldn't know what to think about that, Stacey.
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:52.780]   I don't know.
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:53.780]   I don't know.
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.420]   That's a legitimate question.
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.020]   Are credit card companies going to decide?
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.660]   They're going to be the new Prune law.
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.140]   It's a pure pressure point.
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:04.140]   Right.
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:08.420]   Last week, I think we're talking about the postal service and how the comms talk, that
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:12.660]   was the pressure point at which you could bring by the pureness against sex and the
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.860]   things that were seen as bad.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:19.800]   And the credit card companies are just a pressure point, so the parents television
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.660]   council, people like that can go after them and they make them nervous about their business.
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:27.300]   So it's a much, who's going to stand up and favor a porn and a major banking company?
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.860]   They're going to say, okay, okay, okay, we'll, we'll, we'll.
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.620]   But there are, I have to say, plenty of sites out there.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.660]   Scooter X has an explanation.
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.660]   He does.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.980]   Thanks now have to ensure that sellers have documented consent as well as age and identity
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:41.980]   verification.
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:45.460]   So, so that I think that's a requirement for pornography.
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.740]   That pressure came in part from this.
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:48.740]   Yeah.
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:49.740]   Yeah.
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:50.740]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:51.740]   Yeah.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:52.740]   Legitimately, you don't want underage performers.
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:58.660]   Maybe that's a problem on maybe maybe maybe only fans has decided we can do this.
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:04.740]   They have policies in place to document people, but they're probably not as rigorous.
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:05.740]   I don't know.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:12.380]   I mean, I just saw a study that said that you, that 13 year olds and under know easily how
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:16.980]   to get around pretty much every restriction on all the platforms.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:22.340]   Well, UK has been, is going to, is going to require identification for the purposes of
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:25.060]   age, which, which has a horrible chilly.
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.060]   Yeah.
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.860]   And guess where now I think they over tie this, but initially the way you would get this verification
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:39.300]   is by going to your local pub and showing up with ID, they would stamp your card because
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.740]   they needed local places.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.380]   People could go to verify their ID.
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:43.380]   I don't know.
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.140]   I think that did not make it into the final version of the law.
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.380]   Well, I'll see here.
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:55.700]   Age verification law explained in 2019 they would introduce a new law.
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.060]   So I wonder what happens to BBC.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.060]   I think it did not.
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:01.100]   Rob's plan for online pornography, age of verification system.
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.100]   You're right.
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.100]   That was October 19th, 19th.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.100]   Yeah.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.100]   Yeah.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:09.380]   Anyway, I mean, I don't really have a opinion one way or the other.
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.260]   As I said, I don't have any only fans accounts.
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:16.100]   I think platforms like Patreon, but I think Patreon also might have some adult content
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.100]   on it.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.100]   Well, yeah.
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.500]   Plantorms like Patreon are fantastic.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:23.260]   It's what we use for our club to what we use their member full service.
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:27.100]   I think they're fantastic for, for people who create content to go directly to their
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.100]   audience.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:33.500]   There's no reason why people who create adult content should somehow be eliminated from
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.340]   that group of people arbitrarily.
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:40.940]   I agree there should be ways to verify consent and verify age.
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.140]   That's obviously something that has to happen.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.140]   Maybe only.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:51.500]   I think Tumblr got kicked in the groin, so to speak, because of its corporate owners,
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:58.700]   it took down just simply nudity, and Tumblr had a lot of artistic expression that used
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:39:59.700]   that.
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:04.380]   Then suddenly there was a fear about, there was a chill on the naked skin there.
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.380]   It's too bad.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:10.740]   I think it'd be nice if society just accepted that sexuality and nudity is part of life
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:17.780]   and not something to be astute as much as we celebrate violence in all its forms and
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:18.780]   fashion.
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:22.940]   Well, I think if the issue is stopping kids from-
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.100]   That's fine.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.900]   I agree.
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:30.860]   That should not be- they've got to prevent that if that's an issue, but I don't think
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.580]   I don't- maybe it's a big issue.
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.580]   I think most of the people, I only fans are adults who have decided.
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:40.580]   Probably most, but if there are some kids getting it on there and doing that, that is-
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:44.780]   It's my hope that that's exactly what OnlyFans did, is come up with a system to prevent
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.340]   that.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.820]   Is there other- there is stuff besides porn on OnlyFans.
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:51.620]   I've never really- I've never gone on OnlyFans.
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.140]   No, in fact, earlier this year-
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.420]   I tried to not be known for porn.
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:00.500]   Yeah, they kind of started to really- and there are some big celebrities on OnlyFans.
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:08.620]   OnlyFans, I don't know what they offer, probably other stuff.
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:14.460]   Anyway, the biggest turnaround in history.
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:20.420]   Hey, we were talking before we end the journalism topic.
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:26.020]   We should probably mention the passing of the guy who put the New York Times on the Internet.
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:29.420]   Yeah, Richard Meislin.
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:34.980]   He was a Times editor, has passed away at the age of 68, which I can tell you right now,
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:39.180]   far too young.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:43.820]   He was, it says, according to the Times, instrumental in the newspaper's embrace of digital technology.
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:50.620]   The Times is among a handful of newspapers who have really made this transition to digital
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:55.060]   successfully.
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:56.060]   Did you know that-
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:57.540]   Yeah, I knew some.
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:02.700]   I knew Martin Nissenholz, who was the business side equivalent better, but Martin and Rich
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:06.980]   and some others at the Times, Vivian Schiller, were among the early leaders.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.340]   And the Times, of course, remember, was Times on AOL.
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.540]   They created a local Times thing.
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.860]   They experimented a lot.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.340]   They were early in on RSS.
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:17.620]   Thanks to Dave Weiner.
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:21.060]   They experimented with advertising models.
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.260]   The Times was the leader for so long.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.300]   Here's one thing I appreciate.
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:31.660]   The New York Times cooking app introduced in 2014, which I have subscribed to ever since,
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:36.460]   drew on Mr. Meislin's vision 20 years earlier of digitally organizing and sharing our wealth
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.460]   of recipes.
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.020]   Ooh, I subscribed to that too.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.020]   It's a great app.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:43.020]   In fact, that's probably where you got your-
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.100]   No, I'm not.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.100]   We were a little foreign.
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.260]   When it came to Kanye and asked him to have a curious, I just want to say what that was.
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:49.820]   Okay, fine.
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:53.740]   But where did Stacey get her corn pasta recipe?
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.500]   New York Times recipes.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.660]   Last year cooking.
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:58.660]   Cooking.
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:02.260]   I, by the way, I subscribed to Epicurious as well, or I did.
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:06.580]   I don't think I still do, but for a long time, it was the most beautiful of all the recipe
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.580]   apps.
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.260]   It was just gorgeous, as good as the, as beautiful as the magazine.
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:16.220]   Last year, New York Times cooking attracted 113 million users.
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.020]   Pretty good success.
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:22.620]   Anyway, thought we'd pass that along.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.620]   All right, Pete Rich.
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.620]   All right, Pete.
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:28.620]   Yeah, we're getting to the point, point in time in the internet revolution, where some
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:32.700]   of many of the pioneers are getting a little long in the tooth.
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:37.340]   We're all, we're all starting to make our way towards the western havens.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:43.460]   So my sister was asking today, because I'm down here in a town, Sun City Center, Florida,
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:49.780]   where you, by law, you have to be 55 to live in the town, not just the building, the town.
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:54.220]   And my father has a World War II veteran hat when she and I talked today to a guy named
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:58.580]   Bob, who's 99 years old who flew Air Force jets over China.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:43:59.820]   I mean, it's amazing.
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:04.780]   So what they talk about here, especially in the complex, right, my folks have been, is
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:08.220]   World War II and the Korean War and being veterans.
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:13.220]   And my generation, certainly Stacey's generation, is not going to have that commonality.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.500]   You know, what are we going to talk about?
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.660]   You know, the Grateful Dead, when we're in the old folks home?
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:18.660]   Yeah.
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:19.660]   I'll be talking about Google.
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.660]   I'll tell you, Jeff.
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:27.420]   Actually, I, Lisa and I went to see Billy Eidle on Saturday.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:34.740]   And it's really, when you go to see a concert like that, you, you know, you're going to
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:39.980]   see immediately that the people were Billy Eidle fans are now in their 50s and 60s.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:41.380]   And it's really interesting.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:46.340]   It was a elder audience.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.000]   Some kids, parents bringing their kids and stuff.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.780]   But for the most part, people, my age and older, because Billy Eidle was huge in what
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:56.940]   the early 80s, he was an MTV star.
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:03.500]   And there was even a guy probably in his 60s who was complete head to toe dressed like
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:08.140]   Billy Eidle and leathers with studs and chains.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:13.900]   And I noticed his, his Lexus Carkey hanging from his belt as well.
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.380]   It was a very interesting scene.
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.580]   I have to tell you, I wish I got a picture of that because it was kind of his style.
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:24.180]   I want to envision now Leo in the old folks home.
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.180]   Do you?
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.180]   I used to be on radio.
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.020]   I was on a remote radio.
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.020]   I often, I often.
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.020]   What's radio?
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:33.020]   I often thought I'd be in the skid row with the sun.
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:34.020]   I'm telling you.
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.940]   Saying we'll announce for food.
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:37.940]   Yeah.
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:38.940]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.540]   I did not stay for the white wedding on core.
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:42.540]   I did not.
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.380]   How did you know that's good or X?
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.380]   Oh.
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:46.380]   It's correct.
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.380]   No, it's everywhere.
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:52.180]   We left right before Rebel yell.
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.180]   But it was fun.
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:54.180]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.180]   Well, that's the other thing I noted.
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:59.400]   The entire band, which also was getting on in years, instead of the traditional Jack
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.060]   Daniels bottle, they were all drinking Gatorade.
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:10.820]   So you got to keep your energy up for jumping around on stage.
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:16.320]   Hey, speaking of the New York Times and the New York Times recipes, this makes me sad.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:21.500]   The New York Times crossword puzzles for the longest time supported a format.puz.scooterx
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:28.300]   is reminding me that times has decided to no longer support this open standard, the PUZ
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.300]   format.
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:34.420]   They basically say no one else can publish New York Times articles.
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:38.860]   You still had to subscribe to get access to the content, but I use a very nice Macintosh
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:43.420]   third party program, which will no longer work starting August 10th.
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.540]   Oh, no, I'm just getting into crossword puzzles.
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.220]   Oh, I love crossword puzzles.
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:50.100]   The good news is it has.
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:51.260]   Yeah, right.
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:57.420]   The Times has an excellent crossword app itself, but there were even better third party apps.
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:58.620]   Plus there are a dot.
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.820]   So D standard.
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:05.500]   I'm sure there is.
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:10.260]   Actually, Sudoku is a much easier thing to, you know, I mean, all it is is a nine by nine
[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.260]   grid.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:15.780]   And you say where the numbers are, I think it'd probably be fairly simple to do.
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:19.500]   Crossword puzzles are more complicated because you got to include the clues and so forth.
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:24.860]   So the, the across light dot puz format.
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.900]   Sorry to say is no longer.
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:33.340]   I mean, it's going to continue, but the New York Times is no longer going to support it.
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:34.700]   Be that way.
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:35.700]   Be that way.
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:37.740]   Yeah, see, I'm not sure.
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:39.780]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:43.540]   You know, another thing that we'll be talking about in the old folks home, Jeff, remember
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:52.100]   when credit cards used to have a magnetic stripe across the back that you would swipe.
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.460]   I remember my charge.
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.420]   My mother's charge plate.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:56.420]   Charge flights.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:57.420]   Remember that?
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:00.020]   This big metal across a carbon.
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.020]   Jun, Jun.
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:06.860]   Magnetic stripes are on their way out.
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:10.020]   Mastercard will be the first payments network to phase it out.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:16.820]   Of course, they've shifted over to a chip and pen or chip and sign microprocessors that
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:17.820]   are in.
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:18.820]   So much better.
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:19.820]   Yeah.
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:21.140]   You know, they're not a hundred percent secure.
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.460]   They're a little easier though.
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:27.420]   I mean, they're a little harder to reproduce the chip that's in the credit card.
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:32.060]   So that, I guess, gives you some more security.
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:36.140]   Based on the declining payments powered by mag stripes after the chip based payments
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:40.660]   took hold, newly issued Mastercard credit and debit cards will not be required to have
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:44.940]   a stripe starting 2024 in most markets by 2033.
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.300]   So you get a little time.
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.300]   No master.
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:52.020]   What happens when the power goes down or the internet goes out?
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.900]   You just have to write your credit card number down for later.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.820]   Oh, I mean, that's happened to me.
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:00.740]   I mean, I just like, oh, yeah, that's interesting.
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:01.740]   I don't know.
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:02.740]   I don't know.
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:03.740]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.660]   The mag stripes probably didn't work then.
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:09.320]   Yeah, they just pull like a couple of places have literally pulled out the little credit
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.320]   card plate.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:15.220]   They just kept this with a slip.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.700]   You must have put this in here, Jeff.
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:20.420]   Bear makes off with Amazon package.
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:21.980]   Yes, I did.
[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:24.380]   Hey, how did I know?
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:26.740]   That's not a that's that's an actual bear.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.860]   Looks like a brown bear.
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:32.700]   Bristol, Connecticut, black bear is a black bear.
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:33.700]   That's it.
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:39.220]   You know, thanks to thanks to these video doorbells now, we're going to get more and more of these
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.220]   videos.
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:43.660]   I was wondering the drill being that's one guy finds a new way to say I love you to his
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.740]   wife every day go around the door and I'm thinking, man, that's going to wear a fan in
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:47.740]   20 years.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.140]   Oh, God, she's saved every video.
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:53.020]   She stopped watching those a long time ago.
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.020]   Yeah, I'm done.
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.780]   Oh, honey.
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:58.140]   Did you see my latest?
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:00.060]   Yeah, that was good.
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:02.100]   How'd you like the thing I did with the balloon?
[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:04.020]   Oh, yeah, that was great.
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.020]   Yeah, honey.
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:06.020]   Honey.
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:07.020]   That's good.
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.500]   What do you want for dinner?
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:12.140]   Did you take out the trash?
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:13.140]   Exactly.
[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:14.140]   Yeah.
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:15.620]   Did you see what I did when I took out the treasure?
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:16.900]   Oh, yeah, that was cute.
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:17.900]   I did.
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:18.900]   I did.
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:26.980]   Elon Musk's Tesla bot is it's a dancer in a suit that's apparently going to do the Charleston
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:28.500]   this was insulting.
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.500]   This is an insult.
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.260]   This is this is an insult.
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.060]   I am just gonna.
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:40.820]   I was so frustrated by this and that I was even more frustrated by people even talking
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:41.820]   about it.
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:42.820]   We should not be talking about this.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:44.260]   Do not give him any attention.
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.180]   No, we are letting him troll us all.
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:50.780]   There is no way robots are ready for this.
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:53.060]   That kind of generic.
[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:58.540]   It's pretty clear to me that this was an attempt to with a little bit of hand waving
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:03.060]   in Charleston dancing say pay no attention to the National Highway Transportation Safety
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.060]   Administration.
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.060]   Yes.
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:06.060]   Getting ourselves down vehicles.
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.860]   Pay no attention to that.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:11.940]   Instead of caring about your safety, we're going to just troll you with this dancing robot
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.420]   person in a robot suit.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.940]   However, I will say Halloween costume of the year.
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:21.700]   I'm going to ask you to go in.
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:27.260]   So my view is if robots are like Mimes, I'm going dystopian and I want to destroy all
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:28.260]   robots.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:30.260]   Mimes are bad too.
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:31.260]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.180]   Clowns, Mimes and robots.
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:36.020]   Those are the big three now, aren't they?
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:37.020]   Go on.
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:38.020]   Go on.
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.020]   Go on.
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.020]   Whirlpool.
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:42.020]   NHTSA or NUTSTA.
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:45.700]   Some people call it.
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:49.260]   They'll be probing the autopilot software.
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:54.340]   Since 2018 is logged 11 incidents, including 17 injuries and one fatality in which the
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:52:02.020]   vehicles autopilot features crashed into stationary emergency vehicles 11 times in the last three
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:03.020]   years.
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:07.380]   Most of these incidents took place after dark with the software ignoring scene control measures,
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:13.220]   including warning lights, flares, cones and an illuminated arrow board.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:18.340]   You know, this is a case where I'll surprise you perhaps.
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:24.700]   I can't think of a better field that requires regulation than this and that hasn't been
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.700]   regulated.
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:26.700]   Completely agree with you.
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:27.700]   I agree with you.
[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:32.820]   Although here's what I don't understand is the first two times this happened, we're like,
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:37.300]   oh man, these things are confused by our emergency setting.
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.580]   Put up a sign with the freaking QR code.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.820]   I mean, we know how to make things legible to robots.
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:47.140]   It is very simple to give someone some sort of waterproof, avoid this area.
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.140]   I mean, it really is.
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:49.140]   Sure.
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:51.140]   So just like your train to put your code up.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:52.140]   Yeah.
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:54.820]   In fact, you don't even probably need a QR code.
[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:57.700]   You probably could just say look for flashing warning lights.
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:58.700]   That might be a sign.
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:52:59.700]   Apparently, according to--
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:03.940]   No, I meant some sort of instead of just putting up, like they put the flares to talk
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:07.220]   to humans, you need to put up something to indicate the robots that is--
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.140]   Yeah, yeah, robots, stay away.
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:10.940]   No Charleston thing here.
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:16.700]   OK, that's all.
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.260]   I don't know what else to talk about.
[00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:20.820]   Let's talk about the new Fitbit.
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:22.660]   The Charge 5.
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:24.060]   Do you have one?
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:25.060]   No, no.
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.060]   He's just launched today.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:28.660]   Oh, you wouldn't have one so soon.
[00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:31.660]   Do you like it?
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:37.140]   I do, but I'm frustrated because Google's pulling, let's call it a Google messaging situation
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:38.540]   here with their fitness stuff.
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:39.540]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:43.660]   They've got their weird Tizen stuff, which there's news out on that.
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:49.180]   And then they've got WearOS and they've got the Fitbit app and the Fit app.
[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:50.900]   And I don't know where anything fits anymore.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.820]   This is just like messaging, isn't it?
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:53.820]   They just can't--
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:54.820]   Yes.
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:55.820]   They just can't make up their mind.
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:58.900]   So Samsung said we're going to stop doing Tizen.
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:00.380]   We're going to merge with Wear.
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:05.100]   We're going to make a Tizen/WearOS that will probably be mostly WearOS because it's going
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:07.380]   to use the WearOS store.
[00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:09.220]   I have ordered and I will get Friday.
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:13.260]   I'll have it for next week, the classic four from Samsung, their new watch, along with the
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:16.340]   Flip 3 because I figured I should have the two together.
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:17.340]   I'll let you know.
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:20.300]   I've liked-- for a long time I had a Gear 3 Frontier.
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:23.180]   I liked it quite a bit.
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:26.460]   But the Wear watches just were terrible.
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.020]   They had slow chips in them.
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:30.180]   They had bad battery life, bad software.
[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:32.780]   With Google, it ignored them for years.
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:36.940]   So at least Samsung's putting re-energizing the WearOS.
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.940]   They're going to use more modern chips.
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.180]   Who's in charge of that OS now?
[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:42.180]   Is it Samsung or Google?
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.140]   Who's going to be the primary developer?
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:45.140]   It's got to be Google.
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:46.940]   Yeah, it's got to be Google.
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:50.460]   I feel like Samsung has capitulated, thrown in the tunnel.
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:51.460]   But Google screwed it up.
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:52.460]   I know.
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:53.460]   I know.
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:54.460]   I don't understand it.
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:55.460]   I know.
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:59.460]   And then Google buys Fitbit and continues with the Fitbit line, which I'm sure Fitbit
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:01.100]   fans will be very happy about.
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:02.100]   Right.
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:08.020]   And the Fitbit app and the Pebble-- I mean, the underlying OS on the Fitbit, I don't
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.020]   know if it's still--
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:10.020]   They bought Pebble.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.020]   --the Pebble stuff.
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:12.020]   Yeah.
[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:14.980]   I know that you can-- actually, the Pebble stuff may be still a UI thing now still.
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:18.540]   Because you can still have a watch face look more like a Pebble.
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:20.260]   But yeah.
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:24.580]   You do have to-- unfortunately, with Fitbit, you subscribe, right?
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.420]   $10 a month, $80 a year for the previous.
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:27.420]   You don't have to subscribe.
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:28.420]   You don't have to.
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:29.420]   But do you--
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:30.420]   In fact--
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:31.420]   Do you want to?
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:34.580]   No, originally, I'll check it out again.
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:37.460]   But at the beginning of the pandemic, they offered it for free.
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:39.820]   So I was like, I will check it out.
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:41.620]   And it was so bad.
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:44.220]   I gave back my free version.
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:46.300]   This is worthless.
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:48.860]   It's just cluttering up my screen and has no point.
[00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:55.780]   So they're going to offer-- so I get many options on my current Charge 3.
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:59.580]   I don't know if they're going to pull back features as they launch new watches to make
[00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:02.060]   the subscription more exciting.
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:05.140]   But right now, I get everything I want without a subscription.
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:07.900]   I have to say, it's pretty attractive.
[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:10.060]   $180.
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:14.100]   It's kind of all soft and rounded.
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:19.220]   And it sounds like this is a fairly competent competitor to the Apple Watch, which is the
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:24.380]   king of the hill in this, at least in the non-specialized fitness watches.
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.380]   I mean, I think they're--
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.380]   Yeah.
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.180]   And they're adding things that they stole, like, the Whoop Band in their heart rate
[00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:30.540]   variability score.
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:33.540]   They're calling it daily readiness experience.
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:36.660]   So they're pulling that from the Garmin and the Whoop World.
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:38.660]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:39.980]   You do have to pay for that.
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:46.260]   Socks, oxygen, saturation, they're going to do SVA2.
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:51.860]   And I'm interested because Amazon has this, and it was actually one of my favorite features
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:58.620]   of the Halo, which is you could access through the Halo subscription, which is only $4 a
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:00.380]   month.
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:03.660]   All kinds of content from other places.
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:09.340]   And it looks like Google's actually doing that here with bar three, daily burn, less
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.180]   mills workouts.
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:14.340]   So because originally with the Google plus--
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:15.580]   The Fit-- sorry.
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:21.140]   Originally with Fitbit Plus, you got really stupid Fitbit coached workouts, and they
[00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:22.140]   were terrible.
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:25.780]   I mean, like, the whole experience was confusing because you had to open up a separate app,
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:29.540]   but then you had to talk to your Fitbit.
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:36.180]   So just a couple of features missing from the five that your charge has, like the floor's
[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:37.180]   climbed altimeter.
[00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:38.180]   It won't have that.
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:39.980]   Oh, I love my floor's climb.
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:42.180]   I think that's a good thing to know.
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:44.500]   And it won't have the relaxed guided breathing.
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:45.500]   Do you do that?
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:46.500]   I never do that.
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:51.980]   I will say, I actually-- I bought one a couple of Fitbits back that didn't have the floor's
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:52.980]   climbed.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:53.980]   And I missed it so much that--
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:54.980]   Well, don't get the five.
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:55.980]   I missed it.
[00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:58.500]   Well, now I won't.
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.500]   That's kind of a shame.
[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:02.580]   I don't understand why they didn't include it, but maybe that was to make room for other
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:03.580]   features.
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.060]   They do a lot of other things.
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:06.060]   Yeah.
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:07.060]   And seven-day battery life--
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:08.060]   I like this when I'm going on a hike.
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:09.060]   It's fun.
[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:10.060]   Right.
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:11.420]   I don't think anything has battery life.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:16.660]   Apple Watch, Samsung watches, Wear OS, none of them have seven-day battery life.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.660]   That's one thing Fitbit really has down.
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:19.660]   Yeah, that's probably--
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:21.260]   I just charge mine every night.
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:22.260]   I don't--
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:23.260]   Really?
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:25.260]   I charge mine every 10 days.
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:29.660]   I have my charger next to my bed, and every now and then I'll stick it on the charger.
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:34.620]   My being the Apple Watch requires-- I charge it every night.
[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:35.860]   It charges up pretty fast, though.
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:40.060]   You could, I think, quite reasonably wear it all night.
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:43.700]   It would be still enough battery, and then put it on the charger while you got ready
[00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:45.420]   for work in a couple of hours.
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:46.700]   It'd be fully charged again.
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:48.340]   So I think there's people who do that.
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:49.340]   I don't like to wear a watch today.
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:52.540]   It takes you a couple hours to get out of the house.
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:53.540]   John does.
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:54.540]   He wears it a bit.
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:55.540]   Well, no.
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:58.260]   So what do you wake up and go out the door half an hour later?
[00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:00.020]   Don't you want to have breakfast?
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:01.020]   Yes.
[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.020]   Yes?
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:03.020]   Where are you going?
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:04.020]   It's basically--
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:05.020]   Yes, why would you-- any time I leave from-- I mean--
[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:06.020]   So I get up--
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:08.660]   So I have a nice cup of coffee.
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:10.700]   I read the paper.
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:11.700]   I shower.
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:14.060]   I shave.
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:15.060]   Brush my teeth.
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:16.060]   Yes.
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:17.060]   Yes.
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:18.860]   We're up to 20 minutes so far.
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:19.860]   And it's charged by--
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:22.860]   You know, I'm up to like 40 minutes by now, but OK.
[00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:27.100]   Sometimes I'll do a little--
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:28.100]   I'm a palaton.
[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:30.620]   That's a 45 minute thing.
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:31.620]   OK, yeah.
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:32.980]   If I'm doing a workout beforehand--
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:39.740]   I set up my day to begin at 11 AM so that I can get up at 8
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:41.300]   and still have plenty of time for work.
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:42.180]   And I'm often late.
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:42.700]   So there.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:48.940]   I just think-- you know what?
[00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:52.260]   Work expands to fill the time available.
[00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:54.980]   If you have three hours to get ready and get out the door,
[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:56.620]   you're going to take three and a half.
[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:58.460]   It's just-- it's Leo's Law.
[00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:02.100]   OK.
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:03.100]   This is not an democracy.
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.260]   It's just Leo's Law.
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.860]   It's Leo's Law.
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:06.180]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:08.300]   Leo's Law.
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.940]   A court-- we talked about this extensively on Twitter.
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:15.900]   A court has ruled that Proposition 22, the Gigworch
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:19.740]   Worker Initiative in California, was unconstitutional.
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:23.620]   And Lyft and Uber will have to hire their drivers.
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.580]   No more-- no more faking.
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.780]   Now, of course, Lyft and Uber will appeal.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:29.340]   And this will go on for years.
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:33.140]   But the reason Prop 22 is unconstitutional--
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:38.180]   there's a little bit of it in there, which I'm sure the folks
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:41.540]   at Lyft and Uber were very serious about saying
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:46.460]   the legislature could not change this law.
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.500]   And the judge said, you know, you can't
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:53.420]   limit the power of a future legislature to change the law.
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.780]   That's unconstitutional.
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:57.660]   So the entire ballot measure is unenforceable, which
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.740]   is a bit of a blow for Uber and Lyft.
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:05.500]   It was also-- it sounded like it was indeed
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:08.820]   a constitutional ride too far.
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:11.420]   It'd be like Donald Trump saying everything I'd done.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.180]   It can't be overturned.
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:14.500]   Yeah, can't overturn it.
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.780]   No, I think the judge is right.
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:19.580]   That was a little bit overreaching on the part of Uber and Lyft.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:20.540]   Tried too hard.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:21.500]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:26.300]   I'm always torn about this because, in fact, I voted yes
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:29.340]   on Prop 22 because I was convinced by the ads that Uber
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.980]   and Lyft spent hundreds of millions of dollars to run,
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:35.580]   saying, you know, featuring Uber and Lyft workers,
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:36.540]   saying, look, I'm a mom.
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:37.420]   I got kids.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:38.900]   This is the only way I can make a job.
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:41.620]   I set my own schedule, and it works for me.
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.700]   And I always think, well, if people didn't like it,
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.140]   couldn't they just do something else?
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.180]   It must work for some people.
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:51.580]   Or is it the case that the job market is so inflexible
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:54.180]   that you just got to take a terrible job because there's
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.140]   nothing else you could do?
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:59.860]   If we've reinvented feudalism where you're so desperate
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:00.860]   and you have to--
[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:01.580]   Is that the case?
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:02.060]   You think?
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:04.620]   I mean, that's the same thing with Amazon warehouses.
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.700]   I wonder if you have to take a terrible job.
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.660]   Yeah.
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:11.260]   If you have no social safety net, right?
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.820]   You have kids.
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:14.340]   You have rent due.
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:16.020]   You have to do whatever you can.
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:20.900]   And if there's enough of you out there and there's a lot,
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:25.940]   I mean, your only option otherwise is just to starve
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:26.500]   and be homeless.
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.500]   And plenty of people are taking that option.
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.580]   They're not taking it with--
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:29.940]   Right, kidding.
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:30.580]   Yeah.
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.620]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.300]   Yes, I know.
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:34.180]   I'm a socialist.
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:36.260]   We move on.
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.180]   Well, I just don't know.
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:41.260]   I mean, I understand that.
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:45.660]   And I guess I'd like to talk to people who say, yeah,
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.500]   I had to be an Amazon warehouse worker
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.940]   because there was nothing else I could do.
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:49.740]   Or I had to take a job--
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:50.980]   You could talk to my brother.
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:51.340]   Really?
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:52.260]   He has to be--
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:52.820]   I mean--
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:55.100]   He couldn't, like, say just go down the street
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:56.900]   and get a better job.
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.660]   Like, I don't know--
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:02:59.900]   He has a--
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:03.580]   He has a GD and the ability to work as an auto mechanic.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:08.860]   But he has ADHD that's not--
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:09.740]   what's it called?
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:10.780]   Medicated.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:12.100]   And so he'll--
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.540]   you know, he crashed some cars.
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.780]   So now he can't really work in many places that have that.
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:19.340]   And then he has an ethical issue with a lot of the crashes.
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:20.980]   Shouldn't he be glad then that there
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:24.020]   is a job that will hire him?
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:24.900]   Yes, he's glad.
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.540]   But he's also like--
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.660]   And it pays well.
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:30.380]   It doesn't pay him well.
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:33.020]   And he's putting-- he had to go buy a separate car
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:33.820]   to put the miles on.
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:38.020]   Like, he's fronting this company that has raised hundreds
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.460]   of millions or billions of dollars.
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:43.980]   I mean-- so it works for him?
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.060]   Is it an ideal job for him?
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:49.340]   It's probably the best job that he can get at this moment.
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:52.900]   And, you know, Amazon warehouse, he could do that
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:55.180]   for a little while, but it's pretty grueling work.
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:57.660]   And he doesn't have health insurance.
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:58.260]   Right.
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.140]   No, I understand.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.300]   It's completely legitimate if you have a job to say,
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.820]   I want conditions to be better.
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:04.740]   I want more pay.
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.460]   All of that's completely legitimate.
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:09.340]   But if a job really, like Uber and Lyft driving doesn't--
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.220]   or DoorDash delivery does not make
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:15.340]   sense for you economically, I guess they're just people who
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:19.660]   have to do something that they lose money at.
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:22.300]   I don't get it.
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.580]   You know, I confess I voted wrong on that.
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:28.260]   But I was persuaded by the ads that said, oh, yeah,
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.700]   this is a job that works for me.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.780]   And I wanted those people to be able to take that job.
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:34.300]   Well, we talked about this before.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:38.540]   I've talked to drivers who insist that still.
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:39.060]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:42.060]   But the work is going to change completely.
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:42.580]   Right.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:42.940]   That's completely.
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:44.340]   We're just going to change profoundly.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.420]   And I don't think we know where it comes out yet.
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:48.420]   And COVID obviously had a huge structure there.
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:50.820]   And I saw somebody complaining, well,
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:54.780]   Amazon was unfair to its competitors by paying a higher
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.180]   salary.
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.420]   Well, TS competitors--
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:00.020]   Oh, that's good.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:01.580]   Yeah, that's a good thing.
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:02.620]   Yeah.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.260]   And they changed the marketplace.
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:05.780]   And they changed labor.
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:07.060]   Now, they did a lot of other things.
[01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:08.620]   They do badly.
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:11.060]   And it's grueling, as Stacy says.
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:14.820]   And their health-- their safety cares
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:16.660]   what they should be.
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:21.260]   Nonetheless, they've kind of single-handedly raised
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:22.860]   wages around the country.
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:23.620]   That's important.
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.100]   Yeah.
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:28.300]   And with one thing we have with my father
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:29.980]   was trying to get help from him here.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.020]   You can't get anybody.
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:33.100]   Now, partly because that's these companies that do it,
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:33.860]   don't pay well.
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:37.060]   And it's hard work.
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:38.660]   So wages are going to have to go up.
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:40.420]   And then we're going to have fear about inflation.
[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:41.380]   But it's time to--
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:44.300]   It's not just wages.
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.580]   So I was actually surprised because there
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:49.580]   were a bunch of articles about the ferry system here
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:52.060]   is having a hard time hiring like other places.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.820]   And they pay really well.
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:55.580]   But then when you dig into it, you
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:57.940]   realize that to get this job, you
[01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:00.420]   have to have like two weeks of training on your own dime
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:01.900]   to work in the ferry system.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.100]   And then you have two years--
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:04.440]   yeah.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.700]   Then you have two years where you're basically on call,
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:10.180]   where the ferry--
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.300]   they will call you wherever they need you.
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.100]   And that could be anywhere from like near Seattle,
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:17.100]   all the way up to like Bellingham, which
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:19.340]   is like two hours away from Seattle.
[01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:20.700]   And you just have to show up.
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:23.060]   You don't have a set schedule or anything.
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:25.460]   You just are basically on call.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:26.460]   So you don't have--
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:27.940]   You don't have a tennis structure.
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:28.580]   Exactly.
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:31.300]   You have to get your dues.
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.900]   When you understand that, you're like, oh, that
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:34.820]   would be really hard.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.940]   Like if you have a family, for example.
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.540]   I have to point out, though, that's
[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:40.260]   how unions worked for years is you
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.900]   had to work your way up through the union
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:44.500]   and become a first-naprentice, then a journeyman.
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.380]   And that was the same kind of thing
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:48.380]   if you wanted a good union.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:50.020]   But then you had a job for the rest of it.
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:50.820]   Well, that's true.
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:53.580]   You did that process when you were young.
[01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:55.940]   Well, that's it.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:57.340]   Sorry, Stacey.
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:58.100]   No, go ahead.
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:59.740]   Go ahead.
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:03.020]   Well, I just listened to "Box," the book
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:06.540]   that Leo made fun of me for buying last week
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:07.620]   by the author of the--
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.460]   How is that?
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.860]   Well, I enjoyed it, but it's really wonky, so watch out.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.620]   But it's about the creation of this different economy
[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:15.220]   around the container.
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:16.220]   And it's fascinating.
[01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:18.180]   But what I didn't know, Stacey, to your point was,
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.260]   you thought that as a longshoreman, let's say,
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:21.580]   yeah, you got set for life.
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:26.580]   No, your seniority meant you got hired before the next schmuck.
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:29.780]   But it wasn't until containers came in
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:32.980]   that they actually got permanent jobs
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:36.340]   because it was the way the union fought
[01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:38.100]   for protection from the technology.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.140]   And so, well, if you give us real jobs and real guarantee
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:45.260]   wages and benefits, OK, we'll let you do this,
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:46.820]   because you protect our current members,
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.980]   same in typesetters unions.
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:51.300]   A lot of this with technology, they
[01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:56.300]   didn't become wage-paying jobs until that was the price
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:00.620]   that they got for the disruption that they could see was imminent.
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:04.660]   I didn't know that, especially about longshoremen.
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.300]   But once you got the job, you could
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:08.700]   be a longshoreman philosopher.
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:10.940]   And then the world is your oyster.
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:11.980]   Yeah.
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:15.660]   Our show today brought to you by a brand new podcast
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:16.260]   from Red Hat.
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:19.180]   And I'm really enjoying it called Compiler.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:21.300]   They only have two episodes out so far.
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:24.500]   But I really thought it was really great.
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.980]   Compiler comes to you from Red Hat.
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:29.460]   It's hosted by Angela Andrews and Brent Simino.
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.620]   They're great together.
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:33.860]   It's very nicely produced.
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:39.140]   And it's fun because they say in the copy,
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:42.100]   they say it's a podcast about technology
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:46.900]   and how it's changing our lives and big and small
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:48.060]   and strange tech topics.
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.300]   So really what I gather from it, at least from the first two,
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:54.020]   is questions people are asking us around here at Red Hat
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:55.580]   and answers.
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.180]   For instance, I listened to the first episode was,
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:00.300]   should managers code?
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:01.300]   And it was fascinating.
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:04.940]   They talked to everybody from the CFO at Red Hat who says,
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:05.740]   no, I manage.
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:07.300]   I only get to code 20%.
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.820]   To another manager who said, I don't code at all.
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:14.020]   But when I'm on vacation, I do the advent of code.
[01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:15.140]   And I solve those problems.
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:16.820]   It was really fascinating.
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:20.300]   You hear a lot of perspectives from the diverse communities
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:22.260]   behind the code.
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:24.020]   And it's really fun.
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.580]   Compiler brings together a curious team of Red Hatters,
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:29.020]   as they call them, to tackle big questions in tech.
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:31.980]   Like, what is technical debt that's coming?
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:35.740]   What are tech hiring managers actually looking for?
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.060]   And do you have to know how to code
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.860]   to get started in open source?
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:42.340]   It's really fascinating.
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.020]   It's fun.
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:43.820]   It's a quick listen.
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:44.500]   They're not very long.
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:45.620]   They're about 25 minutes.
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:46.980]   I'm jealous.
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:50.820]   But I think you're going to really enjoy it.
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:54.260]   The first episode, as I mentioned, should managers code?
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:56.580]   Talks about, well, managers maybe should manage.
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:01.260]   But then some managers really love to wade into it.
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:04.140]   It started as an internal email discussion at Red Hat
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:09.940]   and became a very interesting, much more in depth topic
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:10.900]   than I thought it would.
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:13.140]   And what's great is it's very well-edited, very well-produced.
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:15.140]   So it's fun to listen to, and you really
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:19.500]   get the information in there in a very quick and digestible
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.020]   manner.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:23.380]   Red Hat has done another great podcast.
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:29.300]   Compiler, a demystifying tech, one question at a time.
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:32.020]   First episode, just as I said, just almost just came out.
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:35.020]   August 5th came out and then they have a second episode.
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.500]   You'll find it everywhere, apples, podcasts,
[01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.660]   or wherever you get your podcasts.
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:42.460]   Of course, it's on the Red Hat site as well.
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:45.260]   It's really a great show.
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:48.500]   Well done, Angela, and Brent, congratulations.
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:52.060]   Find it on your-- here's the current one just came out.
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:53.700]   20 minutes, it's quick.
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:56.660]   What can video games teach us about edge computing?
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.300]   I love that.
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:10:59.540]   I love that.
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:05.100]   Compiler, learn more at red.ht/twit.
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:08.100]   We'll also include a link on this episode's show page.
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:11.460]   Or subscribe in your favorite podcast client.
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:12.340]   They've done a nice job.
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:13.900]   reed.ht.
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:16.940]   I like to highlight other podcasters doing great work.
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:19.540]   reed.ht/twit.
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:24.420]   Or just look for compiler on your favorite podcast platform.
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.940]   It's really fun.
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:31.140]   Let's do a Google change log, shall we?
[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:33.860]   Play that funny sound.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:35.860]   The Google change log.
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:44.460]   Big news for San Francisco's starting August 24th.
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.860]   You can ride in a waymo.
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:49.860]   Their first ride is they won't take you downtown.
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.540]   They won't go anywhere.
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:54.340]   If you've ever driven in downtown San Francisco,
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:54.900]   you know why.
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:58.100]   You need to be a trusted tester.
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:01.460]   So I don't know how you get to be a trusted tester.
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:03.060]   But for the first time, San Francisco
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.780]   will be able to hail an autonomous ride.
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:08.980]   And one of their all-electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:13.180]   equipped with the fifth generation Waymo driver.
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:15.340]   They've been doing it in Phoenix for years.
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:17.540]   In fact, I've been watching videos.
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:18.180]   People--
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:19.580]   Pardon me?
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:21.340]   Where is downtown San Francisco?
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:24.420]   So down by the financial district where the high rises are,
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:25.620]   at least I looked at a map--
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:26.980]   I may be wrong, I should--
[01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:29.300]   but I looked at a map of what they were serving.
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:30.500]   Actually, it was an interesting map,
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:33.540]   because it compared that to where most Uber and Lyft rides
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:34.700]   are.
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:37.500]   And it's neither the train shall meet.
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.700]   Almost everybody going on Uber and Lyft is going down
[01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:43.580]   to the Pier 39, the Wharf, the financial district,
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:44.940]   the Embarcadero.
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:49.100]   And by the way, I don't even like driving down there.
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:50.500]   And I've driven down there for years.
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.100]   Yeah, no.
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.380]   I was just like, huh, I wonder where--
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:57.060]   I'm thinking about like, Osama or--
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:58.060]   Osama's on--
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:00.860]   South of Market's fine.
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:01.820]   I don't know.
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:03.300]   I guess you'd have to look at a map.
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:03.940]   I'll look at that.
[01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:05.820]   Yeah.
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:09.300]   But if you want to go to Golden Gate Park, no problem.
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:10.740]   They could take you there.
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:13.900]   I think that's really more of a safety issue.
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:16.860]   I don't think you want to drive down there with all the buses
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.420]   and the bums.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.180]   The buses, the bums, the construction.
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.460]   Yeah, it's not easy.
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:23.140]   Although I haven't been down there in two years,
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:25.460]   presumably it's different.
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:28.700]   Well, there's more of all of the above.
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.660]   I guess it's the answer.
[01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:31.060]   Do you ever--
[01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:33.820]   Is this the ultimate answer to Prop 22?
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:36.100]   Yeah, maybe it is.
[01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:37.140]   Maybe it is.
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:41.180]   Do you ever get to San Francisco anymore, Jeff?
[01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:41.700]   Well--
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.060]   That's in school, I owe, right?
[01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:44.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:45.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:51.340]   Flying right now, I consider no fun at all.
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:54.820]   I flew 300,000 miles a year before pandemic.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:55.980]   I went to zero of course.
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:57.420]   I don't think I'm going to fly much.
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.380]   Yeah.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:00.500]   You wear a mask the whole time.
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:00.980]   Oh, we have--
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:01.660]   This is no fun.
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:02.180]   --this is no fun.
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:02.980]   You've been coming into this place.
[01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.940]   Yeah, that's no fun.
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:07.660]   Do they require a test or anything?
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:09.180]   No, because you're flying dude.
[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:09.900]   No.
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:10.940]   To go to Hawaii, we had--
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:11.900]   It's Florida.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:14.660]   Yeah, but when going to Hawaii, we had either have a test
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:15.780]   or a vaccination--
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:17.540]   a proof of vaccination.
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:18.060]   Really?
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:19.060]   Yeah.
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:20.060]   Yeah.
[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:20.660]   Oh, well.
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:21.220]   Good.
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:21.740]   Yeah.
[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:22.220]   Good.
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:23.260]   I'm still having--
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:25.820]   it fits that my university is not
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:27.940]   mandating vaccination for staff and faculty.
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:30.740]   And other universities like Lehigh and Columbia
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:33.020]   and places that care about their entire community.
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.540]   They should mandate that.
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:36.580]   I understand there should be exemptions for people who
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.660]   can't, for medical reasons, get a vaccination.
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:40.820]   Always a case, but geez.
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:41.700]   It's pretty close.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:42.740]   Yeah.
[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:47.420]   Google is shutting down the Android Auto Phone app.
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:47.620]   Good.
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:48.620]   It's a pain in the butt.
[01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:49.340]   Yeah.
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:51.860]   I love the Android Auto experience in my car
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:54.500]   on the screen of the car, but using it on your phone
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.660]   is, I think, it's dangerous.
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:02.420]   There is an assistant driving mode in the Google Assistant.
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:05.660]   And so that is to replace it.
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:07.780]   And that's a little-- I think a little bit more
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.300]   judiciously designed.
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:10.500]   I didn't never like that name for it.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.060]   I don't have one with you.
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:15.860]   Google Meet will now warn you when you're echoing.
[01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:18.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:20.020]   I love it.
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:22.140]   That's a good feature.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:26.100]   Oh, the Slimer-- the Slimer B feature.
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.780]   Timer B. Timer B. Yeah.
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:28.780]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:29.300]   That's weird.
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.060]   You're echoing.
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:35.420]   Here's the warning you'll get.
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:37.260]   They'll say, the sound from your speakers
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:39.020]   is picked up at your microphone and causing echo
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:40.980]   for other participants.
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:43.500]   So here's the recommendations.
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:44.540]   Use headphones.
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.860]   That's my recommendation.
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:50.820]   Lower your speaker volume or mute yourself when not speaking.
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:51.460]   So good.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:53.020]   Thank you, Google, for adding that.
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:54.900]   No more echoes in your Google Meet.
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:57.740]   We use Google Meet a lot.
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:00.140]   We use it for all our staff meetings, our editorial meetings,
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:00.900]   all that stuff.
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:01.220]   Really?
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:02.580]   You're not using Zoom for that?
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:04.140]   No.
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:05.900]   We use-- Kevin and I use Google Meet
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:08.180]   to meet for the show and all of our stuff too.
[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:08.900]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:12.820]   I think we're-- we pay for Google Workplace, Workspace,
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:13.500]   whatever we call it.
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.980]   So figure it's part of the deal.
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:17.540]   You got to use Google stuff.
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:18.900]   We use-- I mean, we have Slack.
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:19.740]   We could do it with Slack.
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:21.540]   We pay for Slack.
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:23.380]   But I have a JITC server.
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:25.940]   I set up, which no one uses.
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:29.300]   I'm intrigued by what the rationalization of workplace
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:30.660]   tools will look like.
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:34.980]   If you have Slack and Teams and a Zoom account, right?
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:36.300]   And these are not uncommon.
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:36.780]   Like how--
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:37.660]   Sure.
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:38.700]   How is that going to happen?
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:39.660]   Too many choices.
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:40.900]   Host pandemic.
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:41.260]   Yeah.
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:42.700]   Yeah.
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:45.260]   It's gotten a little complicated because when you're dealing
[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:49.020]   with-- on a sales call or an outside agencies
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:53.260]   or other people, there's a little bit of a tug of war
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:56.460]   between who use-- who sets up the meaning and which
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:57.380]   set you're going to use.
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:59.820]   So we have to support everything because sometimes they
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:00.380]   want Zoom.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:03.100]   Sometimes they want crazy stuff, you know?
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:04.060]   Like blue jeans?
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:05.300]   Like blue jeans, baby.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:07.180]   I've done blue jeans calls, yeah.
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:08.620]   Well, I like blue jeans.
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:10.980]   No, I think blue jeans is actually pretty good.
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:11.460]   I like JITC.
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.460]   The team is terrible.
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:14.180]   OK.
[01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.100]   It sucks.
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:15.980]   It's so bad.
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:19.180]   I just didn't want to say it out loud.
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:22.420]   I don't have a-- I don't have a strong opinion.
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:28.140]   Let me see what system update is available Android 12, beta 4.1.
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:33.300]   Rolling out, this one's little 6.48 megabytes.
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.700]   We're getting closer and closer to the release of Android 12.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:36.620]   Probably.
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:42.140]   I'm guessing in October with the release of the Pixel 6.
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:46.460]   But if you're on the beta track, beta 4.1
[01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:49.540]   includes Pixel bug fixes, including for VPN
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:51.740]   and notifications.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:55.380]   Google Chrome will let you save tab groups.
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:56.380]   That's a nice feature.
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:57.300]   I don't use Chrome.
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:59.100]   I'm using Firefox.
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:03.300]   But everybody-- I know Jeff, you do, and you love your tabs.
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:04.020]   Of course I do.
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:07.060]   Now you can save tab groups.
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:09.780]   And one quick option is save group toggle
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:12.780]   with the added to each group's dropdown menu.
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:13.980]   So you can save the group.
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:17.580]   So after reboot, it returns.
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:20.740]   Ooh.
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:22.420]   That's nice because you've got to update Chrome
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:23.780]   every five minutes.
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.780]   That's a good point, yes.
[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:28.420]   So you need that.
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:29.420]   And--
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:32.100]   I'm just in a lab at Harvard.
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:32.620]   Yeah.
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:34.300]   Last I checked, he brags.
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:36.860]   He had 530 open tags.
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:38.620]   Nothing to brag about.
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:40.220]   What is his computer doing?
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:42.420]   Is it like heating his office?
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:44.260]   I know it must be.
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:46.180]   Poor thing.
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:50.300]   He's the society for the prevention of cruelty to computers.
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:51.500]   I'm big on tab hygiene.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.940]   I close them when I'm done.
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:54.780]   Sometimes, too aggressively.
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:55.780]   Like I go, oh, shoot.
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:57.420]   Well, it's like my office after COVID.
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:59.660]   I mean, everything in there, now I know I don't need.
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:02.220]   So if a tab stays open for so long and I didn't use it,
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:03.660]   then I really never did need it.
[01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:04.100]   No.
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:04.580]   Yeah.
[01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:05.180]   That's right.
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:07.140]   I'm the same way.
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:10.740]   And if you are-- although I love the idea of tab groups
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:14.340]   and every browser will let you create a folder of bookmarks
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:15.340]   so you can open all at once.
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:17.980]   So I do sometimes do that.
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:21.940]   But honestly, I just like one tab at a time guy.
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:24.300]   If you were excited about the Pixel 6, good news.
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:30.340]   The Pixel 5 and 4A 5G are now officially discontinued,
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:35.620]   which usually is a step prior to the release of a new phone.
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:41.780]   So because they've got the 5A, and I guess the 6, any day now.
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:42.220]   Any day now.
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:44.300]   Come on, 6s.
[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.180]   Come on, 6s.
[01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:47.140]   Yeah, I'm ready for it.
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:49.340]   He sounds like we're all three getting one.
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:51.620]   Man, I am running out of memory on this phone.
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:55.220]   And some of my apps I'm just like, the heck?
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:57.220]   Yeah.
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:58.380]   You know what?
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:19:59.820]   I swear this is an erotic company.
[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:04.820]   But every single day, I refresh the Asus CX9 page
[01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:06.620]   to see if it's not temporarily sold out anymore.
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:08.660]   I can give the money more.
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:09.220]   Every day.
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:12.900]   I do that with the Xbox Series X every day.
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:14.300]   See if I can buy an Xbox.
[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:16.620]   [SOUND]
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:19.300]   I got to save my money because I've got a new phone coming up
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:21.900]   in October, and I really want to get the new MacBook with the--
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:22.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:23.900]   --the new MacBook Pros.
[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:24.900]   I'm really excited to--
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:26.900]   Yeah, or maybe one of those new Mac minis
[01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:28.100]   that are room-mering about.
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:30.100]   You know, you should listen to our show Mac break weekly.
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:34.500]   We cover all the ins and outs of Macintosh, as well as iOS.
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:35.500]   Yes, I'll do.
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:36.900]   And all of that stuff.
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:42.900]   Partner program on YouTube now has 2 million members.
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:44.700]   2 million members.
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:47.700]   Yeah, launched 14 years ago.
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:53.700]   This is their program to pay creators of the 2 million
[01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:54.700]   members.
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:58.180]   A few dozen are really making some money.
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:01.700]   To qualify, you need 1,000 subscribers, 4,000 hours
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:04.300]   of overall watch time in the past 12 months.
[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:06.900]   You can earn money through ad subscription fees, donations,
[01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:11.300]   live streaming, and YouTube premium revenue.
[01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:12.300]   I'll wear--
[01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.500]   What?
[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.300]   The universe is out of order.
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:15.800]   Oh, no.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.300]   What's the matter?
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:19.300]   You forgot something.
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:21.300]   Oh, and that's--
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:23.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:26.300]   --good, cool, change look.
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:27.300]   Oh.
[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:28.300]   Thank you so much.
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.300]   Ooh, that was scary.
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:32.100]   Gosh, that was close.
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.300]   What if I'd ended the show without that?
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:35.300]   People would have just--
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:37.300]   It would have just been open forever.
[01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:38.300]   --they would have opened forever.
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:39.300]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:40.300]   That's like--
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:44.620]   Didn't we talk about that being the secret to Baby Shark?
[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:46.620]   Is it never ends?
[01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:48.300]   Don't ever say those words.
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:50.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:53.060]   Hey, can we talk about Google's--
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:54.060]   Nope.
[01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:55.060]   No.
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:56.060]   Squallow bimbo?
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:57.060]   No?
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:58.060]   OK.
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:59.060]   What do you want to talk about?
[01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:00.900]   Google's geofencing warrants.
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:02.700]   Oh, my God.
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:03.700]   [SIGHS]
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:07.580]   Exactly what I talk about all the time on the show and having
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:08.580]   access to this data.
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:11.180]   It's so illegal, and we need to figure out how to make this,
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:13.340]   like, how to get away from this.
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:14.860]   And thank you for letting people know
[01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:16.660]   how prevalent of an issue are related to Google.
[01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:17.140]   Yeah.
[01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:20.860]   So Google does a regular transparency report.
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:23.140]   This time, I think, for the first time, they--
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:24.780]   It's the first time they published their--
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:25.300]   Oh, sorry.
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:25.980]   Yeah.
[01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:26.540]   Well, go ahead.
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:27.740]   No, that's--
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:31.900]   It's the first time they published their data about geofence
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:34.140]   warrants.
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:38.340]   The figures reveal that Google has received thousands
[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:41.700]   of geofence warrants every quarter since 2018.
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:45.780]   In fact, it's one quarter of all US warrants
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:47.020]   that Google receives.
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:50.180]   What is a geofence warrants, Stacy?
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:53.100]   It is when they ask, basically, for people of interest
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:55.580]   in an area where--
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:58.860]   send us the people who were in this area a crime--
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:02.900]   that a crime occurred based on their self-emocation data.
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:05.980]   So if there was a robbery of a--
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:11.180]   as there was just the other day of a local beauty store in Petaluma,
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:13.020]   the Petaluma police might go to Google
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:17.620]   say, tell us everybody who was within 500 feet of that store
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:19.420]   at the time of the robbery.
[01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:23.300]   And that would net in everybody innocent and guilty alike,
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:25.820]   and maybe not even the guilty.
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:26.260]   Yeah.
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:29.140]   And when you're a victim of such a--
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:31.980]   or when your data has been compelled,
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:35.340]   Google will let you know that the police in this area
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:36.220]   have it--
[01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:37.940]   sought data on your phone.
[01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:40.380]   Oh, here's my daughter's home.
[01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:41.940]   But they don't tell you why or what.
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:44.460]   They just give you the police information, police departments
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:47.380]   contact, and then you're like, what is happening?
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:48.140]   Am I in trouble?
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:48.500]   What?
[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:49.660]   Oh, no.
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:54.220]   You can see on the graph on the Transparency Report,
[01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:57.180]   this just shows you the growth in this.
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:01.220]   The graph starts at 0 in this first quarter of 2018,
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:03.460]   and of course in the fourth quarter of 2020,
[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:05.340]   and it's just stunning growth.
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:10.380]   And by the way, mostly local.
[01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.820]   The red is state jurisdictions.
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:15.540]   The blue is federal jurisdictions.
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:17.900]   So the states have really--
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:20.740]   number one state for geofence warrants, California,
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:24.860]   followed by Texas, Florida, Michigan, Georgia, Virginia,
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:27.860]   Illinois.
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:29.180]   Yikes.
[01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:31.060]   Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:34.740]   So I'm glad-- thank you, Google, for being transparent about that.
[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:36.460]   One quarter of all the US warrants,
[01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:40.900]   they receive thousands a quarter.
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:43.980]   And so now we need Apple to publish this?
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:45.180]   Yeah.
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:47.340]   But I don't think Apple has the same kind of--
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:50.380]   in fact, I don't think Apple could respond to a warrant
[01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:50.900]   like that.
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:51.900]   Google has mad.
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:52.380]   I guess that's a--
[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:53.540]   Phone companies all do.
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:54.540]   Phone companies, too.
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:56.860]   Phone companies have transparency reports.
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:57.900]   No.
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:24:59.260]   Do they?
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:24:59.860]   Do they?
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:00.980]   I don't know.
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:02.340]   I bet they don't.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:04.420]   Why would they?
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:07.340]   Here is a little work from Danny Sullivan.
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:09.860]   You remember he left Search Engine land to--
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:11.220]   Oh, Fred.
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:12.620]   Go to work for Google.
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:13.340]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:14.300]   Oh, Verizon.
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:15.500]   Hey, let's stay on the--
[01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:16.380]   Verizon has a--
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:19.060]   AT&T and Verizon both publish transparency reports.
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:19.940]   Oh, Google is.
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:21.460]   You're so good.
[01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:23.900]   You're so fast.
[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:25.580]   All right, well, anyway, that's my--
[01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:34.700]   PINA's in 2020, second half Verizon 59,264.
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:38.420]   Ken registered trap and trace orders 4,500.
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:42.100]   Wire tap orders 627.
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:44.260]   warrants 15,000.
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:47.500]   Emergency requests from law enforcement 37,000.
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.780]   Total 121,000 back then.
[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:53.140]   Down a bit from prior years.
[01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:54.020]   OK, we'll remind you.
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:55.540]   Thank you.
[01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:57.340]   Danny on a Danny story.
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:58.500]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:01.980]   Actually, Danny story is boring.
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:03.540]   But these are a print.
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:04.420]   I know.
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:05.580]   He's updated how--
[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:07.380]   But he's not an exciting friend.
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:10.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:11.780]   We're done.
[01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:12.300]   We're done.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:12.780]   I think--
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:13.460]   You got places to be, Jeff.
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.100]   I think you're exactly right.
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:17.700]   Stacy Higginbotham is calling the shots today.
[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:18.580]   Oh, no, I didn't--
[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:19.100]   I didn't--
[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:20.100]   I didn't hear--
[01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:21.060]   --call on the shots today.
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:22.540]   --the show.
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:24.860]   Get ready, your picks of the week coming up.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:25.540]   I don't care.
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:26.060]   It's over.
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:26.540]   It's over.
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:27.020]   I'm done.
[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:28.100]   I'm out of here.
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.540]   Get ready, your picks of the week come up.
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:32.500]   It's like an hour early, oh, geez.
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:33.100]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:35.940]   I'm not even hungry yet.
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:40.260]   Let's start with your thing of the week.
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:40.740]   All right.
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:42.100]   I have two things for you all.
[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:43.860]   Yes.
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:46.300]   This is the new Nest Cam.
[01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:48.780]   It just-- the reviews went up on Tuesday.
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:51.380]   Looks like the old Nest Cam.
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:52.100]   It does.
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.060]   This is--
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:53.820]   I'm trying to give you all.
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:57.180]   There's a can of La Croix for context.
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:59.780]   They actually-- this is heavier than the La Croix.
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:02.740]   How does it compare to a waffle, Stacy?
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:04.340]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:07.900]   So a couple of things to note.
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:10.340]   And I also have the doorbell that I
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:12.220]   didn't bring the doorbell in because I'm
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:15.820]   going to show you the pictures that the doorbell is showing me
[01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:19.020]   so you can get some image quality action happening.
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:20.540]   So both of these devices--
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:21.020]   What's improved on this?
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:24.940]   Fire resolution, something like that.
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.940]   Well, this is their first refresh.
[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:28.980]   So these-- oh, batteries.
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:29.980]   That's the big deal.
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:30.480]   Sorry.
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:30.980]   That's the news.
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:31.940]   Oh, you don't have to plug it in.
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:33.580]   These are all battery powered.
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:36.140]   You can plug them in, and they will have wires,
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.620]   but you don't have to.
[01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:39.500]   They are 179.99.
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:40.700]   Google also added this.
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:42.340]   You see how this has a green light right now?
[01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:44.380]   Yeah.
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:46.780]   It flashes when I'm actually-- so the green light
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:48.780]   says it's processing something.
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:50.140]   And then it'll flash.
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:50.940]   When you're looking--
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:53.460]   To let you know that I'm looking at it directly.
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:56.100]   So I'm about to go look at it directly and see it flash.
[01:27:56.100 --> 01:28:00.420]   I always take that over so the bad guys don't know I'm watching them.
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:02.140]   Oh, that's rude.
[01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:02.660]   What do you mean?
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:03.620]   Here I am watching.
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:05.700]   They're on my property.
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:06.980]   The hell with them?
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:08.580]   I have a lot of these cameras.
[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:11.060]   I actually like them quite a bit.
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:12.620]   Yeah, they're really great.
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:16.140]   So here, now you can see the inception that is--
[01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:16.980]   Oh, neat.
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:18.260]   My office.
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:19.700]   That's nice.
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.180]   That actually looks pretty good.
[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:22.500]   That looks like good quality.
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:24.780]   It's really nice.
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:26.980]   It's a little-- the motion sensor's in the bottom.
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:29.020]   So if you have your--
[01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:31.620]   there is a definite up and down in this camera.
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:34.180]   Down here, you can see where you plug it in.
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.900]   Although there is a setting that you can say,
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.260]   I mounted it upside down.
[01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:40.540]   So there is a setting.
[01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:41.540]   Which is good.
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:42.060]   Yeah.
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:43.540]   You beat me to it.
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:45.540]   And the other thing that is notable here
[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:47.820]   is that it has more on-device AI.
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:51.060]   So locally, it can recognize nine object classes,
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:58.380]   including people, pets, packages, cats, dogs, other stuff.
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:28:59.740]   I don't remember the others.
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:01.060]   It would be great if it could say, hey,
[01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:02.980]   I spotted a waffle at 12 o'clock.
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:04.060]   That'd be so cool.
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:05.740]   Can't recognize waffles.
[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:06.260]   Why not?
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:09.140]   I'm trying to get a sense of how big that lens space is,
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:09.460]   facey.
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:12.100]   Is it bigger than a waffle or smaller than a waffle?
[01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:13.900]   It's smaller than a waffle.
[01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:14.780]   It depends on the waffle.
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:16.260]   Is it the same size as the old Nest Cam?
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:17.100]   Because it looks bigger.
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:18.780]   But I think that's just an artifact of it.
[01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:19.860]   No, no, it really--
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:22.220]   I think it's bigger than the original Nest Cam.
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:24.180]   So this is an indoor outdoor cam.
[01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:24.860]   OK.
[01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:28.660]   So here's the kachunk.
[01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:28.940]   I know.
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:29.860]   I love that, Matt.
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:30.980]   The stolen.
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:33.380]   How does it not get stolen?
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:35.740]   Well, you've got a video of somebody stealing it, basically.
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:36.420]   Yeah.
[01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:38.100]   I mean, people could steal it.
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:39.780]   If they wanted to, they'd just steal this part.
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:41.900]   But then they wouldn't have all kinds of other things
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:42.300]   they need.
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:43.380]   And you'd have video of it.
[01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:43.740]   Yeah.
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:45.780]   They'd be in your yard doing it.
[01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:50.380]   You could also just knock it down from the side.
[01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:51.380]   You know, I thought about--
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:52.220]   Oh, no, no, no, Jeff.
[01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:54.060]   If somebody were going to invade my home,
[01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:55.780]   they could go around and unplug it.
[01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:58.540]   Although now with a battery, that wouldn't work so well.
[01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:00.140]   Or they could knock it down.
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:03.100]   I put them pretty high so they're not easily reached.
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:03.980]   Yeah, it's going to be a hurt.
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:05.140]   You don't have to have too high with the battery ones,
[01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:06.100]   because then you've got to recharge.
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.020]   Yeah, no, no, that's why.
[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:10.500]   Yeah, but I know the old ones that would be plugged in.
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:15.020]   Yeah, this truck would be the same design that was not attached.
[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:16.020]   And some magnet.
[01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:17.380]   No, that's my magnet.
[01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:19.980]   It makes it much easier for you to--
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:20.980]   Position.
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:22.820]   Attach it to things in position.
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:24.260]   So you just have to--
[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:25.260]   Yeah.
[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:27.620]   And there's a mounting plate, but I don't have that on it right now.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:28.740]   I used to be--
[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:29.220]   Yeah.
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:31.100]   I used to be one of those guys.
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:34.500]   Camera just makes you paranoid.
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.060]   And then I just got some for review.
[01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:37.100]   And now I have them everywhere.
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:40.540]   I really like being able to look and see what's going on.
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:43.700]   Mostly it's to see what the cats are up to, stuff like that.
[01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:49.340]   I want to see the bird that knocks on the wood on my house.
[01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:50.540]   Oh, this would be good for that.
[01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:51.260]   Just stick it up.
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:52.820]   Hi.
[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:54.700]   And you can always put them inside.
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:58.180]   I found the app experience a little slow.
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:01.900]   I found the actual design of the app a little weird.
[01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:03.460]   Like, you've got your history.
[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:04.380]   You've got your live view.
[01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:05.420]   You've got the current view.
[01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:07.420]   And then you have to--
[01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:10.700]   it's not exactly as intuitive as I'd like it to be.
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:15.780]   I thought actually seeing the camera to my Google displays
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:17.020]   was actually super fast.
[01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:19.660]   It was like two to three seconds.
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:23.060]   And yeah.
[01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:29.140]   How quickly does the notification come right away
[01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:31.900]   if somebody comes up to the camera or whatever?
[01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:33.300]   Is it pretty quick?
[01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:34.700]   Like, if you turned on the--
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.820]   if you got an notification and immediately went to the camera,
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:40.060]   would you see that in process?
[01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:43.100]   So here we'll sit because it's not on right now.
[01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:45.980]   I'll do OK, I'm motioning the camera.
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:47.100]   Now it just turned on.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:49.940]   Yeah.
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:51.980]   And it's confused.
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:52.780]   Now I stopped.
[01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:57.420]   And I'm not getting a notification.
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:58.540]   Oh, it's because it's not a person.
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:31:58.860]   Hold on.
[01:31:58.860 --> 01:31:59.360]   Sorry.
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:00.100]   I have a different setting.
[01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.780]   You're not a person?
[01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:02.140]   All this time.
[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:03.340]   Well, it only saw my hand.
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:05.340]   It doesn't know that I'm a person.
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:07.020]   Boy.
[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:07.540]   She's a mom.
[01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:08.660]   I'm the Tesla bot.
[01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:09.340]   OK, here we go.
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:10.060]   I'm going to tell it.
[01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:11.940]   It's a person.
[01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:12.440]   We.
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:18.340]   Let's see if that worked.
[01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:20.860]   When I was testing it in life, I was actually
[01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:22.980]   walking in front of it as opposed to just doing this thing.
[01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:25.020]   So this is not the most accurate test.
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:26.420]   OK, it's not giving me anything.
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:29.180]   It doesn't recognize me as a person at this moment.
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:31.740]   But it was--
[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:33.100]   Can you see yourself in a mirror?
[01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:36.460]   Stacy, we've wondered.
[01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:37.300]   I'm just looking--
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:38.460]   And I can eat garlic.
[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:40.100]   I'm looking at my front yard.
[01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:42.100]   I just saw somebody walking in my front yard
[01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:44.580]   and just checking to see, get sound.
[01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:45.540]   You can talk to them.
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:46.060]   It's nice.
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:46.580]   I like it.
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:47.940]   I'm a fan.
[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:49.060]   You can have zones.
[01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:50.460]   You don't get notifications.
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:51.620]   Like for this is a good example.
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:53.180]   This is the street that goes by the house.
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:55.140]   I don't want notifications to be able to drive by.
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:57.980]   But if somebody's in my drive, I want a notification.
[01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:00.220]   And in fact, they even have different notifications
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:01.380]   to do different parts of the driveway.
[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:01.900]   I like it.
[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:03.980]   Now this is the old one.
[01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:07.500]   I presume the new one's even better.
[01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:08.860]   I don't know if you should--
[01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:11.580]   I mean, I get frustrated by the subscription fees
[01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:12.500]   and all of that.
[01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:15.060]   They've fixed that a little bit because you get one now, one
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:15.580]   fee.
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:17.100]   And I have many cameras.
[01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:18.860]   And you just get one giant fee.
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:21.260]   This is where the cats usually walk around.
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:22.260]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:23.260]   Yeah, it's a backyard.
[01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:25.020]   Oh, that's so pretty.
[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:26.700]   You have a nice backyard, my friend.
[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:27.180]   Yeah.
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:28.500]   Well, you can't do anything on that hill.
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:29.100]   It's too steep.
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:31.500]   But you can look at it.
[01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:33.940]   And then actually, this camera was the first one we got
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:36.100]   because right there is our neighbor who used to come down
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:37.380]   here and kill these trees.
[01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:41.300]   So I want to make sure I had a video record of the guy--
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:43.140]   Why did he kill those trees?
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:45.860]   I think they thought they were blocking his view or something.
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:47.260]   I don't know.
[01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:49.500]   But we didn't know it was him.
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:50.380]   So I wanted a camera.
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:53.460]   But somebody stripped the bark off in a strategic fashion
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:55.700]   on some of these trees up here.
[01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:58.180]   And we figured, well, what else, right?
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:00.220]   Did you stop them?
[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:04.020]   Yeah, we stopped them.
[01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:06.780]   Let's say Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson stopped them.
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:08.740]   Shall we put it that way?
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:11.260]   We live in Wild West.
[01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:13.300]   Wild West.
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:15.860]   You threatened your neighbor with a gun?
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:18.100]   I didn't actually threaten him with a gun.
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:21.500]   Lisa said, I have a gun.
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:25.780]   She kind of not afraid to use it.
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:26.740]   OK.
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:27.140]   You know what?
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:29.420]   It's not the first time our neighbor said, oh, yeah,
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:30.660]   we had to call the sheriff on him.
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:34.380]   He kept coming onto our land, too.
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:37.340]   This is why Leo has that hat station.
[01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:38.980]   It keeps us going, too.
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:40.580]   I am ready.
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:41.380]   Where my heck?
[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:42.620]   Oh, here it is.
[01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:43.620]   Yeah.
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:45.020]   Let's try it this way.
[01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:49.700]   There's a new sheriff in town.
[01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:52.700]   Sing a load of my little friends, Smith and Wesson.
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:57.020]   What else?
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:35:00.300]   You said you had two things, Stace.
[01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:01.260]   No, that was the doorbell.
[01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:03.140]   The other one is-- so the camera and the doorbell.
[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:04.300]   The doorbell, yeah.
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:05.420]   We have the doorbell, too.
[01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:06.260]   Yeah.
[01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:07.020]   I like-- I like--
[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:07.540]   I like--
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:09.020]   I like knowing what's going on.
[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:10.980]   And it's not because we have any intruders.
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:12.060]   We're kind of in a--
[01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:13.060]   I think it's pretty quiet.
[01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:13.660]   It's pretty quiet.
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:14.220]   It's a private.
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:15.060]   Yeah.
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:15.580]   It is.
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:16.620]   Yeah, the doorbell's real nice.
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:18.380]   It's got a nice field of view.
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:19.380]   It's pretty wide.
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.060]   It's very tall.
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:21.020]   Yeah.
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:21.980]   Yeah.
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:25.380]   So it gets the top of my head down to the packages,
[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:26.380]   which is really nice.
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:28.540]   And the new setting that's new here
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:31.780]   is that it will tell you that, oh, I see a package.
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:33.460]   And then I'll get a notification.
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:35.340]   It's like, hey, the package has been removed.
[01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:38.380]   And I'm like, oh, how did that happen?
[01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:39.340]   And then I could have--
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:40.340]   Go to the tape.
[01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:41.860]   Go to the tape.
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:44.540]   And we all won't go outside our homes anymore.
[01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:46.340]   And we just stare at each other with our cameras.
[01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:46.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:48.340]   And it's safer that way.
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:50.060]   Yeah.
[01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:51.900]   By the way, Sundar Pichai was at the White House
[01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:54.420]   apparently today.
[01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:56.100]   Those words used to scare me, but no more.
[01:35:56.100 --> 01:35:56.980]   This just in.
[01:35:56.980 --> 01:35:57.780]   Yeah.
[01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:00.140]   I think it's kind of a non-meeting just
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:03.700]   to talk about how we can make the cyber safer.
[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:06.140]   I don't know how much Sundar has to say.
[01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:07.700]   He said, apparently, Google announced
[01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:10.380]   it's committing $10 billion over the next five years
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:13.420]   to strengthen and advance cybersecurity.
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:14.940]   Whatever that is.
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:16.580]   They spent a lot of money, I'm sure.
[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:17.020]   Oh, no, no.
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:19.700]   Go read the book that I sent last week's recommendation.
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:21.580]   Once you read that, you'll be like, oh, shoot.
[01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:22.300]   We need to.
[01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:24.260]   Oh, I agree.
[01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:26.420]   I'm not saying we don't need to.
[01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:26.900]   Oh, OK.
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:29.580]   I'm like, we should be having these conversations.
[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:31.860]   But a lot of depth, actually.
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:36.300]   I just don't know how much these CEOs and President Biden
[01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:37.740]   are going to be able to do.
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:42.100]   But I guess committing $10 billion is probably a good idea.
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:44.020]   They're going to expand zero trust programs,
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:46.020]   help secure the software supply chain.
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:49.500]   Very important, enhancing open source security.
[01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:52.220]   They're also pledging through Google's career certificate
[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:55.300]   program to train 100,000 Americans.
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:58.740]   It feels like IT support and data analytics,
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:01.380]   including data privacy and security.
[01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:02.100]   So good.
[01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:04.620]   Good for Google for doing that.
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:05.500]   They've got the money.
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:08.420]   That's great.
[01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:10.260]   Jeff, do you have a number?
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:10.760]   Yes, I do.
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:13.660]   So last week we talked about how Wendy's was opening up
[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:18.740]   all of these ghost kitchens and the power of real estate
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:19.740]   related to junk food.
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:21.700]   It goes, well, this week, my friend
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:28.700]   Rafaeli's skiff reports that among VC funded startups,
[01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:33.700]   there's a soaring cost, not a rent,
[01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:36.220]   but instead of Airbnb.
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:39.140]   As their leases are expiring, they're getting rid of the rob.
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:41.540]   And they're instead doing meetings
[01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:44.700]   and they're spending money on travel.
[01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:46.020]   Wow.
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:48.820]   And I think it was somebody--
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:50.700]   I forget who now-- argued that this
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:54.500]   is a portend of things to come.
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:57.700]   Real estate business, the disruption, ain't over there,
[01:37:57.700 --> 01:37:59.740]   man, after COVID.
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:02.140]   Who would have thought that it wasn't we work
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:05.100]   that had capitalized on this, but Airbnb?
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:06.780]   Exactly what Skiff says.
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:07.280]   Yes.
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:09.700]   We would have thought that would have been about the workspace.
[01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:10.700]   But no.
[01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:13.020]   Instead, they're going to save a fortune on rent.
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:14.540]   They're canceling leases.
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:16.020]   Why spend all that money?
[01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:17.620]   Yes, we'll get the team together.
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:18.860]   And we'll make it fun.
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:21.220]   Actually, I hated those kinds of events.
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:22.420]   I hated the things we had to be--
[01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:24.580]   they were ready to work, but that's fine.
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:27.780]   If they had a conference table on a little Airbnb
[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:30.580]   on the beach in Hawaii, I would probably be--
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:33.460]   We had stars in Carmel, and that was very nice.
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:34.940]   Yeah.
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:36.060]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:37.020]   What do you mean we?
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:38.820]   You and Andrew had a conference table.
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:40.300]   No, no, no, no, no, like a gigo.
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:40.980]   Oh, gigo.
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:41.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:42.540]   I lost everything.
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:44.940]   When we did the corporate retreats for like fortune,
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:46.940]   they were just in New York and they sucked.
[01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:47.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:48.380]   Oh, they all--
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:51.100]   Mine's not a car but a little bit of a warning.
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:53.380]   I remember when I was a little kid,
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:54.700]   I got lost in the woods.
[01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:56.300]   My sister and I got lost in the woods.
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:39:00.380]   We got very thirsty and it was getting dark.
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:03.580]   And we finally we found a house and we knocked on the door
[01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:05.060]   and we said, help us.
[01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:06.580]   We're lost in the woods.
[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:07.780]   And the lady pointed the phone.
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:11.260]   She said, yeah, just go ahead and use the phone to call police.
[01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:12.260]   And I said, what's the number?
[01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:14.300]   She said, 6, 7, 4, 5.
[01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:16.500]   I thought, well, I've never heard of a four-digit phone
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.100]   number, but I guess it was a small town,
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:20.340]   and that's all you needed.
[01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:22.700]   I've always dialed seven digits.
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:25.260]   3331212.
[01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:29.140]   Well, pretty soon you're going to have to dial 10 digits.
[01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:32.220]   In fact, you should start today getting used to it.
[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:36.660]   FCC is announcing this and it's kind of an interesting reason.
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:39.420]   They want to give the suicide prevention hotline
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:44.220]   a three-digit number, 988.
[01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:46.260]   Easy to remember, easy to connect.
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:47.820]   It will work everywhere.
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:50.940]   But as soon as you do that, it means
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:55.420]   that dialing an extension is going to be 988 and 4 digits
[01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:58.020]   is not going to work in a lot of areas.
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:00.860]   So beginning April 24, it says, you
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:04.340]   should begin to become accustomed to 10-digit dialing.
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:05.740]   Start dialing the area code.
[01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:06.820]   It was over the years.
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:07.420]   I thought we had to.
[01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:08.260]   Well, you might--
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:10.820]   Well, it's because you and I were in places that, yeah.
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:12.700]   Because in Texas, we had to.
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:13.700]   It was national.
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:14.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:15.700]   No, it was New York.
[01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:16.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:17.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:20.220]   Here in Petaluma, you could dial the seven digits.
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:22.220]   You'd get somebody even on your cell phone.
[01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:22.740]   You could.
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:23.340]   It worked fine.
[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:24.340]   How you got the party line, too.
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:26.620]   Wow.
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:30.020]   I didn't realize you city slickers had it different.
[01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:33.620]   However, you should start dialing 10 digits
[01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:38.380]   because October 24, all consumers must dial 10 digits
[01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:41.380]   for all local calls.
[01:40:41.380 --> 01:40:42.860]   On and after the state, local calls
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:45.180]   dialed with only seven digits may not be completed.
[01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:47.740]   A recording will inform you your call cannot be completed
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:48.620]   as dialed.
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:49.620]   We've heard that.
[01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:52.740]   You have to hang up and dial again using the area code.
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:55.900]   And then the 988 number isn't going to actually
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:59.620]   be in effect till next year, July 16, 2022.
[01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:00.540]   So--
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:03.060]   Is it possible to put things in your phone book
[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:05.180]   with only the seven digits?
[01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:06.740]   Yeah.
[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:07.180]   Really?
[01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:07.980]   Yeah.
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:09.620]   Because I was going to say that means you
[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:11.020]   have to have to reprogram your contacts.
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:13.020]   For the contacts, I don't have that.
[01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:13.620]   You're right.
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:14.980]   Well, the other weird thing about this
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:16.620]   is that we're already having cell phones
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:18.620]   and people moving around area codes
[01:41:18.620 --> 01:41:21.620]   to be meaningless for a long time.
[01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:22.220]   Yeah.
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:25.660]   So now, basically, every phone number is a 10 digit number.
[01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:27.500]   Now, I don't know if this is everywhere.
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:29.380]   The FCC acts like it is.
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:31.860]   These are the 82 area codes that currently
[01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:34.380]   permit seven digit dialing.
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:37.340]   But they also use 988 apparently as a central office code.
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:39.380]   And that's why they have to change.
[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:42.380]   And so I see California 707 is in that.
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:43.900]   That's our area code.
[01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:45.500]   But in many states--
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:47.220]   Welcome to the future.
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:49.980]   You guys have been dialing 10 digits all this time,
[01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:53.020]   and you didn't tell me?
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:53.900]   Well, yeah.
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:55.740]   Very--
[01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:56.820]   I didn't know about this.
[01:41:56.820 --> 01:41:59.700]   I feel like this is going to be very poorly understood
[01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:02.100]   for it to show up in October 24th.
[01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:03.100]   Why am I not seeing more stories?
[01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:04.860]   It's a public service announcement
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:07.380]   from Leo Laporte in the Twit Network.
[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:08.060]   John Lee.
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:10.580]   Ha.
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:11.540]   You're going to--
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:13.500]   Yeah.
[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:16.260]   So Phoenix Warp 1 says, I never dialed in any more
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:19.140]   than seven numbers, and I live in New Jersey.
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:21.260]   Let me see if New Jersey is on the list as it is.
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:24.260]   In the 856 and 908 area code only, however.
[01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:25.580]   908, that's mine.
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:27.100]   Well, guess what?
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:28.900]   You didn't have to dial 10 digits, but now you do.
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:30.540]   All those wasted digits.
[01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:32.460]   All those wasted digits.
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:35.900]   Hey, thank god we got to push button dialing.
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:39.260]   You didn't have to go ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch,
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:40.780]   that was slow.
[01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:42.340]   Sorry, Stace?
[01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:42.740]   Oh, no.
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:44.900]   I was going to say, if you tried to call anyone in New York,
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:46.620]   though, you would have had to do it regardless.
[01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:47.260]   That's right.
[01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:49.100]   2, 1, 2, 7, 1, 8, or 7, 8, well--
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:51.780]   Well, I think of myself as being in New York at all times.
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:52.580]   Right.
[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:54.500]   In New York, the area codes 5 once--
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:56.500]   You embody that--
[01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:57.340]   He is in New York.
[01:42:57.340 --> 01:42:58.340]   He's in New York.
[01:42:58.340 --> 01:42:59.340]   He's in New York.
[01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:01.780]   I was going to say, you embody the New York mindset, Jeff.
[01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:02.820]   Don't worry.
[01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:04.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:07.460]   Pace-- what was that?
[01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:09.060]   Pace taco sauce?
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:11.900]   Is the guy-- the cow--
[01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:12.660]   Oh, pace--
[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:13.500]   The carte sauce?
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:16.540]   Pace picante sauce, the guy's looking at the taco sauce,
[01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:19.540]   and he says, it's made in New York City.
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:21.460]   Remember that?
[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:23.060]   Get a rope.
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:25.220]   Get a rope.
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:26.620]   And of course, you know what that means.
[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:28.020]   It's made by Jewish people.
[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:30.860]   I think that's what he meant.
[01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:33.020]   I always hear that when they say New York City.
[01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:34.580]   He's a little too New York.
[01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:35.660]   I always hear that.
[01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:36.220]   Yeah.
[01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:38.980]   He's a little too Jewish, really.
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:40.100]   I should take this hat off.
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:41.180]   It's affecting me.
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:42.980]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:44.100]   We're done.
[01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:45.140]   I want to thank you.
[01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:46.420]   I want to get to see my father.
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:47.540]   I got to do a whole show.
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:48.620]   I'm going to take you right back.
[01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:50.580]   Why don't you have enough time to spend time with dad
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:51.900]   and the fam?
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:54.540]   Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com.
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:57.140]   But he's really better known as the guy who,
[01:43:57.140 --> 01:44:00.300]   Frank Sinatra, called a bum.
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:01.540]   What did Bill Cosby call you?
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:05.740]   I don't--
[01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:07.700]   Ray Crock called him a nickel millionaire.
[01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:09.780]   I know that.
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:12.340]   He was once asked to appear on the Oprah Winfrey show.
[01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:13.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:14.580]   And refused.
[01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:16.140]   And refused.
[01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:18.220]   Just off my publicist.
[01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:18.860]   Yeah.
[01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:21.020]   Why did you refuse?
[01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:23.900]   Because she wanted to brag about how she'd seen the light.
[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:26.860]   And I argued that she had actually ruined daytime TV
[01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:28.100]   and turned it into trash TV.
[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:29.820]   And I wasn't going to be part of her--
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:31.220]   Oh, wow.
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:33.780]   Jeff Jarvis called Oprah Trash.
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:34.660]   And that's--
[01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:35.380]   --the new headline.
[01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:35.900]   That's ballsy.
[01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:39.820]   I mean, she's the goddess of the queen of television.
[01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:41.780]   She trashed up TV.
[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:43.380]   And then she thought better of it.
[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:44.340]   You get with that credit.
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:46.980]   But she was trying to claim--
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:48.620]   She was like Andrew Carnegie.
[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:50.060]   Kind of, yeah.
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:50.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:54.140]   Kind of refurbishing the old reputation.
[01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:55.260]   Oh, the hat's back on.
[01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:56.620]   Oh, dear.
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:57.540]   He's awesome.
[01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:58.700]   It just jumped on my head.
[01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:00.100]   I don't understand how.
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:01.780]   He's also the director of the townite center
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:04.380]   for entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig Newmark
[01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:05.580]   Graduate School.
[01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:08.540]   Newmark graduate school of journalism.
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:10.460]   I just have decided not to do it without Andrew.
[01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:11.700]   It's covering me.
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:13.220]   Yeah.
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:15.260]   The Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:20.060]   at the City University of New York.
[01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:23.100]   Have you been going back to the city to work?
[01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:24.900]   I've been once, and I'm going.
[01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:26.660]   I'm teaching Monday.
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:27.860]   Nice.
[01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:29.220]   I love New York.
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:31.660]   I miss it.
[01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:32.220]   Thank you, Stair.
[01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:34.100]   I also love the Pacific Northwest.
[01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:35.860]   You know, Lisa and I are thinking about moving,
[01:45:35.860 --> 01:45:37.820]   as I told you, to Hat Island.
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:38.660]   That's why I got that.
[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:39.660]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:40.420]   Hat Island.
[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:43.060]   Can't wait.
[01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:45.380]   Stacey, you get a boat and you can come visit me.
[01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:46.100]   I know.
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:49.100]   Fairly the only way to get on or off that island.
[01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:50.060]   Stacey, you can put--
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:50.540]   Get more planes.
[01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:51.860]   Or plane.
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:55.020]   Maybe I'll get me a plane then.
[01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:57.260]   Stacey is at staceyniot.com.
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:59.980]   That's where you can subscribe to her newsletter.
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:03.020]   You can also listen to her great podcast with Kevin Tofol
[01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:06.460]   called the IoT podcast.
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.620]   Any events coming up soon?
[01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:11.380]   I was supposed to have it ready for today,
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:16.380]   but there is an event coming up on RF sensing, future sensing
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:18.020]   things using RF technology.
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:19.500]   It will be September 21st.
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:22.100]   It's virtual and it's going to be awesome.
[01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:25.380]   So if you go to staceyniot.com, it's not there yet,
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:28.180]   but it will be up there soon under the events tab.
[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:30.460]   And you can participate in all your events are free,
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:32.340]   which is nice, right?
[01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:32.860]   It is.
[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:34.300]   Except for the ones you can tell us about,
[01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:36.700]   because they're not free.
[01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:37.700]   Yeah.
[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:40.060]   Those are called private parties.
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:42.180]   Private parties.
[01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:44.060]   Private parties.
[01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:45.500]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:48.300]   We do this week in Google on a Wednesday afternoon,
[01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:51.980]   right about 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2100 UTC.
[01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:56.780]   You can tune in and watch us do it live at twit.tv/live.
[01:46:56.780 --> 01:46:59.420]   You can also chat with us live if you're watching live
[01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:01.180]   at irc.twit.tv.
[01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:03.820]   Club Twit members get their own chat room.
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:05.660]   It's easy to become a club twit member.
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:06.860]   All it takes is $7 a month.
[01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:09.300]   You get ad-free versions of all of our shows,
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:13.060]   access to our Discord server, which is a heck of a lot of fun.
[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:14.620]   You can also--
[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:17.100]   it really is cool with the animated GIFs and everything.
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:18.180]   And you can also--
[01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:18.580]   And I'm--
[01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:19.180]   And I'm--
[01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:19.680]   And I'm a--
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:21.140]   And I'm a community manager.
[01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:22.500]   Postmaster.
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:23.780]   That's right.
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:25.460]   He's awesome.
[01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:28.380]   And you can also get the Twit Plus feed,
[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:31.300]   which has all the stuff we thought was too controversial
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:32.820]   to cut out of the--
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:33.500]   leaving the show.
[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:35.780]   And you get all that because we trust you.
[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:36.260]   All of that.
[01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:37.100]   Twit that--
[01:47:37.100 --> 01:47:37.940]   I can say dirty words.
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:38.980]   It'll become a special thing.
[01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:40.180]   You can say dirty words--
[01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:41.180]   Or words.
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:42.380]   --on the club twit feed.
[01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:43.380]   Watch out.
[01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:44.300]   Watch out, editors.
[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:45.300]   I'm coming.
[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:47.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:47.580]   What?
[01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:48.540]   Sunday.
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:50.620]   We'll just do a show on club twit.
[01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:52.780]   It's just Jeff swearing.
[01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:53.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:54.460]   Yeah.
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:55.980]   Ad-a-cling they had a context.
[01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:57.540]   Just swearing up a storm.
[01:47:57.540 --> 01:47:58.180]   That'd be good.
[01:47:58.180 --> 01:47:59.020]   I like it.
[01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:00.500]   Should I start right now?
[01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:01.500]   No.
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:02.300]   No.
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:02.780]   Not yet.
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:04.340]   We got to get the button ready.
[01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:05.180]   [BLEEP]
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:06.180]   That's bad.
[01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:07.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:12.020]   Sorry, I'm not even at it.
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:15.180]   If you really want to have some fun,
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:17.780]   turn on the Samuel L. Jackson personality
[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:20.180]   in your Amazon Echo.
[01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:22.540]   I think it's $5, but you can put it on all your echoes
[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:23.380]   once you do that.
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:28.500]   And then say, Samuel, why do you swear so much?
[01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:30.540]   And he swears up a storm.
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:32.340]   It's good.
[01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:34.900]   We'll play it for you after the show's over.
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:35.740]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:37.060]   Have a great week.
[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:39.300]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:40.420]   Bye-bye.
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:41.580]   Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:44.860]   I am Ant Perwood, and I want to tell you about my show,
[01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:48.060]   Hands on Photography Here on Twit TV.
[01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:50.860]   Each and every week, Thursday, that is.
[01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:53.420]   I'd like to sit down and share with you the best tips
[01:48:53.420 --> 01:48:55.620]   and tricks that are going to help make you a better
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:56.620]   photographer.
[01:48:56.620 --> 01:48:58.620]   And it's not always about Photoshop.
[01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:02.140]   It's not always about just having the biggest and baddest
[01:49:02.140 --> 01:49:03.500]   and bestest camera.
[01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:07.500]   It can be the simplest of things like leave your eye open
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:09.700]   when you're looking through the viewfinder.
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:11.740]   All of these simple tips can really help
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:13.100]   step your photography game up.
[01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:17.020]   So subscribe to the show today as Twit.tv/hop,
