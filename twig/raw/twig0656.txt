[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Stacey's here. Jeff's here.
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.600]   And Pruitt's here. We will talk about the Lapsis extortion group.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.160]   They've hacked NVIDIA and Samsung, Microsoft, Octa.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.320]   And apparently it's a 16-year-old living in his mother's house in Oxford, England.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.160]   We'll also say goodbye to a couple of computer pioneers.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.880]   Take a look at South by Southwest and Stacey has a review of the new ERO Pro 6E.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.800]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.800]   On Twig.

[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:54.640]   Show me cover the latest news from the Googleverse with Stacey Higginbotham of StaceyOnIOT.com.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640]   Hello Stacey.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.640]   Hello y'all.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.360]   You're wearing a lovely scarf and a configured in a stylish fashion.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.000]   It looks a little funny right now.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.760]   It looks a little upstaging us in many ways.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.760]   It looks good.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.760]   No, it looks great.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.760]   There we go.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.640]   Thank you, Miss Marple.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.000]   Also with us.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.720]   Only Jeff got that one.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.720]   Also with his app.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.720]   Pro detention.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.720]   Oh yeah, I did get it.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.080]   I used to read Ellery Queen.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.400]   Oh yeah.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.800]   I think it was Agatha Christie but close.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.960]   Anthony Pruitt is here from Hands On Photography.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.720]   He's got his granny glasses on too.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.720]   Can't see you today.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.720]   Nice.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.720]   Don't know why.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.720]   Did you get your pupils dilated?
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.960]   No, just some days I wake up and I'm like, I can't see.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.960]   I know what it is.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.960]   It's allergies.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.960]   It's a peak allergy.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.960]   Oh, it is.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.960]   It is.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.960]   It is.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.960]   Ring again.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.960]   Spring is here.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.280]   As somebody said on Reddit, enjoy the green hills.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.600]   They'll be deathly brown in about eight weeks.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.240]   They're looking like they're dying.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.120]   Also with us the Leonard Taop Professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig New York
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.400]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York, the Evertuneville.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.200]   Jeff Jarvis, hello Jeff.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   Hello, hello, hello.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   How are you?
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   Hello, hello, hello.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.920]   I bring sad tidings.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.560]   Today at one o'clock, just an hour ago, we learned of the passing of the man who quits
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.480]   and created the GIF.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.800]   And you know what?
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.120]   I'm going to call it the GIF in his honor.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.440]   Here is a tribute.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.600]   He, Steve Willhite won a lifetime achievement award from the Webbies a couple of years
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.600]   ago.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:52.160]   Here is David Carp of Tumblr to present that award with a look back at some famous GIFs.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.600]   There's a peanut butter jelly time, the dancing baby from Ally McPeal.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.640]   See if you can identify all of them.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   Everybody's website had the under construction GIF, Netscape, American flag, tomatoes.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.560]   I don't know what that is.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.440]   Crying guy, baby with an ice cream cone.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.200]   The mascot that falls on his face, Orson Welles applauding, instead is in cane that
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   deal with it dog.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.120]   I don't know what to call that.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.120]   He's David Robbins getting stisted up.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.880]   These are so many famous animated GIFs.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.720]   The GIF does not inherently animate it.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.400]   It can be a still image and was often used on the Web as a still image.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.040]   But it was, I remember, I'll never forget I was seeing my first animated GIF and Netscape
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.560]   Navigator when it first came out.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.840]   I had that rotating compass.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.840]   There he is.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.840]   Stephen Willhite.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.080]   He's going to get up below his speech because he says something pretty important.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.680]   Here's Webby for lifetime achievement.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.680]   It's David Clark.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.680]   Steve Willhite.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.320]   I thought he's so young.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.320]   What year was this?
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.400]   I think it's two years to come, believe it or not.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   I don't think it's two one.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.400]   No way.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.440]   No, you think it's a Willhite passed away earlier today of COVID.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.440]   Complications for COVID.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.440]   The years are 74.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.440]   Oh, no.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.440]   I know.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.440]   Still.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.440]   People wear your damn masks around.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.440]   Yeah, get your boosters.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.800]   Oh, oh, so you lose.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.480]   And I have one of those spring awards as well.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.120]   Springy little hippies.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.480]   What is...
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:28.040]   Standing O from a crowd who never knew a world without a GIF.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.040]   Right.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.040]   He's got five words.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.240]   Instead of speaking as five words tonight, Steve is using his own invention to accept
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.320]   his award.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.400]   It's pronounced GIF.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.400]   Yes.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   Not GIF.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   Yes.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   You tell it.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   For those who don't know, that was a tradition.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:58.600]   It still is, I guess, at the Webby Awards you get five.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.080]   It's a short acceptance speech.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.640]   You get five words.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.640]   That's awesome.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.280]   It's pronounced GIF, not GIF.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.280]   That's very funny.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.280]   Very funny.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.280]   Anyway...
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.880]   For the day, I too will say GIF.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.080]   Are you a hard G kind of guy?
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.080]   Oh, God, yes.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.400]   I am too, and I don't know why, but he did in fact very famously what you saw.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   It's a graphical thing.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.920]   Yeah, it's a graphic interchange format.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.080]   But you know what?
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.080]   This is his day.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.080]   This is his day.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.800]   What else did he do?
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.800]   Not much.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.720]   Oh, that was enough.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.240]   Actually, that was...
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.240]   Me and Lucas...
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.240]   Twenty-thousand.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   Twenty-thirteen.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.240]   Yeah, I was going to say.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.240]   Yeah, right.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.400]   More than we did.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.400]   That was twenty-thirteen.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.200]   That was nine years ago.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   That makes a lot more sense.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.480]   Yeah, it does.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.640]   And it was created for CompuServe.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.120]   He worked at CompuServe.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:03.840]   And actually, the interesting story here is he did it in his spare time and didn't bring
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:10.520]   it into CompuServe until he had gotten it just so.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.560]   And now you can easily create them on your weak little smartphones.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.680]   Although, as I said, the gifts originally were not necessarily animated.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:26.280]   It was just a compressed format, graphics interchange format.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.080]   But it was very important to the development of the web.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.400]   And CompuServe and all the online services because they were very small, very compressed.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.320]   And so you could get a very tiny little thing.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.920]   Little thing to speed up those load times.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.920]   I wonder if I can find.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.920]   74.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:51.320]   Yeah, 74 left his wife behind and she asked everybody to say "Jeff."
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.720]   And it's like, "That's what's up."
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.080]   As I remember, it was not an unencumbered format.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:08.040]   I think Spary Univac, remember that, Jeff, owned the compression algorithm.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.200]   Yes, I've been so.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.400]   There was an issue because they had the patent.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.360]   And so for Unisys, rather, had it, well, it was Spary Univac before it was Unisys.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:29.560]   So when Wilhite released it in 1987, it was used legitimately sort of, but there was a
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:34.040]   controversy over the licensing agreement between Unisys and CompuServe.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.040]   And that's why Ping arose in 1994.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.040]   Oh.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.200]   Seven years later, Ping was a replacement for Jeff.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.760]   In fact, a much improved replacement for Jeff.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.840]   I'm reading right now, "Bamboozled at the Revolution."
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.840]   Oh, I want to read that.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.760]   John Bonavoli, he's 10 years old.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.760]   But it's about media companies, utterly screwing up the internet.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.760]   Not knowing what to do.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.040]   And stories, some stories that I'm not in it, but I was involved in some of these stories
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:09.000]   like when Timing and cutting ass wanted to buy Alton Vista, Pathfinder, all these things.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.720]   But it was the time that the Coquiserve and Prodigy had AOL and everybody guessing which
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.080]   one of those was going to win.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.160]   Yeah, we didn't know, did we?
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.880]   Google didn't exist yet.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.360]   The first Jeff I saw was, as I mentioned, I was blown away.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.760]   I remember vividly seeing it in, I think, in 1994 with Netscape Navigator browser, the
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.240]   web was static, static stills, and this compass, the points on the compass were moving.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.640]   And I was, I remember my jaw dropping.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.320]   I was so stupid.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.000]   I remember they did that at one of the Kanye Nets sites we started and our pages were
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   too slow.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.720]   And I said, "Well, that animated thing is constantly using bandwidth."
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.720]   They said, "No, Jeff."
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.720]   No, it's not.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.720]   I like that.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.720]   Wow.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.720]   Wow.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.320]   Well, but you weren't wrong, in order to do it, they had to download all the frames.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.320]   So gifts could be...
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.920]   It's going to be quite big because you had to download the whole thing and then it animated
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.480]   it by going through, cycling through the frames.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.440]   Anyway, that's how we begin the show.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.440]   Farewell to Mr. Wilhite.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.440]   Thank you.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.440]   And thank you.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.520]   I think you still see GIFs everywhere.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.760]   Oh, God, yeah.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.840]   The UNICEF patent expired and so didn't have to be PINGS.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:28.760]   PINGS support animations, but these are all animated GIFs on the...
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.760]   What would Discord be without them?
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.760]   Or Slack?
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.760]   Or Twitter and...
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:39.200]   Oh, my God, there's my head being shaved.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.000]   I send them to my family via my phone.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.880]   The family communication is usually in GIFs.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:49.880]   Here's a question.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.880]   Google, are the Google animated thumbs and all those...
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.400]   Are those GIFs too, I wonder?
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400]   Or are they using...
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.960]   Probably more more.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:03.040]   They're emojis, they're gifts, they're stickers, and those animated things.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.040]   What are those called?
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.200]   Well, I mean, they may...
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.400]   I'm just asking what the background technology is if it's GIF-y enough.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.040]   It's really hard to say GIF.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.040]   It is.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.040]   It's really hard.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.040]   I'm impressed you can.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.040]   I can't...
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.080]   No, I'm glad to hear you say it because I've never said it the other way.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.080]   But then they can.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.720]   Every time I'm around smart folks like you...
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.520]   No, there's no right.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.400]   If we're going to say it, there's a right way to say it.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.800]   We're going to give Steve Willite the pride of telling us how you say it.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   I'm not quite...
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   I don't know what he said.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   It doesn't matter to him anymore.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.840]   Ooh, it mattered to him when he was alive.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.840]   So cold, stage cold.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.840]   She is harsh.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.840]   Wow.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.840]   That's when you should have said it.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.840]   He did.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.840]   Over and over.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.840]   And did we ignore him?
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.840]   No, that's...
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.840]   Yes.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.840]   That's when you should have said it.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.840]   Not now when it doesn't.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.840]   I mean...
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.840]   Sorry.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.840]   I'm not cold.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.840]   It's just realistic.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.480]   I love that.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.480]   Ahhh...
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:00.240]   Boy, the Lapsus gang has been very busy.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.440]   The Laxus extortion group...
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:11.560]   They hacked Microsoft, leaked out 36 gigabytes of source code for Windows, for Cortana, and
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.560]   for Bing.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.560]   Who wants it?
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.560]   No, he wants it.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.560]   Right there.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.400]   They're all big.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.320]   And now they've breached something called Octa.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.480]   And anybody who's done Enterprise Security or IT knows Octa very well.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.120]   It's used as a second form of authentication.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.560]   Putatively, I'll use that word because...
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.160]   I don't know why, because I'm going to show off.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160]   Because you need 50 cents or an hour?
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.160]   50 cents.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.760]   Putatively, it is more secure than a text message.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.720]   Maybe not today.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   Maybe not today.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.400]   The Lapsus digital extortion gang.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.680]   Ahhh, it's been very busy and they published this on their Telegram channel.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:58.920]   Octa says, "Okay, we're not saying they didn't do something, but it was on January 21st, and
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:04.280]   it was one account and we've constrained the damage, and so we probably, you don't have
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.280]   to worry."
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.520]   Can I ask by dumb question of the day?
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.720]   What does releasing the source code of Bing actually do?
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.720]   Nothing is of...
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.160]   So, I mean, obviously, it's a proprietary, right?
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.920]   It's a company secret.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.400]   I mean, it's not like if you got the recipe for Coca-Cola, you could make Coca-Cola.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.960]   It's not like if you got the recipe for Bing, you could make Bing.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.520]   This is more of a bragging right, so look, I got you.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.320]   It's interesting to see.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.120]   Okay, I am on Twitter.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.120]   I'll just be honest.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.960]   But a Bloomberg reporter, William Turton, is saying that he's got a story coming up that
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.840]   he's saying that a 16-year-old living in his mother's house in Oxford, England is suspected
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   to be the mastermind behind many of the hacks conducted by the Hacken Group Lapsis.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.320]   A 16-year-old living in his mom's basement.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.000]   Okay, probably just in his mom's house.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Yeah, she opens up.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.760]   We're going to put him in the basement.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.760]   No, no, no.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.400]   We're sleeping on a cotton basement.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   I guarantee.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.400]   Wow.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.400]   He's 16.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.520]   Well, this is what this reporter is.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.520]   Oh, I believe it.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.520]   As a wild historian.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.520]   I told you.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.520]   What else do they do?
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.520]   What else do this group?
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.120]   Oh, Lapsis has been around.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.520]   So that's interesting because that says it's not, by the way, Russia.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.520]   State actors.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.520]   State actors.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.840]   Turns out any old buddy could do that.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.480]   I first heard their name a couple of weeks ago on security now, and I'm trying to remember
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.400]   what it was.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.120]   They are asking for money.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:44.040]   That's why their name, L.A.P.S.U.S. ends in a dollar sign, which sounds like, to me,
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.520]   honest, something a 16-year-old living in his mom's house might do.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.000]   Oh, by the way, this is clever.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.600]   It's two S's, one's a dollar sign.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.240]   We're not going to be like cash-shapped.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.520]   We're going to put it in.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:05.000]   One of their first victims was the Brazilian Ministry of Health, 50 terabytes worth of
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.600]   data stolen and deleted.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.760]   Among that COVID-19 pandemic information took them a month before they could get their
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.240]   systems up and running in.
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.320]   That's a nice little hack, isn't that sweet?
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:23.360]   In Vidia, Phil claimed to, Phil, victim to a cybersecurity incident attributed to Lapsis
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.880]   last month.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:30.360]   That's the one where they stole a terabyte of data, including employee passwords from
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.360]   NVIDIA.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.000]   Samsung confirmed the data had been breached in an attack, including source code relating
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.400]   to the Galaxy smartphones.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.040]   You know, this is sounding more and more like a 16-year-old who would want the source
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.040]   code.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:47.040]   Why can't we go after these folks and hire them and give them jobs?
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.080]   Well, I bet he gets a job in about four years after he gets out of juvie.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:57.000]   Lapsis also claims to a compromised video game developer, Ubi Soft.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.600]   And the company said, "Yeah, well, we did have to reset passwords across the organization."
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.680]   This is from a ZDNet article today.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:12.520]   Obviously, they don't have the sources our Bloomberg reporter has.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.720]   Not much is known about Lapsis itself other than it's a cyber criminal gang.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.720]   I'm going to put that quote.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.320]   "We need to operate out of South America that hacks into networks of large organizations
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.520]   to steal data and extort payments."
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.520]   Wrong.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.520]   They're pronged.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.520]   "Rong."
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.520]   "Rong."
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.520]   Or Daily City.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:36.080]   They published the information on a telegram channel.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:44.240]   They seem to have a variety of techniques, including phishing emails and exploiting public-facing
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:50.840]   remote desktop protocol installations.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.840]   So who's the guy?
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.840]   It's on Bloomberg.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.840]   I want to see this article.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.360]   His name is William Turton.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.400]   So @WilliamTerton, T-U-R-T-O-N.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.080]   He is a Bloomberg reporter.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.760]   I stuck the tweet online, 17 minutes to this story for you.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.760]   That's hysterical.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.920]   16-year-old living in his mother's house.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.920]   Wow.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.960]   Yeah, I'll look forward to seeing the full story.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.160]   That's quite a scoop.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.160]   Mr. Turton.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.400]   Yeah, I was like, "Okay."
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.400]   "Okay."
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.040]   Of course, it's Bloomberg.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.480]   And didn't they publish some of their other crazy stuff?
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.000]   I don't, you know, I still think Bloomberg's good.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   I do.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.920]   I was like, "Who is this dude?"
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.920]   "Oh, okay."
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.920]   Bloomberg, yeah.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:37.320]   See, despite the super-micro reporting, which they've never changed or retracted, never
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:43.440]   retracted, never proved, but never disproved, I don't think it didn't tarnish them as
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.600]   much as it should have, although you're not alone, Stacey.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.240]   Everybody, when they hear Bloomberg now, a story like this says, "Oh, yeah, super-micro
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.240]   guys, okay."
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:56.080]   Yeah, I'm on Bloomberg because I pay the money for the work.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.080]   I pay.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.800]   I do not see the story yet.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   We'll see.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.800]   Okay.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.800]   Wow.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.800]   What a story.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.800]   Thank you for finding that.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.800]   See, I'm glad you were on Twitter.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.560]   I was just on Twitter.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:17.560]   The reason I was on Twitter was I was pushing my talk to my or my, what's that called, "Help
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.560]   me?"
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.560]   Book Club.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.560]   Book Club.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.560]   I was pushing the book club.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.560]   I saw that Ant had pushed out something.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.560]   Like, please.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.560]   Did you find the John Roach obituaries?
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.560]   Is that what you put?
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.560]   That wasn't.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.560]   Ah, yes.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.560]   I just put that in there.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.760]   So this just in from Twitter.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.960]   I have never heard of this guy, but he was a pioneer of the personal computer.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.600]   John Roach, dead at 83.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.080]   He helped make the home computer ubiquitous, says the New York Times a bit by introducing
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:46.920]   the fully assembled Tandy TRS 80, which was so novel, the time he was like, "You also
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.920]   like you, Leo?"
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.920]   Wow.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.320]   How many cousins you have out here, man?
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.080]   Your DNA is everywhere.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.080]   Good lord.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.080]   Yep.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.360]   There's the next avatar.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.800]   I can't believe all three of you said that at the same time.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   Holy crap.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.800]   It must be true.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:11.400]   That was in 1986 when he was chairman and chief executive of the Tandy Corporation.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.360]   Well, you could look, you scroll down and see what you're going to look like in a few
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.360]   years later.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.360]   Oh boy.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.360]   Actually, that's a good question.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.160]   Yeah, I think that's right.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.760]   I think I look like that now.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.520]   That's actually 2009.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.160]   That's 13 years ago.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.160]   Wow.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.320]   He was, so, you know, when he's the chairman of the company, I'm not sure I give you full
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.960]   credit for our advantage.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.960]   Actually putting it together.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.960]   Yes, if you will.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:40.920]   The TRSAD was beloved by some called the Trash 80 by others.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.600]   $600 through a radio shack.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.400]   It was the first computer for a lot of people listening right now, very, very, very popular.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.240]   I never had one, but my cousin did.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.520]   Yeah, it's like that.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.880]   I wish I'd had one.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.880]   I can't wait over.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.680]   My cousin's has to play with his second.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.720]   And he didn't know what the heck he was doing with it.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.920]   It was a break for the most part.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.200]   I did not have one either.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.200]   All right, so enough people pass away.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.200]   I don't want to.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.200]   They come in threes.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.000]   Who knows who's going next?
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.720]   From your vast experience at Entertainment Weekly, is that true, Jeff?
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.640]   It just seems so because you then go back and think of the two prior deaths.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.120]   And say, oh, they come in threes.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.120]   Right.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.520]   Well, actually, that is the third thing.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.520]   That is the third death.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.520]   Oh, hold on one second.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.520]   I'm back.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.520]   Oh, yes.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.520]   Jeff, don't die.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.520]   You don't need to say he's okay.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.200]   You don't need to make you the third.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.200]   It's okay.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.200]   He could have rich.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.200]   This is the last print edition.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:41.200]   Oh, that just, so it just came out.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.200]   Speaking of death, but Barry Diller.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.200]   There we go.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.200]   There's the third.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.160]   Barry Diller killed it with its with its cover billing.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.640]   Is that JD Lang on the cover?
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.360]   The future of Hollywood.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.000]   Is that was a thing I was rather controversial for me.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Yes.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.640]   Oh, I mean, so the Kenobi one is the last one.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.160]   Oh, so the one on your right hand is the first one.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.160]   That's the first one.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.160]   Oh, okay.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.200]   I was wondering why they were doing a cover story on Katie Lang as they're very last.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   That's not good.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.200]   Episode.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.200]   Okay.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.200]   There you go.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.200]   Star Wars related.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.760]   It's Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.360]   And the future of Hollywood.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.280]   You and McGregor as Obi-Wan.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.360]   Not the only one true, only one.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.360]   Alec Guinness.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.360]   Obi-Wan.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.880]   Goodbye Entertainment Weekly.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.880]   Bye-bye, baby.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.120]   Bye-bye, my baby.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.120]   Mm.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.120]   Hey, you might be interested.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:36.360]   Ron Richards, the host of all about Android, tweeted, got my last issue of Entertainment Weekly
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.040]   today in the mail as someone who subscribed in year one back in 1991.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.440]   I have a lot of emotions.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.880]   Seems fitting the last cover would be Star Wars related.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.320]   Goodbye Entertainment Weekly.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.120]   I'll miss you most of all.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.120]   So Ron.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.640]   Your was issue number two.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.640]   Do you have them all?
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.200]   Tim O'Brien's, the things they carried.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.200]   Oh, that was amazing.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.080]   I was told this was a, I was amazing book, but it was not exactly something.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.880]   They didn't tell me there was something new, Stan.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.000]   I thought it was a subscription only magazine.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.920]   As the circulation director said, it was the only magazine that kind of flashed on the
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.920]   newsstand.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:12.720]   Well, also since it was 1991, we were out of Vietnam.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.760]   So I'm not sure I really understand the headline.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.400]   Why can't we get out of Vietnam?
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.840]   Well, because we can't get out of our heads.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:26.920]   Now call me ignorant, which I'm sure a lot of you do, is this available on newsstands?
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.920]   It was.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:28.920]   Last issue, yes, it is.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.920]   It is.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.920]   I'm going to run out and get it.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.920]   Collectors item.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.920]   I think I'd like to get one.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.600]   I used to get seems like I remember having my hands on an E.W. and I don't remember ever
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.560]   subscribing, but I remember having my hands on one and throwing a couple away here and
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.560]   there.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.080]   But yeah, I would like to have that one.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.080]   I have Star Wars.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.440]   I have her third death.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.880]   Madeline Albright just died.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.880]   Yes.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.880]   You see her?
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.880]   She was.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.880]   I fit in our world.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   Yes, she did.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.360]   She was the first female secretary of state.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.360]   Oh, man.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.360]   84.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.960]   So, I guess we have three, so stop it.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.640]   Knock it off.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.640]   No more.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.520]   No more.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.960]   If you're worried about cyber attacks, you're not alone.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.160]   The president spoke earlier this week saying get ready.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.600]   They're coming this article in New Yorker by Sue Halpern.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.520]   The threat of Russian cyber attacks looms large.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.880]   We had a warning last week from the intelligence community.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:36.440]   This is an extension of the shields up program that was launched when Russia invaded Ukraine
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.160]   back in February.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.000]   This is specifically targeting Satcom.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.520]   And I don't know if you all remember me talking about space force being legit.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:51.760]   This is actually talking about Ukraine had attacked via satellite soon or sorry, Russia
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.600]   had attacked via satellite soon after they invaded.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.920]   This is an extension of that.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:03.960]   So basically CSUN, FBI put out a warning this week and said, we already told all the infrastructure
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:08.600]   people to get ready and make sure that you've got your plans in place.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:15.360]   Now we're doing a specific one for the Satcom industry.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.680]   And they are hearing credible.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.000]   Like beforehand, there weren't really an incredible threat.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.840]   So it's just like get ready, y'all.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.680]   So we assumed that they would do it.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.680]   Two cents in there.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:31.640]   One of the questions everybody's been asking is why haven't they yet really done an all
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.960]   out attack.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:39.000]   And in this article, the author kind of says, well, once you can start dropping bombs,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   a cyber attack isn't, you know, you're just going to drop more bombs.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.360]   They took out, when they took out Viasat right before the invasion that was to take out Ukraine
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:56.200]   internet, but Viasat is used by the military in the United States, as well as the Ukrainian
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.080]   army and number of Western militaries.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:03.080]   The US military says the attack did not affect us.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.640]   They use Viasat for some battle management system.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.480]   So you could see why you would want to take that out before you invaded.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:14.800]   The real question is, though, you know, Russia's been using Ukraine as a testing ground for
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.880]   years, more than a decade.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:24.240]   Why they haven't unleashed the hounds of hacking on Ukraine or on us.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.880]   Biden said I have previously warned about the potential that Russia could conduct malicious
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:35.000]   cyber activity against the US, including as a response to the unprecedented economic costs.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.680]   We've imposed on Russia alongside our allies and partners.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.920]   It's part of Russia's playbook.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:44.600]   Today, my administration is reiterating those warnings based on evolving intelligence that
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.520]   the Russian government is explaining options for potential cyber attacks.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.560]   So yeah, Shes has been saying put your shields up.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.960]   In fact, I saw a tweet that's actually a good tweet this morning saying, okay, you want
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:04.200]   to help the fight against Ukraine, update your routers, secure your systems.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:08.400]   Because a lot of times, that's exactly what happens is normal people like you and me,
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.240]   our routers are vulnerable.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:15.000]   Steve did a whole thing yesterday on security now about micro tick routers, which have updated
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.560]   firmware, but nobody has up door.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.280]   Lots of people have not updated them.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.600]   And they're used in then massive DDoS attacks.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.600]   They're calling.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.920]   Did he have a utility up to check?
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.920]   He did not write a utility, but but his strong suggestion was to anybody, not just somebody
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:33.080]   using a micro tick router, but anybody using a router should check to make sure they have
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.320]   the latest firmware.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.920]   Because if there is a flaw in the router, you could very well be part of attack on the Ukraine
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.880]   or on the US.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:48.400]   Now according to my YouTube history, about three weeks ago, we talked about on Twitter,
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:54.400]   a potential cyber attack from the US on the offensive towards Russia.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.000]   You think we're capable of.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   So it's interesting.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.920]   There's speculation in Halpern's article about why it hasn't happened.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.800]   She quotes a fellow at Hoover Institution who says, if you're already at a stage in a conflict
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.480]   where you're willing to drop bombs, you're going to drop bombs.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.400]   But she says it also may be Russia never had the capability.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.320]   It's adversaries ascribed to it in the first place.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.480]   I'm not sure that's true.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.640]   Or it may be that the Russian generals prosecuting the war are skeptical of relying on weapons
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.360]   composed of zeros or ones.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.320]   I could believe that.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:32.080]   Or that the Russians, and I think this is the most likely, and I think this is what
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.880]   we talked about three weeks ago, trying to replicate their earlier attacks.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:40.280]   But Ukraine's digital defenses, which are much stronger now successfully fended them
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.280]   off.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:49.120]   And I think Stacey Eurey also saying that the attention, the US has pumped, I think,
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:54.480]   18 million dollars so far with a pledge for 30 more into Ukraine's cyber defense.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:59.120]   And we've done much of the same thing with CISA here in the United States.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.440]   I wouldn't be surprised if we just, I think we were talking about this.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:07.080]   We just are maybe a little more hardened than we thought.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.720]   I still wouldn't be complacent.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:13.640]   Well, and I also, I think we have been investing in that.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.200]   There's good news there.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:22.800]   But I also, I made this point a couple of weeks ago, is once Russia does that, especially
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:28.000]   if they do this here in the US, and it causes a loss of life, we're going to treat that
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.080]   like we would a physical attack.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.080]   We will physically enter.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:39.880]   So that may be another reason that although they, I mean, yeah, at this point, it's still
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.880]   going.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.640]   I wouldn't, I wouldn't count on it.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.120]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.480]   We have more uplifting news.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.840]   This has been a grim downer of opening segment.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:57.120]   So we're going to cheer you up with something funny, a more panic, funny tick tock anything
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.560]   you got just, you know, get it ready.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.560]   More death and more.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.560]   Look, tick tock.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:07.240]   Just tell me, tell me what, no, he asked for it.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.240]   I showed it.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.240]   Oh, dear.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.240]   I showed it.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.360]   I brought to you by Code Academy.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.520]   Are you ready to change your career?
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.360]   There's never been a better time to be a programmer.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.640]   They are in high demand right now.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:25.440]   And as a result, are highly paid, great benefits, great jobs out there.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:30.360]   And with Code Academy, you can learn to code on your own terms.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.720]   Over 50 million people already have.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.680]   They already know Code Academy is the best way to learn to code.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.800]   That's because Code Academy not only teaches you job-ready coding skills, but also helps
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.320]   you build unique projects for your portfolio.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.120]   That's really important.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.240]   Companies look at that, say, what have you done?
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.240]   And it's nice.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.720]   And one of the things about coding that's so great is you can do stuff for yourself that
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.920]   still show off your skills and still get credit for it.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.040]   You also can earn certificates at Code Academy.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.680]   That's often very important.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.640]   And they even help you prep for technical interviews.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.000]   That's the thing that always scares me when I think about getting a job as a coder.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.600]   Do I have the interview process?
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.880]   But you'll be ready.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.080]   You'll be prepared.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.760]   I used Code Academy myself because I like learning.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.960]   And it's a really great way to learn.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.600]   I've played with their Python classes.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.680]   What's nice is when you start using Code Academy, you start programming right now.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.680]   You'll get it right away.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.160]   When you're very first lesson, you'll enter code, you'll run it.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.160]   You'll find out what's wrong.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.600]   You'll fix it and it runs.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:36.200]   And I don't know if you ever had this experience, but everybody who codes had that experience
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.920]   that first time when they wrote a program for me, it was 10.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.920]   Print hello.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.240]   Actually, it was more like 10.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.560]   Print Leo is the cool guy.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.560]   And then 20.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.240]   Go to 10 in that infinite loop.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:53.520]   And when it happens, when the computer does what you said it should do, that's a magic
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.520]   moment.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.920]   You can have that magic moment right now.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.920]   You'll learn at your own pace.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.600]   You'll get qualified for in-demand jobs.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.360]   You could choose what to learn from building basic websites to artificial intelligence
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.200]   and everything you could want.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:10.440]   No matter what your experience level, you'll be writing real working code in minutes.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.960]   It's a great feeling.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:17.800]   It really is to sit down, type out some code and say, I got the computer to do something.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:22.800]   Lots of languages, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.400]   If you're not sure where to begin, and I love this, Lisa and I both did this, we took
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.240]   Code Academy's programming personality quiz.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.040]   It's not a test of your programming skills.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.040]   It asks you about how you learn what you like.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.680]   It's kind of like career counseling.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.680]   And it's great.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:44.160]   It's tailored career advice and course recommendations based on your strengths and your interests.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.440]   Lisa, for instance, it was right on.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:52.960]   They said, you should do R. You should do statistics because you've got a head for numbers.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.400]   And they looked at me and they said, you should be a shepherd because you have no.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.400]   They looked at me.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:03.120]   I took the test and they said, I should study computer science, which I'm agree.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.120]   I agree.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.160]   That's what I'm most interested in.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:10.800]   I'm not sure what it will tell you, but take at least do this.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:15.880]   Go to code Academy.com and take the personality quiz.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.240]   It's an interactive program you'll learn by doing.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.560]   You can build your portfolio.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.480]   You'll get the certificate of completion.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.400]   Put that in your LinkedIn, then land your dream job, whether it's in web development
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:30.760]   programming, computer science, data science, or tons more.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.360]   I think Code Academy is the best way to learn.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.920]   Join over 50 million people who agree.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.160]   Learn to code with Code Academy and see where coding can take you.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.840]   I will say this absolutely.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.920]   It is so much fun.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.920]   It's so gratifying.

[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:19.800]   Thank you, Code Academy, for your support of this week in Google.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:27.440]   I guess we should talk about this UK law.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:39.560]   The online safety bill, wrong in so many ways, including jail time potentially, for tech executives.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:44.200]   From Meta, TikTok, and other tech companies would face the prospect of jail time.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:49.240]   This is from Mark D. Stefano and Sylvia Varnum, O'Reagan writing and the information.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:54.040]   Under sweeping new legislation proposed by the UK government, the aim of the bill is to
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.280]   curb illegal and harmful internet content.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.760]   It's called the online safety bill.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:02.520]   It's going to be introduced for a vote tomorrow.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:09.160]   Tech executives will be potentially facing criminal prosecution if they fail to comply
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:13.720]   with decisions made by the regulator in charge of enforcing the law.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:19.480]   This is the worst part of it is that they're told to take down legal but harmful content
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.280]   without the government defining what is harmful.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.160]   If you don't figure out what's harmful, take it down.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.520]   Your rump is in trouble.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:31.640]   They don't have, obviously, the First Amendment, because that would be unconstitutional in
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:37.800]   the United States for the government to tell anybody what they can or cannot say is against
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.520]   the First Amendment.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:45.560]   The provision to include liability for senior management and not just companies has been
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.160]   called the Nick Kleglaw and Downing Street, obviously.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.560]   That's why.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.400]   Let's get Nick.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:58.920]   Nick does not leave a trail of friends behind when he left the government in the UK.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.440]   He is, of course, now a senior vice.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.160]   I think he's a president of global operations at Facebook.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.960]   Apparently, he could be found criminally liable.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:15.640]   Now you'll have to destroy evidence, give false information to the regulator or obstruct
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.960]   officials from entering company offices.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.760]   I doubt Nick will be doing any of that.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.760]   But it is...
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.760]   You'll have someone else do it.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.760]   Yes.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.200]   Well, the UK government hopes to...
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.200]   Of course, got worse.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.520]   Johnson support hopes to pass the law by the end of the year or early next year.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.520]   The online city.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.240]   They just threw in the kitchen sink.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:39.320]   This includes the need for anybody showing pornography to get age verification.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:43.040]   Can we talk about privacy violations and problems and data?
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.360]   Yeah, it's going to go.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:49.720]   Let me tell you the places they're talking about to get age verification include pubs.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.320]   You go down, you're 16 years old.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:57.600]   You go down to your pub to show them your ID so that you have a beer, a pint and some
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.600]   porn.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.760]   Not a good idea.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:10.640]   The safe harbor principle, which is essentially their section 230, also would be rolled back.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.680]   While some of the tougher parts of the legislation and the information rights appear controversial
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:20.040]   in tech circles, yes, the Boris Johnson led government is confident the public largely
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.200]   supports the bill.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.440]   Think of the children.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.400]   It's the same as the hearing going on in Washington right now.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.320]   Be high your authoritarianism behind child court.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.120]   You can do anything.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.720]   Moral panic.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.720]   Okay.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.480]   Well, you know, what are you going to do?
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.720]   They've got the Snoopers charter.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.880]   There's all sorts of stuff going on in the UK.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.720]   I would hope we would be smart enough not to do here.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:48.720]   Let's hope.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.720]   Let's hope.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.720]   I would hope so.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.720]   Let's say also added.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.920]   They added in no cyber flashing.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.920]   What's no that way?
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.440]   What's cyber flashing?
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:02.440]   That is, you know, maybe I shouldn't ask sending a picture of, you know, what person.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.200]   Oh, that's cyber flashing.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.200]   That's a new way of putting it.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.600]   No, it was taking over the world.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   Apparently it is.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.600]   We've got to do something.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:12.160]   Think of the children, but they also buy the favor.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.920]   I would like, I would like actually not to get unsolicited picks.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:17.920]   That's okay.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:18.920]   I mean, I'm for that.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:23.600]   Would you, if somebody were to do that and not anybody I know, would you want them to be
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.520]   thrown in jail?
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:31.200]   Um, I would like the opportunity to press charges and have them.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   Yeah, actually.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.200]   Maybe a sex offender.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.200]   You know what?
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.920]   Keep your penis to yourself.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.480]   Keep it to yourself, buddy.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:42.240]   No one wants to see that.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:49.320]   I'm just saying money laundering and human trafficking are also included.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.080]   Also equally awful.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:01.320]   Having legal but harmful content is the most controversial, as you said, Jeff's.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.320]   It's nasty, but it's not illegal.
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.840]   Yeah, but if the government tells you to get down, it becomes the fact illegal.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:08.840]   Right.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:09.840]   Right.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.840]   And it's not just child.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.320]   I mean, there are things like there are no laws right now.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.840]   Well, in some places against upskirt photos, but you know, a lot of people would not see
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.840]   those.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.840]   I agree.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.840]   I agree.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.840]   So it should be illegal.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:26.840]   People rulings for every creepy things like, Oh, this guy installed a bathroom camera and
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.840]   stuck those in there.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.360]   Is that its own brand of like, that's a fair.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.080]   That's already illegal in the real world.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.080]   Right.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.360]   I mean, it's not flashing.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.320]   It's already illegal.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.040]   But sending a photo of your penis is not.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.040]   Excuse me.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.120]   An unsolicited photo.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.120]   I don't know.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.120]   Is it?
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.120]   No, it's not illegal.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.120]   Oh, well, that's good.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.880]   It's not an unsolicited photo.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.040]   I'm joking.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.600]   I mean, you might like, if you're doing it at a company, you might get like HR might
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.840]   Oh, yeah, you get a lot of trouble getting in trouble, but it's not against the law.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.120]   Well, I don't know.
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.120]   It's not against the law.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.120]   We should.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.120]   I don't know.
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.120]   We should get a lawyer.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:09.200]   Now, if you send if you send a picture of your penis to a minor, that's the last
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.200]   story.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.200]   That is definitely.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.560]   Well, but what if you what if you know, state bill, there's a bill in the New York
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.560]   States Senate.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.560]   I just searched this.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:22.000]   A person is guilty of unsolicited disclosure disclosure of an intimate image.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.040]   When with the intent to harass a lawyer, alarm another person, that's added in, which
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.600]   serves no legitimate purpose.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.360]   What legitimate purpose could it be?
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.560]   He or she sends by the car device and unsolicited image, another person such person.
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.520]   So there's these things are, but it's not illegal.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.520]   It's not illegal.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.520]   It's interesting.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.560]   California is a flash act in California.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.480]   So there's a lot of stuff coming along the the pike.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:50.760]   So maybe it'd be better to have specific time specific laws against specific things
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:55.440]   or you think there's just such a wide range that you can't such a wide range.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:02.400]   I mean, so and I'm saying this as someone who has watched men harassing women on digital
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.880]   platforms play out in a lot of different ways.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.880]   Totally agree.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.880]   It's not just men.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.880]   Totally agree.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:13.800]   There are not in a lot of cases laws to police departments aren't interested in prosecuting
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.600]   this or able to.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:23.880]   No, you have to threaten death or put somebody in fear for their life for them to go after.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.880]   But it is.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.680]   And that's very black and horrible.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:33.800]   But you understand the concern is that it might also be a satiric comic about Boris
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:38.200]   Johnson's hair or likening President Xi to Winnie the Pooh.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.200]   And that's the problem.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.200]   I think we do have.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.640]   You have to be specific enough to get the better law has to be specific.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:47.640]   It's unconstitutional to be so unspecific that you don't know what the law is.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.640]   That's the issue.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.640]   Right.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:55.000]   And in this does not cover all those bases and we've we've historically been very bad
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   at labeling.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.040]   I mean, even we'll know when we see it.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.760]   And part of it is I'm going to just be honest.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:07.680]   It's because men tend to write our laws and enforce them and a lot of people who the harms
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.360]   of some of this.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.040]   So I'm just going to throw that out there.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.040]   Hey, speaking of bad laws.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:19.600]   I just are y'all playing the Techderts March Vendous most misunderstood legal concept?
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.600]   It is pretty funny.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.280]   Oh, no, this is their brackets.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.440]   Their version of the brackets.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.560]   It's the legal misunderstanding March Vendous.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.560]   Oh, you did?
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.560]   Okay.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.720]   No, it's on the rundown.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.880]   So, uh, should we play it?
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.960]   I mean, you could you just have to fill out your spreadsheet.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.280]   Oh, you do it yourself.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.280]   I get it.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.280]   Okay.
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.600]   I think like super fancy, I think Mike was just like, we'll give it a whirl.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.520]   But they're good.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.200]   Section 230 is on there.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.200]   Here's the bracket.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:51.680]   Oh, this is nice.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.160]   It's a Google sheet.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:00.400]   2022 legal misunderstanding March Vendous first amendment rules of evidence, which one.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:05.960]   So what you're predicting is most misunderstood, more misunderstood.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.960]   And how are they going to determine that?
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.600]   Oh, because they're going to.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.640]   No, no, no, because they're they're compiling.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.640]   No, they are compiling this.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.960]   And I saw the numbers.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:23.000]   So section 230 versus something else was like 87%, versus 13%.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.560]   Based on a poll or something.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.560]   Here's HIPAA.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.440]   So the first, no, this is not a poll.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.720]   This is your vote for which is misunderstood.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:32.720]   This is your prediction.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.720]   That's misunderstood.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.720]   Yes.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.800]   So I'm you're misunderstanding the point of this.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:41.560]   That's what you think is the most misunderstood.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.560]   Right.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:46.520]   My question is, how are they going to know who wins?
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:47.920]   Well, let's read Mike.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.920]   Maybe he tells us.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.120]   Oh, you know, no, you you save it.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.680]   And then you tweet it.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.400]   You take a screenshot and you say or share it to her.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.400]   So it's just.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.080]   No, I understand that.
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.960]   But somebody has to say who won.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:05.200]   Who's tabulating said, oh, Mike is tabulating it.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.200]   But these aren't votes.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.200]   They're predictions.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.440]   Every day I've got it.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.440]   I had a right read the article.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.880]   I'm the one I never heard of this.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.920]   You guys are the ones who talk each day that this is running.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:22.240]   Tech Dirt says we will be posting Twitter polls of the competing legal concepts to see
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.960]   which one has misunderstood the most.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.240]   The winner will advance to the next round eventually crowning the most misunderstood legal
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.440]   concept of 2022.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.440]   What do you think?
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.440]   There's quite a few of them.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.440]   Section 230.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:40.320]   The amendment Sherman Act fair use obstruction of justice ADA insider training.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.000]   First amendment is pretty common.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.520]   Yeah, which which is more misunderstood.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.360]   The Hatch Act or the Unruh Act.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.960]   I don't know which which is more misunderstood.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:57.680]   The 25th amendment or hearsay.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.400]   These are this is hard.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.240]   I sense Kathy yellow's involved in this.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.560]   Who's going to who's wait?
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.040]   What is the 25th amendment?
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.040]   Hold on.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.040]   Right against unreasonable.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.440]   No, no, wait a minute.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.440]   That's no.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.440]   No, that's not.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.440]   No idea.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.440]   The 25th amendment is the right to vote for women.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.440]   What is it?
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.440]   Look it up quick.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.440]   I'm looking.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.480]   I'm looking at the transition of power for president.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.720]   Oh, that's the crazy president one.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.720]   I knew I'd heard that recently.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.360]   So wait, wait, what was it?
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.360]   Crazy.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.000]   Say versus crazy president.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.120]   Oh, hearsay.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.520]   Nobody understands hearsay.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:35.000]   Hear say is the one I all I know is when you're watching.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.080]   You know, law and order.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:44.200]   And the attorney jumps up and says, that's hearsay, your honor, because it's not my eyewitness
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.200]   thing.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.600]   I'm reporting somebody else's eye witness.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:47.880]   I think that's pretty well understood.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.880]   Someone else heard something.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.480]   It's understood because of TV.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:54.680]   The 25th amendment is pretty well understood because of never mind.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.080]   Because of the last presidential arrow.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.080]   Never mind.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.520]   I bet you if you asked that question four years ago would not be understood.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:02.520]   No, I don't know.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.520]   No.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.800]   Actually, if you grew up in the Reagan era, because then they, they're there to make you
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:07.800]   a man.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   You know what?
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.920]   We've been talking about the 25th of minutes since it was created.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.120]   It just depends which party you're on which side you're on.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.120]   How about this?
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.280]   It's treason versus OSHA.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.040]   Oh, OSHA.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.040]   OSHA.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.040]   OSHA.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.040]   Got to be most confused.
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:28.280]   Occupational self safety and health administration.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.880]   I figured treason would be more confused.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.360]   Although people often say things are treasonous when they're not.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.360]   Right.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.960]   Net neutrality or the CFAA.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.800]   I'd have to look that up.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.800]   Net neutrality.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.320]   Copyright or Citizens United, Aretha or joint and several.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.320]   Fire in the end.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.760]   We can go and vote as a show.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.240]   I'm not feeling like these brackets.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.240]   There's a lot of that.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.240]   There's a lot of that.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.240]   I know.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.240]   Little line 55.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.240]   We can just vote and glitter.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:54.240]   Oh, what is the CFFA?
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.240]   CFFA?
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.240]   CFAA.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.880]   You got to look it up.
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.880]   CFAA.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.880]   I'm looking it up.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.880]   We can vote.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.240]   Oh, computer fraud and abuse act.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.240]   We should know this.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.240]   We should know that one.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.240]   That's the one.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.240]   We did.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.240]   That's the one where the course that Aaron Schwartz was prosecuted under.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.240]   Okay.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:14.480]   This is actually, you know, this is Mike's secret way of getting everybody to look these
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.480]   things up.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:16.480]   Yeah, it is.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.480]   It's genius.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.480]   He's doing a great job.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.480]   Nice.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.920]   I feel like I'm helping out a good cause here by looking up things.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:25.200]   I'm like, oh, I'm so first amendment or rules of evidence.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.200]   No, wait a minute.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.200]   That's the first one.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.200]   Jeff.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:33.200]   We're not doing the brackets.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.200]   All right.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.200]   That's just for the first round.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.040]   Then there's the sweet 16.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.920]   Then there's the elite eight, the final few and the championship.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:43.920]   Yes.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.760]   It's the final four, isn't it?
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:46.760]   Yes.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:49.800]   I told you, I don't know, sport ball.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.360]   He's definitely not a sports ball guy.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.360]   All right.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.640]   We'll come back for the final four.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:00.240]   This is too busy making computers and waging Russian war.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.160]   I'm casting my votes here.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.120]   We went because you cast your votes.
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:08.360]   We went took my daughter out to her 30th birthday, which was yesterday for dinner.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.360]   Cheers.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.640]   Henry and I are sitting side by side.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.640]   We're at the restaurant.
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:12.640]   We're looking up.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.240]   There's a basketball game.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:17.400]   Henry says, oh, why aren't they showing the March Madness?
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.560]   And I said, well, it's basketball.
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.240]   He said, no, no, that's the NBA.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:23.040]   I said, oh, yeah, there's LeBron.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.040]   He said, no, that's.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.040]   Oh, she's nuts.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.520]   What are you talking about?
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.520]   Oh, boy.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:32.360]   So I proved that I know nothing.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.360]   You are Russian.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:34.360]   I am Russian.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.360]   I am that guy.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.360]   I am a deep cover.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:41.760]   What do they call that when you like in the Americans, when you're a mole and you're in
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:47.040]   your under deep cover and you skip the week on American sports.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.040]   I forgot that.
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.040]   I should have gone.
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.040]   Espionage.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.480]   Should have gone.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.480]   That's a fun one.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.480]   I like that.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.480]   I like that.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.480]   Let's see.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.480]   What else here?
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:01.480]   Yeah, I was going to say it's not like we have a lot of Google news to discuss.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:05.120]   So I figured we could throw some fun stuff in here.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.120]   Oh, through the rundown.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:10.400]   Unsolicited dick ticks.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:19.000]   There's a John, we told you no unsolicited dick ticks for our listeners.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.640]   Perhaps for our listeners, you might want to display.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.640]   Okay.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.920]   The dick tick is a kind of aminal.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.120]   It's an ungulant.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.360]   Is it an ungulant?
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.360]   I don't know.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.560]   It's a cute picture.
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.200]   Does it have hooves?
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.200]   Unbelievable.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.320]   Jammer be unbelievable.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.720]   Now I'm looking up dick dick ungulant.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:44.440]   So dick ticks are named for the alarms calls of the females, in addition to the females
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:49.720]   alarm call, both the male and female make a shrill whistling sound.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:58.440]   Ex-mamellia order arterio-dactilla family bovid eye their cows, bovines, sub-family
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.440]   antelope eye.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:03.880]   You yelled at me for trying to go through concepts of law and saying that was distracting.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.880]   Geez.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:05.880]   It is.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:09.280]   I'm going down tick dirt and you're going into dick ticks.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:12.200]   It is the ultimate ungulant.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.200]   I'm just saying.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.200]   Geez.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.440]   Just telling you.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:17.440]   Here's another unsolicited dick.
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.280]   I'm listening to their.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.760]   I'm listening to their call and it doesn't sound like dick dick.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:23.960]   It sounds like whistling.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.960]   On a monopoe it was never.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:27.960]   Are they cute?
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:28.960]   Very cute thing.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.600]   It's like a little tiny elephant trunk or something.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.600]   Oh my gosh.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.600]   By the way.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:34.600]   But it looks like a deer nose.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.240]   This is from ultimateungulant.com.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.800]   Kirk's dick dick is not in danger.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.800]   What?
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.800]   Is it worth?
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:43.960]   I'm just glad.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.200]   If your name is Kirk, congratulations.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.120]   All right.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.320]   Let's let's let's.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.320]   Small Internet.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:54.800]   Internet Alliance from the small Internet companies.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   Oh God.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.800]   Who cares?
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   Thank you.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   This is a Jarvis.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.560]   You know who else doesn't care?
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.480]   Jonah Peretti no longer cares.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.640]   Did you see this article from the defector?
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.640]   He when he.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.200]   One could read it all because it's beyond a paywall.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.200]   Oh.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.200]   You're right.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.200]   It is.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:18.560]   You may have this thing that says take down these walls, Mr. Garbachev.
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:25.440]   He laid off a year ago 70 employees, including 47 Huff post staffers in the US to drive long-term
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.880]   sustainability today.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.840]   He announced this was yesterday.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:34.720]   He once again is reducing the BuzzFeed workforce to quote accelerate profitability.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.320]   Hey, you know what?
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.560]   When you're an owner, sometimes you have to do that.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:39.640]   Well, he's not the owner now.
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:40.640]   It's the stock market.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:41.640]   That's the issue.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:45.920]   He closed basically the entire news division, I think.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.320]   And so I tweeted about this.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.320]   I think it's too bad.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.320]   They won the Pulitzer Prize.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.480]   They've done brilliant work.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.360]   Buzzfeed news has been great.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.360]   But you know what?
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.400]   And I even said this on the show.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:00.880]   It's tainted because it started with BuzzFeed and you think BuzzFeed, listicles.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:04.160]   Well, but they got past that and really got a reputation.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:06.040]   But the problem was there was never a business model.
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.400]   It was always subsidized by BuzzFeed, the listicles.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.680]   And people said, oh, this is wonderful.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:11.680]   It's a future of news.
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:13.280]   I said, oh, I wish.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.680]   But never the BuzzFeed business model.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.240]   Hey, we can make our stuff viral.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.680]   We can make your stuff viral.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:19.920]   Didn't come over to news.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.080]   You know, the same problem every news organization has.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.680]   Who wants to be next to news?
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.680]   Nobody.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.680]   That's the problem.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.680]   Paretti, who was--
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:27.920]   This is such a bummer.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:32.440]   Was the founder had an all hands meeting following the resignation announcements from
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:36.880]   a BuzzFeed news editor in chief Mark Schuff's and the other top two other top editors, Nakamoto
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.440]   and Kamenor.
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.080]   He said he's making cuts, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:44.560]   And then right before the Q&A, he just leaves.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.720]   He logs out.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:50.520]   And people were pretty upset.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:53.920]   Julia Rienstein tweeted, I've worked at this company for seven years and I've never felt
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:54.920]   so disrespected.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:52:00.120]   And seeing my CEO log out without answering a single question about why he wants to gut
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.280]   my newsroom.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:06.520]   But it is, I think the point of this is news sustainable is the real question.
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:11.440]   Is it, can it, can it, is it, can it just be the New York Times, the Washington Post,
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.600]   and that's it.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:18.520]   It's not sustainable at the infinite profit margins, apparently shareholders expect.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:22.240]   I think news can be sustainable.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.880]   You don't think news can be sustainable?
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.120]   No, no, no.
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.680]   I think that's, I think it may be going a little too far.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:32.360]   I think that that, yes, at the scale of the stock market, there's only three brands that
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.120]   bring in two thirds of the subscription models.
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:39.280]   Advertising has changed markedly, including the ad market as a whole is going down and
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.160]   they haven't reinvented themselves.
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:45.720]   But at a different scale, no, I still believe that it is possible to have sustainable news
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.960]   so that let me finish.
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.560]   That is exactly what I was going to say.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:51.560]   Yay.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:52.560]   Thank you.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:53.560]   I thought you asked me.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:54.560]   Sorry.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.560]   No, it's because you interrupted it.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.560]   And then then I'm sorry.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.560]   I apologize.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.560]   I apologize.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:52:59.560]   I apologize.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.560]   Oh, it was it is.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.560]   I'll give you the day.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.560]   Sorry.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.560]   Sorry.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:04.560]   It is profitable.
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.640]   I'm going to get people are going to yell at me on Twitter.
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.480]   So I will get my, I will get my just desserts for that.
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:10.480]   I apologize.
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.480]   I was wrong.
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.040]   I thought she was not wrong.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.040]   Wrong.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:17.720]   I'm sure it's my fault for not moderating this pandemic.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.720]   Okay.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:19.720]   Okay.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.720]   Okay.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:21.960]   Did you get a South by Stacy speaking of moderating panels?
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:28.720]   No, I was really excited to not go to South by because I no longer live in Austin.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.960]   So I no longer have to go.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:30.960]   Oh, I get it.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:31.960]   Was it awful Stacy?
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:32.960]   Would you live there?
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:33.960]   What?
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:34.960]   It's awful.
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:38.240]   It's just I gone for like almost 20 years and I had something.
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.200]   I didn't hear anything notable coming out of South by.
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.200]   Did you?
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:46.120]   All I knew was a Twitter friend, Mr. Wesley.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.120]   You fought her was going and outside of that.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.120]   He lives in.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.120]   Oh, he doesn't live in Austin.
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.120]   No, he doesn't.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.120]   He moved.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:54.120]   Yeah, he's like in the Midwest somewhere.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:57.120]   I know you introduced us in Austin.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:02.600]   Amy Webb or Amy Webb did her annual keynote there for her.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:03.600]   Oh, she did.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.600]   Okay.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:09.200]   There were people forget Mark Zuckerberg did a did a panel.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.960]   I thought he was virtual though.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:11.960]   Right?
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:15.440]   That's well, yeah, but you know, they might have been.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:26.240]   Yeah, oh, hey, I recognize the sound of that fantastic Samsung Galaxy Flip Z3 boy.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:29.320]   That sounds mighty good.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:32.640]   You didn't even pick your own ring is not heavy either.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.640]   It's not heavy.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:34.640]   It's not heavy.
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.760]   So actually you still liking it?
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:37.760]   Is it okay?
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:38.760]   I do.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:39.760]   I said, I'll send you a bill.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:40.760]   Do you want it back?
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:41.960]   No, I'm just teasing you.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:42.960]   Invoice coming.
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:43.960]   You can.
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:44.960]   No, no, I'm just teasing you.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.520]   I'll pay you whatever it goes for on swap.
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:47.960]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's yours.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:50.160]   It's a gift, but I'm just glad you like it.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:51.720]   I'm just curious if you liked it.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:55.600]   Now, don't ask me about the Kobo because I haven't charged that yet.
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:56.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:59.280]   The Kobo was not a gift.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:03.560]   The Kobo was, I think technically it's called a dump run.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:06.720]   I just want to say an unsolicited e-reader.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:12.240]   Yeah, it was almost as bad as, yeah, it was an unsolicited e-reader.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:15.320]   I drive by e-reader to you.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:23.800]   I was curious for y'all's take maybe because you might be well versed in corporate, not
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:27.200]   malfeasance, but shady tactics.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:34.000]   The Justice Department asking, talking about how Google has basically told its employees
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.360]   that if they're going to put anything weird in an email, they should loop in an attorney
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.360]   to keep it.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:40.960]   They're in trouble for that.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:46.000]   Yeah, well, it's kind of like both, it's both like, well, clever, but also super shady.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.240]   Well, I'm sure they thought it was clever, but apparently it's illegal.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:54.680]   So the Justice Department is in fact investigating.
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:57.480]   They're accusing Google of, and this makes sense.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:03.360]   In fact, if you were kind of naive, you might say, good, this is our policy from now on.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:08.400]   The Justice Department said that Google teaches employees to, before, when they're sending
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:14.600]   a sensitive business communication, like, we got to shut that Facebook down.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:23.080]   They should also CC the House Council because they shield the documents from Discovery.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:28.160]   It is suddenly protected under attorney client privilege just by virtue of CCing them.
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.160]   Ooh.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:37.080]   Now, the DOJ says they're using false requests for legal advice that is they feel to the
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.080]   DOJ.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.920]   Well, if you're actually asking for the advice that is legit, I used to have to do that in
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:44.440]   advance all the time because it was kind of a shadow management of the company, and I
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:48.440]   had to think it's clear for the lawyers, and before I sent something out, I had to check
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:49.840]   with the lawyers.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.240]   And that was...
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.320]   I think the government might lose on this one.
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:57.880]   I mean, the government is asking the judge to sanction Google and compel disclosure of
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:04.080]   more documents, documents that are hidden from them due to this attorney client privilege.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:07.200]   But I think if I'm the judge, I'm going to say, well, you have to show intent with each
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:10.840]   and every one of these, and I don't think you can.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:15.000]   So the DOJ was saying, look, they had training sessions.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.840]   They trained people just to CC the attorney.
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:17.840]   It doesn't matter.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.000]   What they need is a smoking gun.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:24.240]   They need an email from syndarchpitchizing, whatever you do, make sure you CC an attorney
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.240]   of every time.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:26.240]   I was told to...
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.240]   Every time I did something...
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:32.200]   So in advance as a fascinating company, it was a family owned, the new houses, and they
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.200]   didn't have a corporate...
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.840]   I was the only corporate employee of the whole house there.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:38.280]   They didn't have corporate, because of the family, and then they had the law firm and
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.280]   the accountancy firm.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:43.320]   And if you did anything that had the slightest kind of controversy, not even legally, but
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:47.600]   just business sense, the bosses, the owners would say, did you check with the lawyers?
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:52.320]   Because that was a means of management and a means of checking and making sure that
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:54.720]   things were going to be passable.
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:58.520]   So God, most everything I did went through the lawyers.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:04.600]   I mean, it's clear that probably Google was using this, but it's also very difficult
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:07.880]   to show because it's a reasonable business practice.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:16.600]   The DOJ lawyers cited an email from Sundarchpitchai to Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:21.040]   He was telling her how to respond to a press inquiry, but he put up at the top attorney
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:27.080]   client privileged and copied Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker on it.
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:28.080]   But you have to then...
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:29.080]   That might be you.
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.080]   Right.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:35.680]   The DOJ would have to prove that Sundarchpitchai was doing this intentionally to hide it, as
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:38.440]   opposed to legitimately saying, "I want to make sure the council's there."
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.280]   You come from Sundarch to whom?
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:41.280]   Wojcicki.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:42.280]   And Wojcicki.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:43.280]   So it was internal.
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:46.880]   So if you did that in an external, and said, "Well, we're going to get around anti-trust
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:49.960]   here because if I'm able to zuck, I'm going to CC.
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:50.960]   That'd be a no-no."
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:51.960]   Right.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:55.320]   But internally, checking things out, that seems normal.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.320]   Right.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:00.560]   Google spokesperson said, "Just like other American companies, we educate our employees
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:04.120]   about legal privilege and when to seek legal advice."
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:08.920]   And she pointed out, "We've produced over 4 million documents to the DOJ in this case
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:14.040]   alone, including many that employees have considered potentially privileged."
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.840]   I think the government's going to lose on this one.
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.520]   It's worth a try.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:22.720]   What they wanted to use as a litmus test is if it's an email chain where attorneys were
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:26.920]   copied but never responded to.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:27.920]   Or...
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:30.120]   I thought it phoned.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:33.520]   You know, this is going to be a hard one to prove.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:34.520]   We'll see.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:38.120]   The judge may say, "No, you're right."
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.120]   But we'll see.
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.440]   I have a feeling it's a hard thing to prove.
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:44.280]   If this were any other company, would this even have come up?
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:47.640]   Well, in any other antitrust suit, maybe.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:48.640]   Yes.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:52.640]   I think the DOJ probably looks for this all the time.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:57.000]   I just asked where it just looks like some targeting at Google to me.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   It depends.
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   I'm trying to take it up more.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   It depends.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.960]   But that just seems a little too odd.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:09.680]   You could also say, 80% of the things that we have encountered are protected by attorney
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.680]   client privilege.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:14.800]   But in Microsoft, our prior case, only 60% were.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.800]   This looks really suspicious.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.880]   Or actually, we make it more egregious.
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.080]   Only 20% were.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.120]   So this seems unusually high.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.120]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.680]   I'm not in the Department of Justice.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:29.480]   Well, except Spacey, what if this case is just more clearly legally sensitive?
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.960]   And so you do want more lawyer advice.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:38.800]   But if you're saying of all the discovery things that they're pulling for, a greater percentage
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:46.680]   of general discovery is protected compared to another company in that position that might
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.080]   set off alarm bells.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.480]   I don't know if it's default practice or not.
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.480]   I'm all speculation.
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.480]   Depends on the company.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.840]   Depends on the company.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:00.080]   But this is also why lawyers often rise to senior VP and the CEOs.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.080]   That's right.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.160]   They really know the company.
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:12.160]   Although my wife often says that she doesn't want to consult attorneys because they're
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.960]   not business people, that they understand the law, but they're so exposure adverse.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:23.120]   Their advice is always to protect themselves as much as to protect you, to not do things
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.800]   just because it's risky.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.400]   And she says, you know, they don't, they need, they don't temper their legal judgment
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.640]   with business judgment.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:37.600]   So she'll, I've had good lawyers and companies that in time, make especially where they said,
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.560]   my job is to help you do what you want to do.
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.560]   Right.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:41.560]   Let's figure out a way to do it.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:44.000]   I'm going to help you find the way you can do that or tell you you can't.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   And here's what, right?
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.920]   But the same can be said for HR too.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.960]   Well, HR is there to protect the company.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:50.960]   I can tell you that right now.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.800]   They're not there to protect you.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.120]   Always in forever.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.480]   They are, they are not there to protect you.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.680]   That's a very common mistake.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:00.680]   Employees man.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.680]   That's the thing.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.120]   Employees are usually told HR is going to protect you.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.120]   No.
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.120]   No.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.760]   They're just, they were just like a lawyer.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:13.640]   They're keeping us, they're preventing us from exposing, giving unsolicited exposing
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.640]   exposure.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.440]   Yeah, for my pleasure.
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:19.240]   Especially if there's been actual exposure.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.240]   Yes.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.240]   No exposure.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.240]   Oh, there we are again.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.240]   No exposure.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.280]   I know we're right back there.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.280]   I love this.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.140]   I know we're talking about this fair play, we talked about this on Mac break weekly.
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:38.080]   So Apple, as you know, will not let companies like Amazon with their Kindle app or their
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:48.800]   Audible app or Netflix charge people in the app without giving Apple 30% big.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.360]   And that's been a big issue.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:54.360]   A lot of, that's their beings, they were sued over that by Epic and so forth.
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:59.640]   They also have in their developer's rules and not only can you not do that, but if you're
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.040]   not going to sell inside your apps because you don't want to give us money, you can't
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.160]   tell people go somewhere else.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.720]   You can't say, but you can buy this on the web.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.040]   Click here to exit out of this app.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:15.640]   So Apple had an agreement with Google on the Android store and on Android TV that if you
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:21.320]   bought something in Apple TV, Apple wouldn't have to give Google 30%.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:29.560]   That agreement expired and they have not been able to reach terms on in app payment commissions.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:39.400]   So Apple has now a button in the Apple TV app on Android and on Google TV says how to
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:44.400]   watch and it says you can buy, render, subscribe in the Apple TV app on iPhone and iPad and
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.400]   on other streaming devices, just not here.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.400]   How to do it?
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.400]   How to get around it?
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:57.840]   This is something Apple forbids, but when Google said we want our 30%, Apple said no
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.400]   and isn't that called a double standard?
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.640]   And we're going to put a watch button.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.160]   Google allows it, but it's interesting.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:14.840]   That's why Apple is one of the most profitable companies in the planet.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:19.760]   I guess, but I just think in some ways it's kind of like what's happening in politics.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:27.280]   Like Democrats can't go buy jerks, but the Republicans can take advantage of their silence
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.160]   on things and just push that line a little further.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:35.760]   It all comes down with the norms and what you're willing to do and not do.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:37.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.760]   Well, you can get away with it.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.760]   Yep.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:45.040]   Let's take a little break and when we come back, we'll have the words of God.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.520]   So get ready for that.
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:54.640]   Something you don't hear all the time on this show, but first a word from something you
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.640]   don't hear all this.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.640]   Jarvis speaking?
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.360]   No, he's more like Moses.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:04:59.360]   Moses.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:06.120]   Moses, Moses, Moses, Moses, Moses, Moses, Moses, Moses, eroniously are showed today brought
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.400]   to you by New Relic.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.320]   If you're a software engineer, whoa, you know that late night call.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.320]   It ain't working.
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.320]   Something's down.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.320]   The server's down.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:16.320]   Something.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.320]   That's a problem.
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.520]   All you know is customers are screaming.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:21.360]   The boss is mad and you're up in the middle of the night.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.940]   Your team is scrambling around like crazy, like a long tail cat and a room full of rock
[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:33.320]   and chairs and you're firing up tool after tool, trying to figure it out.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.480]   And you just don't know what's wrong.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.480]   It's the worst feeling.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:38.400]   And if you've ever had that feeling, you know what I'm talking about.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.840]   You know, it doesn't have that feeling.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:42.400]   People who use New Relic.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:48.400]   Unfortunately, that's only about half of all organizations.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:52.360]   Only half of all organizations implement observability for the networks and systems according to
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.360]   New Relic.
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:06:01.560]   Maintaining network observability is a big issue, but you will not be in the dark if you
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:03.200]   get New Relic.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.520]   Imagine getting that call in the middle of the night.
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:10.920]   Look, things are going to go down, but knowing exactly when wrong, maybe a line of codes
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.600]   that you just committed is broken.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:16.160]   You'll know you could fix it and you get back to bed in minutes.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.840]   Stop guessing where the problems lie.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:22.520]   New Relic combined 16 different monitoring products you'd normally buy separately.
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:26.920]   So engineering teams can see across the entire software stack in one place.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:32.440]   You'll get application monitoring, APM for your apps, your microservices, unified monitoring.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:37.560]   So if you know exactly when wrong, unified is a good word for this.
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:43.480]   Their network performance monitoring ditches the data silo for a system-wide correlated
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.360]   view of where the performance issues are happening.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:50.120]   So you don't have to kind of page back and forth.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:53.800]   You can get distributed tracing, see all your traces without management headaches.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:58.640]   If you use Kubernetes, you'll love PIXI, Kubernetes observability.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.840]   And more importantly, you can pinpoint issues down to the line of code.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:07.520]   You will know exactly why the problem happened and resolve it quickly.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:14.680]   That's why the devs and ops teams at DoorDash and GitHub and Epic Games and more than 14,000
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:19.440]   other companies use New Relic to debug and improve their software, whether you're running
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:22.920]   a cloud native startup or a Fortune 500 company.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.240]   It just takes a couple of minutes to set up New Relic in your environment and then you
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.800]   can go to sleep in peace.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.800]   And never have to worry about that late night call.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:33.920]   They may come, but you'll be able to fix it fast.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:39.240]   New Relic, that late night call is just waiting to happen, get New Relic before it does get
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:46.680]   access to the whole New Relic platform and 100 gigabytes of data per month free forever.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:51.160]   Wait a minute, Leo, you just told me it's free?
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.240]   Yes.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:57.760]   The whole New Relic platform, no limits, 100 gigabytes of data free every month forever,
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.600]   no credit card required.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:05.600]   So why are you waiting?
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:09.400]   Sign up right now, new relic.com/twig.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:13.680]   We thank New Relic so much for supporting this week in Google and thank you for supporting
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:18.840]   us by going to that site so they know you saw it here.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:22.320]   New Relic.com/twig.
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.480]   This was a great story.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:29.200]   I read it in input magazine.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.600]   It actually has a happy ending, but it seems like a sad story.
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:41.320]   It's about Thomas Bookler who just passed away at the age of 65 and left behind a program
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:47.880]   he'd written pretty much on his own, a program that stopped working when Windows 7 was no
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:52.080]   longer supportive of Microsoft, when Apple abandoned 32-bit software.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.560]   So people were updating their iPhones, their Macs, their Windows machines and no longer
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.920]   could use it.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:03.640]   And we're devastated, but they found out that this program, Trope Trainer, was not from
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.720]   a company, but from one guy, a labor of love.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:13.960]   And when he passed away, suddenly in July at the age of 65, the code disappeared and
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:16.520]   no one knew how to update it.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.400]   I'm going to play it a little bit for you.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:22.680]   In order to understand what it does, when you're, and I'm not Jewish, but I know many
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:30.480]   friends who got bought Mitzvah or bar mitzvah, you will sing from the Torah, right?
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.320]   You'll learn to chant.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:37.440]   And of course, that's a big part of your getting ready for your bar mitzvah is learning these
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.440]   chants.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:47.400]   Apparently, it can be very complicated because over time, it's a sing-song thing and different
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:54.600]   traditions have different pronunciations, so there's an Ashkenazi and a Sephardic tradition.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.560]   And there's different ways of singing it.
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:03.000]   But it's something you have to learn in the past, what you'd have to do is go to the temple
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.280]   and be taught and listen and learn and memorize it.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:13.000]   But this program, which worked on a PC, Trope Trainer, actually, I'm going to play a little
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.600]   bit of it for you because even though it's all lost.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:20.920]   And he went to digital equipment, which was the only one that had a voice synthesizer
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:27.680]   20 years ago and got their voice synthesizer to be updated to work with this.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.040]   It's kind of an amazing story.
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.640]   I highly recommend it.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:38.280]   Fortunately, the woman who helped him at deck, unpaid volunteer who helped him at deck had
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.200]   saved one way file of this.
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:43.560]   So I'm going to play just to give you an idea of what it sounded like.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:51.320]   But the people who used it, the kids and the rabbis and the people who used it loved it.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.320]   It was amazing.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:59.240]   Let me scroll down and find the little wave file that's on this article, inputmag.com.
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:01.520]   There's a picture of a bookler.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.680]   Actually, I'm sorry, he died in 2019.
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.680]   I apologize.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:05.680]   Okay.
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:06.680]   So several years ago.
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.480]   In fact, that was what happened.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:09.640]   It was he died in 2019.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:15.680]   And then shortly after that, Microsoft discontinues seven and shortly after that, Apple discontinued
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:19.400]   32-bit support and so forth.
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:29.320]   Here is a wave file, 15-second snippet of a voice synthesized to sing sacred words.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:49.480]   Wow.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:54.720]   So kids would listen to that, memorize it.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:55.880]   Pretty amazing story.
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.080]   Highly recommended.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.360]   But the thing I loved about this.
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:04.720]   I read this story and then I saw Andy Bio of Waxie Links and his tweet.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:10.880]   He figured out actually a guy named Jess 5199 figured out how to do it.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:11.880]   Everybody thought this is it.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:12.880]   It's lost forever.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:18.360]   The source code, they went to a bookler's husband and said, "Do you have the computer
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.360]   he wrote it on?"
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.680]   He said, "Now I gave that away to charity."
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.960]   The source code was long gone.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.920]   And of course, they could have reversed engineered it.
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:31.160]   But fortunately, people who did have a copy of the program running on Windows XP, thanks
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:38.640]   to Jess 5199, he figured out how to run it in VirtualBox using a copy of Trope Trainer
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.200]   from archive.org and the serial number.
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:45.760]   And so it is now running, I'll turn it on again.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:51.000]   It is now running in virtualization.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   So saved.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   Isn't that great?
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.520]   It's a great story.
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:57.320]   And thank you again, another great story.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.720]   Thank you to Internet Archive.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:05.040]   This is the 2005 version of the CD-ROM of Internet Archive.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.040]   Just surprises me constantly.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:12.720]   I'm doing research and I look at these HathiTrust and my academic things and my last resort
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.240]   is, "Well, I wonder if Internet Archive has it."
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.880]   And it's amazing all that it has.
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:16.880]   It's very, very exciting.
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:20.440]   There's magazines and publications.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:24.840]   I would have to think that Booklet would be very relieved to know that this is his life's
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.840]   work.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:30.040]   He spent 20 years on it, that it still can be used.
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.040]   Really neat story.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.320]   I thought I'd be a scientist.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.600]   Can you imagine what Google voice could do with that?
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.920]   Oh, it'd be so much better now.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:43.600]   But honestly, it's not as simple as, I mean, it's a hard thing to do.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.960]   It's also tonality, yeah.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:53.440]   And the way the tones were written by the rabbis on the Hebrew script is it's not a direct
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.880]   correspondence to how it's sung or played.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.680]   So it's a very, very complicated.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:13:59.680]   It's new on it.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.680]   Yeah, it's very difficult.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.000]   And this thing would do it in a variety of different.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.920]   You could even have a young kid or an old man sing it.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:10.480]   But yeah, if we had decent modern synthesizers working on this, it'd be very interesting.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:17.280]   The deck program that he used had only been translated to English, German, and I think
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.760]   one of their language.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:24.760]   So they had to actually teach it how to sing in Hebrew, which is kind of amazing.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.760]   What a story.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:26.760]   That's awesome.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.920]   Yeah, lovely story.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:36.880]   I think, let me see, just looking at lots of stuff.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:37.880]   There's so much stuff.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.200]   But we don't need to do all of it.
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:41.200]   I love it.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.200]   It feels so cool.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.200]   Go ahead and say, see.
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.360]   Oh, it's like a lot of it feels so marginal.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:52.160]   I'm like, yeah, like Google buys a company called Raxiom for AR.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.480]   Snap bought someone for AR.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:56.480]   I saw this yesterday.
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.480]   All about it.
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:58.680]   Your small AR company.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:01.880]   The Android statues have been removed from Google.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:05.480]   They've been getting really run down and they stopped putting up pretty much.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.480]   Filthy.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:11.760]   I'm not hoping they were just being renovated.
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.760]   But I don't know if--
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:14.960]   I think that day is over.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:15.960]   They're under the story.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:16.960]   I didn't know what the card is.
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.120]   They're just going to hide them for now because they're probably going to put them
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.920]   somewhere else.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.520]   At the moment, it's uncertain what Google will do with the statues, assuming the company
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.720]   hasn't destroyed them.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:33.640]   Until then, fans will have to fondly look back at photos posted online.
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.240]   This is from the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:38.400]   I was getting ready to say, you think Google has destroyed them.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.400]   They were fiberglass.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.720]   They were not meant to last forever.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.720]   No.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.720]   They were really--
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:44.720]   I was looking ready.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.720]   It's like putt-putt golf kind of statues.
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:49.720]   They were.
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:51.720]   But it was for every version of Android.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:57.880]   So there was KitKat, there was a pie, there was a frozen yogurt ice cream sandwich.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.120]   It was outside building 44.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:03.920]   They used to be on the main campus and then they moved to the restaurant store.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:04.920]   Okay.
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.920]   And do they still name things?
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.920]   I'm trying to think of the most.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:09.920]   No, they don't.
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:13.040]   They don't make a big deal of it, but technically they do.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.040]   So I think--
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.040]   Oh, they stopped.
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.600]   Oh, they stopped too.
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:17.600]   Okay.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:22.280]   Jason Howell, all about Android, Colin Jason Howell.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.280]   He pops into the IRC.
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.280]   Reagan.
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.280]   Help us.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.600]   Oh, they do it internally only.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:32.440]   So Q had the name quince tart.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:35.440]   And this is why it's internal.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.440]   Quince tart.
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.680]   Okay, I see what's happening here.
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.280]   That's why they're internal now.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.280]   Yeah, I don't--
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:48.320]   Well, I think the problem was they got to one letter.
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:51.240]   There really wasn't a good dessert for a camera.
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.240]   Forget which one it was.
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.240]   Was it quince?
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:56.120]   Quince, Q is pretty bad.
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.360]   Quince tart or queen cake?
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.960]   Queen cake's not so bad.
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.400]   Which one was it?
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.400]   That was Android 10.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.000]   I don't know what 11 and 12 are.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   You are--
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.320]   I am totally for fun.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.240]   I mean, they're going to run out of letters too.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:12.720]   Android 12 is snow cone because it's S.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:14.320]   Oh, I do remember this.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:15.840]   Yeah, so they didn't get rid of it.
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.920]   They just don't make a big deal out of it anymore.
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:18.920]   Tear me soon.
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:19.920]   I believe they said they were going to try.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:20.920]   Tear me soon.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:24.600]   The third one was Red Velvet Cake says, Jason.
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:25.600]   Oh boy.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:30.520]   And he says, 13, as you said, he's like most likely Tear me soon.
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:34.600]   But then you get to U and V and W and X, Y and X.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.600]   What's X going to be?
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:37.920]   What kind of dessert?
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:38.920]   You run out of--
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:39.920]   Extra dumb.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:40.920]   Extra dumb.
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:41.920]   That's right.
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:42.920]   No, exactly.
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:43.920]   X-silent tall.
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:44.920]   That is not--
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:47.240]   I'm using Android's isle-toll now.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.200]   No cavities.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.240]   Google has settled with the four engineers.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:57.080]   It fired for unionizing.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.120]   And then, of course, the employees
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.880]   went to the National Labor Relations Board.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.680]   And Google finally has settled with them.
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.840]   Google ran a secret campaign according to the engineers
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:12.560]   involved with workplace activism at the company.
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:16.080]   Between 2018 and 2020, to crush union organizing,
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:19.200]   it was known as Project Vivian.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.520]   Four of the workers were fired in late 2019.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:24.320]   We talked about it at the time.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.280]   Two of those employees are back at Google, I think.
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:30.880]   But the four others will not be re--
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:33.440]   none of the four fired workers will be reinstated.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.000]   And of course, we don't know the terms of the settlement.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:37.920]   But I'm thinking--
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.960]   Why did they call it Project Vivian?
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.800]   It's a terrible name.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.960]   Because it couldn't be called X-Cloud or something like that.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:48.240]   Yeah, you can't say like Project Busted Unions.
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:51.480]   That would be a little obvious.
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:53.560]   I mean, it's got to come up from somewhere.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.960]   It was one of the Google employees, Vivian.
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.960]   I mean--
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:59.520]   I don't know.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.440]   Are you ready for YouTube to take on over the air TV
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:09.040]   with nearly 4,000 free episodes of TVs?
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.240]   Shows?
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:11.320]   With commercials.
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.240]   With commercials.
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.160]   I'm down for this.
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:16.960]   Hell's Kitchen, Andromeda, Heartland.
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.560]   You already can watch movies with commercials on YouTube.
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.320]   I'm down for this.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.200]   It makes sense.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:27.720]   I use Plex from time to time to watch TV series or whatever.
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.720]   And I like Plex for the most part.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:34.080]   But this live quote TV stuff seems to be a little bit clunky.
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:37.120]   And I would assume YouTube/Google would
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.360]   be able to do it a little bit better.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.520]   I think it's just a matter of time
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.600]   with where the networks realize.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.120]   That's where the kids are.
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.520]   And just--
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:47.560]   Remember when YouTube first came out, NBC was furious.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.760]   Because Saturday Night Live skits kept ending up,
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:50.800]   and they were starting to sue them.
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:52.160]   And then they realized, wait a minute.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.360]   They're drawing more people in.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.600]   Right from business.
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.440]   This is literally where people see this.
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.080]   Wait a minute.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.760]   A million people saw just this one segment.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.640]   So they not only gave up, I think they
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.760]   started posting themselves.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.920]   Twitter has gone, given us back the chronological fee.
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:14.200]   Now, feed, now Instagram is doing the same.
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.080]   Although I've seen people say, just wait until you get
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.440]   that chronological feed.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:20.640]   You'll realize why you didn't want it all along.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.440]   I disagree.
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.320]   I disagree too.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.480]   I love my chronological feed.
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.600]   I agree.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.240]   I like my algorithmic feed.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:27.560]   So we both can be happy.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:28.080]   Ah, she's.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:28.640]   You get both?
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.520]   Well, there we go.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.320]   Features have been launched into limited testing
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:32.400]   starting in January.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:37.560]   But today, it'll roll out to the entire global base
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.120]   of Instagram users.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:39.760]   Are you looking?
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:40.560]   Do you have it?
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.120]   Well, I haven't tried it yet.
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.920]   But there is one beef that I have with Instagram.
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:48.720]   And when I launch it, it's going to have a post that's
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.480]   showing, and then it quickly jumps on me.
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.040]   I know.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:52.880]   And you can never get back to that post.
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:54.320]   Oh, and now I didn't do it this time.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.360]   No, but it happened to me today.
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:59.040]   It was a picture of my daughter's birthday.
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:20:59.880]   And then it's gone.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:00.440]   And it was gone.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.040]   I can never get back to it.
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:03.240]   It's like, what are you doing?
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.760]   It's like I was probably scrolling and scrolling.
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:05.720]   It's cold.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:06.840]   So maybe that was just a bug.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:07.680]   Maybe that'll be fixed.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:09.280]   Maybe they fixed it now.
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.200]   Yeah, that was-- it's funny, because that happened to me.
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.080]   You just did it.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.000]   It did just do it again.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.280]   You just did it.
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.400]   I don't know why it does that.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:19.840]   So give me chronological and fix that bug, please.
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.560]   Thank you.
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.720]   This is on iOS and Android, but not on the web version of
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:25.240]   Instagram.
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:26.600]   They had to give you something.
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.280]   Users will be alerted to the new options following and
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:33.800]   favorites from a pop-up at the top left of the app under the
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:34.600]   word Instagram.
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:35.920]   From there, you can tap on the feed.
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.800]   That's kind of what Twitter does.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.720]   They have a little sparkle icon that no one knows what the
[01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:41.000]   hell is that.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.080]   Took me a while to figure out that's how you get back to
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.840]   the chronological feed on Twitter.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:46.640]   Let me check this.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.280]   Let me see what I've got here.
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:52.720]   I'm finding myself using Twitter mobile less to read.
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.560]   Just did the same thing, by the way, to me.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.280]   It showed something disappearing.
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.480]   Pop away, too.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.360]   So annoying.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:00.880]   So annoying.
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:04.400]   I wonder what Instagrams analytics are for people using
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.560]   the web interface.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:10.080]   Well, I use it for the show all the time.
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.720]   That's so much a week for you.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:15.440]   I use it when I click through something.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.760]   I use Instagram less and less.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.920]   In fact, I just saw a story that they want to become a
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:23.080]   shopping mall instead of--
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.320]   and it has been slowly changing to that from a
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.480]   photographic sharing site.
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:27.480]   Yeah, they move the buttons.
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.720]   And it just makes me want to use it less and less and less.
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:30.840]   I don't want to go to a shopping mall.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:31.680]   They move that one button.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.520]   But you buy things.
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:33.520]   They hit it for the first thing you do to shop.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.320]   Another reason why I don't want to go is I'll buy things.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.080]   That's the problem.
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.320]   Works on you.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.560]   Yeah.
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:40.640]   They're good ads.
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.120]   You have to admit, they are good ads on Instagram.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.120]   I'm going to delete it.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.240]   People buy a lot of that crap.
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.640]   Oh, geez.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:50.040]   Leo.
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:51.400]   Yeah, I know.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.640]   Why do you think I'm sitting out of a stick?
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:57.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:01.640]   You think I would have bought this in a store?
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:05.040]   You think I would have said, oh, that's perfect.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:08.160]   I need a chair with a little tiny seat.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.640]   That's the tenth the size of your rear ends.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.920]   The tenth the size of my feet, huh?
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:16.040]   You think if it weren't for Instagram, I'd be sitting
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:17.040]   on this.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.680]   He's been squirming all day.
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:21.560]   I'm so sorry.
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.560]   How long did this-- when did you get this?
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:25.560]   Middle of the night, it came.
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:26.560]   OK.
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:27.560]   It came last week.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:31.680]   I want to see your collection of capadamante.
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:33.000]   What's capadamante?
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   That's the tacky stuff they sold on QVC.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.560]   Oh, I got a lot of capadamante.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:39.080]   No.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:39.520]   Interesting.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.240]   I'm not getting a lot of ads right now.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:42.600]   No, I'm going to scroll through and see.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.400]   Oh, there's one.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:45.160]   Just beep.
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:47.120]   That's the other problem you probably see in a lot of ads
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.240]   not knowing it.
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.240]   You're thinking, oh, that's a nice picture.
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:51.400]   Oh, no, it's a stick.
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:52.920]   You sit on it.
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.520]   Oh, no.
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:57.080]   I think I'll get one of those.
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:58.680]   Let me buy that.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:01.040]   That should become comfortable.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:04.400]   Why help me understand why you purchased this?
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:08.480]   I mean, what is the same point for this?
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.760]   I'm genuine.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:11.400]   Is it food posture?
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.680]   It's a baby chair.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.280]   I thought it was for grownups.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:18.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:22.360]   No, it's for good posture.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.360]   Oh, OK.
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:23.840]   It's like--
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.960]   And again, notice he's been squirming for the last hour
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:26.960]   of time.
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:27.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:29.520]   Yeah, he's been rocking back and forth.
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:30.040]   Yeah.
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:33.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:35.240]   His ass is numb.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:36.240]   Yeah, just one second.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.040]   He can't kill one.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.280]   He's got a thing.
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:38.800]   He's got a thing.
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:41.040]   He's some sort of Stockholm syndrome.
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.320]   And I bought a second one.
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:44.760]   It's like, oh, this really hurts.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:45.760]   I need another.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.280]   It looks like a chair.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.960]   Photographers use that on the shoot,
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.760]   but it's just not as portable.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.400]   It's like, you know, the walking sticks you get
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.040]   where you unfold it.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:53.560]   Yeah.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:54.440]   Sit in it for about a minute.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.440]   That's exactly what this is.
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.040]   The old man who goes to the parade.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:24:59.880]   That's good enough.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:02.000]   Yeah, with a parade for the golf course.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.600]   So that's about it.
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:07.160]   The Capo de Monte porcelain is one of the glories
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.480]   of Neapolitan homemade.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.920]   It binds their origins to the splendor
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:13.720]   of the bourbon dynasty.
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:14.600]   Wait, what?
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:17.480]   In 1743, King Charles of bourbon and his wife,
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.800]   Amalia of Saxony, decided to find a center
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:23.960]   for porcelain production within the Regine Regia
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.840]   the Capo de Monte driven by the people with science.
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.320]   People with science stuff on QVC.
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:30.720]   Oh, this lovely nymph.
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.120]   With it with the--
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:34.200]   It's like hummel figurines.
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:34.720]   It's the same.
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:35.360]   Oh, it's worse than that.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.160]   Worse than hummels.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.120]   Oh, like the Yardro things or whatever?
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.240]   Yeah, like Yardro.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:39.840]   But worse.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:40.320]   Worse.
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:40.800]   Tackier.
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:42.720]   I need to see it.
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:43.360]   Show it to me.
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.200]   OK.
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:45.040]   Here it comes.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.720]   I'm sorry, audio people.
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:52.200]   You asked Capo de Monte, which means top of the mountain,
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:53.280]   right?
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:53.840]   I don't know.
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.680]   Capo de Monte.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:59.920]   Oh, here's a beautiful $350 floral arrangement.
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.880]   It's just the kind of thing your grandmother bought.
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.760]   And then you think you're going to sell it at her estate
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:05.800]   and nobody wants it.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:06.360]   No.
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:07.600]   Actually, we had these--
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.040]   What happens to kids?
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.440]   We had these exact flowers.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.640]   Oh, my god.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.720]   Here's a-- this is for you, Stacy.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:17.880]   If you send me that phone back, I will send you
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:20.200]   Put Chanelah with fruit.
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:23.960]   It is a great-- she's figurine with fruit punch made--
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:27.000]   Well, that looks like you too.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   That is like a nightmare.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.760]   It's scary.
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:33.840]   I think, though, it might be my new profile picture.
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:36.840]   Go for that.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:37.340]   Wow.
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:40.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:40.900]   OK.
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:45.180]   All right, they would spend hours selling this stuff on QVC.
[01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:48.260]   I would watch QVC if that's what they would sell.
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:48.740]   You know what?
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:51.060]   QVC is more modern now.
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:55.260]   All of the tech companies are getting into real life shopping.
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:57.700]   It's actually kind of scary.
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.300]   I-- somebody was saying, oh, they've
[01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:02.620]   got the Xbox Series X, which I've had a hard time finding.
[01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:04.540]   On QVC, I went-- I went to the website.
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:08.260]   They're selling it for twice the retail price.
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:10.540]   My mom's is a QVC shopper.
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:11.380]   I don't think it's--
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:12.820]   She's quite enjoys it.
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:16.460]   I'm about to talk to a woman-- oh, you guys know her.
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:17.660]   Hold on.
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:21.900]   It's one of the co-founders of iRobot, Griner.
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:23.780]   She has a new company called Turtle,
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:26.340]   which is a-- it's like a Roomba for your garden that does
[01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:26.860]   weeding.
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:28.180]   It's a 399 robot.
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:29.540]   I'm very excited about it.
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:32.060]   But they're going to launch on Home Shopping Network, which
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:33.300]   is basically like QVC.
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:34.300]   That's cool.
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:35.140]   So there's money.
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:38.860]   Now on QVC, it's gourmet holiday at the moment.
[01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:42.700]   If you go to qvc.com, you can go in and then click on what's
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:42.900]   now.
[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:43.900]   It's gourmet holiday.
[01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:46.340]   You can get just bagels from New York City.
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:48.580]   Oh, that's good.
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:56.060]   You can get Landy's Cafe, cups of meatballs in sauce.
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:28:03.100]   I have now, by the way, changed my avatar on the Discord.
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:05.860]   So I think you're going to enjoy this.
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:07.300]   It is--
[01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:07.820]   Oh, gosh.
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:10.460]   --looks just like me.
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:13.620]   For a thing.
[01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:17.580]   This dude is so weird.
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:18.580]   This dude.
[01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:19.580]   [SCREAMING]
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:22.580]   --to bring him back.
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:22.980]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:24.500]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:27.220]   The head of the mountain.
[01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:29.060]   Let's play the sound.
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:30.940]   And we'll do-- it is your total, your fault.
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:33.140]   But then-- but it was really Steph.
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:34.100]   But it brought joy.
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:34.740]   What's your name?
[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:35.240]   False.
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:35.940]   Yes, Stacy.
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:36.440]   Me.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:37.100]   That lady.
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:38.860]   That lady over on my right here.
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:42.820]   Because she said, oh, Jeff, fully knowledgeable, I think,
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:45.740]   now in hindsight as to the impact.
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:49.180]   What's Capo de Monte?
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:49.660]   And then I am.
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:53.340]   It sounded delicious.
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.300]   It's time for the Google.
[01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:56.060]   You know.
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:29:00.020]   The Google change log.
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:03.180]   See how fast we can get through this.
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:05.220]   Android 13, the next one.
[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:06.460]   What do we say that is?
[01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:07.180]   Tear me sous?
[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:08.420]   Tear me sous, what?
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:09.420]   Possibly.
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:09.700]   It will allegedly.
[01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:13.580]   We'll ask your permission to send notifications.
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:16.820]   As well it should.
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:21.900]   So apps will have to ask, oh, well, Apple does this.
[01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:24.820]   I didn't realize that this wasn't on Android.
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:26.340]   If I thought it does it too.
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:28.260]   Allow app to send you notifications.
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:30.260]   Allow, don't allow.
[01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:33.860]   It gives you the option to manage it.
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:37.660]   When you get a notification, you're like, God, why is HBO Max sending me a notification?
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:39.700]   Do you just open it up and you're like, stop that?
[01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:40.940]   This is now a requirement.
[01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:43.420]   I guess you could do it before.
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:49.820]   If an app was nice, but they didn't have to do it, apps targeting Android 13 will now
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:57.220]   need to request the notification permission from the user before posting anything at all.
[01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:59.140]   So that is a good improvement.
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:00.580]   That will be coming soon.
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:03.780]   It's already in the dev versions of Android 13.
[01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:08.180]   Speaking of Android 13, there is a new search in town.
[01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:15.540]   Pixel launcher search is at least testing showing results from Google Photos.
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:21.060]   So when you search now, you know how you do a search on your Android phone for an app,
[01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:24.380]   it will also, if you put a name in search for photos of that person.
[01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:28.420]   It will search across a whole bunch of domains in the photo.
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:31.340]   As well as Google Photos.
[01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:35.260]   So searching for screenshots will surf as a Google Photos branded carousel.
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:38.020]   He said it'll search outside of Google Photos.
[01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:41.100]   No, I think this says it's going to search your phone.
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:42.100]   Your phone.
[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:43.100]   Oh, OK.
[01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:44.700]   Which way to include photos?
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:45.700]   OK.
[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:47.980]   That's interesting.
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:51.900]   Especially if you actually tag people in your photos.
[01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:52.900]   Yeah.
[01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:53.900]   So there.
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:59.420]   Google Photos is updating its library and sharing tabs to make photos easier to find as well.
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:02.500]   Shortcuts to your screenshots.
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:06.260]   So that's a layout change basically to the interface.
[01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:09.500]   Don't be surprised when you see that.
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:10.780]   I appreciate them doing this.
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:12.380]   I haven't really cared for.
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:14.780]   It's not a great interface.
[01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:19.420]   I like this service being pretty quick on backing up and so forth and allowing me to just
[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:25.340]   get my images off of them fairly quickly but still just navigating on the phone is clear.
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:28.220]   Also an update coming for the Google Home app.
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:30.820]   Simpler controls improved privacy.
[01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:33.820]   I'm sure Stacey likes that.
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:36.540]   We talked about it on the show coming out tomorrow.
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:39.020]   What'd you say?
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:40.020]   We said we liked it.
[01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:41.020]   It's simple.
[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:45.300]   We like the privacy and apparently they're also going to change the event feed.
[01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:47.100]   So it'll be a little bit more.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:49.220]   It'll sort them in groups.
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:52.460]   It's always been a problem of mine because I'll get a thousand.
[01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:57.220]   If I go in the backyard and get a thousand notifications there's somebody in your backyard.
[01:31:57.220 --> 01:32:01.580]   So now it will kind of sort them into a group of things that happen with them a short space
[01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:04.420]   of time into one thing.
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:09.340]   The Android app will finally let you delete the last 15 minutes of your search history
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:12.780]   just like iPhone users.
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:16.260]   It came to the iOS app in the last summer.
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:19.740]   But for some reason Google denied it to Android users.
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:21.180]   They are now bringing it.
[01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:24.500]   So why would you want to delete the last 15 minutes of your search history?
[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:25.900]   It depends on who's looking at your phone.
[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:28.300]   Let's say you just murdered someone.
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:30.300]   Oh, of course.
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:32.300]   Not the great example of that.
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:33.300]   I think this is Higginbotha.
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:34.300]   Of course.
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:36.220]   You could.
[01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:43.940]   So the settings are now 36 months, 18 months, three months or 15 minutes.
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:44.940]   That's interesting.
[01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:46.740]   I thought there was a firm.
[01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:53.700]   So I was talking to a friend of mine who in his kids school, his teenager's school, he
[01:32:53.700 --> 01:33:01.940]   had his laptop and it was on the screen and he started typing the letter as you know
[01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:03.580]   when it was complete.
[01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:05.100]   Yeah, right.
[01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.100]   P.
[01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:07.100]   Oh, no.
[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:08.100]   Pornhub fired.
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:09.100]   Mm.
[01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:12.300]   Just because he typed the letter P. That's sad.
[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:13.700]   And it came up with one.
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:14.700]   He clicked.
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:15.700]   He must have clicked.
[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:17.060]   He have to return.
[01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:18.940]   But those keyboards believe me.
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:19.940]   It's easy to actually.
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:22.180]   I think a kid was using the computer.
[01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:23.180]   Yeah.
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:24.420]   And did that so often.
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:25.420]   I went through.
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:27.220]   Not before that my her or her, her destroy by the way.
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:30.380]   It just happened to go through my entire alphabet.
[01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:32.020]   Just to see what one letter will do.
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:33.020]   Yeah.
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:34.020]   Whatever we letter will do.
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:35.020]   Yeah.
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:36.020]   Yeah.
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:37.020]   That's bad.
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:38.020]   Yeah.
[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:39.020]   Okay.
[01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:41.820]   Fortunately, mine goes to fizz.org.
[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:42.820]   Hm.
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:43.820]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:44.820]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:45.820]   Yeah.
[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:46.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:47.820]   Yeah.
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:48.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:49.820]   Yeah.
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:50.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:51.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:52.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:53.820]   Yeah.
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:54.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:55.820]   Yeah.
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:56.820]   It's a good thing.
[01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:57.820]   I think it's a good thing.

[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:04.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:05.820]   Yeah.
[01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:06.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:07.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:13.820]   I think it's a good thing.

[01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:52.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:53.820]   I think it's a good thing.

[01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:33.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:34.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:35.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:36.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:37.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:38.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:39.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:40.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:41.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:42.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:43.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:44.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:45.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:46.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:47.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:48.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:49.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:50.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:51.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:52.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:53.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:54.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:55.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:56.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:56.820 --> 01:45:57.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:57.820 --> 01:45:59.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:00.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:01.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:02.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:03.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:04.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:05.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:06.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:07.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:08.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:09.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:10.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:11.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:12.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:13.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:14.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:15.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:16.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:17.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:18.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:19.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:20.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:21.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:22.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:23.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:24.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:25.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:26.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:27.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:28.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:29.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:30.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:31.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:32.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:33.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:34.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:35.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:35.820 --> 01:46:36.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:37.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:38.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:39.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:40.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:41.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:42.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:43.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:44.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:45.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:46.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:47.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:48.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:49.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:50.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:51.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:52.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:53.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:54.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:55.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:55.820 --> 01:46:56.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:56.820 --> 01:46:57.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:57.820 --> 01:46:58.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:58.820 --> 01:46:59.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:00.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:01.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:02.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:03.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:04.820]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:11.820]   We used ours probably four or five times a day every single day.
[01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:14.820]   The new one doesn't have the cool knob.
[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:15.820]   That's another one savings.
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:16.820]   I don't mind that much.
[01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:18.820]   What's funny is it runs Android.
[01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:22.820]   That's an Android little Android interface running there.
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:23.820]   It goes out on the net.
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:25.820]   It looks up recipes.
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:28.820]   What turned her around was she put Brussels sprouts in and said,
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:30.820]   "Are those Brussels sprouts?
[01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:31.820]   Would you like me to cook them?"
[01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:32.820]   She said, "Yes."
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:34.820]   20 minutes later, perfect Brussels sprouts.
[01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:35.820]   Did it add bacon?
[01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:36.820]   No.
[01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:37.820]   It's impossible.
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:38.820]   It's a good thing.
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:39.820]   No.
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:40.820]   She was like that.
[01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:42.820]   She was not a believer.
[01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:43.820]   No.
[01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:44.820]   No, I don't believe her.
[01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:45.820]   She believes today.
[01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:47.820]   She does.
[01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:50.820]   I'm telling you, she loves them.
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:52.820]   Grab yourself a replacement.
[01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:53.820]   We did.
[01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:54.820]   We don't regret it.
[01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:56.820]   You can use it as an air fryer now, which is kind of cool.
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:57.820]   Yeah, you should use it.
[01:47:57.820 --> 01:47:59.820]   We use it all the time.
[01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:02.820]   Thank you.
[01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:03.820]   What is yours?
[01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:04.820]   New thing.
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:05.820]   What else should I buy?
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:09.820]   Oh, by the way, I have to -- okay, this is before my thing.
[01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:11.820]   Remember the cocktail shaker?
[01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:12.820]   Yeah.
[01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:14.820]   It turns out they didn't send me the small gasket and they did.
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:15.820]   I just emailed them.
[01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:16.820]   I was like, "Hey."
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:17.820]   Yeah.
[01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:18.820]   I remember each other.
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:19.820]   That was why my thing.
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:20.820]   Now it's perfect.
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:21.820]   Oh, good.
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:22.820]   So they did send the gasket.
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:23.820]   You just didn't see it?
[01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:24.820]   Yeah.
[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:27.820]   They were super -- no, they didn't -- they sent me two of the big gaskets
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:29.820]   instead of a big gasket.
[01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:31.820]   Oh, yeah, I have small gaskets.
[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:33.820]   I didn't get one of those.
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:34.820]   Oh, good.
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:35.820]   Because we threw it away.
[01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:36.820]   So --
[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:37.820]   Yeah, you're fine.
[01:48:37.820 --> 01:48:38.820]   No, we didn't.
[01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:40.820]   It is, however --
[01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:43.820]   Up in the cupboard, waiting to make a martini --
[01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:44.820]   Now you should use it.
[01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:47.820]   -- for the next garage sale.
[01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:48.820]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:50.820]   You used it beforehand.
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:52.820]   I bought it right when you talked about it.
[01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:53.820]   I bought it for Christmas for Lisa.
[01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:54.820]   It didn't come.
[01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:56.820]   But fortunately, your birthday is one month later, so she --
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:57.820]   for her birthday.
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:48:59.820]   We haven't had a chance to use it.
[01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:00.820]   Maybe tonight, that reminds me.
[01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:01.820]   We should do it.
[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:02.820]   Could you imagine --
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:03.820]   I'll fill up.
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:04.820]   Okay.
[01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:05.820]   -- the report garage sale.
[01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:06.820]   Oh, you don't have to imagine it.
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:07.820]   Aunt already knows all about it.
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:08.820]   I love it.
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:10.820]   Happens usually every January.
[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:12.820]   It's so cool.
[01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:14.820]   It's in the conference room.
[01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:15.820]   I just bring a lot of crap.
[01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:16.820]   I love it.
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:17.820]   Yeah.
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:18.820]   There's one coming up.
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:20.820]   Maybe you'll mail you a device.
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:23.820]   It includes some other unsolicited objects.
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:27.820]   I shed gadgets as I go down the street.
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:30.820]   They just fall off of me.
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:32.820]   That's pretty awesome.
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:34.820]   I actually saw your article -- or maybe it was a tweet
[01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:38.820]   about these new Wi-Fi routers from Eero.
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:39.820]   Yes.
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:42.820]   So this is a 2000 word review.
[01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:45.820]   And I feel like it didn't even cover all the things one
[01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:46.820]   should cover.
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:47.820]   That's how crazy sounds.
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:48.820]   Well, there's one thing --
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:49.820]   -- the big --
[01:49:49.820 --> 01:49:50.820]   -- right up top.
[01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:51.820]   Six E, right?
[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:52.820]   Right.
[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:54.820]   So that's -- because I'm not a gadget nerd.
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:56.820]   I'm just a nerd nerd.
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:58.820]   I'm mostly excited about the fact that this year we're
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:03.820]   getting Wi-Fi 6E, which, to be honest, is not exciting in the
[01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:06.820]   sense that we can use it today because there's not a lot of
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:08.820]   6E capable devices.
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:11.820]   But it's awesome because we have 1200 megahertz of
[01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:15.820]   unlicensed spectrum for Wi-Fi that we can use, which is
[01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:16.820]   amazing.
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:17.820]   So --
[01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:18.820]   Is it 6 gigs?
[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:20.820]   Where is the 6E spectrum?
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:26.820]   It's technically in the 5.6 -- but it's called the 6
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:27.820]   gigahertz.
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:28.820]   So it's very high.
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:31.820]   So, you know, first I thought when they started doing 5
[01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:33.820]   gigahertz, I thought, well, that's going to be so high.
[01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:34.820]   It's not going to go anywhere.
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:38.820]   But that actually turns out to be it's real benefit because
[01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:39.820]   it doesn't go through walls.
[01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:43.820]   You don't get interference from neighbors or anybody or
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:44.820]   yourself.
[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:49.820]   And 6 is even better because you get these wide channel widths.
[01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:55.820]   So this Euro -- it supports 160 megahertz channels, which
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:59.820]   basically means you can pack a whole bunch of information in
[01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:01.820]   those megahertz and just send it all in one go.
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:04.820]   Like a really big dump truck full of stuff, full of data.
[01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:06.820]   How much is it?
[01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:09.820]   160 megahertz wide channels.
[01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:14.820]   So the entire FM band is 20 megahertz.
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:15.820]   Yeah.
[01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:18.820]   The entire AM band, I think, is --
[01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:20.820]   200 kilohertz.
[01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:22.820]   So that's a lot.
[01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:25.820]   You could get all the AM FM stations on there and then some.
[01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:26.820]   Wow.
[01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:27.820]   Wow.
[01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:28.820]   That's pretty good.
[01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:30.820]   Like 5G, it's up there.
[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:32.820]   So it does attenuate.
[01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:34.820]   It doesn't go through walls.
[01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:37.820]   This is a short distance for prime usage.
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:42.820]   But -- so there's a -- orbi, lincis, asus.
[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:44.820]   They all have these routers out.
[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:47.820]   So this is just the latest is Eros routers.
[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:49.820]   And I -- I like Eros.
[01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:50.820]   I'm testing them now.
[01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:51.820]   Yeah.
[01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:52.820]   A lot of people do.
[01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:53.820]   They're user friendly.
[01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:54.820]   Yeah.
[01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:56.820]   I've heard you say a couple of times short distance.
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:59.820]   What exactly is considered short distance when you're talking
[01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:02.820]   about this particular wavelength?
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:04.820]   It depends on your environment.
[01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:07.820]   But think a couple of feet.
[01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:11.820]   Well, think -- not tens of feet.
[01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:12.820]   Like 10 feet.
[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:13.820]   It's a room.
[01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:14.820]   It's basically a room.
[01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:15.820]   It's a room.
[01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:16.820]   Yeah.
[01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:18.820]   So but that's good because you don't -- if you have a neighbor
[01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:21.820]   in an apartment next to you or even a house nowadays, people blast
[01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:22.820]   their Wi-Fi.
[01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:23.820]   Yeah.
[01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:24.820]   That won't interfere with yours.
[01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:25.820]   Okay.
[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:27.820]   Do you have any 6E devices?
[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:28.820]   I do.
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:30.820]   I have the phone you sent me.
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:31.820]   It was literally the only.
[01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:32.820]   It was funny.
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:33.820]   You shit ass.
[01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:35.820]   It was the only 6G device.
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:36.820]   I actually knew that.
[01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:37.820]   I was so excited.
[01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:40.820]   Because throughout the review, it says, "When testing speeds
[01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:44.820]   in the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 in my dining room, and a Samsung
[01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:48.820]   Galaxy Z Fold 3 has a Wi-Fi 6E capable radio."
[01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:49.820]   That's good.
[01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:51.820]   I'm glad that makes it even better that you got that.
[01:52:51.820 --> 01:52:54.820]   Because otherwise, you wouldn't be able to test it.
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:55.820]   Yeah.
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:56.820]   Yeah.
[01:52:56.820 --> 01:52:58.820]   But that's a good point is most people do not have devices
[01:52:58.820 --> 01:52:59.820]   that will take advantage.
[01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:00.820]   Yeah.
[01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:02.820]   You don't need to rush out and buy this.
[01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:03.820]   Two years maybe.
[01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:04.820]   I highly --
[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:05.820]   Soon.
[01:53:05.820 --> 01:53:08.820]   You know, here's -- you should buy it if you've got like -- if you
[01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:12.820]   have a press -- like your Wi-Fi 5 router just broke, then sure.
[01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:13.820]   Go get this.
[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:14.820]   You didn't go ahead.
[01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:16.820]   Or get a 6E capable router.
[01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:17.820]   You can decide if you want to.
[01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:19.820]   I would because it's a standard now and so devices will start
[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:20.820]   coming out.
[01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:21.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:23.820]   You know, most phones now are Wi-Fi 6.
[01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:25.820]   It just took a little while.
[01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:28.820]   But don't -- I mean, again, you don't have to rush.
[01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:31.820]   If you're going to upgrade your computer or phone and you're
[01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:34.820]   going to have a 6G -- I would say whenever you get your first
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:37.820]   6G device that you're really stoked about, you know, then you
[01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:42.820]   can go buy your first -- sorry, 6E device.
[01:53:42.820 --> 01:53:47.820]   Then go and get this to go with it.
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:51.820]   Or go and get a 6E capable router.
[01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:56.820]   Now, I will say like the Orbeez and the Linksys, both of those
[01:53:56.820 --> 01:53:58.820]   are like $1,500, $1,200.
[01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:00.820]   And they're multi-multigigigabit.
[01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:04.820]   Like I think it's 8 and 11 gigabits respectively.
[01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:09.820]   Eero's done a nice job in the sense that if you don't have -- if
[01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:12.820]   you have a gigabit connection, this is going to be fine for you.
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:15.820]   If you've got a small office, you know, go up.
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:19.820]   If you've got machines capable of transferring data inside
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:24.820]   your LAN, or it would be your WAN.
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:26.820]   Or it would be your WAN.
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:27.820]   Sorry.
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:30.820]   I was like, let me get there.
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:33.820]   Then I guess, but it seems like overkill.
[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:37.820]   Like the cool thing for this story is I think Eero's probably
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:40.820]   taken to the right tack, recognizing what we have available as
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:44.820]   bandwidth for consumers and serving something that is -- it's
[01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:46.820]   still kind of pricey.
[01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:47.820]   You know what's though?
[01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:49.820]   It's about the same price as the older Eros.
[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:50.820]   So they're kind of --
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:52.820]   I'm so pissed that I have the older Eros.
[01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:53.820]   Yeah.
[01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:54.820]   I think they said a lot of money for --
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:57.820]   When Eero came out, they were considered really, really
[01:54:57.820 --> 01:54:58.820]   expensive.
[01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:01.820]   But he else has gone up and gone beyond them now.
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:06.820]   And Eero's kind of stayed at that $500 price book, which is good.
[01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:09.820]   And so -- and they also launched -- I didn't review these,
[01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:12.820]   but they launched the 6 Plus, and then they lowered their price
[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:14.820]   on their regular 6 ones.
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:18.820]   So -- and on as it -- the final thing I'll say about this
[01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:21.820]   because I really was curious and have been for a while.
[01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:25.820]   Nick Weaver, who is the CEO of Eero, he said, "Hey, you know what?
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:29.820]   Five years is about the right time for transfer, like, switching
[01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:30.820]   out your own."
[01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:31.820]   I'd say that's right.
[01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:32.820]   I'd agree with him.
[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:33.820]   And I agree with him.
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:35.820]   Because technologies change.
[01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:37.820]   Unfortunately, security issues crop up.
[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:38.820]   Sometimes they don't get patched.
[01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:41.820]   It's probably a good idea every four or five years to update your
[01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:42.820]   router.
[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:43.820]   I agree.
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:44.820]   So there you go.
[01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:48.820]   How fast did you do a bandwidth test on the fine Samsung
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:49.820]   Galaxy Flip?
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:51.820]   I did.
[01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:54.820]   And you know, I can't get above 500 megabits per second.
[01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:56.820]   Anywhere in my house on the device.
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:56:00.820]   Yes, it is fine, but I do have a gig of it.
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:01.820]   Yeah.
[01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:02.820]   Yeah.
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:05.820]   It's always half what the nominal speed is.
[01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:07.820]   Yeah, internally the --
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:10.820]   It's not a rule, but it's very common.
[01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:11.820]   Seems to be the --
[01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:12.820]   Yeah, fine.
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:13.820]   I'd say 50 to 60 percent.
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:14.820]   Mm-hmm.
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:15.820]   Of fire.
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:18.820]   But it is -- so I will say these are, like, two and a half
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:22.820]   to three X faster than my existing -- like, all of my existing
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:26.820]   devices ran two to -- two and a half to three times faster.
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:27.820]   That's been a big change.
[01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:32.820]   Phones have gotten even on 5G, but even on Wi-Fi, they've gotten
[01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:33.820]   much faster.
[01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:36.820]   It used to be the phone, even if you could get a 500 megabit
[01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:39.820]   connection, couldn't do more than 100 or 200.
[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:41.820]   They really -- they put better chips in there and better
[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:44.820]   radios, and they're much faster than they used to be.
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:47.820]   Do you know if the iPhones have an upload limit?
[01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:50.820]   Because my husband noticed when he was testing on his iPhone, he
[01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:54.820]   could not get more than, like, 120-something or 130.
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:55.820]   And I didn't know --
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:56.820]   Oh, they may --
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:57.820]   That was a function --
[01:56:57.820 --> 01:56:58.820]   They may be --
[01:56:58.820 --> 01:56:59.820]   You know what?
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:00.820]   Let me look.
[01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:03.820]   I don't think I've ever seen more than 100 megabits up.
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:04.820]   So maybe there is a limit.
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:05.820]   Yeah.
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:07.820]   That may be -- I don't know.
[01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:08.820]   Well, what would you --
[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:09.820]   Why would you throttle up?
[01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:11.820]   Well, you don't -- for one thing, you don't want to saturate
[01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:14.820]   the connections, because if you do, then if you're using the
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:16.820]   maximum upstream, your downstream stops.
[01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:17.820]   Mm-hmm.
[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:19.820]   So -- but it also probably used to save money.
[01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:20.820]   I don't know.
[01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:21.820]   I'll investigate.
[01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:22.820]   That's a good question.
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:23.820]   I do not know.
[01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:27.820]   I'm actually pretty excited because the new Max, the Max
[01:57:27.820 --> 01:57:33.820]   Studios, and some of the M1s support 10-gigabit Ethernet.
[01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:34.820]   Mm-hmm.
[01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:37.820]   And we, as it turns out, have 10-gigabit symmetric
[01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:41.820]   Ethernet from Sonic, which nothing we've had has been able to
[01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:42.820]   use.
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:46.820]   But I now can -- so I asked Russell, I said, "Is there any way I
[01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:48.820]   get a 10-gigabit drop in my office?"
[01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:49.820]   He said, "Yes."
[01:57:49.820 --> 01:57:51.820]   So we'll see.
[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:52.820]   I will be --
[01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:54.820]   So you're going to load a bunch of shows simultaneously.
[01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:56.820]   Well, he said -- it doesn't really matter because there's no
[01:57:56.820 --> 01:57:59.820]   website going to be able to keep up anyway.
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:02.820]   But, you know, faster is always better.
[01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:04.820]   We are at the point now where we're really as fast as any
[01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:07.820]   website ever is going to be, I think.
[01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:10.820]   But yeah, if you're downloading something from a very fast
[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:11.820]   site -- actually, you know what?
[01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:15.820]   He said that the Google Drive storage -- we are in --
[01:58:15.820 --> 01:58:18.820]   our editors have 10-gigabit at their desktops as well.
[01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:22.820]   And he's noticed that the Google Drive uploads are very fast.
[01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:25.820]   Not 10, maybe, but much faster.
[01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:27.820]   Gigabits faster.
[01:58:27.820 --> 01:58:29.820]   So yeah, you can.
[01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:30.820]   You can.
[01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:31.820]   So here we go.
[01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:35.820]   Support Scooter X on the job for my chat room.
[01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:39.820]   iPhone Wi-Fi specifications.
[01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:41.820]   Channel bandwidth.
[01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:44.820]   Does this say what this just says?
[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:49.820]   What they can do -- oh, yeah, here we go.
[01:58:49.820 --> 01:58:53.820]   Maximum data rate.
[01:58:53.820 --> 01:59:01.820]   It does look like -- on BG&N, the -- is this up or down?
[01:59:01.820 --> 01:59:03.820]   I don't know.
[01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:04.820]   I'll have to -- I'll have to --
[01:59:04.820 --> 01:59:05.820]   >> Yeah, I was going to say.
[01:59:05.820 --> 01:59:06.820]   >> It's hard to tell.
[01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:07.820]   I have to look at this more carefully.
[01:59:07.820 --> 01:59:09.820]   >> It may just be a weird thing on his phone.
[01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:11.820]   I don't know.
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:15.820]   >> You should try it with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3.
[01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:16.820]   See how it works.
[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:17.820]   >> I did.
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:18.820]   >> What's the upscrew?
[01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:19.820]   >> It works really well.
[01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:20.820]   Hold on.
[01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:23.820]   Let me go back to my -- I do not realize off the top of my head.
[01:59:23.820 --> 01:59:27.820]   The upstream was -- hold on.
[01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:29.820]   Which is straight --
[01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:30.820]   341.
[01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:31.820]   >> Wow.
[01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:32.820]   >> It's per second up.
[01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:33.820]   >> Wow.
[01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:34.820]   >> Wow.
[01:59:34.820 --> 01:59:35.820]   >> It was pretty nice.
[01:59:35.820 --> 01:59:36.820]   >> Good.
[01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:40.820]   >> I was like, I could film a movie on my Samsung Galaxy 4 3.
[01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:41.820]   >> It's a cool 3.
[01:59:41.820 --> 01:59:42.820]   >> It's a cool 3.
[01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:43.820]   >> It's a cool 3.
[01:59:43.820 --> 01:59:44.820]   >> It's a cool 3.
[01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:45.820]   >> It's a cool 3.
[01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:46.820]   >> It's a cool 3.
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:47.820]   >> It's a cool 3.
[01:59:47.820 --> 01:59:48.820]   >> It's a cool 3.
[01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:49.820]   >> It's a cool 3.
[01:59:49.820 --> 01:59:50.820]   >> Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:51.820]   >> Well, let me see if you want to do this.
[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:52.820]   I'll -- a quick mention for a quick plug.
[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:54.820]   Our friend, near it, Weiss Blatt, her book, Techlash, which was on
[01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:55.820]   the show, cost $100.
[01:59:55.820 --> 01:59:57.820]   It comes out tomorrow on paper back in $25.
[01:59:57.820 --> 01:59:58.820]   >> Oh, good.
[01:59:58.820 --> 01:59:59.820]   >> It's a very good book.
[01:59:59.820 --> 02:00:00.820]   Highly recommend.
[02:00:00.820 --> 02:00:01.820]   >> It is.
[02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:02.820]   >> Yeah.
[02:00:02.820 --> 02:00:03.820]   >> I don't know if you want to do this later or not.
[02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:09.820]   >> But Cory Booker, my senator, just gave an amazing minute during the
[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:11.820]   hearings that's going around video like crazy online.
[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:13.820]   >> I did see what he said.
[02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:14.820]   Let's play a little bit of this.
[02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:20.820]   This is during the Katanji Brown Jackson hearings for Supreme Court.
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:25.820]   Booker, of course, is taking her testimony among others, among
[02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:27.820]   the other senators.
[02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:30.820]   Here was what he had to say about her experience so far.
[02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:35.820]   >> As Langston Hughes wrote, "Oh, let America be America again.
[02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:40.820]   The land that never has been yet but yet must be the land where
[02:00:40.820 --> 02:00:41.820]   everyone is free."
[02:00:41.820 --> 02:00:45.820]   Oh, yes, I say it playing America never was America to me, but
[02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:51.820]   I swear this oath, America will be.
[02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:54.820]   That is the story of how you got to this desk.
[02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:59.820]   You and I and everyone here, generations of folk who came here
[02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:01.820]   and said America.
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:02.820]   I'm Irish.
[02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:05.820]   You may say, "No, Irish or dogs need to ply, but I'm going to
[02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:08.820]   show this country that I can be free here.
[02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:12.820]   I can make this country love me as much as I love it."
[02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:17.820]   Chinese Americans first forced into mere slave labor building our
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:20.820]   railroads, connecting our country.
[02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:23.820]   So the ugliest of America, but they were going to build their
[02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:24.820]   home here to America.
[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:28.820]   You may not love me yet, but I'm going to make this nation live up
[02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:30.820]   to its promise and hope.
[02:01:30.820 --> 02:01:37.820]   LGBTQ Americans from Stonewall women to Seneca, hidden
[02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:40.820]   figures who didn't even get their play until some Hollywood
[02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:43.820]   movie finally talked about them and how they were critical for
[02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:44.820]   us defying gravity.
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:48.820]   All of these people loved America.
[02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:51.820]   And so you faced insults here that were shocking to me.
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:52.820]   Well, actually not shocking.
[02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:53.820]   >> Not shocking.
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:55.820]   >> Oh, she's tearing up.
[02:01:55.820 --> 02:01:56.820]   >> Yeah.
[02:01:56.820 --> 02:02:00.820]   >> You are here because of that kind of love.
[02:02:00.820 --> 02:02:03.820]   And nobody's taken this away from me.
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:06.820]   So you got five more folk to go through.
[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:09.820]   Five more of us.
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:11.820]   And then you can sit back and let us have all the debates.
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:14.820]   And I'm going to tell you it's going to be a well-charted
[02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:18.820]   Senate 4 because it's not going to stop.
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:21.820]   They're going to accuse you of this and that heck in honor of
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:23.820]   your person who shares your birthday.
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:25.820]   You might be called a communist.
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:29.820]   But don't worry, my sister.
[02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:33.820]   Don't worry.
[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:35.820]   God has got you.
[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:37.820]   And how do I know that?
[02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:39.820]   Because you're here.
[02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:46.820]   And I know what it's taken for you to sit in that seat.
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:50.820]   >> He said your ancestors would be proud.
[02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:51.820]   That was a nice speech.
[02:02:51.820 --> 02:02:54.820]   Now, I'm cynical and I know some others are and it obviously
[02:02:54.820 --> 02:02:58.820]   was a prepared speech, but still beautiful, really beautiful.
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:00.820]   >> Also, you used poetry.
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:02.820]   >> Yeah, I love that poem.
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:03.820]   That's a beautiful poem.
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:04.820]   >> Way to go.
[02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:07.820]   Like saying, you know, you've had a really crappy time.
[02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:10.820]   And people have asked you a ton of really crap questions.
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:15.820]   Let me just give you X amount of time and just build you back up.
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:16.820]   >> Yeah.
[02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:18.820]   >> And wait a minute.
[02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:20.820]   Be unselfish choreography.
[02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:21.820]   >> Yeah.
[02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:25.820]   >> I was thinking that probably once they get to the Supreme
[02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:29.820]   Court and their chambers, I mean, now they've crossed that final
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:30.820]   hurdle.
[02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:31.820]   That's it.
[02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:33.820]   They don't have to worry for the rest of their lives about anything
[02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:35.820]   so bad ever again.
[02:03:35.820 --> 02:03:39.820]   And I imagine they sit around going, "Well, not a bitch."
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:41.820]   Man, that was bad.
[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:42.820]   But you made it.
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:43.820]   You made it through.
[02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:45.820]   Well, we hope she does.
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:47.820]   She's definitely qualified.
[02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:48.820]   Good.
[02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:49.820]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:52.820]   >> No, I don't think I'm going to play that, but it was a good idea.
[02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:53.820]   What else you got?
[02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:54.820]   >> Good for...
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:55.820]   >> No, I'm just kidding.
[02:03:55.820 --> 02:03:56.820]   Just kidding.
[02:03:56.820 --> 02:03:57.820]   >> Just like what?
[02:03:57.820 --> 02:03:59.820]   >> I was very confused there.
[02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:03.820]   You kept saying as if I had a choice, now you may not want to do
[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:07.820]   this, but you're going to say we don't do politics in the show,
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:09.820]   of course, or you're going to say, "No, no, no, Jeff."
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:12.820]   I really want that Benedict Evans advertising column for you to go
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:13.820]   through it in detail.
[02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:14.820]   >> Ooh.
[02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:16.820]   >> No, we're going to skip that one this week.
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:17.820]   How about you, Ant?
[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:18.820]   You got a thing?
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:19.820]   >> Yeah.
[02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:23.820]   One thing is something totally random and odd that I do on Saturdays
[02:04:23.820 --> 02:04:28.820]   or Sundays, and it's called LA Flights, and it is a group of
[02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:33.820]   gentlemen that go to the LA airport, set up a couple of cameras
[02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:37.820]   and livestream a couple days a week for like 12 hours straight
[02:04:37.820 --> 02:04:42.820]   of just watching the airplanes come in and they talk about it.
[02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:47.820]   And it's beautiful video quality, beautiful audio.
[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:51.820]   I don't know how they're doing it, but I'm sure Alex Lindsey knows
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:52.820]   how to do it.
[02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:53.820]   >> I know who knows.
[02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:57.820]   Johnny Jett knows they hang out at the In-N-Out Burger outside LA
[02:04:57.820 --> 02:05:00.820]   airport, which has a very good view of the runway.
[02:05:00.820 --> 02:05:02.820]   >> I think that's what Johnny said was the In-N-Out.
[02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:03.820]   >> It is great.
[02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:06.820]   I love watching it, and I'll watch it for hours and just like great
[02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:07.820]   white noise for me.
[02:05:07.820 --> 02:05:10.820]   And I said, "I should share this because I do this every day."
[02:05:10.820 --> 02:05:13.820]   >> You must be a member because I can't -- some of this is
[02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:14.820]   members-only content.
[02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:15.820]   >> Oh, I guess I am.
[02:05:15.820 --> 02:05:17.820]   I may be paying for it.
[02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:18.820]   >> Yeah.
[02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:19.820]   Look at that.
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:20.820]   I can't see it.
[02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:21.820]   >> I guess I need to look.
[02:05:21.820 --> 02:05:22.820]   >> Oh, I'm in the members-only section.
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:23.820]   Here we go.
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:24.820]   >> I need to look.
[02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:27.820]   But yeah, I like LA flights on YouTube.
[02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:32.820]   And then next was a pick that came from a friend of mine and
[02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:35.820]   another listener of Twig.
[02:05:35.820 --> 02:05:37.820]   It's the sound of Merlin.
[02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:42.820]   I've never seen this app, and I thought it was quite awesome
[02:05:42.820 --> 02:05:46.820]   because now I just go outside and hold my phone up and it will
[02:05:46.820 --> 02:05:50.820]   help identify the birds that are making all of the dad gum noise
[02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:52.820]   at 5 a.m. in the morning.
[02:05:52.820 --> 02:05:53.820]   I'll give you a hint.
[02:05:53.820 --> 02:05:54.820]   They're all crows.
[02:05:54.820 --> 02:05:55.820]   Every damn one of them.
[02:05:55.820 --> 02:05:56.820]   >> Well, it ain't that.
[02:05:56.820 --> 02:05:57.820]   It ain't crows.
[02:05:57.820 --> 02:05:58.820]   >> No, it's the songbirds, man.
[02:05:58.820 --> 02:05:59.820]   >> I get those.
[02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:02.820]   I get the stupid turkey.
[02:06:02.820 --> 02:06:05.820]   And of course, the hawks and stuff are out there.
[02:06:05.820 --> 02:06:06.820]   >> Do you get doves?
[02:06:06.820 --> 02:06:07.820]   We have some doves.
[02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:08.820]   >> Yeah, those doves.
[02:06:08.820 --> 02:06:09.820]   >> Oh, look.
[02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:10.820]   >> She's got --
[02:06:10.820 --> 02:06:11.820]   >> This was so great.
[02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:12.820]   >> Oh, look.
[02:06:12.820 --> 02:06:13.820]   >> When you share this.
[02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:14.820]   >> This is only for visual now.
[02:06:14.820 --> 02:06:18.820]   >> So, the anniversary gift is a bird diagram.
[02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:20.820]   This comes from Cornell, actually.
[02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:21.820]   This is really cool.
[02:06:21.820 --> 02:06:22.820]   >> Yeah.
[02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:24.820]   >> Yeah, it has like three or four different components.
[02:06:24.820 --> 02:06:25.820]   You have a visual component.
[02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:28.820]   You also have an audio component that you have to download.
[02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:31.820]   And of course, it's going to want your location and the app to
[02:06:31.820 --> 02:06:35.820]   sort of help, you know, figure out what exactly is around you.
[02:06:35.820 --> 02:06:39.820]   But that's the sound of the Merlin app.
[02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:40.820]   >> Android.
[02:06:40.820 --> 02:06:44.820]   >> I will tell you y'all, I have used the Merlin app.
[02:06:44.820 --> 02:06:47.820]   It's one of my, you know, I've got like my identify mountains,
[02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:48.820]   identify plains.
[02:06:48.820 --> 02:06:49.820]   I also have the Merlin app.
[02:06:49.820 --> 02:06:50.820]   >> Oh, really?
[02:06:50.820 --> 02:06:51.820]   It is awesome.
[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:53.820]   >> You have a thing about identifying stuff.
[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:55.820]   >> I like to know what's around me.
[02:06:55.820 --> 02:06:56.820]   It's fun.
[02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:57.820]   >> It's cool.
[02:06:57.820 --> 02:06:58.820]   I like it.
[02:06:58.820 --> 02:06:59.820]   Yeah.
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:00.820]   That's very cool.
[02:07:00.820 --> 02:07:02.820]   And finally, lastly, I just want to give a shout out to somebody
[02:07:02.820 --> 02:07:04.820]   we all know and love.
[02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:06.820]   It felt good because I was like, oh, I've had that.
[02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:08.820]   And she hasn't had it yet.
[02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:14.820]   Miss Lisa Laport was sharing a wine called Black Girl Magic.
[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:19.820]   And it is a great, great, great tasting wine.
[02:07:19.820 --> 02:07:20.820]   This is a red blend.
[02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:23.820]   I've had their Riesling, but it's the McBride sisters.
[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:26.820]   And I just want to show them some love.
[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:29.820]   >> Two black women out of Paso Robles.
[02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:30.820]   >> Yeah.
[02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:34.820]   >> And it's funny, we uncorked it for the Jackson Brown hearings.
[02:07:34.820 --> 02:07:36.820]   That's what she was telling me this morning.
[02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:38.820]   >> She's like, yeah, I'm going to have something to mind.
[02:07:38.820 --> 02:07:41.820]   >> She says, watching Katanji Brown Jackson's hearings for a
[02:07:41.820 --> 02:07:44.820]   Supreme Court seat now, looking forward to her confirmation.
[02:07:44.820 --> 02:07:45.820]   A little Black Girl Magic.
[02:07:45.820 --> 02:07:46.820]   >> Check it out.
[02:07:46.820 --> 02:07:47.820]   >> That's a little sisterhood.
[02:07:47.820 --> 02:07:48.820]   >> Yeah.
[02:07:48.820 --> 02:07:49.820]   >> Go and take the airwaves.
[02:07:49.820 --> 02:07:50.820]   >> It was quite good.
[02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:51.820]   >> Mm-hmm.
[02:07:51.820 --> 02:07:52.820]   >> Yeah.
[02:07:52.820 --> 02:07:53.820]   Nice.
[02:07:53.820 --> 02:07:54.820]   >> I've been trying to please.
[02:07:54.820 --> 02:07:55.820]   >> She said, should I tweet this?
[02:07:55.820 --> 02:07:56.820]   I said, hell yeah.
[02:07:56.820 --> 02:07:57.820]   Hell yeah.
[02:07:57.820 --> 02:08:01.820]   And then we were waiting to see if you reacted because if you
[02:08:01.820 --> 02:08:03.820]   approved, then we know it was okay.
[02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:07.820]   >> Well, I also just, I dig Miss Lisa because she's helping me get
[02:08:07.820 --> 02:08:11.820]   my wine game on, you know, because I'm still new to all this stuff.
[02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:12.820]   >> Yeah.
[02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:17.820]   >> And that particular resling we were discussing, it threw me off a
[02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:22.820]   bit because when I, nose did, it smelled like fresh cut grass.
[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:23.820]   >> That's good.
[02:08:23.820 --> 02:08:25.820]   >> I didn't like that.
[02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:27.820]   >> I was like, ooh, this is not my thing.
[02:08:27.820 --> 02:08:28.820]   >> You have a very good nose.
[02:08:28.820 --> 02:08:32.820]   >> But I had it with fish and it was delicious.
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:33.820]   >> Yeah.
[02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:36.820]   >> But the nose just sort of threw me off.
[02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:38.820]   >> Thank you, Aunt Pruitt, hands on photography.
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:41.820]   What do you be covering this next couple of weeks here?
[02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:43.820]   >> Well, we got a lot going on.

[02:08:51.820 --> 02:08:52.820]   >> Mm-hmm.
[02:08:52.820 --> 02:08:53.820]   >> Yeah.
[02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:56.820]   And we have our moon photography challenge, so folks go ahead and
[02:08:56.820 --> 02:08:57.820]   keep sending in your photos.
[02:08:57.820 --> 02:08:59.820]   I've been seeing a bunch come in.
[02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:01.820]   Make sure it's something fairly new.
[02:09:01.820 --> 02:09:03.820]   Don't send me something you shot last year.
[02:09:03.820 --> 02:09:06.820]   The whole point of these challenges are for you to get off your

[02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:14.820]   We were talking about Kevin yesterday, or maybe it was Sunday.
[02:12:14.820 --> 02:12:15.820]   Oh, chat room, do you remember?
[02:12:15.820 --> 02:12:18.820]   >> Steam was a steam on the Chromebook.
[02:12:18.820 --> 02:12:20.820]   >> No, Kevin came up with a term.
[02:12:20.820 --> 02:12:24.820]   He was the first when he was at Gigalm to use a term that we all
[02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:28.820]   use now, and I can't remember what it was, but--
[02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:29.820]   >> Okay, great.
[02:12:29.820 --> 02:12:30.820]   >> Maybe it was on Macbreak yesterday.
[02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:32.820]   I cannot remember.
[02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:33.820]   Oh, well.
[02:12:33.820 --> 02:12:34.820]   >> Oh, chat room.
[02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:36.820]   >> Anyway, I hope his ears are burning because we were talking
[02:12:36.820 --> 02:12:38.820]   about him on the show the other day.
[02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:40.820]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:41.820]   >> Thank y'all.
[02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:42.820]   This went so fast.
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:44.820]   I didn't even have time to get hungry, so--
[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:46.820]   >> That's because Leo's butt is--
[02:12:46.820 --> 02:12:47.820]   >> Thanks, you share.
[02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:49.820]   >> Thank the chair.
[02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:52.820]   Man, I wish we had that wide camera going.
[02:12:52.820 --> 02:12:53.820]   No, see the day.
[02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:56.820]   It's been so funny, just watching you guys.
[02:12:56.820 --> 02:12:58.820]   >> Oh, Lord.
