[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.500]   Gina is not in Beta.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500]   She is full release.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.500]   Oh no, no. I'm like pre-alpha.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.500]   I have a lot of work to do.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500]   I have a lot of work to do.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.500]   Oh, do I know that feeling.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.500]   Also with this, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, hey, we're glad to have you.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.500]   We thought you'd be on a plane, but I guess you came home early.
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.500]   No, I just came home one time, which Newark is amazing.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.500]   Congratulations.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.500]   Thank you.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.500]   Yes, I was in, I went to Brussels.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.500]   I went to Rome for a day, then back to Brussels, then London.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.500]   No, I'm here.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.500]   Wow, wow, wow.
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.500]   And you saw Vince Serf speaking in Rome, it looked like?
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.500]   I saw him speaking in Rome, and then I interviewed him in London at the Guardian Act.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.500]   Wow, wow.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.500]   Which was a ball.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   I can't wait for the video to go up and I'll send it to you all.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.500]   It was just great.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.500]   It'll be on the Guardian.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   It's amazing.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.500]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.500]   He is the sweetest guy.
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.500]   I love Vince Serf.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   I'll give you the punchline of the whole thing.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.500]   So we finished, we talked about lots of fascinating things, the NSA security.
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.500]   Wow, I'd love to hear what he thinks about NSA.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.500]   We can talk about that in a second.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.500]   But the punchline was at the end.
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.500]   I said, "Oh, and Vince just moved to East Dakota, London."
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   And I said, "I figured he would just, I said, "Vint, why London?"
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.500]   Figuring he would just, he prays on the audience.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.500]   He said, "Have you heard of Downton Abbey?"
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.500]   He said, "My wife has Downton Abbey I guess."
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.500]   And we had to visit every darn few cows there is.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.500]   And now we're a little bit of London for six months.
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.500]   Isn't that neat?
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.500]   He's very devoted to his wife, by the way.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.500]   It's really sweet, the two of them.
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.500]   And she's deaf, but had a cochlear implant.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.500]   And he was, or was it him?
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.500]   No, it was her, I think.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500]   He's also hard of hearing.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.500]   He's very hard of hearing.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.460]   And there was a moment, I like to go out when I do events and I play Oprah and go to
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.460]   film or film depending upon your metaphor.
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.460]   And I go into the room with the microphone and I keep conversation going and so on and so forth.
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.460]   And when I went out, Vint very nicely said, "I could have a problem with this.
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.460]   I may need you up here, Jeff, to help you with questions."
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.460]   And so I ran back up and so then somebody said something, "Well, I'll speak louder."
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.460]   And he said, "No, no, no."
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.460]   And I saw the problem.
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.460]   He said, "Jeff speaks American."
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.460]   [laughter]
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.460]   More specifically East Coast, more specifically New York.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.460]   [laughter]
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.460]   A bit was just charming as to be both Rome and London.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.460]   He's just the greatest.
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.460]   What a thrill and honor to be able to talk to Vint Cerf and someone who has changed the
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.460]   world this much.
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.460]   I think it's not improper to call him the father.
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.460]   He would demure, but it's not improper to call him the father of the Internet.
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.460]   No, no, he's joke.
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.460]   I'm sure it's the standard joke he uses often and has for years.
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.460]   He said the question is, "Who's the mother?"
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.460]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.460]   He has been using that for years.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.460]   I will vouch for that.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.460]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.460]   He also said that his son was basically born the same year as the Nat.
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.460]   Wow.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.460]   And so his son used to ask him, "Dad, is the Internet my brother?"
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.460]   Wow.
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.460]   If you're the father, and of course Aaron Newcomb's here from NetApp.
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.460]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.460]   Good to be here.
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.460]   But you've been on every show.
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.460]   You were on all about Android last night.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.460]   Yes.
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.460]   All about Android last night.
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.460]   So I just pulled up the cot and then got out the morning.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.460]   Regular floss.
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.460]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.460]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.460]   They didn't have to move the cameras or anything.
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.460]   It was all dialed in.
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.460]   Were you on floss this morning?
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.460]   No, floss was on hiatus, I think, this morning.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.460]   A little break.
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.460]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.460]   It was on last week, though.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.460]   Yep.
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.460]   Well, lots to talk about.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.460]   We're going to get our change log in just a bit.
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.460]   I hardly know where to begin.
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.460]   There's so much going on.
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.460]   Somebody in the chat room said, "What?
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.460]   I just got an email.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.460]   Google's killing latitude."
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.460]   Mm-hmm.
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.460]   Oh, no.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.460]   I actually-- I and a few others used it.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.460]   There's a story in the rundown toward the end of the Google part.
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.460]   I put it in there.
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.460]   Okay.
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.460]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.460]   August 9.
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.460]   August 9.
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:58.460]   So we've got one month latitude for those who don't know was kind of Google's four square,
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.460]   right?
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.460]   Right.
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.460]   Yep.
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.460]   The very patriotic, by the way, thank you, Chad, for that transition.
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.460]   Left over from the 4th of July, apparently.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:14.460]   So how are they going to do this Google+ location sharing?
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:20.460]   Because right now, when I travel around latitude automatically follows me, keeps track of it,
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:28.460]   checks me into places that I enter that I've given permission to do so automatically, and
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.460]   publishes it to the public-- I keep it public.
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.460]   You have a choice, obviously, but publishes it to my Google+ page.
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.460]   What happens now?
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.460]   What's the new thing?
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.460]   I understand that the new thing is just location in Google+, you can add location to your Google
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.460]   plus post.
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.460]   But it's manual?
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.460]   Yeah, because-- and I guess it will be manual.
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.460]   I forgot about that automatic checking in.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.460]   That is crazy, Leo.
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.460]   You made me own the person you had that enabled.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.460]   Go on, stock me.
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.460]   See if I care.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.460]   Crazy automatically check me in.
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.460]   You got nothing to hide.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.460]   I like that.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.460]   I just think it's cool.
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.380]   I don't think that automatic feature is going to happen, but they're just moving to the
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.380]  -- I mean, so Google doesn't have location app anymore.
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.380]   It's just all going to be Google+.
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.380]   Do you think--
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.380]   I would be surprised if at some point they set it up so that at Google+, you know, maybe--
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.500]   can you imagine Google now popping up and being like, "Hey, it looks like you're at your favorite
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.500]   t-shop.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.500]   Want to check in?"
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.500]   Yes, you know.
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.380]   But that obviously doesn't do that now.
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.940]   This is just another effort on Google's part of trying to draw people into Google+ though,
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.940]   right?
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.380]   Because on latitude, I could share-- I had it like with my family could see where I was.
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.740]   I wasn't as brave as Leo, but my family could see where I was.
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.060]   So it didn't matter what email system they were on or what.
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.020]   You know, they just had to be a latitude user signed up for that service and they could
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.300]   see where I was and I could see where they were or whatever.
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.300]   Now I think the difference is going to be you have to go to Google+ or interface with
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.300]   Google+.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.500]   And so it's drawing the eyeballs towards Google+ that they're after.
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.700]   I think that's smart on there.
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.020]   Some people might not like it, but I think it's smart on their part.
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.020]   It's more--
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.700]   I hope Google+ is everywhere.
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.860]   Well, and it's probably also-- see, this is the point.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.540]   They know this information, but they don't want to let everybody know they know.
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.540]   Right?
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.340]   So look, and this is very useful.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.740]   This is my latitude location history.
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.060]   Notice it doesn't say latitude.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.100]   So maybe they'll still offer this.
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.100]   This is in your dashboard.
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.540]   This is not public.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.740]   But how much time I spent at work, that's the green part.
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.220]   How much time at home, that's the yellow part.
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.220]   Time spent out.
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.340]   That's the blue part.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.060]   Places I went.
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.660]   Times I spent at my house, 133 hours last week, 39 hours a week on average.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.020]   I have traveled 128,000 miles.
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.180]   This stuff is great.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.020]   I mean, I think this is--
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.020]   That's great data.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.020]   That's great.
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.180]   You know, you're a data nerd.
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:47.220]   Yeah, no, I tell you, when you show that to us, I actually considered turning on latitude,
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.260]   and I decided not to--
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.660]   You shouldn't.
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.620]   You shouldn't, because you're a woman.
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.620]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.020]   Seriously, I hate to say that, but don't you think that's true?
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.260]   That that's the risk.
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.460]   Well, can't you turn a mod just for yourself?
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.020]   I mean, couldn't you just turn a mod just for yourself?
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.380]   I guess.
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.140]   So you got the blue part.
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.140]   So you just didn't share it.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.340]   So it just keeps track of it.
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.060]   Right, without sharing it.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.060]   Yeah.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.660]   What do you get when you go to your location history dashboard?
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.660]   Do you get this?
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.660]   You don't get this stuff.
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.660]   Where is that?
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.940]   It's in the dashboard, google.com/dashboard, and then scroll down to location history.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:24.860]   So I'm playing back a video of my location over the last 30 days.
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:29.780]   It's actually going to show me going around-- it even shows me going to Colorado with my
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.780]   son.
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.860]   It's pretty cool.
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:34.860]   You can export this to KML.
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.860]   It's going to show the timestamps.
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.100]   Well, we're misinterpreting this.
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.340]   Is this a case like Reader where Google just says people-- they're cool, but people weren't
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.340]   using it?
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.340]   Or--
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.660]   Well, it's interesting that this wasn't a spring cleaning post, right?
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.980]   I mean, normally the way the Google touch things down is they do a spring cleaning post,
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.220]   and then there's a list of products you've never heard of or you forgot about that are
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.220]   getting shut down.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:00.340]   This latitude announcement came in the Google Maps update announcement, because they removed
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.180]   the ability to check in the latitude from the Maps mobile app, which is new, which I'll
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.180]   talk about in the change log.
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.500]   So it was kind of like, hey, we've got this whole new Maps thing.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.300]   Oh, by the way, that old feature.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.580]   That's not there anymore, because we're sons setting a latitude, and you could just check
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.660]   in on Google+, from here on in.
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.180]   So it was a weird-- they didn't make any comment about how they're just worn enough people
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.180]   using latitude.
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.740]   But let's be honest, how many people do you know?
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.020]   I mean, Leo is the only person I knew who--
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.860]   And Aaron's looking at his dashboard, and you have to opt in.
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.860]   You have to manually enable locations.
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.580]   Right, so there is location settings in your Google+ settings.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.620]   If you click on that little home thing and then go down to settings, which is always
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:41.020]   confusing to me, because I'm used to the Google settings being on the upper right-hand side,
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.140]   once you find that, you can scroll all the way down and you'll see location settings.
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:49.180]   So you can enable location sharing, and you can enable it only for certain circles.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.820]   Including just you.
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.820]   Including just you.
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.820]   So you can enable it for only you.
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.820]   You can enable it for public.
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.180]   You can enable it for certain circles.
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.140]   It's the whole Google+ selection thing like you would normally see on a post.
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.420]   So that is in there.
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.740]   I don't know how long it's been there.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.620]   Maybe it's always been there, but I just saw it today.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.660]   I think it's always been there, because I remember turning it on.
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.140]   I like it.
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.740]   I like having that all information.
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.420]   I turn this on for a trip to New York.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.340]   So I actually do have data here.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.740]   But then I guess I turned it off when I got back home in San Diego.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.060]   Because honestly, I work at home, so I really don't go all out of places.
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.060]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.940]   Most of my problems are not that interesting.
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.940]   It's not that interesting.
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.500]   It's just like, here's where I am.
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.740]   Well, I think it's interesting, though, to see how much you go out.
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.740]   Maybe you should go out more.
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.740]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.740]   That's true.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.180]   I actually had Google now ask me if I worked at the coffee shop.
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.380]   Because that's the one that I could go home.
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.180]   Why do you keep coming there?
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:49.780]   Because I'm normally just home, otherwise.
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:55.380]   Now this is tied into, and maybe this is the reason, a new Google Maps app for Android
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.620]   phones and tablets coming soon to iPad and iPhone.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.140]   And you guys are just downloading it now.
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.140]   By the way, there's Jeff.
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.860]   We got him back, so we had a little trouble with Jeff.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.460]   So I haven't played with it at all.
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.460]   I don't have it yet.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.020]   Yeah, I got it yesterday.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.220]   So what's new?
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.780]   This is Jason's--
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.220]   There's a lot of new features in here.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.300]   For one, it looks a lot more.
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:21.220]   If you've been using the Google Maps preview in Chrome or for your desktop, then you'll
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.300]   recognize-- it looks a lot similar to that interface.
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.300]   Very clean interface right now.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:25.820]   Very clean.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.500]   Some of the things that they finally--
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.700]   Who I like this.
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:29.620]   Yeah.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.820]   So one of the things is you can see it has a lot better integration with places and what's
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.860]   near you and what's around you.
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.980]   They enabled cards for what's around you.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:43.140]   So apparently if you touch on the map, and then you should be able to get a choice of
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:48.540]   what's there or what's around your location, and you can actually pull up cards.
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:53.140]   There's some pretty good video of it on the link and the rundown.
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.820]   It is a very different UI.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.780]   And they've gone to this--
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.860]   I think this is a new UI you're seeing a lot on mobile.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.180]   This tab that slides over--
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.100]   Facebook is the first place I saw, but a lot of apps are starting to use this.
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:12.660]   Instead of the overflow menu that we used to see a lot in Android, there's a little
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:19.020]   ton of tab in the lower left-hand corner that opens up a sidebar with a lot of other things,
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.820]   traffic, public transit, basically.
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.220]   That's a new Android UI element.
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.620]   It's called Navigation Drawer.
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.620]   I like it.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.780]   Yeah, I just added it to D2Text.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.380]   And in fact, for apps that have an action bar across the top, which maps does not, you'll
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.900]   see the hamburger icon, the three dashes.
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:36.900]   That's cool.
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.740]   Yeah, the hamburger, right, because it's the two buttons in the meat.
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.180]   You see that in Gmail.
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.660]   If you launch Gmail, you see the hamburger, you can tap on it and expand the Navigation
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.660]   Drawer.
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.660]   But I agree.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.220]   I really love the Navigation Drawer.
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.300]   And what's nice about the Nav drawer, too, is that when you go landscape or you're on
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.220]   a tablet, often it can auto-expand, which we also just put in not to do text.
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.380]   Anyway, sorry, it didn't mean the hijack.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.380]   No, I'm glad.
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.380]   No, that's why we love having a developer on here to explain why this appears in some
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.460]   apps and not in all.
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.820]   So this is something that Google was probably pushing.
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.140]   It's a fairly modern new UI.
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.820]   But it is a part of the standard Android UI elements now.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.060]   So you'll see it more and more.
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.060]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.060]   They've also added--
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:22.060]   The core import chief is certainly what-- the glass and all that is going to use a lot.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.060]   Right.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.060]   Right.
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.140]   You see there they've actually expanded the public transit or the transportation mode
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.140]   offerings.
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.420]   You're not seeing it right there.
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.020]   But they're in certain screens, like when you do navigation or directions, it'll offer
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.220]   you a choice.
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.580]   And it'll say, I want to minimize my time to minimize the amount of walking.
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.580]   I have to do.
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.580]   So I can have--
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.580]   They've always had.
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.580]   For a long time, they've had public transit or--
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.580]   Drive or--
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.580]   Well, I was in Europe.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.580]   It was just the greatest thing to be able to use the public--
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.580]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:53.660]   And so they've expanded that ability to really drill down on exactly what type of transportation
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.660]   modes you want to do.
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:15:01.620]   The other thing they've added is more detailed traffic information and the ability to reroute
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.620]   around traffic.
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:03.620]   I think they mentioned that at Google I/O.
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.620]   Oh, interesting.
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.620]   So they've added that.
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.620]   You can see it on the video that Chad has.
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.620]   Ways style.
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.980]   You know, we thought they might kill latitude once they acquired ways.
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.900]   But this is well before that.
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.340]   And this map update is well before that.
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:21.060]   Apparently, places has been updated as well.
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:25.700]   And it will alert you real time while you're driving if there's been an accident or an event
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.700]   and reroute you.
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:27.700]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.700]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.700]   And it'll tell you how much longer it is or there's a new route.
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.540]   Do you want to take it?
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.220]   Yeah, it's really, really nice.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.020]   I really think Waze was a defensive buy for them.
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.020]   Right?
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.620]   Because they've had to have this ability in the work for a while.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.220]   So they bought Waze because they didn't want anybody else to buy it.
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.660]   But it's not just the defense.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.260]   I think that Waze does have a critical mass of reporting.
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.260]   Yes.
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.260]   Yes.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.260]   That too.
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.260]   Yep.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.260]   Absolutely.
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.260]   Cool.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.020]   I don't want to scoop the change log.
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.020]   No, that's OK.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.020]   That was a big release.
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.020]   It's huge.
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.020]   I'm glad we demoed.
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.020]   You do it to me all the time.
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.020]   I know.
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.020]   I know.
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.020]   It's huge.
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.020]   Time we did.
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:08.460]   OK, this is probably also in the change log.
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.780]   But I've been holding off on putting Hangouts in my Gmail because I still use Gmail to make
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.780]   phone calls.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.780]   Finally, they've put phone calls into Gmail.
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.500]   I mean, they put Hangouts in the Hangouts and now I can use it in my Gmail.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.540]   And I like the interface better.
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:29.140]   And they even said very specifically, this is a step in replacing voice with Google Voice
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.380]   with Hangouts.
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.540]   So I got to think another service that is on the block is Google Voice.
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.540]   And now I'm afraid.
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.540]   Right.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.540]   Because I use that.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.380]   I'm just hoping that all of Google Voice's functionality will get poured it over and
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.380]   Hangouts.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.500]   And it just means that they'll be the same product, integrative other Hangouts stuff under
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.500]   the same name.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.500]   That's what I'm hoping for.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.500]   Because Voice is my primary number.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.140]   Because like you Leo, I've got a bunch of phones.
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.140]   I've got a bunch of test devices.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.660]   And I just like that whatever phone I have rings, right?
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.580]   Because everybody has that one Google Voice number.
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:02.220]   You know, Voice still has this problem, doesn't support things like MMS.
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.900]   And that's something the Hangouts is really good at.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.260]   I have to say, I'm totally hangout to this point.
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.740]   I install the Chrome extension.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.340]   I have it on my phones.
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.580]   My co-founder and I use Hangouts.
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:11.740]   Kevin and I use Hangouts.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.740]   I love it.
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.100]   Because it's kind of a mix of that.
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.980]   Can I use Hangouts on my phone to make--
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:16.980]   To make calls?
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.500]   It's not going to be an announcement.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.500]   Make calls?
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.500]   Is it in there now?
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.500]   I don't think it is.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.500]   It's just desktop.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.500]   Just desktop right now.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.500]   Just desktop users.
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.500]   So you can do it from Gmail.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.180]   They said you could also do it from HTML.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.260]   I'm not sure exactly what that means.
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.260]   WebRTC.
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.260]   WebRTC.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.260]   Yeah.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.260]   WebRTC, is that-- no?
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.340]   But they did not save Android, iPhone, or mobile in the announcement.
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.260]   Yeah, and I don't see it.
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.260]   Oh, well.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.460]   And it's got a couple of different features.
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.100]   Now I'm totally scooping the changelog, but I don't care.
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.100]   You can do it like--
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.660]   Play the changelog theme and then we'll just make this the changelog.
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.660]   Okay.
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.660]   The Google changelog.
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:51.660]   Okay.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.660]   All right.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:57.420]   Now we're safe.
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.420]   Anything goes.
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.420]   We're officially in the changelog.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:06.340]   I haven't had a chance to try this yet, but this new calling from Hangouts and the desktop,
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.340]   you can add-- let's see.
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.340]   Oh, where did I see this?
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.340]   You can add multiple call.
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.620]   You can add multiple call numbers, video participants in the same call.
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.100]   You can play sound effects like applause or laughter.
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.300]   Is that-- yeah, I saw that.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.300]   I don't know if that's an improvement.
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.900]   I'm nervous about that.
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:25.820]   But kind of fun, kind of funny, especially if it's a conference call situation or, you
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.220]   know, if you're working, you know.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.460]   And so to make call from Hangouts, you look for the new phone icon in Gmail.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.420]   I actually-- I haven't seen it to show up for me because that's because I'm normally
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:40.500]   in my app's Gmail or from the new call, a phone menu item in Google+, and the Chrome
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.580]   extension.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.180]   The Chrome extension actually made my Hangouts experience way, way better.
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.380]   I highly recommend that if you're using Hangouts.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.380]   So this is good.
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.540]   Free calls in the US and international rates are pretty low.
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.260]   If--
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.140]   If-- question.
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:03.500]   Young people, whom I know of you, don't use-- don't make phone calls.
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.500]   Right.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.500]   Right, period.
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.020]   Are they using video conferencing a lot?
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:13.100]   And then what does the phone motif do to that for them, I wonder?
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:21.860]   Hey, so my totally subjective observation is that the youngins really like video conferencing.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.860]   I sort of missed it.
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.500]   I'm too-- I'm actually too old.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.500]   I'm in the space where I hate making phone calls, but I also don't love video calls either.
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.380]   But I think one of the more interesting things about Hangouts in Google, the Googlers we talked
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:37.260]   about, Vic and other Googlers we talked to said, you know, that the young people, particularly
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:42.180]   at Google, were on Hangouts all night, kind of just, you know, messing around and joking
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.140]   around and just sort of leaving on all the time while they were working and like-- and
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.460]   talk to their friends.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.020]   I have also heard that other-- other younger people do that same thing.
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.020]   I don't.
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.660]   But I can see that that's, you know, how that sort of interesting.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.180]   I think that Hangouts has a very-- has a lot of use from a certain kind of-- a certain
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.980]   demographic and I do think it's--
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:05.140]   It seems a slightly reasonable-- I mean, I know my kids were on I am all the time.
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.140]   Right.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.140]   Why not have--
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.620]   Why feel the need to bring phone calls in?
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.620]   Right.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.620]   That's what I'm just trying to-- I don't know.
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.620]   Oh, I see what you mean.
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.540]   Well, for us people over 20.
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:18.660]   Yeah, if you want to call someone over 25.
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.860]   When your friends are out camping and they don't have an internet connection-- yeah.
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.140]   And that's literally happened to me a few times.
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.460]   I think-- God, how do they survive?
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.980]   I don't-- I think the real story here is ubiquity, right?
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.620]   I mean, did you guys cover the fact that you can-- from Google Voice, you can call in
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.900]   to Hangouts now?
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:35.900]   No.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.020]   Like you can get a-- you can get-- if you have Hangouts running, it'll-- you can actually
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:43.300]   set an option in Google Voice, say, you know, call my phone first and then call Hangouts.
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:48.020]   I've actually taken a few out-- you know, inbound calls from outside on telephone systems
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.300]   in Hangouts.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.740]   And it's worked brilliantly.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.740]   People can hear me.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.420]   They don't know that I'm on, you know, talking through a webcam speaker.
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.740]   I mean, maybe they do and they just-- they're just too polite to say anything.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.900]   But I've taken a few calls like that and it works really well.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.860]   Boy, does this sound like a death of voice?
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.860]   This is--
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:04.860]   This is--
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.860]   This is--
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.860]   So wait, this is in your Google Voice settings?
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:07.860]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:12.460]   I send this to-- so, okay, so I'm looking forward calls to-- I can forward calls to my
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.460]   cell phones.
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.540]   There's a forward calls to Google Chat.
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.260]   I don't see the Hangouts.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.260]   Maybe I had to--
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.980]   Maybe it's Google Chat and it just-- maybe it's Google Chat and it just came in over Hangouts
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.180]   because I'm using Hangouts in Gmail.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.620]   Because you're using Hangouts now.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.620]   That must be it.
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.860]   So if you forward call to Google Chat, interesting, interesting.
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:31.460]   Yeah, I really hope that they don't-- that they don't kill Google Voice or that there
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.900]   isn't a time when Google Voice doesn't have its full functionality while they ported over
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.700]   to Hangouts.
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.140]   But it seems pretty clear that Hangouts is going to be it from here on end.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:43.580]   This is as long as it supports old-school text messaging and MMS would be also be really
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.220]   nice all integrated into Hangouts.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.220]   I might actually forgive them for the whole--
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.220]   It needs a phone number.
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.220]   That's what you want.
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.820]   Yeah, and that's the main thing we want to keep is that there's numbers.
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:54.820]   That's the main thing.
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:55.820]   Right, that single number.
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:56.820]   Yep.
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.300]   It has to to compete with Skype, doesn't it?
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.180]   Yeah, Skype is-- well, Skype you have to pay for a number, but yes.
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.820]   Well, as I was saying, Google can't go without phone numbers.
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:05.820]   I don't think--
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.060]   Are they trying to compete with Skype?
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.060]   What are they doing?
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.060]   This is Babel, right?
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.700]   This is their unified message platform slowly emerging.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.700]   Yes, yep.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.500]   We thought it would be a kind of a loud one to it.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.700]   The phone system, that's the issue.
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:21.060]   It needs to be interoperable to the phone system both in terms of calls and text.
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.180]   Here's the problem with Voice right now.
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:29.380]   Voice is weird because if you use Voice on your phone, it calls you.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.380]   Right, right.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.900]   And so it's not VoIP.
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.420]   It's a phone call using Google servers.
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:38.700]   If you call out, if you have Google Voice on your phone and you call out, Google Voice
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.700]   basically dials the number for you.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.700]   It doesn't call you back.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.700]   It used to call you back.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.860]   It used to call you back before there was an app.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.260]   But now it's a setting in the app and it'll actually place the call for you.
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:52.820]   So they can now turn it into a true VoIP solution and eliminate that weird call back thing.
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:58.180]   But there's a land-- like they're using a landline number to call a server that then
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.180]   translates.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:03.620]   Like if you look at the way it works, like they assign weird numbers to your friends that
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.780]   are looking somewhere in Nevada or something.
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.780]   For a while there, this is all sort of black box now.
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:08.780]   You don't see it in the new app.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.980]   But in the beginning, when it was Grand Central and early when Google had it, there was all
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.700]   sorts of weirdness about calling out and calling you back.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.620]   But now it's a pretty seamless experience.
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.380]   So you're-- Aaron's making the call right now.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:25.220]   But what phone number was that call coming into your recipient from your phone number?
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.220]   It's supposed to--
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.220]   Your Google Voice?
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.220]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.220]   It's supposed to do some tricky caller ID settings so that it comes in through your number.
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.820]   As long as it looks like your number, then-- It usually does.
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.260]   But I noticed that sometimes, depending on where it calls out from, like Gina was saying,
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.500]   sometimes you get a weird Nevada number or you get a weird--
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.500]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.500]   Some weird number comes up.
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.220]   Well, I still get that when people-- when I use Google Voice for text messaging and
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.500]   I always-- it's weird numbers.
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.940]   The text messages are coming from some-- Yeah, that's true too.
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.940]   Yep.
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:51.940]   That's not good.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.060]   I mean, my mom-- she's not at 313.
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:58.900]   But this conversation we're having is with a 313 number.
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.180]   So that's all got to get out of the way.
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:06.180]   It's like HTTPS.go/we don't need to know the details.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.180]   Exactly.
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.020]   It should look like VoIP even if it's not VoIP.
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.740]   It should-- I've definitely had a few of the like, no, wait, really.
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:13.740]   What is your real number?
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:14.740]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.540]   Like, conversation with my family a couple of times.
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.540]   Yeah.
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.540]   Yep.
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:19.540]   Yep.
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.540]   It's like, no, this is my real number.
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.460]   It's a little bit of a weird number, but it works.
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.540]   Yeah, so they just need to make that totally seamless.
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:29.100]   And I hope that that-- I hope that all of that gets in the hangouts, you know, plus some.
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.140]   It doesn't look like they're doing-- there's not a lot of movement on this.
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.140]   I'm not a fan voice.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.620]   Even if you look at the Android app for voice, it's kind of--
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.620]   Yeah, there's sit-not.
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:36.620]   It's looking a little aged.
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.620]   It's looking old.
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.580]   They're not working on that.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:44.020]   My optimistic self is thinking that there's a whole team of little hamster engineers
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:47.940]   that Google make me work perfectly with hangouts right now.
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.060]   That's what I'm hoping.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.700]   So I should finish up the changelog.
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:52.700]   Yes.
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.700]   What else do we have?
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:57.100]   Chrome 28 comes with rich notifications for apps and extensions.
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.820]   This is only on Windows.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.140]   I haven't had a chance to see it yet.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.460]   It's coming from Mac and Linux soon.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.980]   Chrome 28 also has Blink.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.740]   This is the first release of Chrome that has Blink, which if you remember, is Google's
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.540]   fork of WebKit, the super fast fork of WebKit.
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.500]   And you can check the Blink ID yourself.
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:24.660]   You go to Chrome colon slash slash version, and I'll show you that Blink is there in your
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:25.660]   installation.
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.660]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.660]   Yes.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:32.300]   I think it's going to be 8, the same as Chrome in terms of the feature set.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.300]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.980]   It's going to be on Chrome Book.
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.980]   It's 28 now.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:37.980]   Mm-hmm.
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.780]   Ah, beta on Chromebook, right.
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.220]   But I think this is Windows only has the rich notifications in Blink.
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.500]   So I think that, I think, well, let's see.
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.420]   Next up is saying Mac and Linux coming soon.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.420]   Didn't say anything about the Chromebook.
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.780]   So you're not seeing Blink in your Chrome version there?
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.780]   I haven't looked yet.
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:54.780]   Okay.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:55.780]   Okay.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.100]   And I'm not sure why they released this for Windows first, but you can see on the next
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:05.140]   way of Blink, they have a couple of nice screenshots of what the rich toast looks like.
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.140]   Looks like a Google--
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.140]   What's the rich toast?
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.140]   What's rich toast?
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:13.580]   Well, you know when you call a notification on Windows toast, you know the toaster?
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.940]   Come on, like the notification comes out like a slice of toast.
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.900]   What does rich toast look like?
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.780]   And your chocolate Nutella vegimite?
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:24.020]   There are bugs on it where you can interact with it.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.020]   Come on.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.020]   With a program.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:31.300]   Rich toast and hamburgers with a skull in the interface.
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.300]   So toast is notifications.
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:39.260]   Yeah, the toast is like the notification that pops up out of your status bar, like a slice
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.260]   of toast.
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.260]   And that goes back to early days at Microsoft.
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.020]   So I call it a rich toast because it has-- it's the toast.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.860]   It's the slice of bread that kind of pops up.
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.860]   But then there's also--
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:48.860]   You're not.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:51.580]   I think if it's your coining mat, I think you should call it butter toast.
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:52.580]   Butter toast.
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.580]   No, no, no.
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.580]   This is not a case.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.580]   This is what happens when a developer learns too many UX terms.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.220]   It just gets more and more round.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.220]   Game drop in UX.
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.220]   You have hamburgers and rich toast.
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.580]   You know, the word Chrome itself is a UI term, a UX term.
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.580]   It is.
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:10.500]   It was what the Firefox folks called the user interface on top of the Gecko engine was
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.500]   the Chrome.
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.500]   It was the Chrome.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.660]   And Google picked that up as the name of their browser.
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:18.460]   So one of the chat room says we should call it a "Chronut," of course.
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.980]   Mm, a "Chronut."
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.980]   That's a New York thing.
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:21.980]   I got the Chrome.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:22.980]   What's a "Chronut"?
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.660]   You know this one, Leo?
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.260]   This is a pretty-- this is a New York-centric thing, Jeff.
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.260]   It's like a Chrome.
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.460]   Chrome, an un-bakery that does this very special thing.
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:37.500]   It uses Quaso dough to make a doughnut with some kind of creamy thing.
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.500]   Oh, my God!
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.620]   They can only make so many a day.
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.340]   So there's a long line.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.540]   You can only get two at a time.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.540]   It's like the soup nazi.
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.540]   And then when you leave--
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.460]   Look at how meat it has.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:54.300]   You can-- what are you doing tickets?
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.540]   Oh, that looks so good.
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.300]   You can sell them for 40 bucks each.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.300]   You can scalp a "Chronut"?
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.300]   Yes.
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.100]   "Chronut" scalping is the shame of the New York City.
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.620]   I should have been in my tip.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.460]   Google Image Surge "Chronut."
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.860]   That's called the man repeller.
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:13.060]   I don't know why.
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.860]   There's the line.
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.420]   It starts like five in the morning.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.260]   Is this one place?
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.460]   Dominics and sell bakery.
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.620]   So have you had one, Jeff?
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:23.620]   Is it worth the line?
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:24.620]   Oh, look at the sit-off.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.620]   Oh, I have no idea.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.620]   God.
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.060]   Are you a doughnut guy?
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.300]   You're a croissant guy or a doughnut guy?
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.900]   Don't tell my wife or my pediatric or my cardiologist.
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.900]   Right, absolutely.
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:35.900]   Fair enough.
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.900]   Oh, that looks good.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.700]   When I was in Paris, I had to have a croissant.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:41.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.700]   But I normally had a doughnut.
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.260]   So New York invented the cupcake craze.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.060]   Is the "Chronut" next?
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.460]   Yes, but evidently it's so special now.
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.460]   But I don't know.
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.460]   Why haven't others done this?
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.860]   Is there a patent involved?
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:53.860]   Is there--
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.940]   It's probably very tricky.
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.100]   It's very, very tricky.
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.900]   Evidently it's extremely tricky.
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.580]   How tricky could it be?
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.300]   You just dip food around this one.
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:08.100]   I'm following Dominic Ansell on Twitter because apparently he's tweeting about "Chronuts."
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.700]   He says, "One woman legitimately cried.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:11.700]   We felt so bad.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.100]   We looked everywhere to find her the last remaining "Chronut."
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.100]   Holy--
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.340]   This is where we drive our audience nuts.
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.340]   I don't know.
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.620]   From the whole way to "Chronuts."
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.340]   From "Chronut" to "Chronuts" people.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.340]   I'm so hungry.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.980]   Come on, you don't get this anywhere else.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.860]   This has got to be in San Francisco somewhere.
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.620]   Why do they not have "Chronuts"?
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.140]   Hey, hey, hey, what is that?
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.140]   What is that?
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.140]   We've got to be in San Francisco.
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.260]   No, this is the center of the universe, fella.
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.260]   Not anymore.
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.260]   It's--
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.260]   That's--
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.260]   Yeah, man, that's--
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:46.020]   This is a city.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.020]   It's true.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.020]   He's right.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.020]   Sorry, Leo.
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.020]   That's right.
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:54.100]   I prefer my sleepy-litting little fishing village, but if it doesn't get "Chronuts" soon,
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.100]   I might have to move.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.740]   Sleepy little fishing village.
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.660]   It is a sleepy little fishing village.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.660]   It is.
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.660]   It is.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.660]   Okay, I'm going to get through the changelog.
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.660]   Let's keep going.
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.260]   We talked about the Google-- the new Google Maps app.
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.460]   Thank you, Erin, for doing an excellent demo.
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.660]   That is rolling out the play store over the next few days.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:11.660]   I got it on my phone.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.580]   So you should be getting it as well.
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:17.660]   And then the last bit of change in Google+, this is kind of interesting.
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.020]   And I found myself wishing that Twitter would do it.
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:26.380]   Google+ is now going to start showing you posts that your friends have plus wand.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.740]   So we'll occasionally highlight posts that were plus one by people in your circles.
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:35.340]   And if you plus want to post Google rights, we may highlight it to your friends as well.
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:36.340]   I like that.
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.340]   So there's lots of settings.
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.780]   You can visit your settings and you can put it on the volume.
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:46.180]   This is mind blowing because this was always our puzzle, was why plus one something if no
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.180]   one sees it.
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.180]   Exactly.
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.180]   Exactly.
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.900]   And for two years, that's been the default behavior.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.900]   Yep.
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:53.900]   Plus one thing.
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.540]   But then I had to realize, well, that was pointless.
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:57.820]   Nobody's going to notice.
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:01.260]   If you plus one in the forest and nobody's there, does it--
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.260]   Well, the author, the original post author sees it, right?
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:08.900]   Like, so I plus one is a way to say thank you, acknowledge, you know, as a thumbs up.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.620]   So as a pat on the back, an atta boy or an atta girl.
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:12.620]   But this is nice.
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:13.620]   I really like this.
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.740]   I wish the Twitter would show me, you know, post that maybe-- I want to see posts.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.060]   Maybe I don't want to see all of my friends' retweets.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.340]   But I want to see the post that three or four of my friends have retweeted.
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.340]   Yeah, you know how I wish I could do.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.340]   Right, Gina.
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:29.540]   And the reef-- my plus one reflex is now established enough.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:32.820]   I often start to want a plus one tweet.
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.020]   And of course, I can't.
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.860]   Well, but do you favor it?
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.740]   No, because favority is different to me.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.300]   Favourity means that I'm saving it.
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.300]   Wow.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.060]   OK, interesting.
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.060]   Interesting.
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:52.460]   I think that people do-- yeah, consider favorites as read it later.
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:56.100]   I kind of look at favorites as a kind of atta boy, atta girl as well.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:59.900]   I think that's one of those I see as odd.
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.580]   I think why would somebody save that?
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:02.580]   OK, I got it.
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:03.580]   Yeah, yeah, no.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.780]   It's them just saying, hey, because the mobile app will say, hey, you know, if you
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:10.220]   favor one of my tweets and because we're friends on the mobile app, I'll get a notification
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:12.380]   that says Jeff Jarvis favorited your tweet.
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.900]   And it gives me a warm and fuzzy.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.780]   So it's kind of a nice way to say, hey, nice job.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.300]   Although you can also use it as read it later.
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:25.260]   But now, not all will be seen just select-- is this like what Facebook does with the
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.740]   selective news feed?
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.460]   How-- is there algorithm published?
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.300]   Do we know how this works?
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.220]   If I--
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.220]   We don't.
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:32.740]   We don't.
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:33.980]   But you can turn down the volume.
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:34.980]   You can go into your settings.
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.180]   You can see too many posts that you don't want to see.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.260]   You can say, don't show me highlighted plus ones.
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.980]   You can go in and say, don't highlight the things that I plus one to my friends.
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.340]   You have a lot of control here, which is really, really nice.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:51.700]   And where would that-- where would that-- in the-- obviously, in the Google+ settings.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.060]   Yeah, in Google+ settings, I'm looking at that post.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.060]   Who can interact?
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.060]   Who can send you notifications?
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.060]   Who can comment?
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.060]   Who can hang out?
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.060]   Notification delivery.
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:04.900]   Wow, there's just so many checks here.
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.900]   See all the content you could--
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:07.900]   Google+ one.
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.340]   Plus one on non-Google sites now.
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.300]   Google+ pages.
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.100]   Automatically at a Google+ page, my circle of five.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.420]   This is the absurdity of Google.
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.700]   This is ridiculous.
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.740]   This is about controlling your own data.
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.660]   You get a settings panel that is like out of--
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.900]   it's completely insane.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:22.900]   I don't know if yours upload my photo.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.780]   It's just a friggin' plus one.
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.820]   Profile.
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:26.540]   Oh, here we go.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.940]   Show your-- no.
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:32.940]   Show these--
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.380]   I don't really see it either.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.980]   It might not have been rolled out to everybody.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:36.980]   It's possible to do that.
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.460]   Oh, now after I go through 100 pages of settings.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.460]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.460]   So, yeah.
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.180]   I did get a little pop-up though this morning when I was on Google+
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:46.020]   and I hovered over the plus.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.940]   It popped up and told me basically what you just read,
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.620]   Gina, about how it's going to work.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:55.460]   It said, OK, this may be shared to your friends, extended circles.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:58.140]   If enough people like it, they'll get a little notification.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.260]   I kind of like it and I kind of don't, because I've kind of got my Google+
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.980]   locked down the way I want to see it.
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:08.180]   And I don't like things flying at me that I didn't explicitly say I wanted to see.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:12.660]   So like when communities first came out, I was like, they were--
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:13.460]   I say spamming.
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.660]   I guess to other people, it was helpful.
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:19.860]   But they were putting a lot of posts in my timeline that I didn't want to see.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.660]   And so luckily, finally, they came back and corrected that.
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:25.220]   So I hope this doesn't add a lot of things that I would consider spam.
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:29.740]   You know, Aaron, I think that every time they've added something,
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:33.700]   think of the earliest days of Google+ the scobaldays.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.420]   Oh, we got over.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.860]   People update and we all complain about it.
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:40.500]   And then they fixed it.
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.420]   And we kind of forgot that we were complaining.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.660]   They stayed with the community as things.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.500]   And every time they've introduced something new,
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.580]   it tends to have a little bit of an overdose period.
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.580]   And then they find the right level.
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.460]   They're good at that.
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:50.900]   And they're just--
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.100]   And then you just forget the pain.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:53.940]   Yep.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.900]   Unlike Facebook and other sites.
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:56.380]   Yes.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:56.860]   Yep.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:57.300]   I agree.
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.460]   That's why I like Google+.
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.140]   I love Google+ more and more.
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.180]   I mean, I think communities--
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.060]   the photos in the communities put me over the top.
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.500]   Now it's just where I want to live.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.820]   Photos, amazing.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.220]   Yep.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.580]   I'm going nuts with photos.
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.860]   And I went nuts on this trip.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.220]   My favorite auto awesome I've done yet was
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:18.300]   Efficient Ships Flickering Neon Sign.
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:18.900]   Oh, cool.
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:19.420]   Cool.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.220]   Now tell us how you did that, Jeff.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.940]   You consciously did that by doing a burst.
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.460]   I went to the camera to the shoot the mini.
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:25.940]   OK.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.740]   And then uploaded them and I made it.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:28.900]   It was that's it.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.660]   If you look at my feed, you should--
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.140]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.020]   I got stuck on you wearing the newspaper hat.
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:33.940]   Come on, Andy.
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:36.740]   He won.
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.500]   I'm not sure for that.
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.020]   For those who can't see the sun newspaper in London
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:44.060]   to the hat you could make for Andy Murray and a sun hat.
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:45.580]   And I said, finally, there was a good reason
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:46.420]   to publish the sun.
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:48.500]   Here's it.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.660]   Oh, this is a great auto awesome.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.540]   I really like this.
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.140]   That is really neat.
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:58.380]   Because it doesn't look like an animated picture.
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.980]   It's just the sign going off and on.
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.180]   There's also-- I did two of them.
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.740]   There's that one and there's a bigger one.
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:03.820]   There's that one too, right?
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:04.820]   Oh, I love this.
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:05.460]   Isn't that a beautiful one?
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.220]   OK, so say how you did that again?
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:07.900]   It's just simple.
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.700]   My camera, my Nikon one, you just turn it
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.620]   from single shot to multiple shots, right?
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:13.060]   Burst the phone.
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.020]   You call that.
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.780]   And hit it down.
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.460]   Just try to hold still as I can.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:17.980]   Hit it down.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.580]   And then when I upload all the photos in the Google Plus,
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.660]   wait about two, three minutes.
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.900]   And then you'll see that it'll catch it.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:25.300]   And do it.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:29.940]   I did one, two, four, a flag waving at top, the Union Jack
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.820]   waving at top of parliament.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.860]   So I like those.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.540]   No, I'm playing with those where I could take something
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:36.740]   where everything is static.
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:38.220]   But there is one thing moving there.
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.300]   Yeah, love that.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.860]   You want to wash them around that.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.500]   And most camera phones, I think, have a burst mode.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.740]   So presumably, you can also do that with your camera phone.
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.940]   I have not been able to do it on my camera phone.
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.020]   Well, my Nexus 4 doesn't seem to have a burst mode.
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.420]   So unless I'm wrong.
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.340]   Maybe it doesn't.
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.500]   But there's an app that actually Jason featured on all
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:00.540]   about Android a few weeks ago called Fast Burst Camera.
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.460]   That does a really nice job.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.500]   Takes a ton of picture really, really fast.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.300]   But the problem with it is, though,
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.340]   is that even though I have this huge humongous amount
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.060]   of storage now, I'll stick the-- and I am using this.
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.740]   What I do now is I sign out of my Chromebook.
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:18.260]   I sign into my other account, my Google Plus account.
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.740]   Put in the SD card in the Chromebook,
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.100]   and it all just goes up.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.540]   It just syncs my photos completely.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.500]   Well, and that's why I like to do it on the camera phone,
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.820]   because I don't even have to do that step.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.180]   But yeah, that's nice.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.780]   Well, this way I can do fancy things with the camera.
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.500]   But the problem is, suddenly, I'm uploading 268 photos.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.020]   Right.
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.020]   Yeah, I'm already using over a third of my storage.
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.420]   And I really don't even upload that on the mobile.
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.380]   So you need a pixel.
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.060]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.860]   You're using a third of a terabyte?
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:47.300]   Oh, mine.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.860]   It says 15 gig.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:50.460]   Oh, you didn't register your pixel.
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.740]   Register your pixel.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:52.660]   That's what I got to do.
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:53.980]   You got a terabyte.
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.620]   That's the best reason to get that pixel.
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:56.140]   That's the best part.
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:56.580]   OK.
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.020]   OK.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:58.700]   I got to get on that.
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:37:59.460]   I was like 15 gig.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.300]   What's all the reasons, Leon?
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:02.580]   Oh, I'm sure there are.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.500]   I wouldn't know that.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.820]   But I do know that one.
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.220]   And I had already bought a lot of storage,
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.820]   because I think this is great.
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:10.500]   I want--
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.420]   I mean, I never have to--
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:12.740]   It's the most beautiful thing there is.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:13.420]   I love the backup.
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.820]   Forget me into photography in a way that I never have been.
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.220]   So now I'm using it all the time, three things.
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.460]   I'm using my camera phone, my camera.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.540]   And also, my glass.
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:24.060]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.220]   I took a picture of Vince Serf with Google Glass and Rome.
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.300]   You know, what more perfect could you have?
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.780]   Oh, you wore your glass in Rome.
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:30.340]   How nice.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:30.780]   That's--
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:31.420]   Well, yeah.
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.700]   In Rome, I was at a Google event,
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:37.140]   and nobody there had glass.
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.860]   So I said to the Google people, OK,
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.660]   if I were on stage, I said, yeah, whatever.
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.340]   I don't care.
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.020]   So I wore it on stage and did a little demo.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.180]   And I did it again at Guardian Activate.
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.540]   And I hammed it up.
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.980]   I'm doing that.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:50.500]   What's the word?
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.340]   Peacock.
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.340]   Peacock.
[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:56.140]   They wouldn't have gotten it in Europe.
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:00.660]   But I'm doing that and screaming, you know, OK, glass!
[00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:03.020]   And it gets great laughs.
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.420]   It works well.
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.140]   And then I bring somebody on stage,
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.540]   and they get to try it on.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.300]   Oh, that's a good stick.
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:09.820]   Yeah.
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.100]   And then somebody-- somebody in activate-- when
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.620]   VIT was on, Guardian activate, somebody
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.980]   did the standard stick about, well, everybody's
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.020]   following us at the NSA.
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:21.140]   And now with his Google Glass, I said, whoa, I won't.
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:24.060]   If you've got nothing out of my demo, what you should have
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.180]   gotten is that it is impossible to subtly take a picture
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.420]   of Google Glass.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.940]   OK, glass!
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.300]   OK, glass!
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.900]   Take a picture!
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.340]   Right?
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.500]   Yeah, forget the--
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.780]   OK, let's finish this change.
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:39.500]   Let's change the world.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:40.740]   It's the world longest.
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:41.540]   No, wait a minute.
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.540]   You had more.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.100]   I didn't play--
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:44.580]   Are you done?
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:45.420]   That was it.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:46.900]   OK, I'm sorry.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.140]   Go ahead, play the timponies.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:50.180]   Good to go.
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:50.700]   Good to go.
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.700]   Good to go.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:52.700]   Hold on.
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:53.700]   [DOG BARKING]
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.140]   Rewind the card.
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.580]   Card is rewound.
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:58.100]   That was the Google change log.
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.220]   That is Gina Trippani.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.620]   Lots more news coming up in just a second.
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:05.940]   But first, a word from hover.com.
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:09.140]   It is the best way to register domains,
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.140]   to manage your domains.
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.060]   They've made it simple.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:12.900]   They've made it clean.
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.140]   There's not a lot of upsell.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.580]   If you want to register a domain name, please do me a favor.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:23.620]   Go to hover.com/twig and check it out.
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.180]   It's clean.
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:24.700]   It's easy.
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.140]   They just announced something new.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:32.540]   Add Google Apps for your business.
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:37.780]   So from-- this is-- I just was announced today.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.580]   So I'm not completely up on this.
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:42.340]   But when you go to hover.com and register a domain,
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.420]   you can also use that domain with Google Apps.
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.860]   And they'll make it very simple for you to do so.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:47.540]   Integrates.
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.740]   And we do that here.
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.620]   Twit.tv.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:54.500]   Mail.twit.tv is a Gmail and all of that.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.620]   So this is a really great new feature at Hover.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:00.420]   If you've got domains registered with other registrars,
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.700]   you can transfer them to hover very easily.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.460]   They have a concierge transfer service.
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.300]   They'll pay $10 each.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.500]   But you get an extra year on the domain.
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.900]   So you extend the domain another year over and above what you
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:15.780]   already have left on your domain.
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:18.500]   They will do the transfer for you.
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.260]   You get the great domain management tools.
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.660]   And as with everything at Hover, there
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.380]   is just no wait telephone support.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.500]   If you'd call during regular business hours,
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.780]   which are very extensive-- let me give you the business hours--
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:31.180]   8 AM to 8 PM Eastern time, Monday through Friday,
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:34.180]   you'll get a representative who is empowered to help you,
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.620]   is empowered to fix it.
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.940]   Because this is what Hover was created for--
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:42.980]   to do it right-- domain name registration done right.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.780]   I want you to try it.
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.940]   I use Hover for all my domains now, and I'm so happy.
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.420]   They have great online help support documentation,
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.380]   tutorials.
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:53.340]   They're part of Tukas.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:56.300]   And I know you know Tukas have been around since 1994.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.020]   We love them.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.700]   They've gone into these businesses
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.820]   because they knew they needed to be reinvented.
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:02.660]   And Hover is just great.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:06.580]   They have all the top level domains.com and everything.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.540]   I might note that they do offer you the .NET address
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:11.900]   because so many of the .coms, almost all of them are gone.
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.740]   But they will always tell you what the .NET is.
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.500]   And I think .NET is not bad.
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:21.260]   I mean, Hover has all of the .tv.pro.moby.biz.ca.asia.us,
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:21.980]   all of those.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.300]   But I think .NET is the one to take a look at.
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.340]   I think it's-- for a lot of people,
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.980]   it's just as popular and common as .com.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:29.940]   It doesn't confuse them.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:31.780]   I still often, I'll say, twit.tv.
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.300]   And they say, you mean twit.tv.com?
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.860]   I say, no, twit.tv.
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:37.900]   You don't have that problem with .NET so much.
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:39.900]   Hover.com/twig.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.420]   You'll get 10% off when you use our offer code twig
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:43.940]   on your domain registrations.
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:47.140]   10% off standard domain names when you use the offer code
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.540]   TWIG.
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.700]   So go to hover.com/twig.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:51.260]   Take a look.
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:56.580]   And now, I love this Google Apps integration.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.340]   It makes it so much easier.
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:03.260]   $60 per user per year, $6 per user per month.
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.380]   You'll save 20%.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:05.780]   And they have a 30-day free trial,
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.820]   so you can see what it's like to add it to your domain.
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.300]   You can use one you already know or you already know
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.900]   or you could start fresh.
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:20.220]   Hover.com, thank you for your support of this week in Google.
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:23.580]   Well, some exciting news from T-Mobile.
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.500]   They said they were going to really blow things out
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.380]   of the water.
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:33.540]   They have just announced that you can dump your smartphone
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.700]   twice a year.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.500]   Oh, so it's OK to split that, OK?
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.700]   You pay an extra fee?
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.820]   You pay $10 a month, which is an insurance fee.
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:45.980]   And you could be part of Jump, which stands for--
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.100]   How high?
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:47.540]   How high?
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:52.380]   No, Jump stands for Just Upgrade My Phone.
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:56.060]   You should be just upgrade my damn phone.
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:56.900]   Jibberim.
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:00.020]   You know, I think for most people--
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:01.300]   this is like, what?
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.580]   But for people who watch this show, for everybody at this table--
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:05.740]   Oh, this is everything.
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:06.220]   This is good.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:06.980]   This is awesome.
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:07.700]   Yeah, really good.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.380]   This is awesome.
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.620]   You can trade in your T-Mobile smartphone
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:13.980]   for a new device subsidized after a six-month waiting
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:15.860]   period.
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.780]   They're trying to be the un-carrier, right?
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.220]   After the initial six months, the carrier
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:25.020]   will waive the rest of what is owed on the device.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.220]   I guess you probably have to turn it in, right?
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.780]   Well, it says you have to turn it--
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.300]   to get started, you have to turn it your phone.
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.100]   I think that's what you do.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.820]   I think that's probably how they make it back.
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:37.220]   So it's kind of like rotating phones.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.940]   But what if you break your phone or something?
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.100]   It's part of the insurance.
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.660]   So if the device is broken or has water damage,
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:43.900]   you're paying $10 insurance.
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.220]   There's a deductible.
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.300]   But in effect, you're also getting insurance.
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.700]   That's what most carriers charge just for the handset
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.100]   insurance anyway.
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:54.180]   So this is just kind of an additional feature.
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.420]   That's pretty good.
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:56.940]   It is mobile.
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.100]   This is much needed.
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.580]   This is why you want competition.
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.980]   You want a number four carrier.
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.380]   Yeah.
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:03.780]   Definitely.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:04.780]   Because they try harder.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:05.860]   I wish.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.060]   I'm on a business plan.
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.460]   And so they only support the major three.
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:10.460]   They don't support T-Mobile.
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.500]   So I had to go with one of the--
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.060]   I got with AT&T.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:16.300]   But if they had T-Mobile, this is exactly the reason.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.860]   I would have chosen T-Mobile right away,
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.660]   if that was an option for me.
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:22.100]   And if I was not on a business plan,
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.180]   if I was on a personal plan, it would absolutely be either T-Mobile
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:30.820]   or one of the second tier ones like Ting or Virgin Mobile.
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:33.060]   So here's-- I'm now understanding this
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.780]   is part of the EIP program.
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.460]   So remember, T-Mobile eliminated subsidies.
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:39.700]   But they do have-- which is basically a subsidy--
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.580]   a subsidy and installment plan, right?
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.540]   They call that the Equipment Installment Programmer EIP.
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.700]   So you go to T-Mobile.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.860]   You buy a phone using the EIP.
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:53.460]   Six months later, you can say, OK, take this phone back.
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.620]   And I want the Galaxy S5.
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:59.820]   They say, OK, you no longer have to pay the EIP for the old phone.
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:01.340]   We're going to start you on a new one.
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:02.580]   And you get the new phone.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.380]   But you just have to bring this in.
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:05.780]   There's no contract.
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:06.780]   Right.
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.340]   The EIP is, I guess, kind of a contract.
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.220]   Because you have to-- you owe them.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:11.940]   It's a charge.
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.380]   It's a charge.
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.380]   But there's no annual service contract.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.700]   Very interesting.
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.740]   And this is how my Galaxy S4 is a T-Mobile.
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.700]   And I have to say, you got to check to see
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.300]   if T-Mobile works in your neck of the woods.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:28.300]   But here, T-Mobile's great because nobody uses it.
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.900]   So I'm using their HSPA+.
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:31.340]   They don't have LTE here.
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.700]   But it's the 42-megabit HSPA+.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.780]   And I'm pretty typically getting 20 megabits down.
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:36.260]   Yep.
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.260]   You can argue all you want.
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.220]   Some of the carriers will argue that they have a faster
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:39.820]   network, right?
[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:41.100]   But that's in ideal conditions.
[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:41.460]   Right.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:44.060]   So like you're saying, if you're on T-Mobile and no one else,
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:47.500]   if you go to a baseball game or if you go to any event--
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:49.980]   like I was at the fireworks or 4th of July,
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.460]   I couldn't get hardly any download because everybody around me
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:54.220]   also had a AT&T service.
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.660]   And the pipes were clogged.
[00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:57.660]   So you've got a good point there.
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:02.140]   I mean, T-Mobile should have in certain circumstances
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.380]   better throughput, even if the other guy's network is faster
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.900]   under ideal conditions.
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.820]   As long as they have a nearby tower, which apparently
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.180]   they do in Petaluma.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:14.500]   Now, if you bring an Xs4 or a full length app
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.980]   that you bought, full price--
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:17.620]   That's different.
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.340]   That doesn't normally have for you than the plan.
[00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:21.860]   Well, you're months to month then anyway.
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.540]   So there'll be no benefit to you.
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.940]   You can trade in any time you want.
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:25.540]   You can trust her.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:26.740]   That's right.
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:28.340]   You don't have to wait six months.
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:31.500]   We get to which gene have you done your phone?
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:32.540]   Not yet.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:33.340]   Which one?
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.420]   The HTC One Google experience, right?
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.380]   Give us the update, Gina.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.500]   We knew last night it was in Kansas City.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.180]   It was in Kansas City last night.
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.140]   I actually have been busy enough today
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:44.020]   that I don't know where it's located at the--
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:47.220]   I'm opening slice right now to check to see where it's at.
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:47.940]   But yeah, Kansas City.
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:49.300]   I should be here on Friday.
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:53.980]   I'm very excited because my poor Galaxy Nexus is totally cracked.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.740]   And I'm tired of people saying, oh, you're poor phone.
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:00.540]   Whenever I see it.
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:05.380]   So T-Mobile is adding a couple of phones, July 17th,
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:09.260]   using this plan, the Xperia Z, which is waterproof.
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:12.940]   Is that really thin Sony phone?
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.980]   It's really-- that's interesting because Sony didn't--
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:19.300]   Sony, they also introduced the separate little tiny handsets.
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:19.500]   Right.
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.460]   We were talking about that.
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:21.140]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:21.460]   Right.
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:24.140]   So I think that's really an interesting path where they're going.
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:26.540]   So the idea of the handset is you keep the phone in the pocket
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:28.940]   and you just go, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.100]   Do this little thing.
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:32.980]   And that's your phone now.
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:34.740]   It's not exactly a Bluetooth headset
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:36.020]   because you're holding it, right?
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.100]   Well, you know you can also know it also has little ear--
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:38.620]   You can mount it.
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:39.420]   You can use a Bluetooth.
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:41.060]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:43.580]   The Lumia 925.
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:44.820]   Ooh.
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:46.580]   That's a nice-- if you wanted Windows Phone,
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.340]   that would probably be the one to get.
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:52.300]   That will be available July 17th as well, using this jump
[00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.900]   pricing.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:58.860]   I also interviewed the CEO of Erickson at Guardian
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:48:59.580]   Activate.
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:01.660]   All these videos I hope would be up in a week.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:06.300]   And they're out of the device business.
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:08.660]   They sold that because they were in it with Sony.
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:10.860]   But he's set-- fascinating stat that I just--
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.100]   I should use it for my number, but I won't.
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:17.620]   He said that for every $10 drop in the price of handsets,
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.220]   it adds 100 million users.
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:21.660]   Wow.
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:22.180]   Right.
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.180]   That's the argument for the cheap buy phone.
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.020]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:25.620]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.820]   We also saw-- I don't know if we talk about the show,
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.780]   the Firefox phone.
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:30.820]   Right.
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.380]   That's in Spain.
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:35.620]   And these ways that reduce the handset cost
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:39.020]   have a huge impact then on increasing
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:41.700]   the connected population.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.820]   That's-- yeah, is the way people are getting computing,
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:46.460]   basically, in many areas.
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:48.380]   Yeah, yes.
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:53.300]   Apple has lost its-- well, at least for the time being,
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:57.820]   in the e-book case, a judgment came down this morning.
[00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.660]   Remember, most of the publishers settled--
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:03.500]   I'm curious what you think about this, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:06.580]   Most of the publishers settled out of court.
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:09.100]   But Apple said, no.
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:12.380]   And fought it in court.
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:18.220]   The publishers were--
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:20.100]   I'm going to get this right now.
[00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:21.100]   Who is suing?
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:22.100]   It's complicated.
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.100]   That's the problem.
[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:24.100]   I don't want to say this properly.
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:26.100]   It's something you guys could explain.
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.180]   You know, part of the reason is I don't
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.700]   like to follow court stuff.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.500]   Because even this, it sounds so final.
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:34.540]   Apple's going to appeal.
[00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:36.420]   They said, we didn't do anything wrong.
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:40.660]   There will be a whole another trial on damages.
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:43.580]   So really, nothing-- so little has been decided.
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:48.660]   And yet, it sounds like the decision has been made.
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:53.540]   So the judge ruled that Apple conspired
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:58.100]   with the five major publishers to raise book prices.
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:02.220]   Remember, when Apple came into the market with iBooks,
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:06.020]   the standard process was Amazon would set the price
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.100]   for a book.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.180]   They'd say, no, on Bestsellers-- remember this?
[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:11.380]   Remember, Amazon.com?
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:13.580]   999, Bestsellers, right?
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:15.340]   And the publishers didn't much like that,
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:17.300]   because they wanted to set the price themselves.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.260]   Apple brought in this agency model.
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:20.700]   Well, Apple said, you set the price.
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:22.900]   We'll take 30% or whatever.
[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:24.180]   I don't know what the cut is.
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:24.660]   But--
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:25.660]   And--
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:27.180]   That's like what the publisher's in.
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.100]   And they got the publishers in?
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.420]   I'm not sure why that's wrong.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:33.700]   It seems like--
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:34.700]   Right.
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.380]   There's various arguments about this.
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.020]   And one is that the publishers would say,
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:41.820]   this is better for publishers and better for authors
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:42.700]   and so on and so forth.
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:51.060]   But I also wrote an article last week that Amazon, now
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.140]   that it basically has the lock on the market
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:56.300]   and Barnes and Noble is teetering near death,
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.180]   the head just left.
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:51:59.900]   God knows what's going to happen there.
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:03.900]   So Amazon's getting hegemony in the book business.
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:05.580]   Yeah, that's what Apple was fighting here.
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:07.700]   And it's raising prices.
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:11.220]   So the irony here is that Amazon is going
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:12.300]   to raise prices anyway.
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:14.620]   And so--
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:15.340]   I don't know.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.780]   Apple says, when we introduced the iBook Store in 2010,
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:20.820]   we gave customers more choice injecting much needed
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:23.660]   innovation and competition into the market,
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:26.260]   breaking Amazon's monopolistic grip on the publishing
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:26.660]   industry.
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:28.340]   We've done nothing wrong.
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.740]   We will appeal the judge's decision.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:34.060]   I actually, on the one hand, as a consumer,
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.300]   oh, 999, that's great.
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.140]   I'm going to get this book for much less than it would cost me
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.260]   in a bookstore.
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.220]   But that's kind of to me classic dumping,
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:45.300]   where you set an arbitrarily low cost price until you own
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.500]   the market.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:50.100]   And courts have historically punished people for that.
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:50.940]   Right.
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.900]   On the other hand, you could argue
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:58.340]   that books have been overpriced,
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:02.740]   antiquated distribution chain, look what's
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:04.780]   happened with Kindle Singles and such,
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:07.300]   and that Amazon--
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.060]   there's a hell of a lot more books right now
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:12.980]   than there ever have been because Amazon came in
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:14.340]   and created the structure.
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:15.860]   So--
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:16.420]   Yeah.
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:18.100]   I mean, the costs are certainly lower, right?
[00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:19.580]   I mean, there's no shipping.
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.780]   There's no printing fees.
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:22.620]   No, these aren't ebooks.
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:24.020]   These are real books.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.020]   These are--
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:27.300]   That's actually a minor in terms of the e-book port.
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.300]   That's a fairly minor part of the cost, is it right?
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:30.860]   You got to hire people to hawk the books.
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:32.700]   I mean, I have friends that go around and do this, right?
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:36.380]   You got to hire people to go around and say, buy this book
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:37.140]   to the bookstore.
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:37.700]   To the bookstore.
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:38.500]   I know what you're saying.
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.540]   There's a whole ecosystem around that, right?
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:40.860]   Right.
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:41.420]   Which--
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:41.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:43.980]   --is costly.
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:50.020]   So the publishers, of course, wanted Apple to break this $9.99
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:51.500]   for spicing.
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:52.820]   So that's the conspiracy.
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:53.820]   They all settled out of court.
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:57.060]   Apple continued to defend.
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:59.140]   And one of the things Apple did that might have gotten them
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:02.700]   into trouble, they also said to the publishers, oh,
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.060]   and you can't charge less at any other bookstore
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:08.620]   than you're charging on our bookstore.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:11.620]   And I think that was probably something the publishers wanted,
[00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:15.020]   but that allowed them to go to Amazon, said, hey, I am sorry.
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:18.940]   I do not wish to break out of a trust relationship here,
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:24.180]   but I got to charge $12.99 because Apple is insisting upon that.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:24.860]   Apple played it--
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:25.940]   That is price fixing now.
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:26.900]   Yeah.
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:28.580]   That's probably why they're getting in trouble.
[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:30.660]   Apple played-- this is what the judge wrote.
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:33.460]   Apple played a central role in facilitating and executing
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:34.940]   that conspiracy.
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:38.260]   They seized the moment and brilliantly played its hand
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.500]   through the vehicle of the Apple agency agreements.
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.980]   The price is in the nascent e-book industry
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:44.300]   shifted upward.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:48.620]   In some cases, 50% are more for an individual title.
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:51.460]   Stay on this for a second with Barnes & Noble.
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:53.580]   Barnes & Noble CEO this week has said QUET.
[00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:56.900]   They're basically quitting the tablet business
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.340]   and just going to do the reader business
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:00.260]   because their tablets were competitive
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:04.460]   and they were too restrained and limited.
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:07.620]   So let's imagine that Barnes & Noble Folks--
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:11.100]   God forbid, but they ain't looking good--
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:13.980]   huge amount of retail space, unnecessary,
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:15.500]   charging higher prices to consumers
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:17.900]   than they can get even from vn.com.
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:21.900]   What if Barnes & Noble physical bookstores disappear?
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.420]   The number of independent bookstores
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:26.180]   is diminuous in this country now.
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:30.540]   What happens to the whole notion of the market for books?
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:33.180]   That's the--
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:34.740]   We're going anywhere.
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:37.740]   Are we just eliminating physical media anyway?
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:39.940]   Yeah, well, I guess it's not so revolutionary.
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:41.420]   There are no record stores.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:42.420]   There are no media stores.
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:43.060]   Welcome to the--
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.540]   --to be bookstore in the 21st century.
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:46.940]   I like books.
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:48.380]   I will still buy books, and I think
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:51.300]   there'll be a premium market for physical books.
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:52.300]   That's not going to go away.
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.580]   Books stores will still be around, right?
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:54.580]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:57.740]   They probably won't carry as many obscure new books.
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.740]   Yeah, do you have a library changes dramatically?
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:00.260]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:05.940]   My wife rents on her Nexus 7 all the time.
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:07.580]   She just goes on to the library site.
[00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:08.580]   She's a digital thing.
[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.900]   It goes through Amazon, and she gets it for seven days
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.500]   or whatever it is, and she's a fast reader.
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.420]   So that works for her.
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:16.140]   But yeah, she does that all the time.
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.660]   So I think people are going to trend more towards doing this
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:20.780]   and libraries included.
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:24.500]   So we'll see what happens.
[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:27.700]   Now, OK, so part of this lawsuit, publishers and e-book stores
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:31.460]   will have to end the agency pricing model for two years.
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:34.820]   So if this appeal fails--
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:36.860]   and this could take a long time--
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:40.860]   but if this appeal fails, then all of a sudden,
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:42.660]   we go back to $9.99?
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:46.460]   No, because there's nothing in the agreement
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:47.900]   about what the price should be.
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:49.460]   Amazon's going to say, yeah, yeah, we're
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:51.980]   going to charge $29.99 now.
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:53.740]   And you take it or leave it.
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.860]   And I think that this is exactly what you don't want.
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:57.980]   I don't know.
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:59.660]   I think competition is good.
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:02.700]   But I don't pretend to understand it.
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:06.500]   And you make a good point, which is there isn't--
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.820]   electronic books don't have a--
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:11.180]   there's a considerable number of costs that are out of that.
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:13.740]   I mean, for $0.99 for your Gutenberg, the geek,
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:15.460]   you made some money.
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:15.980]   Exactly.
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:17.860]   And by the way, by the way, it's falling out.
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:18.860]   Two announcements.
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:23.020]   The first is that as of since the last show,
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:24.740]   Gutenberg the Geek in translation
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:27.180]   is now available in German.
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:28.380]   For $0.99?
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:29.340]   Nice.
[00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:31.100]   Gutenberg-- now $2.99.
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:31.620]   Oh.
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:32.860]   They set the price.
[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:33.140]   I didn't--
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:34.140]   Oh, good.
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:37.100]   Gutenberg-- Gutenberg, their nerd.
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:38.580]   No.
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:39.860]   There's no geek in German.
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:40.220]   It's nerd.
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:41.220]   They didn't want to do geek.
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:42.020]   Don't you understand?
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:44.020]   Stainzy, alliteration?
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:45.500]   Gutenberg Geek.
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.180]   They don't have a word geek?
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:48.180]   Gutenberg, their nerd.
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:49.380]   Their nerd.
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:52.460]   But it's a nice, you know, assonance with the Earth sound.
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:53.460]   I can-- yeah, er.
[00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:54.460]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:54.940]   That's true.
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:56.180]   Gutenberg, their nerd.
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:57.500]   And then it's also going to be--
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:58.340]   I've got to go record this.
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:01.180]   It's also going to be an audible single.
[00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:02.780]   Oh, nice.
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:03.860]   Very nice, Jeff.
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:04.940]   Good for you.
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:06.420]   Are you going to read it?
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:07.260]   Yeah, I'm going to read it.
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:07.780]   Awesome.
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:11.820]   It's also separately been translated into Chinese and Italian.
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.340]   That's happening now.
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:13.860]   Very good.
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:14.380]   You.
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:16.140]   Congratulations.
[00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:19.300]   I wonder what they'll call it in Chinese or Italian.
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:22.300]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:22.820]   I don't know.
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:23.660]   It's terrible.
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:26.020]   It seems very strange when your book gets translated.
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:27.980]   And your name is on a thing that you are unable to read.
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:30.700]   When they translated the life hacker book into Japanese,
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:31.820]   I was like, you know what?
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:34.100]   This book could be insulting your mother on the cover.
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:35.100]   And I have no idea.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:35.620]   No idea.
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:36.100]   No idea.
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:36.620]   No idea.
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:37.120]   No idea.
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.500]   That's why you don't get Chinese tattoos.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:39.500]   I'm just saying.
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:40.500]   Yep.
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:42.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.820]   Yeah, I remember seeing my first book in Chinese.
[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:45.900]   It was very odd.
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:47.260]   Very odd.
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:50.620]   Our show brought to you today by 99 Designs,
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:53.820]   the world's largest online graphic design marketplace.
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:58.580]   99 Designs connects you with more than 200,000 talented graphic
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.820]   designers all over the world.
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:03.820]   And it's kind of a marketplace in the sense
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:05.420]   that it's a competition.
[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:10.580]   You set the-- you know, you put out on 99 Designs your contest.
[00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:12.460]   What I need, I need a t-shirt design.
[00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:13.740]   That's what we've done with it.
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:16.060]   I need digital marketing collateral.
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:18.060]   I need a landing page or a Facebook cover.
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:20.220]   I need print marketing collateral.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:22.860]   I need a flyer or a menu.
[00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:25.300]   I need an app design.
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:26.340]   And you go there.
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:30.020]   Designers then compete for the buy.
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:31.820]   They say, OK, how about this?
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:32.220]   How about this?
[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:33.700]   You can work back and forth with them.
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:35.940]   Then pick the winning designer.
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:38.140]   And man, this is quite successful.
[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:43.020]   As of today, there are 236,800 designers
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:45.380]   submitting ideas on 99 Designs.
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:50.060]   There are 1,876 open contests out of a quarter million,
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:51.860]   almost, that they've done to date.
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:56.180]   Total payouts last month to designers, $1.7 million.
[00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:59.340]   Total payouts, overall $56 million.
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:01.660]   99 Designs is super cool.
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:06.740]   If you're a geek and you know how to code, you know how to design
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.060]   websites, you know how to do all that,
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:12.660]   but you don't have that visual sense, go to 99designs.com.

[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:14.500]   Thank them for their support of this week in Google.
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:17.700]   Melody Macfessel.
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.820]   This is a great piece.
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:20.220]   I never heard of her.
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:21.540]   It was a fluff piece.
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.460]   I'll admit it.
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:23.580]   And I've never heard of her either.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:26.620]   And in fact, she must have asked not to be photographed,
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.220]   like straight on, because all the photos of her
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:33.140]   are either sort of side or they're a little blurry.
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:34.300]   But this is a great piece and wired
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:38.980]   about Melody Macfessel, who was in charge of Google's
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:42.020]   internal engineering tools.
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.500]   So cool.
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.860]   Yeah, great, great piece about how she leads the team that
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:48.740]   builds the tools that Google engineers use.
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:52.460]   So nothing that's consumer-facing or user-facing.
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:56.220]   The plugins, the IDEs, the coding, the testing tools,
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:57.620]   the push architecture that they use.
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.860]   And in fact, Wired couldn't write a whole lot about what
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:00.860]   these tools actually are.
[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:03.060]   They didn't even use the names of the tools, which amazed me.
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:04.620]   Yeah, they couldn't use the name--
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:07.100]   well, because this is Google's business value.
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.060]   This is part of the secret sauce that
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:11.660]   makes Google run the way that it does.
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:16.060]   I understand that, because we have internal tools that really
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:17.500]   are our secret sauce.
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.820]   That's some of the value that comes in.
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.140]   But probably have silly names.
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:22.580]   They're all named after Jetson's characters.
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:23.580]   Right.
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:23.940]   Oh, that's a good--
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.700]   We got Rosie, Elroy.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.820]   What is some of-- Jane?
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:29.700]   They're all acronyms.
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:30.620]   They're all retro names.
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.300]   We come up with a name, and then we have to come up
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:33.060]   with an acronym.
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.700]   What is--
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:35.820]   Rosie, it was the first one.
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:39.940]   It was kind of a wiki that's the repository of--
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:40.980]   I can't remember.
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:41.620]   Do you remember Chad?
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:42.860]   Get an engineer in here.
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:43.940]   And only the engineers know.
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:46.500]   Anyway, so what's cool about this is I guess
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.420]   that she's a woman, right?
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.060]   She's a very important part.
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:51.100]   She says, if these systems don't work, then Google
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:51.620]   doesn't work.
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:54.980]   There would be no Kirk without Scotty.
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:55.980]   Love that.
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:57.380]   She's Scotty.
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:59.540]   Yeah, she's Scotty, exactly.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.340]   Another way to think--
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.380]   Another way to think about the story, go ahead, Gina.
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.420]   I was going to say that the part that
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:04.860]   started to really kind of spoke to me in the first couple
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:06.980]   of graphs that she said that she's
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:08.980]   been working in startups and technology for a long time
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.740]   and that she had two separate wardrobe.
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:13.420]   She had her work wardrobe and then her at home
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.620]   regular life wardrobe.
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:19.540]   And her work wardrobe was jeans and t-shirts and hoodies
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:21.980]   because she kind of made herself into one of the guys
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:24.340]   because she was surrounded by male engineers all day.
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.620]   And then she'd go home and she'd put on skirts and dresses
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:29.620]   and things that she kind of like to wear in her own life
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:31.380]   and that she had gotten to this point in her career
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.820]   where she was like, you know what?
[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:35.300]   I'm just going to be myself everywhere that I am.
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.300]   Good.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:39.380]   And that entailed her wearing dresses to work
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.740]   because that's what she likes to wear.
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:41.740]   Yeah.
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:43.420]   And she kind of consciously kind of
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.980]   had to make that decision, which is so interesting to me.
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.900]   But yeah, it's a good piece.
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:49.900]   And I really like that.
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.540]   There's another part of the piece where it said
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.420]   a friend of her, a close friend of hers and colleague
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:56.380]   of Google said that she doesn't feel passionately
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:04:00.420]   about getting other women into the place that she is.
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:03.500]   She just knows that she deserves to be in that place,
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:06.180]   which I really liked.
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.940]   But I really like-- I guess she kind of came in
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.540]   and looked at the developer tools and the internal engineering
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:11.260]   tools.
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:13.100]   And her edict to the team was, we
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:16.300]   have to build these as if they were a consumer-facing product.
[01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:19.940]   We have to make them fun to use, good looking, easy to use
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.580]   because if engineers are happy and they have tools
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:23.700]   that they like to use, then they're more productive.
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:26.300]   And I just think that's so important.
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:27.740]   I worked at so many startups.
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.700]   Gawker, the CMS, was a nightmare.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.740]   I worked even.
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:32.940]   Even on ThinkUp, we have a couple of internal tools.
[01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:36.340]   And it's so easy to just build something that just
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:37.780]   far enough for it to work.
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:38.620]   And it's kind of ugly.
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.580]   And you ask your people to just do this little workaround
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.780]   and do this, that, and the other thing.
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:44.380]   But if you take the time to make really good products,
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.180]   internal products, I think that that sets up a tone.
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:50.780]   People enjoy using tools that are beautiful and easy to use.
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.180]   So I--
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:52.620]   So I have to--
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:54.940]   I would imagine too that there's a little tool
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:57.300]   macho that internally--
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:59.380]   we don't make this too easy because if we
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:01.380]   have to make it too easy, you're an idiot.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:01.900]   Right?
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:04.420]   Because there's a test there.
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:05.060]   I wonder.
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:05.500]   I wonder.
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:06.060]   I bet.
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:06.420]   I bet.
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:07.980]   I really like-- apparently Google has a system.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:10.420]   All their internal engineering tools,
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:13.700]   the code is open-- open in so far within the company
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:14.900]   that it's available--
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:17.300]   made available by the system, a web-based system,
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.220]   whose own source code is also available through this system.
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:22.100]   So it's this recursive openness.
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:26.100]   So anybody can inspect the code and contribute to the code.
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:27.900]   But man, I don't often feel this way.
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:29.020]   But I read this piece and I was like,
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:30.700]   I really want to wish I want to work at Google.
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:31.220]   Oh, no.
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:32.020]   I just want to see this stuff.
[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:33.540]   They celebrate code.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:34.700]   Yeah.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:35.220]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:37.500]   So our tools-- Patrick De LaHandy,
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.660]   who's doing a lot of the coding for it--
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:42.980]   we, by the way, we finally got in a house programmer, Patrick.
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.740]   Because we realized exactly what you said,
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.620]   the internal tools are so important to our workflow.
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.740]   And as we grow and make more shows,
[01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:51.900]   we want to make sure that we can do it efficiently.
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.820]   So Rosie was the first--
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:55.740]   that was the repository of standardized
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:57.420]   informational explication.
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.980]   I don't think I had another acronym for it.
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:01.940]   But that--
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:04.340]   That tells me a lot about what that does.
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:06.060]   It's a wiki.
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:06.740]   OK.
[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:09.100]   Jane, what does Jane do?
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.900]   Jane is just another number enhancer.
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.180]   I don't know what Jane does.
[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:15.780]   Astro, which is our ticket system,
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:18.420]   is a system to restore order.
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.580]   That makes sense, right?
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:21.580]   Astro.
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:24.260]   And then the most recent one is Elroy.
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:27.940]   Have we decided what Elroy does or--
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:30.180]   Pretty positive we came up with one.
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:31.820]   I came up-- we had a contest.
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:32.260]   Yeah.
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:34.100]   I came up with a retro-nim.
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.060]   You got 50 bucks in the journal.
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:38.420]   But I don't see any-- where's my 50 bucks?
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:38.860]   Well, I don't know.
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.900]   It's really strange because it'd be like taking out my wallet,
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:42.740]   taking out 50 bucks and giving it to myself.
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.260]   But that's OK.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.140]   Winning's winning.
[01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:48.020]   I look at this tax implications, Leo.
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.340]   I want to see--
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:52.660]   I want to see you name some tool this crazy thing.
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:53.700]   This crazy thing.
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:55.100]   What is this crazy thing, dude?
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.780]   As in Jane, stop this crazy thing.
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:57.820]   Stop this crazy thing.
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:06:59.900]   Oh, the bear bell.
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:00.420]   Right.
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.900]   Right.
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:03.540]   That's next on the list.
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:04.940]   Mr.-- what was the boss's name?
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:07.500]   Mr. Elroy's-- yeah, Mr. Spacely.
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:08.500]   We don't have a space like you.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:09.140]   Who would that be?
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:10.340]   Elroy is a great name.
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:15.140]   Elroy is-- yeah, that's the most important tool.
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:17.460]   It's replacing MTIG.
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:19.060]   I remember what MTIG's did.
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.060]   What's MTIG's did?
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:21.940]   Multi-transcode internet go.
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:24.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:26.060]   So Elroy has that--
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:26.660]   Has that been in code?
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:29.420]   That was-- Elroy-- no, El-- yeah.
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:32.100]   That's the workflow where you put in a show
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:34.300]   and it comes out on YouTube and all the other places.
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:35.300]   Right, right.
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:36.300]   Exactly.
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.900]   Yeah, encoding-- I came up with a name,
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.580]   but I can't remember what it is.
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.660]   Easily lose royalties over at YouTube.
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:45.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:46.580]   That's actually the name.
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:48.620]   I believe that-- I think we have a winner.
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:52.900]   Court Anonymous-- I owe you $50.
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:56.620]   This tool lets us easily lose royalties over YouTube.
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.060]   Accurate and memorable.
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:58.580]   Yeah.
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:07:59.780]   That might be a good show title.
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:01.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:07.580]   Anyway, it's a sad thing that we have to write articles about.
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:10.020]   Look, here's an important woman in engineering.
[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.020]   Yes.
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:14.420]   I wish we didn't, but I'm glad Kate Metz did write this article.
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:16.060]   And I'm glad--
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:18.060]   The feller on the film.
[01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:22.820]   Indiegogo was at Guardian Activate, where I presided only
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:23.660]   yesterday.
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:26.220]   And she said-- she had a--
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:26.620]   what was it?
[01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:27.620]   No, it wasn't her.
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:29.300]   It was the-- I think the head of the Nike Five.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:30.580]   I forget who it was now.
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:36.380]   Somebody had a-- that said that whereas I think Indiegogo
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:41.580]   and companies like that support 40% women ventures,
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:45.220]   VCs support-- only 3% of VCs companies
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.900]   have women executives.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:49.100]   VCs support a company.
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.540]   I don't know what the source for that was,
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:51.580]   but it was just shocking.
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:54.540]   I don't understand it.
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:55.020]   Yep.
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:56.420]   And in my limited experience with the VCs,
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:58.860]   you can tell pretty much from the get-go whether or not
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:02.420]   they're interested in funding a woman founded company.
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:03.660]   It's interesting.
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:04.340]   It's interesting.
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:07.460]   It's actually a really good filter for me.
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:09.420]   But anyway.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:13.660]   You saw the hysterical cartoon video of the VC process
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:14.660]   that somebody made.
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.340]   Oh, I wish I could--
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:16.140]   Oh, no.
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:16.940]   Oh, it was--
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:17.940]   It was hysterical.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:21.220]   Oh.
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.340]   Oh, if I could just find it.
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:24.700]   Why don't I bookmark this?
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:27.100]   We should have some way I could keep track of this.
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:27.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.100]   It's a place you can see.
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.980]   We should have somewhere--
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:32.500]   See kids somehow said to me--
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.100]   --track of it.
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:35.540]   I'm sure--
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.060]   Do you really--
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:39.580]   Actually, it's called the chat room.
[01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:40.780]   We're looking at them right now.
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:41.300]   OK, guys.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:42.700]   It's called Earn Your Key.
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:43.900]   The chat room.
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:44.700]   You know what I'm talking about?
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:45.700]   There's a cartoon.
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:46.700]   There we go.
[01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:47.580]   There you go, Link.
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:48.660]   I wonder if that's it though.
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:49.660]   There was a cartoon.
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:50.420]   Cartoon.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:50.940]   Yeah.
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:52.420]   You're like our Googling minions.
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:54.260]   I imagine you all as little yellow--
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:55.060]   Yeah, this is it.
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:57.060]   Wow.
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.060]   You win again.
[01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:59.420]   Sorry about the explosion.
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:00.940]   This is what it would have looked like.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:05.460]   Had Nikolai Tesla had to go to venture capital and pitch them--
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:06.260]   Oh, I've seen this.
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:07.140]   This is good.
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:08.740]   If it was only play.
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:11.500]   And of course, we need a name for the internet.
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.300]   There you go.
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:15.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.140]   Oh, my--
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:17.140]   Oh, my--
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.780]   Nick, my partners are really excited.
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:19.300]   Hi, Nick.
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.580]   Can't wait to see what you got.
[01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:21.420]   Thanks for having--
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:22.260]   You're--
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:22.940]   Oops.
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.260]   Oh, you're watching me.
[01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:25.300]   I thought that was you.
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:26.180]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.660]   I'm start over.
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:29.060]   Start over.
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:30.060]   Do over.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:30.780]   I thought it was him.
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:31.820]   Thanks for coming in, Nick.
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.140]   My partners are really excited.
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:33.620]   Hi, Nick.
[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:34.940]   Can't wait to see what you got.
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:35.740]   Thanks for having--
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.420]   You're not going to show a deck, are you?
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:38.740]   Well, I would like to see a deck.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.780]   Well, I will begin by showing you
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:44.020]   my inventions for transmitting electricity wirelessly.
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:44.900]   Sounds great.
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:46.500]   Hey, do you mind if Josh sits in?
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:47.100]   Sure.
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.020]   Who's Josh?
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:49.020]   Nice to meet you.
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:50.460]   Josh is an EIR.
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:52.820]   He's thinking of starting a company in your space.
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:54.140]   That does not sound great.
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.420]   Just leave out the parts you are not comfortable sharing.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:58.020]   Or we can reschedule.
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.860]   Since it took a while to schedule--
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:00.780]   Fantastic.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:03.180]   Before you proceed, can you tell us a bit about the market?
[01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:06.900]   My inventions allow the wireless transfer of energy
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:09.020]   to power any device.
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.780]   So this is a wireless play or an energy play.
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:14.580]   Technically, it would be both.
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:16.500]   Hard to do two things at once.
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:20.780]   The inventions send in the new wirelessly to any device,
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:22.140]   even mobile devices.
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:23.820]   So this is a mobile play.
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:26.500]   If this can make things he can go after three markets at once,
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:27.260]   he's crazy.
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:28.260]   Maybe not.
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:29.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:32.740]   But three big intersecting opportunities.
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.940]   Nick, I think you're sounding a bit defensive.
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:37.700]   If you had to pick one market, which one would you pick?
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:40.660]   Energy is the simplest way to think about it.
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.740]   Energy is not as hot as it used to be.
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:44.340]   You can always pivot back to energy
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:45.380]   if it gets hot again.
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:46.780]   Maybe you can keep things simple.
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:48.940]   What about some kind of tie into Facebook?
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:49.540]   Josh?
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.860]   Totally.
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:52.900]   Or a Kickstarter campaign, maybe.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.900]   Oh, did you do a Kickstarter?
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:55.500]   No.
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.100]   I did not think a Kickstarter was the right avenue
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.300]   for this business given the product.
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.460]   The product is supposed to be amazing.
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:04.980]   I don't see it on Kickstarter.
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:07.260]   Sounds like you might be a bit ahead of the market.
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:09.540]   I have licenses for the technology
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:12.620]   with Samsung, Apple, and Intel.
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:13.900]   Intel is in trouble.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:15.780]   I wonder how Apple stocked it today.
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:18.140]   The main point is on business models
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:20.540]   to license to these kinds of companies.
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:22.340]   It's funny because it's true.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:23.860]   That's what's sad about it.
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:26.340]   It's amazing how spot on this is.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.500]   Apparently, the Fed might do something with interest rates.
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:30.140]   Anyway, we'll stop.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:31.420]   But go watch it.
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:32.460]   It's on YouTube.
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:36.420]   Just search for Nikola Tesla pitching Silicon Valley VCs.
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.100]   It's just a crazy-- because it's the whole industry
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.460]   that's made up of jerks with money.
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:42.020]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:44.060]   But what's new, right?
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.620]   It's always been that way.
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:47.100]   Yeah.
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:49.100]   Yeah, OK.
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:51.260]   [SINGING]
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:53.060]   We have a few interesting things here, Leo.
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:56.580]   We have-- you could go high market or low market.
[01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:59.060]   You could go with Google interns terrorizing neighbors
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:00.580]   or you could go with Google live streaming
[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:02.860]   from the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:03.860]   Wow.
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:04.220]   There really is.
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:06.060]   That is a broad gulf.
[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:08.740]   Let's start with the terrorizing interns.
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:09.900]   And then we'll go to Mecca.
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:10.420]   I thought you were.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:12.380]   It is Ramadan.
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:13.100]   It is.
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:14.060]   I don't know if that's related.
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:15.500]   But go ahead.
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.700]   Terrorizing interns.
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.740]   Well, just so New York Magazine has a story
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:22.660]   that neighbors complain.
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:24.900]   They started a Facebook group about all the interns.
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.460]   Evidently, there's a big apartment complex
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:28.300]   where the interns live.
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:29.980]   You could imagine what this is like.
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:31.580]   You know, everyone lives next to it.
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:32.820]   We're ready in the world.
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:34.300]   Yeah.
[01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:36.620]   You know, I'm waiting for-- what was the great-- oh.
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:37.860]   It's like a college dorm.
[01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:39.700]   It's basically you're living in a college dorm.
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:40.700]   You don't want to be--
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:41.540]   But swimming pools.
[01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:43.140]   You know, what I'm waiting for.
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:45.180]   These guys are the next masters of the universe, right?
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:45.700]   Right.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:46.260]   And they know it.
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:47.660]   There's going to be that kind of-- yeah,
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:48.660]   there's going to be that kind of behavior.
[01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:49.660]   Of course there is.
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:51.740]   Yeah, but it was in college anyway.
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:53.380]   I lived in my 20s.
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:56.100]   I lived in the Silicon Valley, an apartment.
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.340]   I worked in a radio station in San Jose.
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:00.420]   And it was really-- this was when Atari was big.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:03.820]   And it was really interesting to see the snotty attitude.
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.780]   By the way, if you worked for Atari,
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:08.500]   you were like King of the-- at the time, King of the World.
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.140]   And so snotty.
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.140]   So rude.
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:15.380]   I argued in what would Google do that we should
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:18.140]   disaggregate the functions of college.
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:21.420]   And there's education and research and there's socialization.
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:23.780]   The socialization is just Melrose Place.
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:24.380]   Yeah.
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:26.100]   You should live in an apartment building like this.
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:27.620]   And you figure out how to get along with people.
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:30.420]   Jeff and I are the parents of college kids.
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:34.300]   We're paying god on untold amounts of money
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:37.740]   for this socialization thing.
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:38.900]   Working well, too, isn't it?
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:40.700]   Oh, they're socialized.
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:42.300]   Oh, party.
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:44.980]   My favorite line from this article is,
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.660]   at first I thought it was a summer camp.
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:48.820]   But then I noticed that the kids were too old.
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:52.260]   You said Rochelle Fisher, 46-year-old resident of the--
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:53.500]   Not acting, too old.
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.340]   Just--
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:55.860]   They dart out in the middle of the street.
[01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:57.060]   They jaywalk all the time.
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:57.900]   Cloud parties.
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:14:59.980]   I have to be very careful when I'm driving.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:02.340]   Can you imagine the people who lived next door
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:04.500]   to the Facebook house in the early days?
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.620]   Oh, god.
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:07.540]   Talk about Fras House.
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:09.860]   Is that a true scene in the movie where
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:11.540]   they pull the chimney off the house
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:14.780]   because they're making a zip line?
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:18.220]   If it's not true, it's true to the idea.
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.580]   I thought that was based on an incident,
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:22.420]   but I don't know.
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:23.420]   That movie was so fraught with--
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:24.260]   I think it was.
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:25.260]   Issues.
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.580]   Yeah.
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:27.260]   Wow.
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:28.380]   Yeah.
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:31.260]   I look forward to the future when all of our technology is not
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.620]   created by--
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:34.860]   By teenage boys.
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:35.460]   Yeah.
[01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:36.580]   To put it frankly.
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:37.580]   Yeah.
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:38.580]   Adolescent boys.
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:39.100]   Let's put it back.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:39.620]   Yes.
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:41.340]   I would like adults designing my social networks.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:42.180]   Thank you very much.
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.380]   We're too old and tired.
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:45.780]   Well, the irony is the people that were at Atari
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:47.260]   and other places like that back then
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:48.460]   are now the ones complaining.
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.100]   Right.
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:49.620]   Me?
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:50.460]   Because they're over.
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:50.900]   Yeah.
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.220]   Get off of my lawn, you--
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:53.060]   The curmudgeons.
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:53.060]   It's come--
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:54.140]   Get off my lawn.
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:54.660]   --it's come so circle.
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:55.020]   All right.
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:59.020]   And Ramadan, a live stream of Mecca for Ramadan.
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:02.980]   This is important because it's a place that unless you're--
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.940]   Islamic, you can't go.
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:05.900]   Really?
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:06.980]   This is Mecca.
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:08.420]   We ain't allowed to go to Mecca.
[01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:09.620]   Interesting.
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:12.860]   Unless one of you is Muslim and I don't know it.
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:14.820]   But we're allowed to watch the live stream.
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.260]   But we watch the live stream.
[01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:19.140]   So yeah, this is kind of a big deal.
[01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:23.980]   And Mecca is where you go on pilgrimage.
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.860]   You hope at least once in your life--
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:29.260]   Let me see if I could pull up the live stream.
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:30.220]   I've got it.
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:31.460]   You have to get in so much.
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:32.980]   But oh, I'm on an Apple MacBook.
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:33.620]   Yeah.
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:34.540]   I'm on a Lenovo.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:35.140]   Come on.
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:36.340]   This is the new MacBook Air.
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.620]   And I really do think it has trouble.
[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:39.700]   Can you hear it?
[01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:41.060]   I hear the Muizini.
[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:43.260]   Oh, there it is.
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:44.060]   Wow.
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:50.020]   So I'm kind of amazed that we're allowed to stream this.
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:50.340]   Yeah.
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:51.060]   Mine too.
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:51.620]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:52.780]   Isn't it the same--
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:54.220]   Wouldn't it be the same restrictions?
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:55.620]   One would think.
[01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:57.620]   Well, they've got to be Muslim, the camera operators,
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:59.420]   and the technicians, I presume.
[01:16:59.420 --> 01:16:59.900]   But--
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:00.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:01.500]   Yeah.
[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.140]   Yeah, this is kind of amazing.
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:04.740]   This is an amazing bit of access
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:05.940]   to something really--
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:07.900]   They're not inside, though, right?
[01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:09.140]   No, but these are the pilgrims around.
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.140]   I don't know what they're doing.
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:13.180]   There's that amazing cycle of people that happens.
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:13.540]   Right.
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:14.940]   They go around in the circle.
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:15.460]   Yeah.
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:18.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:24.100]   I always enjoyed the calls of the museum.
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:27.900]   When we were in Egypt, we went to a mosque
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:31.820]   and stood next to the guy as he did his call.
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:32.340]   Wow.
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:33.620]   It was just--
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:34.820]   Their voices are gorgeous.
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:36.060]   Usually, they're up in the minarets.
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:37.300]   They're in the towers.
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:39.500]   You hear it distorted loudspeakers.
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:40.740]   It's not very good.
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:43.260]   But when you hear somebody singing right next to you,
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:45.020]   just beautiful.
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:46.860]   And he was actually reading--
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:49.260]   so the wall of the mosque had the Quran--
[01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:50.380]   the words of the Quran written on it.
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:52.500]   He was reading it as he was singing it.
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:53.860]   So he was turning it.
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:54.860]   Oh, wow.
[01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:54.860]   Yeah.
[01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:55.860]   It's kind of cool.
[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:56.380]   Yeah.
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:57.260]   I recorded it somewhere.
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:59.620]   I have a recording of that.
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:02.660]   Google has-- we talked about this on security now.
[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:06.780]   I don't know who's the evil actor here.
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:08.780]   I think it's ad blocks.
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:12.580]   They're paying ad blocks plus not to block their ads.
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:14.340]   Yeah, ad blocks does this as a policy.
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:16.220]   And I just think it's-- and I've tweeted about this
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:17.420]   and they come out with their PR.
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:18.780]   I really kind of don't care.
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:20.060]   It's ransom.
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.580]   It's ridiculous.
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:22.540]   So you can pay to be waiting for--
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:25.780]   If you're running ad blocks on your computer,
[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:28.140]   you're running it so that you don't see ads on web pages.
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:31.660]   Now, we could argue about whether that's a good thing or not.
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:33.860]   I mean, as an ad supported medium,
[01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:35.340]   I feel like that's kind of cheating.
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.380]   I don't use an ad blocker.
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:38.340]   Even as you notice, when we pull up pages,
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:41.260]   we don't block the ads on the pages.
[01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:42.740]   But just because I feel like that's
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:44.380]   the price you're paying for the content.
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:45.100]   Exactly.
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:46.700]   But that's an argument-- separate argument.
[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:48.700]   I think it's completely reprehensible
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:52.980]   that the company that makes this product ad block plus to block
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:55.180]   ads is then going to advertise or saying,
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:56.540]   ebb it for a small amount.
[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:59.020]   We don't block you.
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:01.180]   I don't know what it's the default setting, right?
[01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:03.860]   So they have an acceptable ads list, right,
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:05.140]   which is on by default.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:09.260]   And so Google's being paid to be on that list, right?
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:10.260]   Users can turn it off.
[01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:11.220]   Google's paying to be on that list.
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:13.660]   Google's paying to be on the acceptable ads list,
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:16.260]   which is there's this acceptable ad whitelist, which
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:17.060]   is on by default.
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:17.580]   Right?
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:18.940]   At least it's power the default setting.
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:19.820]   That's powerful.
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:20.940]   And Google's paying on that list.
[01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:22.860]   So it's interesting because this is-- yeah,
[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:24.540]   Google's paying for the default setting
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:25.980]   to be that they're not blocked.
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:27.940]   I don't blame them if I were Google, I would, too.
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:31.500]   By the way, they block ad block from the Play Store.
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:31.860]   You can't--
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:32.980]   From the Play Store.
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.260]   Yeah.
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:35.220]   Huh.
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:38.380]   So ad blocks plus, by the way, to be clear,
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:39.700]   this is not ad blocks.
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:40.940]   Yeah, they'll come after us.
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:42.780]   There are PR people who will come after us after this.
[01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:43.580]   I actually--
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:46.700]   I switched from ad block plus back to ad block
[01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:49.020]   because of the Google ads that I didn't want to see.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:51.060]   And it was more because I was upset with Google
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:52.860]   because they were hiding the ads,
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:55.700]   because they make it that really light yellow color,
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:56.700]   that top block.
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:58.340]   And if you're not looking at it just right,
[01:19:58.340 --> 01:19:59.340]   you can't even see.
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:00.180]   That's not right.
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:00.940]   That's not right either.
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:01.980]   It's deceptive, I think.
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:03.580]   If it's an ad, it should be clear.
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:04.700]   It's not in the search for us.
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:05.140]   That's right.
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:05.540]   That's right.
[01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.860]   And there was no way to fix that.
[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:08.340]   And so I said, you know what?
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:11.140]   Ad block plus isn't taking care of this anymore.
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.380]   So I went back to ad block.
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:14.460]   Aaron, let me go up here for a second here.
[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:18.820]   What's the harm of seeing ads, number one?
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:22.540]   Number two, for those of us who cover all these things,
[01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:26.380]   the ads often have content value that is of interest.
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:30.900]   I find things in ads that we talk about and that matter.
[01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:33.740]   Number three, this supports the like of your child
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:34.980]   right next to you, Leo.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:37.220]   You want to buy that soupy slurp before,
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:39.220]   by at least looking at his ads.
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:41.140]   And you listen to him in the podcast,
[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:44.060]   I don't understand the ethical decision.
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:47.060]   For me, it's more of a--
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:50.340]   it's less that I don't like ads and more of a layout.
[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:51.820]   It's what ads do to crap about speech.
[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:52.980]   It's what exactly--
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:53.580]   Exactly.
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:54.740]   And so content, I have to say content creators
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:56.300]   are responsible for this.
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:59.620]   Because one of the reasons we do the ads the way we do them
[01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:01.980]   is we try to choose advertisers that are appropriate.
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:05.180]   I mean, we spend a lot of time thinking about how we do the ads
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:06.900]   and choosing the right advertisers.
[01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:08.980]   And I think it is the responsibility of the content
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:12.060]   creator not to have takeovers.
[01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:15.020]   Where you go to a page and the whole page is taken over
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:18.220]   by an advertiser, it slows you down.
[01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:19.860]   It's unesthetically--
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:21.100]   and it's unappealing.
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:24.500]   And I feel like content creators are somewhat
[01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:25.220]   to blame for this.
[01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:28.380]   And so I don't blame people who use adblock.
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:30.700]   Because that's a very good reason to use it, Aaron.
[01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:33.460]   On the other hand, I think it's really important for people
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:37.740]   to understand that when you're reading content on websites,
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:41.260]   like Salon, that content's paid for by ads.
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.180]   And it's good content.
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:45.020]   I think they have the right to display the ads.
[01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:47.300]   So I think blocking them is kind of cheating.
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:47.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.300]   Saying you don't want to consume the content,
[01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:50.500]   but I don't want to see the ad.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:51.780]   Well, that's cheating.
[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:56.900]   If I ran a site, I would block adblock users.
[01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:58.700]   This is what Adblocks Plus says.
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:02.660]   "White listing is free for all small websites and blogs.
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:05.300]   However, managing this list requires significant effort
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:06.300]   on our side.
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:10.140]   And this task cannot be completely taken over by volunteers
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:11.980]   as it happens with common filter lists."
[01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:15.740]   This is why we are being paid by some larger properties
[01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:18.540]   that serve non-intrusive advertisements that
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:22.820]   want to participate in the Acceptable Ads Initiative.
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:24.860]   I think that, to me, says that Adblocks Plus
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:26.540]   is playing both sides of the fence.
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:27.420]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:28.060]   Absolutely.
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:29.140]   It's blackmail.
[01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:31.580]   Yeah.
[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:32.300]   But it's interesting.
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:35.580]   This Acceptable Ads Initiative seems
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:38.380]   like Adblock Plus is in the position
[01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:40.020]   to be able to say, you know what?
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:42.740]   Your ads are so onerous that they degrade the user experience
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:46.340]   of your site so much that they're just not good ads anymore.
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:46.840]   Right?
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.140]   Do we need something like that?
[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:51.160]   A slideshow or something clearly, totally unnecessary.
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:53.800]   A takeover, a flyover, a thing that rolls down
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.480]   and starts playing sound without my permission.
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:58.380]   Like, that upsets me, right?
[01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:00.520]   Because I feel like that's a user experience.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:02.520]   That says to me, this site does not
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:05.860]   care about my experience at all and just cares about serving
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:07.300]   crazy and saying ads.
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:09.560]   Well, and I never go back to that site, by the way.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:12.560]   Well, it wasn't that role, though, in the early days
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.840]   of advertising the web, that was the role
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.520]   where the browser is taken over, right?
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:19.400]   So pop-ups were killed by the browsers.
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:19.900]   Yeah.
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:20.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:20.900]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:22.360]   And pop-ups haven't died yet.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.360]   No, I suppose.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:23.860]   Yeah.
[01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:27.400]   But pop-ups, pop-overs were killed by the browsers.
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.480]   The browser manufacturers determined
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:30.200]   what was acceptable.
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.360]   You're right, G. There is a role for that, absolutely.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.200]   Yeah, they agree with that.
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.720]   It is.
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.280]   And so I feel like there's an opportunity to say,
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:39.160]   these are the things that--
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:41.080]   this is the good way to serve ads.
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:42.880]   These are the ads that improve the user experience.
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:45.360]   And these are the kind of ads that degrade the user experience.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:48.160]   And it'd be really cool to see an organization-- maybe it
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.560]   can't be ad-block.
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:50.520]   Plus it's a point.
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:51.040]   I think that's the issue.
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.200]   That's what they argue they're doing.
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.120]   And I think you're right.
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:54.600]   And I think that that is decent.
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:56.880]   But they are in a definite conflict of interest.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:59.040]   And it makes it a lot odd.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:23:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:00.360]   I agree.
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:00.720]   I agree.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.120]   I would love to see--
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:04.320]   I would totally install an extension that
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.160]   if I did a Google search, or if I found a link on Twitter,
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.560]   or whatever, and I clicked on it,
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.360]   and it popped up and said, hey, you know what?
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:14.280]   This site has a history of serving user hostile advertisements.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.880]   Do you want to stay here or not?
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.800]   And I could say no.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:17.840]   I mean, think about it.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:20.920]   That's what Chrome does for sites that sort of spam.
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:21.420]   Right?
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:23.120]   I feel like this is one way that we could make--
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.200]   This developer, I think you could make it in a weekend.
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:29.080]   Just don't then go to companies and say-- and by the way,
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:32.160]   I could keep you off of that list if you give me a little bit.
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:33.760]   It's a channel conflict.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.960]   Well, it would have to be like the Webmaster Guidelines thing.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.760]   Like, hey, you'll get off this list if you show us--
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:41.760]   that you've changed your ways.
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.760]   I don't know.
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:43.920]   Kind of an idea.
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.920]   But I agree that this is weird.
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.320]   This will pay for getting on the waitlist.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.800]   I'm surprised that Adblock didn't say, hey,
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:49.800]   put us back in the Play Store.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:52.680]   We'll put you on the waitlist.
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:55.200]   And Google wouldn't have done that a bit.
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.240]   That would have been--
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.640]   That would be wrong.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.280]   That would have been really bad for Google's.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:24:59.880]   Really bad for Google's.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:00.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.200]   That's already looks bad for Google.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:04.600]   So Jeff, whose PR people are going to come after us, Google's?
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.100]   Adblock.
[01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:06.120]   What I liked was--
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.600]   That I was surprised at this.
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.640]   They came kind of after me.
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.080]   Oh, no, we have to talk to you.
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:12.760]   And I still said, I just don't like it.
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:13.260]   Sorry.
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:14.260]   It's a challenge.
[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:16.800]   My students, a lot of prayer students,
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.500]   go through this almost universally.
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.380]   Are we a B2B company or a B2C company?
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:23.240]   And I say to them all the time, you cannot be both.
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:24.080]   You'll end up in conflict.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:25.860]   You can't compete with your customers.
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:27.380]   If you're B2C, you serve them.
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:29.340]   They serve the end customers.
[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:30.500]   And you make them happy.
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.860]   If you're B2B, I mean, if you're B2C,
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:37.080]   then you can't serve others competing with you.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:38.100]   You pretty much have to be it.
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:42.300]   And it's a classic channel conflict.
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:43.340]   And that's the problem for adblock.
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:46.340]   And I'm not saying that they're illegitimate in their argument.
[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:47.960]   It does cost money to maintain the list.
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:48.820]   They need money for it.
[01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:49.820]   I'm not questioning all that.
[01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:51.220]   Because it's a free service.
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:53.580]   I mean, the plugin is free.
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:54.980]   But it's a conflict of interest.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:55.980]   Yeah, I think it is.
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:57.820]   That's the issue for them.
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:00.180]   And we should say this is adblock plus.
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:00.980]   We're talking about that.
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:02.820]   That's not the same thing as adblock.
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:04.660]   And it's adblockplus.org.
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:10.380]   And I don't use it, so I don't know
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:12.340]   which is what the best is or whatever.
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:16.580]   Hey, a little props to Twitter from the EFF.
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:20.020]   They say, Twitter shows the way forward with Do Not Track.
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:21.500]   Twitter will honor your browsers.
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:24.420]   Do not track setting by treating as a Do Not Collect signal.
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:26.580]   When Do Not Track is enabled in the browser,
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:28.780]   they will not collect your browsing information
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:30.740]   to show targeted ads on Twitter.
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:33.300]   That's a little disingenuous, too.
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:36.300]   Yeah, because they have this new way of targeting advertisements.
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:36.820]   Right.
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:37.320]   Right.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:41.040]   So as they put it in, what the heck?
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.840]   Well, I think this is the right thing to do.
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:45.440]   Look, if Twitter wants to monetize with targeted ads,
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.640]   that's fine.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:51.360]   And do make sure that you give people a way to opt out.
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:52.240]   And that's fine.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.480]   Google does that, sort of, right?
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:54.980]   Maybe--
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:55.960]   Well, yeah, you can use it in Cognito.
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:56.880]   You can use lots of it.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:59.320]   But again, there, if I ran a site--
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.560]   because my argument immediately--
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.560]   You block in Cognito's browsers.
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:05.760]   Well, no, I'm going to go a more positive way.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.480]   What I argue now to media people--
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:10.280]   I just did talks like this in Europe, where I say,
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.880]   damn it, you're not in the content business.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:12.760]   We've had this discussion, right?
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.000]   You're in the relationship business.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.200]   You're in the service business.
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.520]   And there's a service--
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:19.000]   Google understands who I am, so it can serve me
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.880]   with relevance, and thus greater value.
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:22.560]   And we in media don't know how to do that.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.240]   And, god, you've got to get past it.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.920]   You've got to learn how to know people as individuals
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:27.240]   and serve them relevance.
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:29.840]   Well, the only way you're going to do that
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:32.440]   is if you collect data on them.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:33.600]   Right.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.920]   And Google does that and gets value out of it
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.000]   because it knows where I am.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.520]   And media companies should do the same thing.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.720]   Well, now if you turn on to do not track--
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:44.800]   Setting.
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.760]   Religion.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.320]   Religion.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:48.200]   It's not a setting.
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:50.120]   It's a religion.
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:52.320]   In some cases, it is.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:58.080]   And then I think you threaten to greatly devalue
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:00.040]   where media ought to be going to get higher value
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.320]   to support the content you like.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.120]   Well, here's a question Steve gives it poses.
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.600]   Steve and I have this kind of debate as well.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.840]   He's very much adamantly--
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:10.920]   you know, he was mad at Firefox for changing the way--
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:13.560]   or was it Apache-- anyway, he was mad at somebody.
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:23.200]   Is it the case that ad companies say we need to be able to track,
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:27.680]   we need targeted ads, or we're just not going to raise the revenue.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.200]   We don't get the results we need.
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:30.200]   Is that the case?
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:33.360]   Do we actually need to target advertising?
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.600]   Yes, because otherwise it's noise.
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:38.000]   Otherwise it's extremely low value.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.080]   And then you're in a volume game.
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.680]   And the volume game is that there's no end of competitors.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:46.240]   Targeting means you're going to get better in theory--
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.520]   not in practice.
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:50.880]   But in theory means you're going to get more apropos, better ads,
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:52.760]   ads that are of great of interest to you.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.200]   Yes.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:56.600]   And I've never understood why that bothers people, but it does.
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.720]   Well, because-- and this is what I also say--
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:02.280]   because we messed it up royally in the media advertising
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.760]   technology businesses.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:06.480]   This strange thing called a cookie with a set of your machine,
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:07.480]   and people were tracking you.
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.880]   And we enabled the Wall Street Journal of the World
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:11.720]   to demonize this and make it sound all simple.
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.640]   It isn't creepy.
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:15.920]   It's just saying, look, we want to know what your preferences are.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:16.420]   Right.
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:18.920]   Well, by the way, and we don't use that, the way we do it
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:22.840]   is we sell ads.
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:24.320]   And then we do periodically-- in fact, we're
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.800]   about to do it-- a survey of our viewers have completely
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:27.300]   voluntary.
[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.240]   We say, hey, if you would like to, tell us something
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:32.680]   about yourself, and that information we can use with advertisers
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:34.240]   do want to know, well, who am I reaching?
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:35.640]   Am I reaching 12-year-old girls?
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:36.760]   I'm reaching 50-year-old men.
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:38.120]   What am I getting?
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:40.040]   So they do want to know that.
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:43.040]   And so we do this periodic survey every year or so.
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:46.280]   And we can then say, well, in general, this is who we reach.
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:46.560]   Right.
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.120]   So you do that as a sampling.
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:49.560]   If you do that on an individual level--
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.560]   Not as effective, probably.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.120]   Which is what Google know.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.800]   But this medium, you have to.
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:58.320]   What Google does here is, as Eric Schmidt said, activate
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:04.480]   in Big Tent in New Delhi, or New Delhi,
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:06.800]   this would be more valuable than the web in Google's hands
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:09.400]   because in mobile, we know who you are.
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:10.840]   We know something about you.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:13.040]   And that has a lot of power.
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.840]   And that's where both the content side and the advertising
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.840]   side should both be going, I think.
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.400]   I strongly believe that.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.680]   But if we demonize the cookie and demonize all this,
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:22.840]   then it causes a real problem.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:26.080]   What's happening now in the UK, and then start at the EU,
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:28.320]   is every site you go to in the EU, first time,
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:30.320]   you've got to constantly say, oh, yeah, it's OK.
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:30.800]   You've got cookies.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:31.800]   I know, I know, I know.
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:32.280]   Right.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.320]   And it just becomes an ear.
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:36.400]   I'm starting to see that a lot on sites here in the states, too.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:36.880]   All things--
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:39.440]   First time you visit allthingsd.com.
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:40.560]   Here's our tracking policy.
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:43.240]   Here's our cookie policy, just so you know.
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:45.680]   And actually, we've been debating whether to do that
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:48.720]   on our site, even though we don't use tracking cookies.
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.080]   We do have analytics.
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:52.160]   And so we've been debating whether to do that.
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.520]   And I think we probably are going to do that.
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:54.880]   Well, and here's the second half of this.
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:56.120]   It's annoying.
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:57.600]   This is a transaction that we go through.
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.840]   I think that the way that companies should--
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:01.480]   they should see Amazon as a model for this.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:03.160]   Because Amazon, you know what they're tracking.
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:03.880]   You know why they are.
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:05.040]   You know what they're giving these results.
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:07.520]   And they give you the opportunity to see it and to fix it.
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:09.560]   That should be the standard for all of this.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:12.200]   And every time I fix it on Amazon,
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:13.920]   I'm more valuable to Amazon.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.640]   That's a transaction I go through.
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:18.120]   If it's a transparent transaction in which I feel
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:20.160]   I have some control, I think that works.
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:21.200]   And that's why we ought to go.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:25.680]   Let's remember people, the transaction we do have no control over,
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:28.680]   is the NSA.
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:32.160]   And that's-- if you want to get creeped out about your privacy,
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:34.640]   if you want to get scared and screamed about your privacy,
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:38.480]   now is the time to scream bloody murder about it.
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:41.440]   Because your government is tracking everybody in the world.
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:45.560]   Although I'm going to make the opposite argument.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:47.920]   The NSA is doing that to protect us, advertising--
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:50.640]   or advertisers are doing it just to get money out of us.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:52.280]   They're trying to protect us, Jeff.
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:53.240]   The advertisers are doing it.
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.920]   Media properties are doing it to make money to support the media
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.040]   we get, eh?
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:59.440]   And the NSA is doing it to protect us from terrorism.
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.560]   Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:02.960]   Under the law.
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:04.640]   Under the law.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:09.120]   They-- yes, they can go after certain specifics.
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:13.200]   They can't listen to the entirety of net traffic.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.640]   That's just not right.
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:17.040]   And it's not the damned American way.
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:18.600]   It's the shtazi way.
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:19.920]   I kind of threw him a softball.
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:20.920]   You did it.
[01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:21.920]   I've been Leo so--
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:22.920]   What do I do?
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:23.920]   I had to play into it.
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:26.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.400]   It was-- the leggers, how you play cricket.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:30.320]   What's this thing-- I've heard people talk about
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:31.440]   called the Constitution.
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:32.040]   What is that?
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:33.440]   I don't understand that.
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:33.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:36.600]   Would you explain that to me?
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:39.760]   Twitter has banned auto-following and bulk-following
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.400]   in the new developer updates.
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:42.760]   Thank you, Twitter.
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:43.320]   That's a real--
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:44.160]   That's good for them, too.
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:44.880]   That's smart both ways.
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:45.960]   Smart in every way.
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:49.640]   It just makes it a better environment.
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:54.800]   So no more-- presumably, we're apps that actually did that.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.000]   They have turned on--
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:56.840]   Trans-- pardon me?
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:57.520]   Go ahead.
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:01.720]   I was going to say, there's apps that are late.
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.520]   Trying to follow a bunch of people.
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:04.020]   Rogats.
[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:04.760]   We put rogue apps.
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:08.080]   But then there are apps which seem good and nice.
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:10.480]   But what they'll do is when you sign up for them,
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:13.080]   in the background, have you automatically follow--
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:16.120]   so they say the apps Twitter handle by default
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:17.320]   without letting you know.
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:17.920]   That kind of thing.
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.960]   So Twitter has made it really clear that that's
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:21.760]   a reason to get banned.
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:23.920]   Twitter has also another great thing,
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:28.520]   enabled translation on tweets from high profile users in Egypt.
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:29.440]   So if you're English--
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:30.960]   I see a translation all the time now.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:32.920]   I'm so cool.
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:35.720]   Yeah, it is great because I get a lot of German tweets.
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:38.000]   They're using-- I don't know if they're using Google Translate,
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.320]   but they're using some sort of automated translation.
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.320]   I'm not a big translator.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:43.320]   I'm a big--
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.040]   Oh, wow.
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:44.840]   I'm not a Twitter user.
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:45.920]   So you guys have to explain this to me.
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.720]   So when you get the tweet in your feed--
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:50.600]   it shows up both the original language and the translated.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.320]   Or there's a Translate button.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.520]   There's also a Translate button though to translate the--
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:55.200]   Oh, interesting.
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:57.120]   Isn't that neat?
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:57.760]   That's part of the--
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:59.080]   Is there the more Translate button on anything
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.360]   that's not in your native language?
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:02.200]   On my--
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:02.200]   --is it the--
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:03.040]   --pretty much?
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:03.560]   Yeah.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.280]   Really?
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:05.000]   In what?
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000]   On the web page?
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000]   I'm using the Twitter app on--
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.520]   Or on the Twitter app, OK.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.520]   Well, that makes sense.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:16.480]   I don't follow non-English speakers typically, so I don't--
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:17.360]   Yeah, me neither.
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:20.040]   I realize that I have to vary the people who I follow,
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:20.640]   as I don't see--
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:22.880]   Well, I suppose that they should understand the German ones,
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:25.040]   but I-- but I cheat a lot.
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:26.720]   Do they-- do they get rid of the used to be?
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:28.560]   I guess there's no reason to have it.
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:29.400]   But it was fun.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.640]   The global button where you'd see everything?
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:33.440]   They don't have that anymore.
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.960]   Remember, you-- remember-- that's a long time ago.
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:39.040]   Back in 2007, there was a button on Twitter.
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:42.200]   You'd see everything everybody was posting.
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:43.440]   Don't have that anymore.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.440]   The firehouse.
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:45.680]   [HUMMING]
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:46.160]   Yeah.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:46.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:47.600]   I remember the firehouse.
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:48.200]   The firehouse.
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:50.000]   But then they got-- they-- they turned it--
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.520]   or they limited it, so they got rid of it.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.840]   Yeah, that's why I zapped.net.
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.240]   They still have a firehouse.
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:56.160]   It got to be like--
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:57.440]   Because there's nobody posting.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.360]   Do you have to--
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.080]   You don't use Twitter.
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:00.320]   Is that what you use?
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:00.800]   App.net.
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:01.640]   And it's your snarky app.net.
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:02.400]   I don't use Twitter.
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:03.400]   I mean, I post a Twitter.
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:03.920]   What about--
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:03.920]   What about--
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:04.440]   I don't follow Twitter.
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:05.440]   But do you use app.net?
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:07.120]   What do you use instead?
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:09.600]   Google+, I use Facebook sometimes
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:10.680]   to follow what my family's doing.
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:12.720]   But I don't follow people on Twitter.
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:14.360]   Right.
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:15.120]   And app-- yeah.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.080]   So anyway.
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.080]   OK.
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:17.640]   Moving on.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:18.080]   That's cool.
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:19.960]   I wish they would implement that in--
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:21.520]   why doesn't Google do this?
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:22.880]   They do on web pages.
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:24.600]   You'll see when you go on a web page all the time.
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:25.120]   Yeah.
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:28.080]   On Google+, I mean, they're the king of translate, right?
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:30.360]   Or I consider them a king of translation.
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:32.920]   I mean, that should be like a standard feature.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:34.920]   And you would think Facebook with a number of users
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:36.440]   would do that as well.
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:39.760]   Actually, Google+, did have a translate button on post.
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:41.520]   And I think they took it off.
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:43.080]   Oh.
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:43.800]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:47.160]   When we come back, tool tip number of the week.
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:51.000]   But first, a word from Shutterstock.com
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.680]   with over 26 million high quality stock photos,
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:57.480]   illustrations, vectors and video clips.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:59.000]   Shutterstock is the place you've got
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.360]   to keep in your back pocket whenever you need images.
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.760]   It's the place to go for royalty free images.
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.240]   And I tell you, you're going to love this
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:09.040]   because they have the best search engine ever.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:12.680]   You can not only search for objects like balloons.
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:14.920]   You could search for pink balloons.
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:18.120]   They even have a really cool color wheel.
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:20.640]   You can narrow it down by category.
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:22.680]   You can use the color wheel to say,
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:25.160]   I only want balloons of a certain color.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.880]   If you sign up for a free account,
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:27.680]   don't need a credit card.
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:28.800]   Just sign up for a free account.
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:30.240]   Then you can use their light box feature
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:32.080]   to take some of the search results
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:34.520]   and put them into a light box share with others.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:38.800]   Or just keep track for inspirational purposes.
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:40.520]   Whether it's for your website, a publication,
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:43.400]   an advertisement, a video or any other type of project,
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.160]   you will find the perfect image or video
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:48.760]   for your next creative project from 26 million high quality
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:51.040]   stock photos, illustrations, vectors and video clips.
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:53.520]   And 10,000 new images every single day.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.680]   So you're always going to find something new.
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:57.160]   I want you to try Shutterstock.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:59.560]   They have some interesting pricing plans.
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:02.320]   You can get images on demand.
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:03.840]   But you can also do, and this is what I do,
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:06.880]   the 25 image a day subscription, which is really great.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:11.120]   And right now you can take 30% off.
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:15.320]   Oh look, red for Valentine's Day.

[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:21.640]   TWIG in the number seven.

[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:25.240]   of that subscription, save a lot of money.

[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:48.640]   Gina Trapani, your tip of the week, my dear.
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:51.720]   Tip of the week, if you have not seen Facebook's graph search
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:54.640]   yet, you probably will this week.
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:57.480]   Facebook is rolling out to hundreds of millions of users
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:58.000]   this week.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.040]   Think of starting Monday, actually.
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.880]   If you haven't tried it now, graph search, it's pretty cool.
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:05.680]   You can do things like, say, show me
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:08.680]   all the restaurants in New York City that my friends like,
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:09.800]   or kind of a fun search.
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:13.680]   Photos of my friends before 1996.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:14.840]   That's a good one.
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:15.680]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:17.840]   There's a lot of really, actually cool searches
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:20.400]   you can do in the graph search, I have to say.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:21.640]   It's a pretty great function.
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:22.200]   So check it out.
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:25.560]   I know a lot of our listeners, watchers, viewers
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:27.080]   are not big Facebook users.
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.480]   But graph search is definitely-- if you're
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:32.200]   interested in search, graph search is definitely worth a try.
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:34.200]   Of course, you have to have a pretty good social graph set
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:36.640]   out there on Facebook in order to get anything good.
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:37.560]   But give it a try.
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:40.200]   Look at these are all photos of my friends before 1980.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.840]   This is so cool.
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:44.280]   That's very--
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:46.640]   I think you should just do a search of the graph search
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:47.120]   of the week.
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:48.480]   This is hysterical.
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:50.520]   Yeah, that's pretty great.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:52.400]   Oh my god, that's me.
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:53.600]   What is that I'm holding?
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:54.720]   Oh, never mind.
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:00.000]   That was 1974.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000]   So it was a different time.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:01.800]   That's right.
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:03.240]   Different era.
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:05.040]   Press many of your friends uploaded photos
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.400]   before Facebook existed.
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.880]   I have not of old friends.
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:14.160]   You got to understand my friends are old.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:17.240]   They just sit in their basement going through their old photos.
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.600]   Because all they have here is--
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:23.120]   Here we are when we were freshmen in college.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.080]   And you had to actually scan that too.
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:25.640]   Yeah.
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:26.920]   See that picture on the right?
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:29.080]   That's me and put the pipe.
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:30.080]   Wow.
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:33.920]   I was like, it took me-- I just ran the picture.
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:35.120]   Here, I had some demo.
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:35.600]   Look at that.
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:36.440]   Well, yeah.
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.960]   If you like guys with pipes, I guess.
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:42.280]   Like 18-year-olds pretending to be sophisticated.
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:43.400]   I'm completely out of the running,
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:44.640]   but there's nothing to do with you, Leo.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:45.720]   But very handsome.
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:46.960]   Can I tell you, you wouldn't want
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:50.320]   to have been our neighbor in those days.
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:51.720]   That's holy cow.
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:54.080]   We had a water balloon catapult.
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:56.320]   This guy here in the top hat made it
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.520]   with a surgical tubing that could
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:02.120]   fire from one end of the old campus to the others,
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:04.600]   about 300 yards.
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:04.960]   So--
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:05.960]   Oh, that's pretty cool.
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:07.160]   We'd put water balloons in it.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:07.840]   We'd be at one end.
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:10.720]   We'd fire them like 10 seconds later.
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.600]   It would land on somebody and they'd look around
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:15.480]   and they wouldn't realize, yeah, we're way to hell over here.
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:16.520]   It was great fun.
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:18.920]   You would not want to be our neighbors.
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:19.640]   I truly understand.
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:21.360]   How worse than the Google interns?
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.320]   The devastation.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:25.840]   How bad could it be there at Google all the time coding?
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:26.840]   Or they should be, right?
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.680]   Mm-hmm.
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:30.280]   Theory.
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:32.240]   Actually, would it-- no, it wasn't 300 yards.
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:34.480]   It was probably 150 yards.
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:35.480]   It was more than a football team.
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:36.440]   Water balloons are heavy.
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:38.840]   To get a good lift on a water balloon from a catapult,
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.680]   it's got to be a pretty powerful catapult.
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:41.840]   This guy was an engineer.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.200]   I tell you, double surgical tubing bucket.
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:48.640]   It took four people to shoot it because you have two people
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:50.360]   in front and two people to pull it back.
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:53.400]   And pull back like 15, 20 feet.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.600]   Was it like a more slingshot or a catapult?
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:59.000]   Well, it was a catapult.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:40:59.640]   Hybrid.
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:00.640]   OK.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:01.520]   And you'd fire it.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:03.240]   And that thing--
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:04.200]   anyway.
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.320]   If only they were streaming web video.
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:06.960]   Oh, man.
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:09.360]   We would have-- it'd have been amazing.
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:10.320]   Memory.
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:13.000]   Then there's that time we put the dry ice in the fire
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.160]   extinguisher.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:15.160]   Never mind.
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:17.920]   Another day.
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:21.080]   Your number of the week, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:26.040]   NDP Group says that in just eight months, Chromebooks
[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:31.040]   have snagged 20% to 25% of the under $300 market.
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.080]   Now, yes, straight line here.
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:34.400]   That's a shrinking market.
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:38.000]   PC shipments are predicted to go down 7.8% this year.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:38.880]   But still--
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:40.000]   That's interesting.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.280]   For something that people thought was just this crazy
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:44.240]   little thing, nobody's going to use it.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:45.560]   I was in a store in London.
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:47.520]   And I heard the Google Sales guy pitching the mobile.
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:49.520]   And I said, you mean, I don't have any software?
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.120]   I don't know if you do that.
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:52.880]   I think I've heard a lot of grandmas
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:55.440]   getting them from grandsons because nothing
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:57.560]   to install grandma.
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:59.080]   School shipments like crazy.
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.160]   So it's really pretty impressive that this odd thing nobody
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:03.400]   thought was--
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:08.000]   who wants a browser of the machine that it works?
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.840]   I wonder how many notebooks there are in the under $300
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.840]   laptop market, though.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:15.080]   Oh, fair numbers.
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:16.680]   I think because--
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:17.680]   Well, aren't there?
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:18.680]   There are two nine--
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:20.280]   The failure of netbooks, I guess two nine.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.520]   Yeah, you can get two nine--
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:23.280]   But they're under-powered.
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:24.360]   Pretty junky.
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:26.240]   If you press your budget, get a Chromebook.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.320]   I would agree with that.
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:30.040]   Maybe a tablet.
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:31.560]   Do you want to do a tool?
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:33.520]   I can do a tip if you want me to do a tip.
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.480]   Anything you want to do.
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:35.040]   Let's do a tip.
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:37.880]   So this is something I shared on Google+ not too long ago.
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:43.000]   And this is something that you definitely
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.480]   want to check, make sure that you're
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:45.480]   willing to do something like this.
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:47.680]   I usually bring up the routing things.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:49.360]   Root your phone and do something cool, right?
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:52.520]   So this is something-- this is Wi-Fi tethering
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:53.560]   on your Android phone.
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:55.920]   And it's supported by most--
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:57.040]   most phones, but not all.
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:58.800]   And you don't have to be root for this one.
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:02.400]   This is actually a feature of a program called ES File Explorer,
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:04.680]   a pretty popular file explorer that people have.
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:06.640]   And it's a little known feature, but you can actually go
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:09.960]   into your settings, which I'll do here.
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:11.800]   So this requires root?
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:12.800]   It does not require root.
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:13.840]   It does not require root.
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.440]   It sometimes works better with root,
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:17.360]   but it does not require root.
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:19.160]   You can go into ES File Explorer, go into Tools,
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:21.040]   go into Net Manager.
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.560]   And you'll see there that there is--
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.000]   it brings up your network settings.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.200]   It says Join a Network or Create a Hot Spot Network.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:29.440]   And this is the part that was new to me
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.560]   with their latest releases.
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:32.640]   This create a hot spot network, because a lot of times
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:34.000]   you can't do that on your phone.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.960]   So this is why I say, be careful with this.
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:37.800]   Make sure you're abiding by all of your agreements
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:39.880]   with your carriers and everything.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:43.600]   But I can actually exit my current network right now.
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:46.440]   And I can hit Create a Hot Spot Network.
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:50.480]   And now I have a hot spot Wi-Fi tethering network created
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:53.640]   that I can join my laptop to get worked on in the airport
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:55.880]   or for whatever reason.
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:57.360]   And it's a really nice little feature.
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:59.080]   And I was pleasantly surprised to see
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:00.480]   it actually work on my phone.
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:02.200]   I've had reports that it works on some phones.
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:03.560]   It doesn't work on other phones.
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:04.920]   Some phones you need to be rooted.
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:06.920]   Most of the time I've heard you do not need to be rooted.
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:09.440]   If it works on your phone, it works unrooted.
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:11.200]   So this is ES File Explorer.
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:11.800]   It's a tip.
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:14.680]   It's a little known feature in ES File Explorer.
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.160]   You can actually go in and name the network
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:17.760]   and create your own password if you want to.
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:22.720]   Or it will automatically assign an SSID for you
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:24.480]   and a random password.
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.000]   So--
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:25.840]   Aaron, can I ask a question?
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:26.920]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:29.040]   So I have an XS4.
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.800]   So it's a little more open.
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:32.920]   But I have FoxFi key.
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:35.200]   And I have something called Portable Wi-Fi Hot Spot
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:36.760]   and I'm PDA Net.
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:39.560]   And I am able to open a hot spot.
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:43.080]   What I'm paranoid about is that I have an AT&T
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:46.640]   unlimited account and that they'll send the NSA out for me.
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:49.080]   Right.
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:51.040]   And it matters with glass.
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:51.520]   Sure.
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:54.640]   How many of you-- does the phone company
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:56.920]   know when you're using a hot spot when you're
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:59.240]   covering it in a way like that?
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:01.080]   They do have ways to track it.
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:03.640]   And I think if you were a super huge user, at least
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:06.320]   from what I've read online and the people I've talked to,
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:09.040]   if you're on there all the time and you're watching
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:12.000]   Netflix from your laptop through your Wi-Fi tethered device
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.760]   that you aren't legally or you don't
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:16.800]   have a contract to use Wi-Fi tethered on,
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:18.120]   eventually they will catch you.
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:20.000]   And usually what they do is they turn it off.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.560]   They turn the spick it off.
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:22.360]   Or they charge you.
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:24.120]   Or they'll charge you on your bill.
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:26.760]   Or they'll kill your unlimited plan.
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:28.440]   I haven't heard of them like--
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.160]   or they'll kill your unlimited plan exactly.
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:31.560]   And what I haven't heard of them doing
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.600]   is shutting off service completely or anything like that.
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:35.120]   So that's why I say you use it on your own list.
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.200]   On the rare occasion when you need to do it in an emergency
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:38.840]   or you're demonstrating glass for something,
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:40.200]   or you're going to get you at hand, you think?
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.600]   That's what I use it for.
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:44.800]   That's exactly what I use it for, is when there's no other way
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:47.680]   to get online and I need to show something to somebody
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:50.520]   or I need to get that email sent, right?
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:53.520]   I go ahead and turn this on, get my email sent to whatever
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:54.400]   I need to do.
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.240]   And then I usually just go back and turn it off.
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.440]   That's going to depend on this.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:59.720]   I haven't heard of anyone having any problems with that.
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.760]   So like I said, use it at your own risk.
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:03.200]   Really, really simple tool.
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:04.320]   And if it works for you, great.
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:06.360]   If it doesn't, then there are other tools, like you said,
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:07.720]   Jeff, that you use.
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.800]   But that ES file explorer is a good thing to have anyway.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:10.880]   It's a good thing to have anyway.
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:12.040]   I like that.
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:14.120]   They just updated the interface for it,
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:15.960]   so it looks really, really nice.
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:18.840]   And lots of options, lots of settings.
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:20.480]   You can go in and if you do have root,
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:22.920]   it's a great utility to have because then you can go in
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:25.080]   and change the settings on your phone, browse things.
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:29.200]   It has a built-in ability to connect to network devices
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:32.200]   over FTP or SMB.
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:34.000]   So if you've got a network share and you want to connect
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.800]   to it to transfer files, it's a great way to do that.
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:39.120]   So a lot of really cool features.
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:42.360]   And that was one that just popped up recently.
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:46.960]   I have to go see a man about a phone or a tablet or something.
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:48.160]   Oh, that's right.
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:50.760]   And then you have to come home and email us about it.
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:51.840]   Privately, right?
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:52.360]   I would.
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:53.360]   Privately.
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:54.640]   It would be wrong.
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:55.400]   I don't know.
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:56.520]   No, it wouldn't be wrong.
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:57.400]   No, it wouldn't be wrong.
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:58.680]   OK, you're a journalism professor.
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:46:59.560]   I'm going to go to whatever--
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:00.320]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:01.320]   Whatever a journalist and publisher--
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:02.320]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:04.440]   --you're telling your colleagues so that we can plan
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:06.000]   for the next show.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000]   OK.
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:07.520]   Exactly.
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:08.020]   Exactly.
[01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:08.680]   Good.
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:11.520]   We have to do a lot of deep thinking about this--
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:13.040]   You know, a lot of deep thinking.
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:15.800]   Cara Swisher was so adamant that it's not a phone that I
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:17.320]   can only think, what else does Motorola make?
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:18.160]   They make the tablets.
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:18.660]   Right.
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:20.400]   It's got to be a tablet, right?
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:21.160]   I don't know.
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:22.760]   I got to prepare for all about Android Leo.
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:24.200]   I got to know.
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:25.200]   I don't know.
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.440]   I'll let you know.
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:30.960]   But you, at home, you're just going to have to wait till whenever.
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.600]   Hey, I do thank you so much for being here.
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:34.560]   And I thank you, Aaron Newcomb, for coming by.
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:35.440]   Really appreciate it.
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:36.280]   Thanks for having me.
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:37.120]   NetApp.
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:38.120]   Always fun.
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:39.120]   Always great, Aaron.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:40.960]   And thanks to NetApp for having me come there.
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:41.960]   Thank you, NetApp.
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:42.960]   What is NetApp?
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.520]   So NetApp does enterprise storage.
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:46.640]   Enterprise storage vendor.
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.080]   And they do a lot of really cool things.
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:50.760]   So if you work for a large enterprise,
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:52.640]   you need some storage, go check out NetApp.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:54.120]   Do some really great things.
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:55.240]   And they're very, very flexible.
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:58.280]   It's always one of the top places to work in every country
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:47:58.840]   where they're at.
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:00.920]   I think in the US right now, there are number six
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:02.320]   on the list of best places to work.
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:03.200]   And do you code?
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:04.240]   What do you do for them?
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:07.200]   I do marketing for specific solutions.
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:07.720]   OK.
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:09.720]   Ironically enough, Oracle solutions.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:11.360]   So that worked out pretty well.
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:13.280]   Well, yeah, you have to be technical to do marketing
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:13.880]   in these companies.
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:14.400]   Yes.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.840]   You cannot just be some guy saying, yeah,
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.800]   you really need this thing because it's great.
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:18.360]   Right.
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:19.040]   That doesn't work.
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:20.200]   That does not work.
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:23.200]   Thank you, Gina, for panning, smarterware.org.
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:27.800]   And of course, think up.com to dotext.com, Txt.
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:32.520]   And enter beta, alpha numeric.
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:33.160]   In beta.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:34.600]   In alpha beta.
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:36.040]   In beta.
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:38.600]   On 5x5.tv.
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:39.360]   Thank you very much.
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:39.960]   We showed today.
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:40.600]   Great to have you.
[01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:41.600]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:43.440]   I'm glad you made it.
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:44.680]   I'm delighted I made it.
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:45.160]   I was--
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:47.640]   What time zone do you think you're in right now?
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:50.280]   Oh, God knows.
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:51.840]   Well, go take a nap.
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:52.280]   I will.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:52.640]   All right.
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:53.120]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:53.880]   Have to have some wine.
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:55.800]   His book, of course, Public Parts

[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.640]   But everybody on this show spends a lot of time on Google
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:09.920]   Plus.
