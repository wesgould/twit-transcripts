[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.400]   I wanted to hear you next week will be the day after the election. You sure you don't want to be here
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   I am a hundred percent sure

[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.400]   decide cool
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.920]   It's just too much man. It's just too much. Oh, man
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.520]   This this stuff in California has been quite interesting. I still haven't parsed the ballot. It's complicated
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.760]   I will do so before Tuesday. I'll do so soon
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.280]   Anyway, great to have you a host of hands-on photography and the master of ceremonies in club

[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.800]   I'm sorry. Oh, like crap. Oh, it was bad. Here's the you didn't have covid. You just were you got the did you get the flu?
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:06.200]   Got the booster and then oh the booster right sick. Yeah, the booster made me sick and then the weekend came
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:13.040]   And then I got a cold. Oh, yeah, so my voice sounds weird now, you know, maybe you need to exercise some
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.520]   Biceps yeah, I'll be like lee one me
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:26.200]   I need to figure out what's going on these things something just oh jeez show off. Oh jeez showing us
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.760]   his massive guns
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.000]   That's Jeff Jarvis by the way over in the yeah
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.640]   Look at those are those biceps. What are those?
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:45.000]   Mitty steps Jeff is the Leonard Ta professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:54.880]   Graduate School of Journalism at the city University of New York now we got all of us all four of us
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.400]   Yeah, very exciting. I am here to report first of all I brought this mug
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.840]   Which is an old mug of him for a long time. It says Leo La Porte chief
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.200]   Twit I brought it as he well, okay, that's not the only thing wrong with it because on the other side
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   It also says world's best boss
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:22.520]   So so we're sorry is in question. Yeah, that's it would you fire over that but no, I know
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:30.040]   Said you have one week to fix this so I just want to point out this is an old mug and this is I
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.640]   It's on the mug. I can't take it off the good news is Elon did take off chief Twit office account yesterday
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.840]   So we can you know, but supposedly it is in the office directory. He's listed as chief Twit
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.440]   Well, I don't care what he calls himself in the office. That's fine God
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.640]   Yeah, just not public
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.120]   It's funny Paris Martino suggested that the hashtag not my chief Twit
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.760]   Elon is now Twitter complaint hotline operator
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.360]   But I figure he plans to change these on a regular basis. Yeah
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.880]   Seems like it's a theme
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.240]   We haven't talked to you Stacey about all of this effect. We haven't seen you since Elon
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.920]   Walked into the office carrying his sink
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:23.160]   This was only a last Thursday, right? No, yeah, right things so much has happened. Yeah
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.160]   Oh, wow, look at this. Oh
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.480]   This is archived president Trump. Okay. I thought maybe he he said he they're gonna
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.480]   Consider who to bring back. He has not I thought for many. Yes. I said a few weeks. Yeah
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.440]   Yeah, he said they're gonna take their time and figure out a process for that
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.280]   But they are recommending well because I followed Elon. I'm recommended to put his 45, which is interesting
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:53.960]   He also said just a lie. Yeah, he also said
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:01.040]   He did actually was interesting in public negotiation with Stephen King the horror novel author
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.920]   Who said I'm not paying 20 bucks for a blue check. So he said all right. How about eight and turn out that was the price
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.920]   So thank you Stephen for bringing the price down
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.640]   Still to it's your yeah, can I share on something yeah?
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:25.600]   Because there seems to be real confusion and I think it's legit about what is the product that Twitter offers is it?
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:32.120]   people who tweet things like the journalists and whatnot are we the
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.080]   creators of content and
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.040]   the advertisers are the consumers are we the
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.760]   consumers and
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.840]   Thus we should be paying because I think it's a really interesting like
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.320]   debate
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.400]   Should he pay us or should we pay him?
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.480]   Well feels like he should pay us because there is no Twitter if people don't tweet
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.600]   Exactly, but on the other hand he's never been they've never been able to make money with advertising
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:07.120]   It's and now it's gonna be worse. We're hearing not only did General Motors pause its advertising on Twitter to wait and see what happens
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.200]   but a major ad agency has just advised its
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:17.160]   clients some of the biggest in the world to hold off for a little bit. That's reasonable. That's pretty
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:23.520]   That's been me hint something for content creators to be able to monetize and be able to use the platform more
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:29.360]   Why sweet at some point? I mean, I'm sure he's spattered off a whole lot of things, but but why not you know
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.360]   He's talked about bringing back vine
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:39.120]   One of the reasons vine went away is because content creators wanted to be paid for their work at Twitter right in the back
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.120]   And they said no and they all left and ended up on TikTok
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:50.720]   Kind of end up on YouTube and then tiktok. Yeah, they're intervening stuff. Yeah, you're right
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.880]   Let's talk about about paid video services, right?
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.920]   Which is weird in fact one of the things you get if you pay eight dollars
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.120]   For the Twitter blue subscriptions ability upload longer form videos
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.360]   So he is I think the eight bucks is trying these trying to give you value for dollar
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.280]   He says if you don't pay eight bucks, I'm I'm a verified. I have a check mark
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:18.680]   If you don't pay eight bucks within three months your check mark will disappear. I am not I was paying two ninety nine
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.840]   I thought that was worthwhile to support Twitter blue
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.680]   At a lot of people told me I was nuts, but I'm not gonna pay dollars
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.800]   That seems like a little bit well the problem is the problem here is not is
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:37.200]   Verification sounds like just a badge instead of an actual verification in this scenario to me
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.880]   Oh, you're right. You just have to pay bucks and you got a check all right then. Yeah, like I don't even know how I got my check
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.560]   You know anybody can do that
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:51.040]   But a verification process should prove that you are who the heck you say you are and not just some robot that's
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.520]   That's a real spammer or a crazy marketer or propaganda
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.800]   Well, you could argue you could argue that it would help
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.920]   Somewhat with that because it puts a cost like remember how people are like well, you know
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.760]   Spam is so ubiquitous because it cost people a stamp to send stuff right or media mail, right?
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.120]   This could be a way if you want to create a bunch of bots you're gonna have to spend money to actually
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.440]   Put blue check marks by your box eight dollars a pretty darn cheap then
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.800]   Well
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:30.080]   But it's a devalues it the point the point of the check mark was to make twitter a more credible place by saying he verified
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.400]   This is the real Beyonce right story and all those people go away
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.440]   Then the blue check mark ends up becoming value less and then what are you selling it for?
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.960]   It is worth nothing the story was that tony larusa who was the manager of the oak lemnes
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.880]   Maybe then maybe he was already at the cardinals, but he's a baseball manager
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.680]   sued twitter some years ago
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.720]   over fake tony larusa accounts
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.400]   Twitter said yeah, sorry, but we're not gonna do anything and I think they would have probably won
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:07.840]   That lawsuit but coincidentally right at the same time as that lawsuit came up twitter added
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.440]   Verification check marks and gave tony larusa one
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:19.760]   Possibly you know to get around to all of that so it really was about if this is got a check mark
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.360]   We have verified
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:27.040]   That you are you who you say you are and you are a somewhat public figure. I guess did you apply for it stacey to get it
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:33.680]   I think maybe maybe I got it as part of giga ohm and giga ohm did something. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.760]   Like I just one day woke up and there was a blue check mark. I mean I am who I am but
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.400]   I don't know well and and of course in elon's tweet about this
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.440]   he he said uh
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.040]   something about
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.400]   peasants
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.440]   Yeah lords and peasants lords and yeah, twitter's current lord and peasant system
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.080]   For who has or doesn't have a blue check mark as bs power to the people
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:03.360]   Blue for eight dollars a month, but in fact what he's doing is exactly the opposite he's the opposite
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.880]   We didn't pay for that check. We proved we are who we said we are not lord people wasn't money are gonna pay that now
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.880]   It's the people willing to pay a hundred bucks a year
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.320]   Who will have a blue check mark regardless of their and who's gonna pay for that brand?
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.600]   Maybe
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.000]   Right russian bot farms for sure
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.880]   Yeah
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:30.560]   Well, maybe like the new york times will pay to verify their report. Oh, rans. Absolutely. Okay. Yeah, that's a way
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.480]   Somebody calculated the world would cost the parliament in the uk
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.440]   To do it because if you're a politician should be verified. So you know, you're actually talking to the politician not some
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.040]   um
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.160]   faker
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:42.960]   and
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.680]   It's all about it. It's just my father would say
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.640]   Maybe I mean, I'm trying to see how this would give legitimacy right because like
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.600]   You could have like a double verification system
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:59.360]   Like there's the the popper verification system for people who are like me who are truly people
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.920]   Then you have the paid verification system
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.480]   Although that does kind of destroy some of the legitimacy
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.040]   But if you're like a like a grifter like a traditional grifter
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.800]   You could just be like yeah, I'll take your money people who are pissed off about not having a check mark
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.120]   So maybe there's like a two-tiered system that could develop if he was smart he could take advantage of that
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.200]   He later clarified to say there will be as there are now subheads
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.160]   Saying public figure
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.640]   That's the one i've seen public figure
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.560]   Maybe newspaper
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.000]   So maybe he's the check mark as your reward for giving him eight bucks
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.640]   and then underneath it there is some sort of
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.320]   Thing that says he's grasping at straws
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.040]   He's grasping on the side of the cliff to figure out how to keep from drowning here
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:48.720]   Um, no, I'm sure we're gonna get to it, but but but neelipetel's piece was just
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.360]   chef kiss brilliant
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.160]   Taking in the mess that elon has gotten himself into and he can't win any way
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:03.200]   He's gonna piss off the advertisers by letting the crap in or he's gonna piss off the crappers like his new friend cap turd
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.800]   um
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   uh and then lose the advertisers
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   He's gonna piss off china
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.120]   And doing one thing he's gonna piss off america doing another thing
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.640]   He's he just can't he put himself in he can't win
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.600]   The article from the verges called welcome to hell elon you break it you buy it
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.920]   And yeah, everybody I retweeted everybody retweeted it because it was exactly
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.960]   the
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.680]   The encapsulated problem elon's gonna face for instance
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.960]   He's got a business in china a big one called tesla
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.880]   That needs the support of the chinese government to continue to operate
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:45.360]   What's he gonna do when his big money maker tesla is under threat from the chinese government unless he approves
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:51.520]   Chinese propaganda on twitter. He's got a very challenging situation to be in
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.000]   Um, is this like is this like jeff bezos buying the washington post
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.480]   No
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.720]   Because it isn't isn't you couldn't you have said the same thing about jeff bezos the china
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.880]   Well or wherever amazon business is important. Uh, those countries would have
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.440]   Undo influence on the washington post you don't think so
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:14.800]   No, because he he when when he did it he said i'm gonna be hands off i'm gonna have no influence here
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.520]   I'm i'm on the other side of the part of me chinese wall that we have in newsrooms
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:24.880]   And he's proven that to be the case same thing with um laurin pal jobs
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:31.440]   Who bought the atlantic steve jobs exactly who bought the atlantic exactly so there is in fact in this country a long history of
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.080]   Respirants very wealthy people
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.640]   Uh buying the press
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.560]   Yeah, they don't tend to tend to tend to Sheldon adison Sheldon adelson who
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.800]   Adelson no longer with us, but made all his money in mccow casinos
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.320]   Uh sold comdex made money and kept mccow casinos became one of the top gop donors
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.560]   Well, so he was the opposite he did influence the las vegas paper. Yeah
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.320]   Well, yes, that is true
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.840]   I think that uh, there's two there's two roles in their ideals
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.880]   there's two there's two
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.800]   You could say two motives maybe that for elan two different motives for you
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.600]   It may be he's a businessman a 44 billion his way overpaying right?
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.240]   We agree they paid way too much money. It's not worth that
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.080]   It's gonna be very the the interest alone on his loans is a billion dollars a year
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:23.360]   Charging eight bucks a month to 443 000 verified twitter users
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.120]   41 million dollars a year. It doesn't really go very far towards
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:33.040]   He's not let alone his interest let alone making money to pay back the 44 billion
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.560]   So maybe he's got other ideas that he can make back that money
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:42.160]   So I thought that was the whole story is he had this whole long game thought out with it not necessarily
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:48.960]   Well, this is the question. Is he a businessman who has some 5d chess plan to recoup his 44 billion difficult though
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.920]   That may be and that's what a neilite patelle's pointing out is you're you're between a rock and a heart
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.880]   Place there's no way to win or is he buying influence?
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:03.920]   Because i'm honest so here's my he's acting like he's buying influence. He's using his now new bully pulpit uh twitter
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.000]   To to say stuff just as president trump did some years ago
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.200]   Well, my cynical cynical view is that the only way that he's going to get dividends paid is via poutine g and trump
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.240]   That that this is about disrupting democracy
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:24.560]   And that he will get rewarded in other ways that we may never go about well and the other ways are power
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:32.400]   Power and money and money to tesla money look at jared kushner and what he's done exactly the souti investments
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.840]   Oh, by the way, he's going to build a hotel in moska the souti
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:43.360]   sovereign fund is one of the investors in twitter, it's the biggest and some cepheus is now looking at this the
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.280]   um
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.280]   the us governments
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:54.160]   Um, I don't know what you call it committee to investigate a foreign influence in foreign investments
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:00.160]   In the united states. It's an administrative. It's not part of a congress part of the department of the treasure treasury
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.040]   Uh, they're looking at it. They're saying well wait a minute
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:09.520]   What do you do now? So all right so what if they say that somebody should invest what do they do making on borrow more money?
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.600]   I don't I this little league isn't it?
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.520]   What so they can undo deals they can I mean
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:23.040]   Geez, how do you undo there is that's this is by the it's kind of interesting. So I thought oh you have to have regulatory approval
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   Right, but no you don't because it's an individual
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.600]   Not a company buying another company. It's individual buying it like you're buying an ice cream cone
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.720]   There's no regulatory approval even if you have 20 more ice cream comes at home. That's not a problem
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.960]   There should be some regulatory approval for me buying an ice cream
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:43.360]   But uh, so because it's a private individual buying it there isn't you know the ftc and the f
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.960]   CC and the fda none of these people get involved
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.640]   But
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.640]   Cfius could because of the foreign investment in this so that's interesting
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:19:00.480]   Uh, so there is some maybe there's some it's not regulatory approval that did deal went through he's sitting in the big jerry's there is a security
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.480]   world's best boss mug already
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:08.560]   So in the sink, uh, he is by the way, we didn't know but he is officially according to scc documents filed
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:13.680]   He is the ceo he's taken that role some speculation that he will let others
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.400]   Take over at he fired the board
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.360]   He has a star chamber though wall street journal says jason calicanis
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.160]   Is
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.280]   Is in the is in the room where it happens
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:33.120]   Along with the kvon bake pore who's a former twitter or he's back had a product
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:38.720]   Supposedly he has elan's ear and is actually way one's a very good
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.400]   Okay, well it's very small product and this is where if you're gonna make it if you're gonna make a case for elan
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.400]   This is what you say. Well elan's smart. He's gonna bring in the best people
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.200]   and they're gonna
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.480]   That's what i've been saying for the like the last two bucks everybody's been giving this mesh
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.040]   crap like jason calicanis
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.960]   I think i think i think your team three is falling apart right there aunt
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:08.000]   No, but i'm saying he i got a hunch that he's smart enough to put the right
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:14.720]   Pieces in place or people in place to make something happen if i saw that something was
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:20.560]   When he when he fired all of these former folks and from twitter and bringing in his own staff
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.000]   And i'm like that's pretty common when it comes to acquisitions
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   They usually clean house and say you know what we're gonna put our own people in place
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:35.040]   And we're gonna go to work get this thing done. Well, they don't they don't do it on the first day
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.680]   and they don't do it with the
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.120]   the vengeance the wrath that
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.760]   in three acquisitions and two of them were
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:52.960]   Surprising for me and one of those acquisitions. Yeah, the executives they were gone. It wasn't the first
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.960]   It was the second day they were gone
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.560]   Here's jason's tweet
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:05.360]   From a couple of days ago day zero lfg which i'm thinking is let's effing go. Yes, sir with a
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.000]   Kids talk it's kids talk. Yes, Jason was always a man of the people
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:17.760]   And there's the twitter mug so and he's half drunk the coffee already black. I might add so jason and i had an exchange on twitter
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:23.920]   Um, yo l roth who's a brilliant twitter safety guy who's really quite amazing and so far
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:30.640]   What's like musk is listening to him and as from you know prawny was saying so jason just had a tweet kind of just saying oh look
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.520]   What's happening with with safety and then he retweets wrath but it makes it look like to my mind he was taking credit for this
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:42.560]   Then jason came back to me and said no no no look how i said that he's doing wonderful work in another tweak
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:48.720]   Jason's new bio by the way, we know jason well he's been on many of our shows in fact he's hosted when i'm in on vacation
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.000]   Um, it's always been a love hate thing because he
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.520]   Well, anyway, he stole it. He stole my game and it's fine. No, he may have been the guy who said, you know, elon
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.520]   You could be the chief twit
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.080]   I
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.680]   Or i'll give him credit he could be the guy said elon maybe you shouldn't be the chief
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:12.080]   I don't know he could have but he is now on his twitter bio saying chief meme officer twitter
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.120]   I can't i'd buy that
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.040]   I don't know if he has an official role or not he remember in the uh discovery
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:24.640]   Which is probably the main reason he'll unbot twitter is because there was going to be more discovery in the trial and delaware
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.400]   In the discovery jason volunteered to be the new ceo of twitter
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.800]   He said to an in text to you to elon send me in send me in kosh
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:37.040]   And he had all these ideas and finally elon said this is embarrassing stop
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:45.600]   Well, then he also started selling he started trying to sell the debt without any authorization from yeah, elon and elon got mad and scolded in publicly
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.560]   Yeah
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.320]   Uh, so also in the room where it happens
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.120]   Uh, david sacks
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.880]   The founding chief operating officer and product leader at paypal which of course
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.840]   Musk was one of the paypal mafia so his sacks
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.840]   So he's maybe he has already bring I mean the fact he brought cave on back
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.560]   fired 45
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.640]   Uh tesla people they say well now this is by the way. This is really
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.440]   If I were a tesla shareholder, I might not be thrilled
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:19.840]   Exactly these these tesla engineers who really are kind of on a deadline with full self-driving
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.600]   Uh
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.640]   Are being called in to review they say product code
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.360]   By the twitter engineers
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.040]   Pritam
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.200]   I think they backed down on that. Yeah, they did
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.320]   You know, there's there's a lot of rumors flying and
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:40.160]   You know one rumor was well, they're going to have people print out code so they can look at how thick the stack is because what they really
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.760]   Want to do is fire
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.880]   Uh for cause before november first
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:49.280]   So that these guys don't get their stock vests. Well, they didn't that didn't happen. So I think there's a lot of
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.840]   is a lot of
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:56.320]   Misinformation flying around so I he's trying stuff. Let's let's try let's give him. Let's give him
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.800]   Anybody who's getting off twitter
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:04.960]   No, no and if I was I can't sit here and say I'm going to announce it to everybody
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.800]   That's the most annoying thing is well. That was that great meme you sent out aunt
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.280]   Yeah, she tweeted
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.080]   Uh aunt put out a meme that said what what was it?
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:14.960]   Um
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.440]   I believe you twitter if i'm coming to on twitter to tell you i believe me to let i'm staying on twitter to see what the reaction is to me
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.800]   Yeah, right. It was great. Here it is
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:29.040]   Yeah
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.840]   Uh, I did cancel my subscription for the twitter blue
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.520]   No, i'm keeping that
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:41.440]   That's totally that's totally hails work except as you have a story in the rundown on on on the upper part
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.000]   That they're cutting
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.440]   payments
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:50.640]   To publishers part of the point of twitter blue the ad-free part of twitter blue was you go to washington post
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:56.400]   You see stories without ads and twitter would share revenue for that user with washington post and now they're saying well
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.280]   We're not gonna give you ad free anymore. Well, that means i'm guessing that they're not gonna share revenue publishers anymore
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:06.080]   So I think this is harvest. I still never saw that behavior when I was this a blue subscriber
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.200]   I still would see like something from la times or new york times of what it was only certain papers
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.000]   Yeah, it was a certain I thought it was within
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.480]   If you go, i'm still a twitter blue guy until my subscription runs out and by the way
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.880]   I think because I canceled the threw apple I could reinstate it before the end of the end times
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.600]   Yeah, nice guy. I was the 299 guy. You know, we got in at the beginning. So maybe I should
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:34.480]   Um, but a occasion used to be occasionally on this right hand side of the top articles you'd see a little uh
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.960]   a little thing that said
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.200]   Read article free
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.200]   For twitter
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.200]   I'll go back to the washington post one and see
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.280]   Any one of those one post one this is gone
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:51.040]   They've stopped doing that so they stopped doing that right which means that they're probably stopping to share revenue with
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.040]   The washington post at the same time. He's talking about how we can share stuff
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.080]   I gotta ask you to play this this video of him online
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.240]   54
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.240]   Of elon discussing
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.040]   He's discovering as if no one has thought of this before
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.120]   Micro payments. That's it. Eureka. I have it
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.720]   Well, he did uh
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.720]   Work at paypal so he probably
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:19.120]   Does know a little bit about it knows it it's been around for a lot longer than the twitter
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.080]   So let me
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:22.560]   This is a digital power
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.680]   I want to maximize this virus and kind of like whatever
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:31.280]   What is this uh round table? This is in a tesla factory. This is the tesla owner's
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.360]   Roundtable
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.600]   Yeah, somebody just put this up. I have no idea, but it's his tesla owner silicon valley the kilowatts
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:43.440]   Let's play this I understand that all these publications want to maximize the subscribers and kind of like own their customer and stuff
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:49.600]   But there's there's a huge number of people who are never going to subscribe to that publication
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:54.080]   Like let's say, you know, not picking up the Philadelphia choir, but let's say uh, you don't love it
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.280]   I'm here so most of the time you don't want to read the articles
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:03.680]   But every night again, they've got like some reporter on the scene at some news event and you and and they they're actually the smallest article
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.640]   Everyone else is just copying them and printing their stuff and so you want to
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:13.520]   So you want to just like read the Philadelphia or her article and but you but you're not there's no chance you would become a subscriber
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.520]   So they're not losing a subscriber
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:20.240]   But but they are annoying everyone who's not going to be a subscriber. So there's got to be some way to solve that
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.920]   Answer the corner. Yeah, because I've really liked the twitter. I'll put a couple of those
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.200]   Ten cents for this article or something. Exactly. One knows why
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.720]   Why does every time I hear Elon talking it sounds like it's a podcast
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.160]   Well, that's that's a self-hating podcaster right there. It's just it's just hot air
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:44.240]   What if I don't know what if the aliens came down and we charged him a dollar 50 each
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:51.040]   Um he one second later. He says well, how about one dogecoin to read an article in love those
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:57.760]   That was the perfect. Yeah, by the way dogecoin when he took over twitter sword as if somehow there's some magical connection
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.160]   Maybe they thought he'd be pumping it up again
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:05.120]   I don't know. I you know, uh, I think we're all saying well, we'll stay on it and we'll see what happens
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:10.080]   Yeah, I'm I'm gonna stay around and unless I'm I'm giving a reason to leave
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.200]   But right now if I were to open go where would I go?
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.480]   Um, everybody says mastodon or or
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.840]   I'm sorry. I'm really struggle with that open source
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.840]   and I'm always on mast like
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:30.000]   I am right there. I do there Stacy. I doubled the mastodon memberships pick twit.social. That's a good one
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.560]   I've heard of this twit guy
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.880]   I get a lot of
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:42.480]   Notifications in in my inbox of people following me on on our twit that social and missile report and I'm like
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:49.760]   I'm never there. I it's well if you were there so my community has been on twitter and
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:55.680]   Right now it's still fine for my community to still hang out on twitter. Yeah, but you're you're doing plan b
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.400]   You know what's happening?
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.640]   I'm meeting lots of new people on mastodon and for me
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.280]   It's a lot of professors
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:11.520]   I mean you're gonna see the same people but but there's there's lots of historians and others and so it's it's it's a new raft of people
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.320]   I'm enjoying there. Uh-huh. Okay, but it
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.560]   Maybe at some point I go to let me go to my um
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.280]   twit.social
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.880]   administrator board here on here my administrator board and I have
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.880]   Every day there's been about a hundred new members. I've got 27 new members
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:33.360]   Wanting to join I approve them to keep the spammers out big fan of security
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.200]   I'm gonna check them all and I'll uncheck any that sound like spam big fan of security now
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.120]   I've been following twit since the beginning love twit
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:46.880]   It's fine. Uh longtime listener severed twit podcast big fan of leo and twit we're an it company. Okay. We're
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:53.120]   So every once in a while I run across this we're an it company looking for new abbers who accessing new customers and social
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:59.120]   If they don't mention twit, I generally uncheck them. I need a new home away from musky melons twi
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:04.800]   Because chief twit joined mastodon. I'm a longtime twit listener eelon musk acquired twitter. I regularly listen to twig
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.200]   so um
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.840]   All of these I will approve except for the ones where it's obvious. You want to get on to spam
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.080]   Can we have a moment of dumb jeff question corner? Yeah
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:23.120]   So I and I you be able to leo about this actually uh after our great conversation last week with with
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.480]   Ravel um I ended up finally joining
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:32.640]   Mastodon because I just followed somebody's link and I went oh, okay. I've been messed up now that I realized oh hell right leo has a server
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:37.680]   And so then I did that too. So I ended up with two names a it's okay
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.800]   Well, I got a question. I got a question
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:46.400]   No, it's gonna turn into the google sweets that the g sweet thing. Yes. It is here it comes
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.000]   No, no, it's not no google
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.520]   It's gonna turn into leo abusing me somehow, but not google abusing me in this case
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.880]   um
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:59.920]   So let's say I let's say I just transferred my account over to to twitter social
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:07.600]   Would my experience be any different what I see more people there or it just depends on the individuals across anywhere in the fediverse
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.320]   Follow me. It doesn't matter where I am. So this is what confuses people about mastodon
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.640]   Why I'm asking one of the challenges of explain this it's not monolithic like
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.200]   twitter there are many many servers
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:25.840]   You can join any of them. It doesn't matter if you join mine or somebody else's it and numbers of people have multiple servers
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.920]   I think a public figure like you jeff probably should have one named jeff javis
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.160]   So that people want to follow jeff javis. That's the one they follow
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.080]   You can maybe rename the other ones to you know my fun account or whatever
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:45.120]   Uh, but it doesn't matter where you are because well here look at this. This is this is our twit.social interface
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.640]   There's several, but this is the one I use which is kind of like tweet deck
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:56.240]   And I'm looking at over here on the right the federated timeline. These are all the different servers all of them
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.920]   And people posting to all of them if you see somebody
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:03.040]   You're interested in
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.760]   You just click their name and you click follow now. They're not on my server
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.320]   Right meow meow's on our own server
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.120]   How do I get that feed?
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.520]   You don't have that's well first of all that's there. So if you go in the third column
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.840]   There's a local timeline. This is everything that happens on the twit.social server
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:27.120]   But there's a federated timeline which is everything that happens in the entire fetaverse
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:31.120]   And then if you find somebody you like or you search for somebody and find them
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.960]   Then you follow them and it doesn't matter where they are
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.720]   Right
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:41.200]   Because you're following them will then show up in the home feed. This is like your twitter
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.720]   The home feed is only the people I follow those are the people you follow
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.960]   Notifications if I if I belong to twit.social
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.600]   My home feed isn't any different than if I belong to master. That's exactly right
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:33:01.120]   Okay, how do I get that so I I'm just using the master don't client right now master don't not social right now on the web and my phone
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.160]   How do I get that fetaverse feed is that in there? Yeah?
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:10.320]   Oh, okay. So it's over here. There's a cup of air wasted. Yeah. There's a cup of ways to get it. That's what this globe is
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.520]   Is the Fed and this is everything it tells me there's nothing here rate something
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:22.800]   Or follow users. No, then you're not in this you need to be in the federated timeline and for instance
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.480]   Galia who's a regular in our club twit. She's on twit
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.760]   So I'm gonna follow her and now she'll show up in the home feed
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.280]   But I would also see here in several other places in the local timeline
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:40.000]   Uh, if you're on to there's why there's there's me. There's an so let me follow a aunt. Oh, I've already followed an
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.000]   um
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   so
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.040]   You can cobble together
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:53.760]   This is something similar to twitter, but I have to say not everybody is on matt very no very small fraction of the
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:34:01.120]   Total universe of that's on twitter is unmasted on how many followers do you have no one on master? Oh probably several hundred. I don't know
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.760]   Let's see that's where I am now. I'm several. Yeah. I have
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:11.680]   3,300 followers. That's considerable. Well, but I've been here a while 358 following a 469 post
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.240]   um
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.560]   The the other thing is there's a cultural difference
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:22.720]   And I notice a lot of the people come over from twitter treat it like twitter. It isn't twitter
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:28.240]   So for instance one of the things that's an every time you post on masonon
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:33.280]   Uh, this is the interface that the posting is over here in the left column notice. There's
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:40.880]   Something that says cw that's add a content warning. It is believe it or not. Okay. It is considered
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.440]   polite
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.760]   If you have direct eye contact in your photo, obviously if it's got nudity
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:54.400]   If it's any kind of triggering post you just say what the warning is and it could be direct eye contact
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:35:03.600]   And and then it will be hidden to everybody unless they click on it and it's just this is why it's masted on is a little different than twitter
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.120]   It's also, I think a little gentler than twitter the notion of protecting somebody's
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:16.080]   Content, uh, you know from being a stuff that they don't want to see is fantastic. I think
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:21.120]   Uh, you could choose your language and you can in your settings decide what languages you want to see
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:30.000]   Instead of 280 characters you get 500 characters. You don't have to pay $8. You don't have to pay anything to add video of any length or uh, uh,
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:35.040]   Pictures but it's different and I guess different the biggest difference
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:38.960]   There's this cultural difference, but the biggest difference is it's not it's just not twitter
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.600]   But here's the interesting thing
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.880]   It's not the only thing that's not twitter. There's lots of other
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.240]   Not twitter is out there that attempts to do something different
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.520]   And now all of a sudden more and more are popping up
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:56.080]   So I think I don't think there's gonna be an exodus. I don't unless
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.840]   You know
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.480]   There's some things that we have to turn the board with positive exodus
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.800]   Yeah, he could I mean honestly
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.840]   uh
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:09.280]   The first thing that happened when he long took over is a handful of accounts started tweeting the n-word and
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.440]   Anti-Semitic stuff and those people were quickly booted off
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:19.680]   Thanks to you all thanks to your old Roth. Yep. Uh, and uh, but they were testing the waters, right?
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.320]   If at some point elan does change the moderation
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:28.400]   It could become a hell they don't have the resources to do it, which is the other other problem. Yeah, it could become a hellscape
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.720]   And and and Stacy you missed an unusual show last week
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.200]   Uh, which I loved we have a router watch to rerun trust me
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.840]   Little chain first
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.840]   Hey, thank you, and thank you
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.280]   Um, I did not because I'm not as nice as aunt
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.840]   Hey, but you're a little bit too honest perhaps
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.240]   Yeah
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:57.360]   That that's part of being not as nice as aunt. I'm really honest. You could just not not say
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.360]   any
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.600]   What if there was going to be a quiz there's no quiz. I promise I promise
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.400]   Um, but but but to you to leo's point there are other things being built
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:15.120]   So the scuttle butt protocol that rabbles building planetary on is really interesting and it's pure to peer not
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.880]   Federated and it has all kinds of other possibilities that come up when you don't have internet access and then blue sky
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.800]   I keep yam reen about
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.800]   my my one
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:33.520]   Hopeful scenario for twitter is that the reason jack is being so nice is he convinces elon to sign on to blue sky open up twitter
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:38.160]   To blue sky and then then lots of new flowers can bloom
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:44.960]   Including the services that can give you and you could you could choose to get esp ends view of the social world
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:49.360]   And you get the sports stuff, right and I get the wonky
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.560]   history view of the world and stacey gets
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.920]   um
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:38:00.000]   Regulation and chips and other things and maybe she starts a business saying i'm going to give you the stacey wonky view
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.360]   Of social life. I'm going to find the good people. I'm going to find the good stuff
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:10.640]   I'm going to kill, you know the bad stuff and and new businesses can pop up vaults for your own data
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.680]   And choosing where to go a lot of things could grow
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.440]   in
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:20.960]   A protocol based world. It's speculative as hell. We don't know if it's going to happen or not
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:26.800]   But people are trying and i'm excited about that. I uh, I asked for an invite to blue sky as soon as I get in there
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.200]   I will this is another one. It's called co-host
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:34.640]   Uh, which is very twitter like uh has a paid version and a free version
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:39.440]   Um, I you know, I think there's going to be quite a few this is co-host.org
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.080]   I think something that would be important to look for that is provided for instance by scuttle, but
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:49.840]   Is portability the ability to take your account? Yes and move it to another server mastodon has that
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.880]   In the account settings, you'll see there's a move to a different account
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.960]   But it doesn't think you have to go to the account
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.960]   You're going to go to first and say move it from here and then you go to the account you're moving
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:05.920]   I saw something and move it too. No, you can do either. There's move to if you wish. Yeah, and then there's move from
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.920]   So go check, aren't you?
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:13.680]   Okay, and then leo what if you decide as you tend to do with things like facebook and twitter
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:19.360]   I'm off this mastodon thing. I'm going to turn off my server. What happens to the people who are on it?
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:26.800]   You screwed. You're yeah, uh, this has kind of been a problem. Um, mass it one of the mastodon instances a big one
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.200]   um
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.320]   A tech instance maybe tech dot mastodon shut down
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.960]   They've announced it. They said move now
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.880]   We'll be you know or keep it up for and I would do the same thing keep it up for a month or whatever
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:42.640]   The nice thing about this. This is a hosted service that provides mastodon
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:47.840]   Normally people pay for it. Uh, I've got it for free. They were very kind and they said no
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.240]   We'd be glad to host this for you. So it's cost me nothing
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:55.600]   There's no reason even if I wandered off there's no reason why this wouldn't uh continue to run
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.800]   So I you know, I just don't
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:04.240]   I don't think this is necessarily the only answer. I'll tell you what I tried to use planetary. I don't understand it at all
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.360]   Yeah, yeah, well, we need to get a help
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.320]   I mean I have about mastodon um
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.720]   Just talking to the quote-unquote normal people in my twitter feed
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.720]   They all look at me sort of sideways like what the heck am I supposed to do in here?
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:23.760]   Um, and how do I get other people I know to show up over you are you on their end?
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.800]   Oh, and I follow you on mastodon
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:33.120]   Yeah, I've been a part of twit that social from for a long time. I just don't I want to I search for I'm not finding you
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.120]   But I search for you. I don't get you
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.760]   Interest here. Let me try it. I'm over
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:42.000]   In the search thing a and t there you are there you are. What would be sure?
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:46.560]   PR you I know I got no there's an aunt prune on mastodon. There is
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:52.080]   Well, that's probably him. No, he's on twitch social. I don't know what you're using Jeff
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:57.040]   I'm using mastodon. Uh social. Oh, you're a mastodon that social yeah
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:02.640]   Ants on twit that social but I should be mastered. That's the whole point. Are you unmasted on that social?
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.440]   me aunt
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:11.040]   Oh, no, no, no, no, you're just on twit that social just quit that social I search and the only improved I get
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:14.800]   Is at at our and pruit at mastodon. Social
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.000]   Zero posts one following
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.120]   Join 2018. So there's another way you can do this which is maybe it is me hold on
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:30.560]   Here's another way if you know what his handle is you go to it dot social slash at
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.520]   aunt underscore pruit
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:39.840]   Well, it's an underscore. Yeah. Well, let's on all this don't that will give you this and if in a you're not
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.240]   They'll be a follow
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:48.640]   And Stacy sounds all fascinated with this right now. Well, you know, I know but I understand this is problematic
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.400]   I'm interested. This is probably no. No, no. I'm just I'm just saying twitter. I found you aunt
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:57.280]   You're there. I can I can I can moral pedicue good. I'm not following you
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:02.800]   I mean, I really like mastodon because it tends to be somewhat more geeky
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.080]   Um, but by the way, there are mastodon instances
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.720]   For all kinds of people. There's a sex workers mastodon instance. There's
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.840]   a store there's all sorts of stuff so
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:21.440]   That's the other side of this is you can have a local experience that's like discord or something. That's very local and specifically yours
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.240]   Um, that's not tense. There's something yeah
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.760]   Funny about me. So I I used mastodon for the first two days
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:33.120]   And I was I like aunt and first more I looked at it. I said I can't do this. It's too. Do right
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.000]   But then I started getting used to it, but I kept on it was so subtle
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.080]   This is just light light little purple
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:44.160]   To add someone to follow them or unfollow them and I was unfollowing people
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.800]   I had just followed because I didn't it was too it was too subtle for me
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:52.000]   You know what I did that changed everything that made me happier that made me work better on it
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.160]   Can you take one guess what I managed to do?
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:43:01.520]   Dark mode. Yes. I went to light mode and it made honest to god. It made everything better
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:08.560]   It really is something about my brain. It's honest to god. It's not just a joke. I can't do dark mode
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:15.360]   You said something earlier mr. Jarvis about being on this platform and meeting new people and
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:19.840]   I think it was pretty sure why I said I may just be jaded
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.280]   Um because I have I find myself not necessarily
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.720]   actively looking for new people online to meet
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.280]   um, you know, maybe
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:37.120]   Finding new content creators. Yeah, but far it's just meeting for general conversation. I can't say that I'm actively looking
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:40.880]   So I don't spend a lot of time here on twit.social
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.560]   But I do spend a lot of time on twit.community
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.040]   Because those are the people that are here
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:51.280]   That we are people from twit.social want to follow me. I follow them immediately
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:56.880]   By the way that I'm gonna like that community is our forums. That's the forums that discourse, right?
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:03.280]   Yeah, discourse, right, but I'm saying that that yes the twit connection matters, but I but I'm just reading so here's
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.840]   histodons
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:11.920]   Historians here, right? No, and I'm woman named Dr. Michelle Lynn Khan comes in and tells me all the things that she's interested in
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.320]   And I'm interested in the same things that I never knew her before
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:20.480]   I wonder if it's just a question of a critical mass and that yeah, I think it's true that he's trying to get out of it
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:25.200]   Yeah, what you want and who's on there and it's like any social network. I mean you have
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.200]   Will you come on with us?
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:31.120]   Sure, I guess no, you don't have to
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:38.160]   So there's no drag me on social media. There's no peer pressure
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:45.920]   It's own drag me kicking and screaming onto twitter and now I I use it and I'm just I'm very anti-social
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.400]   Yeah, I'm not
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.320]   I am really bad at being social
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.760]   I'm right there with you
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.760]   I think I I do a lot more auto posting
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:04.400]   Here here nowadays more so than just out there
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.440]   Putting things out there myself
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:12.560]   It just feels weird now. I don't know. I guess I think I just become more jaded in the last
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:18.480]   Several months after watching the world start to burn up around me
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.200]   You know and then it's 70 degrees in November what
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.400]   I should also point out that
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:34.480]   Mastinon itself isn't a thing. It's a client of something called activity pub
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:40.400]   Which is the equivalent of scuttlebutt master don is like planetary
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:48.800]   It is a client of activity pub and there are pleroma plerom a is another activity pub
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:55.600]   Interface pleroma does it is it federated with mastodon or is it separate? Yes?
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.960]   Uh, it also is federated with something called pixel fed
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:04.560]   Which is an instagram that is on activity pub that confederate like that and
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:12.320]   This is not a ticket. This is exactly what instagram used to be very. Yeah, you might really like that. Yeah, I fall
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:18.640]   Pixel fed.org. I'm actually on it. Let me let me log in here. It's um
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:26.880]   So I kind of like this idea of a feta verse a little bit, you know the idea that you could have a variety of different interfaces
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:33.840]   Um and and nobody can own it all. That's the really really good thing. Yeah
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:42.080]   Yeah, that's true. I mean I would join it just for like it feels like a more ethical place to be if that sounds that sounds so
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:46.720]   Fancy though like oh, I have my social eyes on ethical social networks
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:54.560]   Well at the same time, but that's a huge value. That's what open is open is ethical. Yeah, that's what open means open
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:58.000]   Well, that's not what's supposed to yes open source
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.680]   Is not it can be misused your rights, Daisy
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.080]   But it but to be open is more of an opportunity to be ethical were you?
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:12.480]   Yes, but also openness can be used as a shield slash bludgeon to
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:18.480]   Harris people. Yeah, but okay. Is it though?
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.120]   Sure
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.640]   Um
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:28.480]   Who was the who was the bad master minus does it all bludgeon people truth truth social is built on master dawn?
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.120]   Right
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:35.280]   Yeah, but it's not a federated instance. They stole the code and run a step
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:42.160]   A siloed but gab is unmasted on that is a right wing. Right. Right. Right. So yeah, it's open open means anybody can use it
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:47.680]   So bad people can use it too. Yes. Yeah. No, I'm not talking about who's using it. I'm talking about the ethos of open
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:51.280]   Which is not proprietary not owned by a company
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:56.640]   Created by users for users. Yes users can be bad people
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:03.760]   But open is ethical in my opinion. It's in the nature of it. Were you stacey were you here when maulin wick was on?
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.360]   I can't remember
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:09.840]   No, no, but I mean I talked to matt before and that was his big thing
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:18.960]   Right, I think so in a capitalistic society, so I think openness when we talk about ways of making money when we talk about
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:22.960]   Sometimes somewhat content creation. I mean they're they're
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:27.920]   Like as a content creator. I do get worried about too much openness
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:35.040]   And you know the ability to take my stuff and put it everywhere. I mean that's a downside of the web in some ways
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.760]   um
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:44.720]   Open is not just a primary good. It like you can't I mean that can be a modality that you think is important
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.160]   But I would not say that openness is inherently
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.320]   ethical
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.960]   just because openness can lead to
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:59.200]   Abuse just like anything else. I guess well humans can't screw anything
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.200]   Well, yeah, yeah, I mean
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:08.560]   Stacey's right. I'm not I'm not against openness, but you can also say I'm gonna open up the code for a nuclear bomb
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:11.200]   and you know
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:15.360]   Yeah, but I think that is okay. Okay. There's a good example, right
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:23.840]   On this okay, which is more ethical a closed source nuclear bomb recipe or an open source nuclear bomb recipe
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.400]   At least one's more democratic
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:32.480]   Question so that's so nothing is perfectly ethical
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:40.320]   But on the scale of ethicality open is more on the ethical side than anything closed in my opinion
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:44.400]   Scans look
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.560]   I'm struggling. I mean
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:50.240]   No, I'm just gonna say
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:55.440]   And by which I mean closed source. I mean proprietary that is
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.320]   Ethically superior to it's equivalent
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:05.600]   Was ill the schematics for a nuclear power plant. I mean there are certain health and safety things. I would even say
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:09.680]   if you had a happy medium like
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.520]   a
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:14.720]   Group of people to monitor things like medical
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:21.440]   Devices like I want them medicals about always be open hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Let me finish. Let me finish
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.960]   I think that medical hold on
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.880]   Oh, fair
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:32.320]   Medics and devices fall in the middle area like I would love for it to be open from like a security perspective
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:36.800]   I want that code not like totally governed by one profit seeking entity
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:42.400]   But I do think that it's bad news to have the diagrams for
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:47.600]   Maybe certain drugs that could be then manufactured poorly for example
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.440]   Like I think it's not one or the other there are areas where you're gonna need to set
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.760]   Here's here's my grade regulatory committees. Here's my argument to that
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:01.040]   Drugs can be manufactured poorly in secret or in the open right?
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.920]   True, which would you prefer?
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:09.200]   Well once they're out in the world you could test them and say oh shoot
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.840]   No, but you can't this is a poorly manufactured drug if it's open
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:15.440]   You can see it if it's done in secret you can't
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:19.680]   So I would submit as long as you're comparing apples to apples nuclear
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.160]   annihilation open versus closed then almost every case
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.960]   Open is preferable for
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:33.040]   Society for ethics for security in every other thing because you can examine it
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.800]   Will there could there be a poorly made generic? Yes?
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.120]   Absolutely
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.320]   But if you would know we don't want to have out into the world
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:46.320]   like the easiest way like actually
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:52.160]   Think about like manufacturing sarin or some sort of highly toxic. That's the sort of thing
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.160]   I wouldn't want to be open well
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.280]   I think there shouldn't be open posing guests a manufacturer
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.440]   Well, I mean that's kind of a bomb thing
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:05.840]   But if we go back to medical devices if you start looking at ways to hack something like a medical device
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:13.440]   Having some of that opens always better. No, this is provably the case open source software is
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:16.240]   Invariably more
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.280]   Software here and I'm not going to argue with you on software
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.960]   But I'm talking about open source manufacturing of things
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:28.480]   I'm talking about like software. I'm talking about hardware boards and designs and I'm talking about processes
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:33.280]   That's I think in every case when you keep it secret and proprietary
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.000]   There is no oversight
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.440]   Can you make bad things in an open process you bet like sarin?
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:44.160]   But if you're comparing sarin closed source versus sarin open source
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:48.800]   The I think the open source is preferable should there be secrets? That's not what we're talking about
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:56.160]   Should there be secrets? We're talking about is well, I mean anyway, we both okay, then we should we should dump them the sarin open source
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.480]   Yeah, we'll just say sarin should be secret. That's already on the list by the way
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.840]   By the way, it's easy to make mustard guess
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:08.960]   You could find it online. I I know people do it in their kitchen by accident all
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.360]   accidentally. Yeah, yes
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.040]   so uh
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:16.400]   There's you can't the second part of this you can't keep things a secret
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:23.600]   We've tried to keep nuclear proliferation limited to a handful of countries. It's hard to keep that stuff secret
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:30.480]   So in any way, that's good. There's your argument. It's a good argument
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.840]   It's a common argument here is just briefly to complete it and then we're gonna do an ad
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.640]   This is pixel fed ant. This is my account
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:44.000]   Like this is one. This is pixel fed that social so the it says basically if you look at it looks like instagram
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.520]   It's got comments
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.280]   got pictures
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.280]   I click to join I
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:52.080]   You have to pick a surfer to yeah, I pick sir
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:56.160]   So this said pixel that's social which is the largest. Yep is what I pick
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:56.960]   Yep
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:01.760]   And i'm on that page now just giving me the rules and then it gives me a line of code
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:05.920]   Two blocks of code right below it. I'm like, what is this?
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:11.200]   There's no join there's no click here. I'm joined so I can't tell you I don't know
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:14.400]   I don't know what you're seeing but
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.400]   I'm confused. Yeah
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:21.200]   Um, yeah, I don't I'll have to try a log out and see what it looks like
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.720]   It's should be just it is masted on it should be just like joining a mess
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.720]   This is fanny.db.fanny
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:31.520]   It sounds like it's crashing on you work that you shouldn't be seeing that that's not right
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.840]   Okay. Yeah, I think it's crashing on you
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:35.840]   Let me log that
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.880]   What you should see is this
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.160]   Yeah, I'd like to see you should see this
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.760]   I'll share if everyone
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:48.720]   Actually though. This is not this is the login page
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.960]   I wonder what the page looks like to create an account. I don't know
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:59.920]   And so I'm following you both on twit.social and pixel fed.social you can follow well
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:06.400]   Here's what's interesting. You can follow my pixel fed pictures on twit.social because it's another massive right?
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:12.560]   Right. That's what I'm doing on that's that's what I wanted to play with is just see how easy that will work together
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.560]   So all of that in theory
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:18.240]   If it doesn't spit up some database error
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:21.440]   Yeah, I got a bunch of code on my skin
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:25.440]   I think that sounds like there all right. Let's take a quick break because I uh, I
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:32.000]   Think we've gone overboard unfortunately and my plans to keep the show shorter than three hours
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:38.320]   It's because we like talking to each other. That's it. Yeah, that's it and we get and we get
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.400]   in
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.840]   The mastodon stuff is super valuable like what you're doing in Jeff's
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:50.080]   Jeff's an aunt's confusion is been like I'm learning a lot. So I appreciate this. Yeah
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:55.760]   Well, if you'll almost never hear me say those words about like a social media conversation, but here I am
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:58.560]   So thanks. It's a new day
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:07.360]   Every she comes back refreshed to me. Uh, the social media is always best way. It's kind of a constrained group rather than everyone
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:13.360]   Uh, yeah, because you can strain on it. I and get you like openness so much
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:21.920]   All I am just you know what's closed twitter facebook google, you know, it's true mastodon
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:26.080]   Uh scuttlebutt planetary pixel fed those are open
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:30.480]   And if you and the thing is you don't like it. You run your own server. You write your own code
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:37.360]   Now I wish software again. That's okay. Open software is is good. Well open software and open hardware very similar
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.600]   Well, I don't want to get in this whole
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:44.640]   Back away to the app. I'm never gonna get a commercial in here. We're gonna have that in twit plus
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:54.080]   Maybe I have to do my uh, I have to log back in so I can see my pictures on the pixel fed
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:56.960]   Our show today brought to you by
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.960]   Tanium
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:03.200]   Let's talk about cyber security a little bit, you know this the industries approach to cyber security
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.480]   Is tanium would say fundamentally flawed?
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:14.560]   What do they mean? Well, it management security point tools only offer, you know a piece of the puzzle. It's like
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:18.400]   You know, what was it the nine blind men in the uh and the elephant
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:22.240]   Everybody's got a different take on it
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:25.920]   But it's only a small part of the solution you need to protect everything
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:31.360]   And many of these solutions promise to stop all breaches, but they can't they just can't
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:34.240]   Making decisions based on out-of-date
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.480]   Data
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:41.920]   Trying to defend your critical assets from cyber attacks with tools that don't talk to each other is no way
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:45.920]   For it teams to navigate today's attack surface is time
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:55.920]   For a new approach tanium t-a-n-i-u-m says it's time for a convergence of tools endpoints and it operations and security
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:59.600]   Tanium has solutions for government entities education
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:06.880]   Financial services retail health care you could trust their solutions for every workflow that relies on endpoint data
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:09.120]   They've got asset discovery and inventory
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:14.240]   And it's fast you can track down every asset in your entire it estate instantly
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:19.680]   You've got risk and compliance management that will help you fix and find vulnerabilities
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:23.760]   Everywhere in seconds you get in the idea fast
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:28.640]   Threat hunting will let you hunt for sophisticated adversaries in real time
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:34.160]   Client management allows you to automate operations from discovery to management
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:37.680]   And of course because your data is the most important asset
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:43.680]   It's got sensitive data monitoring which lets you index and monitor sensitive data globally to know what's going on with it
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:45.840]   And again in seconds
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:51.360]   titanium protects organizations where other endpoint managers and security providers have failed
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:59:01.040]   With a single program tanium identifies where all your data is across your entire it estate patches every device you own in seconds
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:04.240]   implements critical secure security controls
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.800]   And it does it all from a single pane of glass
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:11.360]   Just ask kevin bush. She's the vice president of it at ring power corp
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:15.920]   He says quote tanium brings visibility to one screen for our whole team
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:19.920]   And if you don't have that kind of visibility you're not going to be able to sleep at night
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:21.840]   Sounds like kevin
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.040]   It's been there, right?
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:29.760]   With real time data comes real time impact if you're ready to unite operations and security teams with a single source of truth and
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:32.320]   confidently protect your organization from cyber threats

[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.800]   twit
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.800]   Ah
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.800]   Yes, I tried a different browser
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:07.280]   This is what I see
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.200]   photo
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.960]   excel fed
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:16.720]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, just go to htbs pixel fed that social. Oh, there you go. Okay. All right
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.800]   And then I get that. Oh, that's a mistake. That's code
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.760]   So weird code when we go up a little bit
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.120]   Under that yeah go underneath the rules what it's say
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:30.080]   what what's
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.640]   node info what's that URL you're at
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:37.680]   Is there a that's what it took me to at that close a little bit right pixel fed that social
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:44.000]   Just to see and it maybe don't don't don't click that just go to picks in your type in your browser pixel fed that social
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.800]   That's something's wrong. I don't know what's going on. Yeah
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:53.440]   Maybe it's down. Oh, there you go. Maybe I can register here. Yeah, I think maybe that's how that's the page I got
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:58.880]   Maybe you just enter it even though you don't have an account yet. Yeah, I don't see you register
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.160]   No, I know just so just enter what you would want it to be maybe
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:06.080]   Maybe that'll let you it'll say oh good. Welcome you're new here's
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.800]   a new account and by the way, I always
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:15.680]   Do it has two factor. I was tearing turn on two factors. Oh, of course for both pixel fed and uh twitta social or any mess
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:18.240]   Of course
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.040]   Um
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.080]   All right, we're gonna move on past elon
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:25.440]   Well, elon block that was all elon
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.320]   So let's talk about tick-tock
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.800]   Oh
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.240]   Bring insiphias back into the equation back in the equation
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:41.040]   Uh actually this is brennan car one of uh the commissioners and one of the best commissioners
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.040]   Oh
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.280]   You know my car is
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:52.240]   Brendan car. It's the free speech stuff. Yeah, jeff. Yeah. Yeah. He's just he's just well. He's he's a fcc commissioner
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.600]   uh
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.120]   He says
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.720]   Well, this will tell you that cepheus should ban tick-tock
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:03.840]   I you know I just did an interview with uh normal
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.640]   So on the techie
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:14.400]   Uh very he used to host a kq ed's forum. He's very well connected michael krasney professor of literature at san francisco state
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.720]   And he said tick-tock
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.120]   It's uh, we should ban it right it's chinese
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:24.560]   Hmm. I said well if you want to start banning things maybe you want to ban facebook instagram
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.520]   twitter
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:33.760]   Uh, well so they all influence us and by the way chinese and russian and other
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:37.840]   Influencers are very prevalent on these platforms
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:42.560]   Why is it because it's from china? Is that why it's so dangerous?
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:46.160]   Well, they're talking about sharing data from people's phones
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:51.920]   So you're downloading an app on someone's phone and the argument is well the national security argument
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.520]   So this is where you would this is the case you would you can't just make a case
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.440]   I think on influence alone
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:02.240]   But you could say hey if you are a government official who has tick-tock
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:09.040]   Not on your work phone, but you you know like let's say you mean on the phone I have that was made in shinjian china on that phone
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:12.320]   Well, I'm I'm just throwing out their argument. They're saying
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.040]   If you're gonna start banning stuff from china go ahead
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:21.920]   Does tick-tock does have an overreach think about things like keystroke loggers on from the website
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.280]   Um, they do track more data than they say they do
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:30.640]   Um, so you could make a case that they are not as transparent as maybe they should be
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:38.560]   And that all that data goes back to china and the chinese government can use it. Is that enough to ban it here in the us?
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:42.160]   I don't know, but that's the case that should be made. I mean
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.040]   Influencing is such a senator Warner agrees
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.880]   democrat
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.840]   Said last week. This is something you would normally hear me say
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.080]   This is not something you normally hear today
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.880]   But donald trump was right on tick-tock years ago
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.600]   If your country uses wah way
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.360]   If your kids are on tick-tock
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:06.240]   The ability for china to have undo influences a much greater challenge and a much more immediate threat than any kind of actual armed conflict
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.280]   So I went to a
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:16.000]   20 conference today where uh, holy 20 business people were that's why I was able to say that I dressed I like your jacket
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.560]   Okay
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.360]   um
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.720]   So
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:25.920]   And it's off the record so I can't say anything but but but but the point was that they said that 10 years ago
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.600]   You said oh china is the key to all growth
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:33.600]   And now the conversation I heard around the room heard was from German executives and others is
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.000]   uh, there's a de globalization
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.920]   And a de-licking that's going to happen and be happening fast where where
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:44.160]   Companies were being told get out of china. You can't do anything with china. We can't do it in china anymore
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:49.360]   Now I I think china is a malign influence of the world. I don't like what they do with freedom of expression
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:54.240]   I've got all those issues, but we are pretty closely tied and and and let's remember that
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.320]   um
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.160]   Canada doesn't want
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.360]   Uh, their citizens data stored in the us
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:05.920]   Germany doesn't want their citizens data stored in the us brazil doesn't want their
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:10.880]   Users data stored the us because they think the us is a malign actor with data
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.920]   Not wrong
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.920]   They're not wrong. Yeah, they're not wrong
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:22.560]   So so when we stand up on our high horse here, uh, again, I don't like china for a lot of reasons
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:27.120]   It's an authoritarian government. It's more authoritarian today than it was two weeks ago
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:31.840]   Uh, it's it's it's it's god awful on freedom of expression. It's god awful on human rights
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.280]   I am not defending china, but let's also look at the mirror
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:41.360]   Right look in the mirror because we're the same country that's sending a bunch of jobs over there for
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:48.800]   Manufacturing stuff that we get to play with instead of keeping well in fact the united states history of imperialistic aggression
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.760]   Is in some ways worse than china at least china
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:55.680]   Uh is trying to uh exert soft power and economic
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:01.520]   Aggression they're exerting hard power in some. I mean, it's like what's happening at the big earth and Tibetans
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:07.200]   That's pretty hard. Yeah, that's not soft imperial. They consider that their own territory. Um, well, I
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.240]   Know but if you talk to the people who live there
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:16.400]   Yeah, ask the people in the guatamala when we invaded for the on the benefit of the united fruit company
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:21.440]   Ask I mean, we don't have the best look what we've done to the people. Oh, I know i'm
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.840]   Uh, if you were a cuban today, I don't think you'd be too happy about the united states
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.040]   Yeah, I
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:36.800]   This released somebody from guantammo who'd been there 20 years without a charge without charges trial no trial no charges
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.240]   We just stuck them there
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:42.000]   Stacy the story that I've been wanting to hear you on when you haven't been here
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.400]   um
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:50.720]   Is is your wisdom about about biden's rules on chips and american executives in chinese chip companies
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.680]   And and how that's affecting the chip ecosystem
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.760]   Okay, well, let's talk about it
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.760]   Like all right, um
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:08.880]   Like what do you want from my opinion? I mean, do I think this is good or bad or I like a little bit
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.440]   I mean, you mean anchor so also at this conference today
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:16.720]   They they quoted the guy who wrote the chip wars book the new one in south that the chips are the new oil
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:21.520]   Which is to say they're the new scarce commodity that's gonna be fought over. That's so stupid
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:26.080]   Well, that's why i'm not i'm just don't kill a messenger yet. Stacy don't kill a messenger
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:31.200]   Um, but but but but but were biden's moves on china
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:36.640]   Where executives like had to just stop working, you know hands up don't do anything
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.280]   Um, and and by some accounts
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:45.680]   Paralyzing potentially the chinese chip industry is that a good move is that cutting off our nose despite our face
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:48.000]   So
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.400]   Our relationship with china has so many complexities like we've we've touched on a bunch of them right there
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.400]   Like we hate a team in rights records. We sell bajillion dollars worth of stuff there
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:03.280]   It's the world's largest market. We can't actually extricate ourselves from this relationship
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.480]   So what we do is we press on different pressure points
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.240]   Right now chips in the chips act is a pressure point
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.520]   So
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:17.040]   Right now we're looking at china and we're being a little bit more aggressive because china is being a little bit more aggressive
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.360]   Now we can't go to them and say hey
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:22.080]   don't go after like
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:28.320]   Don't squash tywan. We can't say that to them directly because that would be like blatantly going to war
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:32.960]   Right, but what we can do is hit some of these other pressure points and I look at
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.840]   From a political point of view
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.440]   This
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:41.280]   helps give the perception that we're solving what is an attractable problem
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:43.760]   in a time
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:48.480]   Is it time constraint? It is a problem of timing like this is a problem that will gradually get better
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:50.640]   But we cannot
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:55.520]   extricate our chip manufacturing and our product development
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:01.840]   Industries from china at all we can do this, but we're not like if everybody
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:06.400]   If all of our us executives in china throw up their hands and go home
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:10.640]   In a year or so we're going to be back sharing information
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.760]   Not just because it's a huge market for semiconductors
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:18.960]   But because we manufacture so many things over there and we can't pull all of that out
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:20.880]   in
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:24.560]   A short time frame and by short, I mean like two to three years
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:32.080]   I'm not even talking like tomorrow, right? So this this to me is like political posturing
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:38.880]   To get what we want and to send a message to china and also feed people back home
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.800]   Like we're doing this image that we're doing something about a problem
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.280]   Is the damage that more us real?
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:54.400]   Short term. Yes. It's that similar to the the trump era tariffs against china
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.040]   Which ended up costing china nothing
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:02.000]   Because cost american companies a lot and a you and consumers
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.880]   If I was an american ceo
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:13.600]   I would be eyeing places other than china to do a lot of my work. I don't I mean that's reasonable and apples do
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.640]   Yeah, everybody's doing that
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:22.960]   and so that is so what we're going to see is a gradual shift to other markets and
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:29.440]   We're I mean, maybe china. Maybe we do completely go to war with china and everybody has to get out
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:35.040]   It's just prudent thinking given the way and this is another signal to like drive that for anybody who's
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:39.680]   Apparently not aware of this. This will be another signal to get them to say who cranky
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:42.080]   Maybe i'm naive
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:47.840]   But it seems to me the best way to avoid war with china to keep china at a time one is to have strong economic ties
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.800]   To make them more dependent on us not less to make it in china's interest
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:55.520]   That the united states
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:01.760]   Is a partner not an enemy the best road to war with any countries just cut all ties
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.400]   Because then the country has nothing to lose
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:08.000]   Is that naive is that the dumb of me? Oh jogs
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.160]   Sorry, we still have strong economic ties with china. We're still doing billions of dollars in trade with them
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.120]   That's why this is a good move in the sense like it's a pressure point. Yeah, it's not like do a little too much
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:24.640]   Yeah, yeah, it's a gauze pad. Yeah, okay. Wait, that assumes it's bleeding. Anyway, the point is
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:28.800]   Metaphorps
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:33.120]   Other side of this is is there all are also
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:40.000]   Leaders who are nuts who don't act in their country's best interests the world's best interests like pouton
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.160]   Uh like kim jong-un. Maybe this is maybe president. She
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.760]   Is nuts, you know, you don't you can't appease hitler
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:53.200]   You can't say well, we're gonna have strong economic ties with germany then they won't invade jekyllis levakia it didn't work
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:59.440]   So, you know, it doesn't work again. Somebody who's not a rational actor is china a rational actor still
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:06.480]   Um, I think still yes, there's some real politicking. I also want to oh goodness
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:13.520]   We don't hear any of that so you're good. Don't worry. Oh, okay. Good. Okay, so we're choking
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:16.560]   I don't know the wrong way
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:23.520]   You have such a good microphone that we don't hear any of that so cough access. Okay. We're good. Okay, so
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:30.800]   Something to pay attention to is I don't know if y'all saw protocol did a thing about eric schmitz ties and
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:38.720]   Not fear mongering but hype around ai the ai battle with china and part of that is the chip thing like if they develop enough chips
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:43.200]   They can build super computers. They've had the biggest best super computer actually for quite some time
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.080]   um, and we've been paying attention to that but
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.800]   There is an economic interest
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:53.920]   In in this case it was all about eric schmit but I would say in silicon valley
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:13:01.920]   And to drive this fear because it gives them money to spend on things that have historically been spent in china
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.240]   Right, so it brings more control back to them
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:11.840]   And it drives federal investment and programs to like like five g china's winning the five g race
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.440]   So I would also like the cynic in me looks at this and says
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:21.760]   Ah, you know, this is kind of just the end result of lobbying if that makes sense if a tiny little island
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:26.880]   In the caribbean can survive 50 years of total embargo
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.520]   from the us
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.520]   I imagine china could too
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.880]   We have not brought kuba to its knees
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:39.280]   Okay, dude, but kuba is really I mean nobody wants to be
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:45.120]   Cuban and they don't want to live. I mean kuba is not like a happy great place to be because of our cuz
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:51.920]   Yeah, right. Well, I know because well all we've done is create a humanitarian crisis. We haven't solved any problems
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:57.280]   And you could argue that our array our sanctions against is it a run? Yeah
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:05.280]   Really caused a lot of problems for the country that then helped fuel, you know, uh radicalization and all kind
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:09.760]   I mean, I I get it, but it sometimes you got to work with the tools you have
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.440]   But we're not stationing china. We're still again spending billions
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:18.080]   I think you make an excellent point. I think the chip embargo and the the Biden administration said it's because
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.560]   It's because they're using these chips to create computers to break our codes
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.520]   And to spy on us, you know, they're using it
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:31.520]   Militarily against us. We don't want to give them those weapons. I can understand that and you're right. It's not cutting them off
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:37.360]   So in that respect, maybe this is it again. I'm naive on this. I'm not
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:42.080]   I wouldn't pretend to be a hand-in-hand messenger here, but uh good good
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:48.240]   He opened up china. Yeah, that would be great. Yeah. Yeah. We need him at the point
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.520]   Opening up china was a was a good thing. Yeah, absolutely. Um
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:55.760]   Yeah, it's unfortunate that china is going more and more authoritarian
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:02.160]   Uh, you know, I think that the whole world is going more and more authoritarian. I mean, let's look at italy
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:05.040]   There look at us
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.040]   Yeah
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.280]   Italy is about to ban raves
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:14.560]   Oh, because of their right wing government says well, we don't want young people
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:20.320]   But what accent was that? We don't want you because I think the Italian accent is
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:26.000]   We don't want to raves in Italy
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.520]   Hey mario
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:35.920]   Uh public parties of more than 50 people will require a permit going forward in it a little for god's sakes
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:39.040]   Unless it's a fascist march then it's okay
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:43.360]   I wonder if i don't raise require permit here
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.640]   No, I don't think so
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:51.680]   Do you have to have a permit to have a party here? I don't think well if you host a rave like I mean
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:56.480]   Well, let me just uh, I mean our let me just google it
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:03.440]   Well, they might not be specifically illegal bit. I've legal if I want to have in the usa
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:08.080]   If you want to provide amplified sound in an outdoor space
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:12.160]   That's like a hundred people the city and county of san francisco
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.040]   Says you need a permit
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:18.720]   Yeah, that's what I mean so raves are like concerts
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:23.920]   So a large rave like a concert would require a business license and event permit
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:29.280]   Permission of the property owner some form of event insurance and collecting taxes of course
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.400]   So you have a point on the black party as usual. Yeah
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:35.280]   so
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:38.240]   So I mean now the Italian government could be like well
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:42.880]   They could have this law and be like we're specifically targeting raves because sometimes they are like a lot
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:46.800]   They are we'll travel down. Yeah, but I don't know how we got into this. I apologize
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:51.680]   It was authoritarian governments was how we got here
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:55.280]   It's not any of a raves the poor Italians
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:58.400]   What are we coming to?
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.120]   mike masonics article about brendan car
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:10.880]   Is I think very uh right on he points out that car who's a commissioner on the federal communications commission has done nothing
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:19.600]   To create any meaningful privacy safeguards over telecom ad tech or app sectors all of which he is officially in charge of
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:26.080]   And instead he's going after social media, which he has no portfolio to to cover to be fair
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:32.960]   The FCC has not had a full democratic commission since no bomb is administration
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.040]   So he can't actually do anything
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:39.520]   Car again is an absolute no show that i'm reading from mike masonics
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.360]   On the issue in the sector he actually regulates
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:46.240]   And his belief or is that mike?
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.400]   This is my oh is it carl boe
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.280]   No, it's carl boe. Oh, it's on it's
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.000]   I said i said mike. I'm sorry and his belief
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.560]   Why do they share that that banning tiktok actually fixes anything?
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:01.840]   Indicates he doesn't understand how any of this
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.560]   works
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:09.360]   Yeah, well carls just mad all the time. I think somebody should ban the news, but uh
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.280]   by the way
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:14.000]   Car mike could legitimately have some control of for that
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.880]   He certainly has control over the telecom industry
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:23.760]   Spying on us and and and all carls saying is look if we suddenly cut off all of the sources of information to tiktok
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:28.240]   They would just go to the telecom providers and buy it from them because they're not right?
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:34.320]   Yeah, and car has put forth efforts to regulate privacy. He's just been
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:42.720]   Shot down by I mean he's I'm trying to remember when his term started. I don't think he's ever had a democratic majority
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:46.800]   But I could be wrong on that the other thing is the FCC
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:52.240]   Yeah, well the FCC has been doing this creeping power grab since about 20
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:58.560]   2008 by the way is a republican. I should point out he's not a democrat. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Oh, yeah
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:04.400]   Whether it's a democratic majority or not doesn't I don't think won't make much difference to him
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.440]   But um it's split right now because they can't
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:14.800]   Uh they can't get gg on yeah, exactly. Yeah, who by the way is fantastic true voice of the consumer
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:23.920]   Write your congressman get her on jesus. Yeah, okay. Or hey. I got another idea. Why don't we all vote on tuesday?
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:33.120]   And i already voted yeah good because voted because honestly you you want to make a change get micha mcconnell out of there and uh gg gets
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:39.600]   Nominated i'm in the bellwether district in new jersey. Oh, are you? Oh, yeah, it's like none of us are in number seven
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:43.600]   i'll ask my vote in california means nothing
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:51.600]   Which is why I don't argue with my relatives because their vote means nothing as well
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.480]   Hey, congratulations speaking of uh fascists you made it on piers morgan's
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.320]   Yes
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:05.600]   On behalf on behalf of this very show. I was I was vlogging our show last week because I was so happy with it
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.480]   And so wanted to have people watch it that I said
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:14.480]   Folks, this is an emergency twitter has been taken over by the evil sith lord
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:20.080]   Said to signal for rescue and rabble answer yay, raba
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.000]   rabble
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.960]   And you know, I was going to the show. Yeah, and I see my name is on there and your name is on there
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:31.360]   Yep. Yep. So what did piers have to say? I don't know somebody just treated this
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:34.400]   I said what did that do to your mentions? Jason
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:38.640]   Um, and I don't know what they said they just said oh wow much harvests here
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:41.360]   That's hysterical
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:48.400]   And by the way, by the way, I don't know how he found it because piers morgan snowflake that he is blocks me
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:54.720]   Oh somebody sent it to him probably fascinating. I'm blocked by piers morgan. What a you can add that if you want
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:59.680]   To my lab and list here get the car by piers morgan
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:03.120]   And that blocked by piers morgan
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:07.760]   New land nation. Let's take a little break more to come
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:11.840]   So nice to have stacey back you see how much more balanced and
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:16.720]   And uh and fun and informative and interesting it is with stacey here. It's so great
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:19.600]   So good internet
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.600]   Our show today brought to you by
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:29.840]   Oh, I love this company. You might know a little bit about this stacey on logic on logic makes
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:38.240]   Orange you've seen this color you see it right there on the lower third industrial and embedded computers
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:40.640]   little guys
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:42.640]   That are revolutionizing
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:45.040]   sustainable agriculture
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:49.280]   Bringing smart cities to life increasing manufacturing efficiency
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.400]   These are so cool these on logic
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:56.560]   Distinctive orange and industrial embedded computers if we received ours yet
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:02.320]   I want I think we ordered one. I want one on logic is the first not that I have an industrial
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.880]   I mean, I don't know what I would use it for but I just think it's cool
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:08.400]   It's the first choice in industrial computing for innovators around the world
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:11.840]   Who need computing power that can survive?
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:16.560]   Even thrive where traditional hardware might fail
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:21.280]   On logic designs and creates computing solutions that fit in the palm of your hand
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:28.880]   While powering everything from advanced robotics and ai to manufacturing automation digital media solutions
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:35.680]   Smart agriculture technologies because these are engineered for reliability. They're passively cooled
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:39.760]   You can get an on logic computer that has no openings completely ventless
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:45.840]   Protecting internal components from dust airborne contamination. These computers can be used anywhere
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:50.240]   They've removed fans. So it's a solid state device
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:53.760]   No moving parts protecting against shock and vibration
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:23:02.320]   Other design features and specialized components protect systems from extreme temperatures and interference you get the model that fits your requirements
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.880]   But you'll always be in
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:11.600]   Assured that on logic systems have been extensively tested to operate reliably wherever they're needed
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:15.440]   You might see them on a medical cart at a hospital on a crash cart
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.320]   You might see them deep within a mine
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:21.920]   the team at on logic
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:28.480]   Is driven to create right fit solutions tailored specifically to solve your unique technology?
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:31.520]   Challenges and when it comes to software they partner with the best
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:38.160]   Companies like a ws to enable rapid evaluation and deployment of edge computing solutions for example, they have
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:44.400]   AWS iot green grass compatible computers. They've been vetted and approved by a ws
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:49.520]   So if you're using green grass, you'll have the you know the peace of mind knowing
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:52.960]   It's gonna work right out of the box. It's it's verified. It's approved
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:58.480]   Look if you need a computing solution that can be easily configured to whatever your particular needs are
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:01.520]   Supported by industry experts who are happy to talk to you
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:04.480]   They're just a phone call a website chat or an email away
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:09.760]   And they want they want to support you and it's delivered quickly that yes
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:11.760]   They've got the supply
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:18.400]   The team at on logic is ready to help to get started learn more about on logics 30 day risk free hardware trial
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:22.960]   That's nice too on logic.com/twit. Oh and
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:27.040]   LOGIC.com/twit. Now voice that we've got the coolest
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.680]   sponsors. I love this
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:34.080]   on logic.com/twit
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:41.600]   Jeff the next time you're in the hospital for atrial fibrillation just look at the crash cart. You'll probably see that's right
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:47.520]   Yeah, I'll do a selfie with me in the old logic box. I'm sorry. That was me
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:51.120]   You're not on
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:56.400]   LED that's never gonna happen you're gonna you're you take good care of yourself, right Jeff?
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:02.880]   Don't eat the ketchup. I bet be. I'm not actually I have Chinese food in the refrigerator tonight
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:05.360]   I'm just gonna take care of myself
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.400]   You know we talked about on windows weekly was using the rice cooker to make
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:17.360]   And if it was Doc Rock on Macberry wheel, he said you put you get leftover katucky fried chicken
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.520]   I'm gonna do it with pop ice and that was
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:23.920]   You put that in the rice cooker on top of the rice you cook it by the time it's done
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:27.040]   It's the flavor is permeated the rice and you've got chicken
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.920]   The crispy chicken
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:33.200]   And then you can tear it apart so you've got little pieces of delicious chicken
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:36.800]   No, that's what that you don't want you want you want crunchy
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:42.640]   It's fried not under the air fryer if you insist, but this idea is the flavor that's easy
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:47.280]   You can just throw some chicken drumsticks on the rice and then get the shmalls
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:49.600]   That's what you get. I mean and you mix it up in a split
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:53.200]   But but if you do it in the rice kicker cook it gets cooked into the
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.000]   Yeah
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.760]   Is the smarts
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.760]   You know we talk a lot about
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:03.360]   My many appliances. I love my thermo mix. You're not getting it
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:09.120]   But I have to say my zojirushi three cup rice cooker
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:12.560]   I use it all that it's so good. Do you have a rice cooker?
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:15.600]   I have this insta pot thing
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:20.800]   I mean that's close and it and it does rice really really quick the rice cooker. It just does rice
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:25.520]   Yeah, and it's so great and it has these mycom rice cookers have a
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:30.800]   AI chip. They say AI. I don't know if it is okay the chip that senses the temperature the moisture
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:35.600]   They measure it so it you could put too much water and I did once the first time I used it
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:40.880]   And it doesn't care because it figures it out. Oh nice. Oh, it's always perfect. Right stacy
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:44.160]   It is it is good rice. So good
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:46.560]   All right
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:48.560]   I'm sorry. How did I get on that?
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.880]   You went from
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:53.760]   To rice cookers. I'm going. That's right. I want you to eat healthy
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:57.760]   All right, okay get you should get a fried chicken
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:01.360]   For quinoa fried. Yeah, having more fried chicken. Yeah, thanks. Thanks. Leo. No, no
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.920]   But I am going to you know, I'll send them the rice cooker stacy and some brown rice
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:11.840]   And it uh mine makes got what's called gabbo rice, which it germinates it before it cooks it
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:17.200]   You set the timer you say I want to eat it five. Well, let's twig. I want to eat six
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:21.040]   Wait a minute. You're on the east coast. I want to eat it 10 p.m
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:26.800]   And and it's and it back times it it does the whole thing it it cooks it
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:31.680]   It soaks the rice at 104 degrees for a couple hours to germinate it and then it cooks it
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:37.520]   And it's supposedly more. I don't know if it's more helpful sport and it's brown rice. So it's good for your it's good for you
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:42.800]   And it's delicious and then you put like a pound of butter on top of it. Oh, it's there you go
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.000]   Now you got me so good or the chicken
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.920]   Just like a butter. Yeah, it's well. All right, November 1st. What was that yesterday?
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:56.480]   Yes, and the line for hangouts. They're they're flipping the switch
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.480]   Mmm
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:00.160]   Did
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:04.880]   I don't even know what I talked to kevin on anymore. I just give up like

[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:26.160]   So I think when I lost because I think it's became chat didn't it or to become I still have
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.320]   I have duo. I have chat
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:31.440]   And they they brought it into the email

[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.560]   Thing. Yes. Not like my hangouts turned into chat
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:50.960]   And duo got supposedly let me let me launch duo. I'm on the pixel here duo is supposedly folded into that as well
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:53.200]   Into meat or something

[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:29.440]   If you want to make sure that you have if you have hangouts stuff you want to keep
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:32.320]   Google takeout
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:35.520]   Go to google takeout which is takeout.google.com

[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:48.000]   Once the data collection is complete with all your hangouts
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.160]   We in a form that are completely useless, but you'll have them
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:58.720]   It's same with I downloaded all my tweets took 48 hours for them to get it to me. Oh, that's nice
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:05.440]   Do you have tweets going back to 2006? Oh, yeah. Oh nice and you have all of them whenever you joined. Yeah
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.360]   Yeah
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:10.880]   So it's sitting there somewhere I'll forget about it, but I have it. I just felt vindicated
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:18.160]   So uh, I guess that could have been in the change log, but you know, it's it's not it's been a change a long time ago
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:21.280]   uh wait
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:29.520]   Sorry, I showed you all the original meets app that I've now installed because there is actually another meet app that is not green
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.840]   It is
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:38.800]   I'm sorry. I didn't see it. Does your daughter play roblox? Do we know anybody who plays roblox?
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:43.920]   Um, apparently weirdo does but I've never seen a little weirdo plays it
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:46.480]   Apparently, but I've never seen it
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:50.560]   Um can tell you the first thing about it on alice lindsey's kids too. I think
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:56.480]   It's supposed to be cool. I should really play it because I it's like it's like the new minecraft, right?
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:58.480]   I mean, it's what all the kids are playing
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:00.480]   Parsons school of design
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:05.280]   Has designed a roblox based digital fashion course
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:12.160]   So this is well, I'm gonna go spend tens of thousands dollars to get a college degree. Oh good. Son. What are you gonna learn?
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:14.480]   I'm gonna learn to make fake clothes
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:18.000]   It's just a course man. I know
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.720]   Parsons
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:27.760]   Feel old this is one of the best fashion schools in the country, right? Parsis. It is indeed. Absolutely. That's where um
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:30.480]   That's where what's his name?
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:31.360]   teaches
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.000]   uh from the uh the design guy from the
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:37.520]   Project runway Tim Gunn. Isn't he teaching versus oh?
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:45.200]   Oh, okay. He does. Yeah, I love to do a control f and type in nft. Does it pop up in this article?
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:49.920]   They mentioned nft's. Oh, I don't know. That's a good question
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:55.040]   If the metaverse is gonna be big, you know get people excited about doing a course
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:58.080]   I mean, it's like when I took a course in blogging in
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:04.320]   1998, okay, yeah, you're all big in front of it, but do you know how much money?
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.560]   Henry is making on tick tock
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:09.920]   How much? I don't know. Do you know? I want to
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:15.120]   I think it's a lot. He's I
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:18.480]   So I wish he could have taken tick tock in college
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:23.360]   What he did take was a pretty much useless broadcast news degree
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:30.080]   Uh, but he did learn how to edit there in a kind of old fashion. I said yeah, you're learning ab editing
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:34.960]   You're never going to use this, but it's probably good to understand the the language of video and stuff
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:37.360]   And I guess it did help him because he's a really good video editor
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:40.800]   Yes, but he's got ads now for Heinz mustard
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:44.720]   For petobysmal. Oh, that's funny
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:50.560]   Kim said on facebook. She said I think this is your son
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:55.680]   He's making this really spicy sandwich and then he then he goes holds up a bottle of pepos as you're gonna need this
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:03.040]   I said, you know, our advertising is slowing down quite a bit. He says not mine
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:07.200]   Oh, jeez, it's just got Heinz just got uh
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:13.200]   Smith playing Daxamara job. I might I might be working for my boy in a bit. That's just fine
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:16.000]   At this schmancy event today
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.680]   I can't off the record so I won so much but the c o o
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:24.160]   Of tick tock was there which is the reason I went because I was really curious to hear she's very impressive
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:28.320]   Uh and the question I asked was she chinese? No, she's american, right?
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:30.720]   Oh, no, she's she's australian actually, but okay
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:33.120]   um
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:35.600]   But she um, but what I asked was
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:39.120]   I said, I'm addicted to tick tock and it's fine. I'm happy with that
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:46.400]   Um, but I'm at the point of training my journalism students to to serve audiences on tick tock and are you gonna have a creator's environment
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:52.160]   That's going to be what she's saying. Um, useful ongoing. Well, she gave again, I thought the record was not sure to say but yes
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:55.440]   Of course she gave the answer you expected to say which we love creators. We have creators to be happy
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:59.840]   We're coming up with more monetization. Um, yeah, look, uh, here's henry
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:05.200]   He's using oscar mire meats. He's using hinds yellow mustard
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:14.400]   Uh, product placement. Uh, yeah, but he gets paid for and he does say hashtag ad is the very first thing
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:18.880]   Yeah, he says which is you know, he knows he's paid partnership all that stuff
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:20.640]   um
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:25.440]   And then and then the first comment says marriage material so I don't know if that's because
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:29.680]   He's now loaded from the hind steel or because he can cook a hell of a
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:34.960]   Cubano. I don't know. Oh a cubano still bishes. Oh, isn't that good
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:39.760]   Oh, you put mayo on the top of the sandwich right in the front ask cannery. I don't know
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:45.520]   It's it's like butter on the outside. Yeah, I get it. I never just know. Yeah, that's the best way to make grilled cheese too, right?
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.520]   You put mayonnaise on the outside. Yeah
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:48.960]   Um
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:54.240]   Somebody said too much mustard, dude. Yeah, but he's heint's wanted a lot of mustards
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:59.680]   Yeah, by the way, just a little tip you don't make mustard gas with mustard who knew
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:07.120]   Uh, anyway, so I don't know if I would be the first person to say oh man parsley school was designed teaching
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:12.480]   Fake fashion, but I got to because who knows those kids might be making billions
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:17.200]   Oh, they can't make him fake. Hey, somebody had a design the fake. Hey for years on on facebook

[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:32.640]   Like somebody had a design it well. Yeah, they actually had a design the fake hey. Oh, yeah
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:37.920]   You know it's led by parsons faculty created in collaboration with roblox
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:44.320]   Roblox representatives in marketing creative and education will be collaborating with parsons
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:48.320]   Now, there's not a conflict of interest is that is that is that uh
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:53.360]   Leading kitties down the capitalistic path to doom. Nah
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:56.880]   No, it's giving them a job after college. My god
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:59.120]   You know, honestly
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:04.000]   Seriously, and I know jeff you probably were worried your son and my son about the same age I
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.520]   I feel I feel for this generation. They can't oh, yeah, I mean, uh
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:14.880]   Minimum wage forget it you make 20 bucks an hour. You still can't rent a room in petaluma
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:16.800]   Nope, uh
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:22.560]   So I was I'm been very worried, but you know if anybody needs a word press developer coming to me for son jay
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:23.760]   And I will send you there
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:30.640]   But these kids are smart enough to know to say yeah, I think I think I needed some skills for the 21st century and that's this is one of them
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:34.960]   Uh, the verge says designing and dressing a digital avatar is a huge part
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:39.680]   I didn't know this of playing roblox games and the avatar shop players can purchase
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:42.960]   Anything from sneakers to designer gowns
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:51.600]   To outfit their in-game self sometimes shelling out thousands of real-life dollars to buy digital items
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:56.400]   Thousands thousands that's that's kind of that's
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:02.720]   Roblox fans are buying digital news from the house digital
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.120]   Yes
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:09.440]   Yeah, if you this is your outlet. This is your social avatar
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:12.080]   Make it look good
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:19.360]   Gucci is hosting an artsy garden space. This was back in me. So it's over now, uh, where you could buy
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:22.720]   Gucci virtual goods
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:26.560]   Including a gucci handbag for thousands of dollars
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:32.160]   So there you go burberry has in-game outfits
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:38.800]   For a chinese strategy game bonsiaga made a post-acapocalyptic world in place of a traditional one-ray show
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:43.920]   Louis Vuitton dressed up a virtual hip-hop group made up of league of legends characters
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:51.760]   And fashion is often an early adopter of these things just to play with it just to be at the cutting edge. It's kind of that
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:57.440]   Uh art plus technology creativity thing. So even it was funny. Stay safe
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.880]   In the early days of the web on when I was a conde
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:04.960]   Fashion was was was scared to death of it. They stayed way back
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:11.120]   So they were scared of the internet, but fashion embraces technology in a lot of weird ways looking like
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:15.040]   Alexander McQueen show with the the robot spray painting
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:18.320]   Yeah, the hiding clue no no

[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:21.920]   No, that was
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:28.720]   No, that that that was actually a call out to a prior show like 20 years before I didn't I didn't understand
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:32.080]   So when Bella Hadid got her dress painted on her
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:35.760]   Oh, okay, that was yes now
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:38.880]   I'll tell you when Alexander McQueen I
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:41.520]   On the chat. No
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:44.720]   This chat no, no, I just this chat would no
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:49.360]   Look at this. Look at this. This is this is uh, Bella Hadid
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:52.800]   So she this is peris fashion week this year
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:56.800]   She went out there and these guys paint on with some sort of weird

[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.200]   They paint 1991 90 what so this was a call out to the 1991
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:12.800]   So Alexander McQueen in his in his show. So this was not this was not the Bella Hadid one wasn't from
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:16.320]   Al-xanima queen. No, no, no, he also it was coparin
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:21.760]   Yeah, and that was a material science thing, but for uh McQueen show
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:24.880]   uh, sarah berten
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:27.600]   did a robot spray painting
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.520]   Address spray like an actual dress not spraying the dress on her
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:39.840]   Uh, and that was a robot spray painting something that happened back all the way back in 1991. Oh 1999
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.760]   So
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:43.760]   Yeah, sorry
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:51.840]   Um, but yes, McQueen doctor. Oh no, it was they say they say it wasn't homage. There you go. See interesting
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:54.480]   Stacy knows
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:59.840]   So without Stacy we wouldn't have known any of that shalom's harlow was spray painted by robotic arms
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:07.040]   There you go. Was it 91 or 99? Yeah, it was just sso 9. I don't know. I don't know the
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:12.400]   Wow spring show. Oh, oh, nine. Maybe I don't know
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:16.000]   So this is in a this is a documentary you could see
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.480]   um
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:23.040]   About McQueen, I guess he's he passed right am I wrong? He did. Yeah, yes
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:29.760]   Anyway, the point is like fashion is important because it's how people present themselves in
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:33.440]   While they hate like the internet and disruptions to their business model
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:40.000]   the designers are like all about like cool like there's some really awesome things like
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.760]   uh
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:46.480]   Is say Miyaki is it? Yeah, Miyaki. He like pioneered an entire
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.200]   Me as that's it
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.200]   an entire
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:56.400]   Manufacturing process to make his pleats. I mean like these guys are like legit
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:04.480]   It's also famous for designing Steve Jobs black turtleneck. Yeah. Yeah, so so the point is I guess
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:10.880]   Getting into like things like the metaverse it makes total sense that you would see people designing
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:15.520]   In the fashion folks getting in on this even if we poo poo it and think it's silly
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:21.520]   It's it's basically creative trying to figure out where the cutting edge is and we should really respect that I think
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:26.320]   Well, and let's not forget you was at youtube that sponsored the met gala last year and there were all these uh
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.520]   Youtuber Instagram was insta maybe
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:34.800]   Uh, but all of these uh, yeah all of these uh influencers on the red card
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:38.240]   Brown league was there. Yeah. Yeah, marquez was there. Yeah
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:42.080]   Looking sharp. I might add marquez looking good
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:47.680]   Uh, we always get into fashion at some point. I don't know. I don't know why that is
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:54.880]   See there are people making comments in the in the chat about fashion. I had faith in y'all. Yeah, they were
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:56.880]   at this
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:02.640]   Is it a brown dress with black stripes or purple dress or the orange? I'm still i'm not
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:07.600]   So, uh, let's take it one line. Okay. I'll couple more. Let's see before we take another break
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:13.360]   Oh, did scooter scooter x just google acquiring the ai avatar startup. We could see see that in the
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.360]   Like presenting this just happened
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:20.400]   Uh google acquires twitter back ai avatar startup altar
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:29.120]   Hunter hunter milo hunter. Hondo milo hundo. Anyways a few days ago. Uh, no, no keep chanting hundo milo
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:31.680]   That's hundo milo. I don't know what that is
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:36.720]   I know what a hundo is, but how do you say million in the argette of the people?
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:38.320]   I don't know
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:39.680]   million
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:41.600]   100 large
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.600]   hundo large
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:45.680]   Uh, hundo
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:50.800]   I know in uh, I know from watching a uh, a show about the city
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:55.120]   London's financial district that uh million dollars is a yard
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:57.920]   So it would be a hundo yards
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:00.400]   But that sounds like a football field
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:05.040]   Anyway, they apparently the acquisition was completed a couple of months ago. Nobody knew
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:10.240]   Nobody knew but uh now thanks to linkedin people see this what people do they say well
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.240]   I gotta update my linkedin and all of a sudden everybody
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:16.000]   Uh knows it's a checked headquartered
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.280]   Company you may remember it better as face emoji
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:26.640]   Uh, yeah, that's familiar. Yeah, that's some more familiar and they got uh three million in seed funding from play ventures
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:29.120]   rusch ventures and twitter
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:32.480]   So I what is google gonna do with it
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:37.840]   They uh plan to use altar to improve and ramp up their content offerings
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:40.720]   Oh, we're gonna have another social network from google
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:48.720]   Where else do you put emoji? I mean uh, avatar's uh, your google, um your face your google profile picture
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:55.200]   You have a picture with 100 million dollars though. Well, I'll tell you maybe they're a little just because with apple you can have
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:58.800]   Your uh, what is apple call its mamojis
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:01.520]   Memojis you can have your apple
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:05.040]   Your apple mamoji as your uh profile picture
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:10.080]   And when you log into your apple computer and you type the wrong thing it goes no
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:12.720]   Or it go yeah, yeah, it actually emotes
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:17.840]   Back at you, which is kind of weird, but I think google probably wants to be in that game
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:22.080]   What's a hundred million dollars to a company like google after yeah, yeah
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:25.280]   Speaking of a hundred million
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:30.160]   Amazon has announced that if you're an amazon prime subscriber
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:35.200]   Remember you used to get two million songs for free that you could ask for on your amazon echo
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:38.800]   They said oh the heck with it. Let's give them the whole catalog a hundred
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:44.000]   million songs it's two million clearly isn't enough to get you out of the picture
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:50.160]   Two of what nine hundred ninety five thousand or eight go
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:55.760]   Apple just raised their rates. Yeah, and just if you're already paying for prime you got it
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:00.560]   Uh now you can't ask for a individual song
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:04.960]   You can't ask for an individual album
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:08.880]   But you can't ask for an artist
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:15.200]   It's going to be shuffle play and apple does this two apple has a five dollar subscription to apple music
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:19.120]   And it's kind of the same limitations and it's really designed for
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:24.720]   In apple's case for the home pod and for google's case for the echo because you're going to talk to it
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:30.160]   Right, it's not going to be on your device so much as say hey echo play some Beatles music
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:36.400]   And then it'll just play you some stuff. There are also and this scares me a little bit more going to include ad-free podcasts
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:43.760]   From cnn npr the new york times and espn as well as the entire wonder catalog they own wonder
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:52.000]   So dr. Death smart less even the rich they made a point of podcast here. How how into podcast is amazon apart from audible
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:57.120]   I didn't know there was really an amazon podcast presence. Well, uh to me
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:03.280]   And by the way, I feel like we're getting now eating up from both sides. No, I know
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:08.880]   They want the same thing spotify has so when you go like joe rogan's exclusive on spotify
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:10.960]   You have to listen to them to spotify
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:16.000]   We've talked about this board now spotify has all the tracking they could ever want they know how much you listen to when you listen to it
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.560]   Who you are what your credit card number is exactly where you are all that stuff
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:26.960]   Uh, and they sell that that's valuable for them for advertising. It's something we can't compete with because we don't know any of that stuff
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:28.720]   So
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:30.720]   The amazon clearly wants that
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:33.680]   But it's ad-free right so I don't understand
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:36.320]   They're not putting ads in there
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:43.280]   But I guess uh, this is where it's tough for spotify to compete because spotify's business is the subscriptions
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:48.720]   Amazon's business is a lot of other stuff if they get you to buy amazon prime
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:53.280]   Because you get video you get free podcast. You know ad free podcast you get
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:58.960]   100 million songs that's all good for their that's the flywheel for their other businesses
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:03.440]   This is why it's hard to compete with apple and amazon because their main business isn't the music
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:07.600]   So spotify is kind of also stuck between a rock and a hard place
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:11.920]   It scares me because now I worry our listeners are gonna say well. I don't want any ads
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:15.840]   So I'm gonna listen to the amazon prime or I'm gonna listen on spotify
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:20.080]   And uh, it's hard for us to survive
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:22.080]   so
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:26.640]   Or not I shouldn't say us it's hard for independent rss based podcasts
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:29.200]   To make go make their way
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:30.560]   There are plenty of them
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:37.360]   But it's gonna get harder and harder to make money and this is this is dave whiners cry the man who co-invented podcasts is
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:41.760]   Taking them away from rss eight podcasts. Yeah, it's not
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:45.680]   Uh, there's some evidence by the way that joe rogan lost
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:53.040]   Well, he lost influence so their thing that means he probably lost listeners when he went exclusive on spotify
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:56.560]   I know how it's turned
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:00.800]   listeners but made a friggin for yeah, I would trade influence for money
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:03.440]   Yeah, I did joe. Well, it's fine for joe, but it's the question is
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:06.320]   did spotify kind of
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:11.600]   Think they were gonna bring his whole audience over they still charge. I'm told a million dollars for an ad
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.680]   on joe rogan
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:14.880]   cheese
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:15.840]   Hey
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.840]   How to ruin your brand and one check
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:21.680]   I don't know who's I know leo. I know
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:25.760]   Breathe leo breathe
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:28.400]   Well, it's one of the reasons we're really
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:31.520]   begging people at this point or we're pulling a
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:35.840]   PBS and and begging people to subscribe to club twit because
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:40.560]   If we're gonna survive and grateful and we're very grateful
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:42.640]   Uh
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:44.640]   We crossed 5 000 members. That's good
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:47.600]   We need maybe a lot more
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:54.640]   To uh to survive if advertising goes away. This is always the threat and I've always said this in the last we've been doing this
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:59.920]   since 2004 was my first podcast this show a little later, but
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:02.960]   We've been doing it for you know 17 years
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:06.880]   And i've always said the only thing that can kill us is if nobody listens
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:09.600]   Thank you for listening
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.280]   Uh or nobody buys ads
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:15.600]   And either one could could literally just we'd have to turn off the lights
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:18.080]   Either one
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:22.720]   Fortunately the audience in fact the audience has been growing since covid for some reason. I'm not sure why thank you
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:27.680]   But the advertisers are going the other direction and I think some of it is because of competition
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:31.120]   on both sides from ad free podcasts on amazon and
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:34.000]   Ad tracking from spotify
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.800]   Anyway, all of which is to say it really helps if you pay seven bucks a month
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:44.320]   I don't like pay walls cheaper than twitters going to be cheaper than twitter blue. Yeah, but
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:48.160]   They can pay more if they want by the way. We've added that feature
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:52.960]   There's a slider if you want to add but you don't have to and I also really understand not every
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:54.880]   Everybody can afford that
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:57.440]   And if money's tight and god knows it is these days
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:02.480]   Yep, we'll still offer the podcast for free ad support it as far as long as we can. I mean i'm
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:05.120]   Obviously if all the advertisers go away
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:08.080]   I don't know what do we do then at? I don't know
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:12.400]   You start working for hanner. I won't say i'll say i'll work for hanner
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:19.440]   If you see me at some point slather and mustard, I have ideas, but it probably shouldn't be said on the air
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:21.680]   Okay, you you and i we should talk let's talk
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:26.320]   It's not going to be nft's is it? Oh, no, sir. No
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:34.320]   Amazon did fire half the stuff actually this I thought was a really good idea they created something called amp
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:39.120]   I bet you never heard of this it was their idea was radio on the internet
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:45.120]   They were hoping deejays and others would use amp they pay the license fees for the music
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:49.920]   So you can go on there and create a show they had lots of live shows
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:53.760]   Unfortunately, they didn't I don't think they had an app. I think you had to do it on the web
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:57.040]   Oh, no, they did have an app in beta
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:02.640]   Um, but the idea was they would bring radio people over they've been promoting an f1 show
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:04.640]   They've said turn down the audio
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:09.360]   This was a by the way hopeless cause if you're watching the formula one race
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:14.000]   Turn down the audio and listen to deejays and some woman
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:20.720]   On amp doing their play by play that's not going to happen because people in the formula one are going to
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:24.480]   Right the formula one it's like
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:27.440]   Right
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:35.680]   Best diagram two minutes in sports exactly. Oh gosh. I love it. So anyway, uh, I guess it's not been a huge success
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:39.680]   Amazon has cut 150 people which is about half
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:42.880]   the division
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:46.240]   And Amazon spokesperson said at Amazon we think big
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:50.640]   Experiment and invest in new ideas to delight customers
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:53.200]   This is a an email they sent to geek wire
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:52:01.280]   We also continually evaluate the progress of potential of our products and services to deliver customer value and we regularly make adjustments based on those assessments
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:04.400]   Following a recent review. We decided
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:09.360]   Made the decision to consolidate a few teams so we could focus on growth and scaling a vamp
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:14.960]   I'm a little disappointed. I thought this might be something pretty cool, but I don't think they really promoted it
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:17.360]   Had you had any of you heard of amp?
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:22.880]   No, that's the thing we talked about the show I think and then completely forgot about yeah gone out of the head. Yeah
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:30.480]   Uh, yeah, it's kind of too bad. So were you referring ant to the guy on nascar who went up on the wall
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:38.720]   No, no, no in formula one. I can't think of the one is different than nascar. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah, don't please excuse me. Yeah
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:44.000]   I'm just gonna stop you right there. Catherners are coming at me right now, sir
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.880]   Did you see did you see the ross chastain thing on nascar though? No, I did not
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:52.480]   You can play without sound leo. I think it'll be safe really you sure
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:54.080]   No
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:56.080]   Chastain
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:59.680]   Apply in 79 the most nascar thing ever
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:03.520]   It really ross chastain driving red and black car
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:09.600]   Picks up five places to qualify the winner take all nascar 2022 cup series championship in phoenix
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:12.480]   On november six with the most hollywood move
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:16.880]   I've ever seen all right. Let me see if I can play this
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:21.360]   Can I I I think I shouldn't play the sound
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:26.160]   No, you don't play the sound but you don't need to play sound okay, but don't play the sound don't play the sound there
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:30.960]   She is in car one there. No, no, no, they're gonna see on the red look at she's she's she's
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:33.520]   scraping the side
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:35.200]   That's the point. Oh
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:38.880]   That was that was the goal. She's getting around she's getting around the uh, the wait a minute
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:43.840]   And then you get the wrong video go to the other video you went through you what the wrong video the oh
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:47.120]   I did it on
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:49.120]   Didn't she scrape it wasn't that good?
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:54.160]   Yeah, the whole point was she went up on the wall
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:59.840]   Florida in the fifth gear took her hands off the steering wheel and let the wall
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:02.960]   Uh do it on the outside
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:08.080]   Because I think learned it in like a like a like a video game or something
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:11.200]   It was pretty amazing if you had the right video which I should have found just guide
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:15.280]   It's a guy by the way, not a not a woman guy. It's okay. I thought well you were saying her
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:17.120]   Oh, I was saying her because I thought you said ross
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:19.840]   No, no no Ross
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:20.960]   So
[01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:24.720]   Hold on. So he rode the wall essentially yes
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:27.440]   Doesn't that slow you down?
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:29.680]   No, that's the point it didn't
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:33.840]   Um the physics trick that led to the incredible nascar trick on big think
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.000]   Here we go. Here we go. I need to see this here. We go. Let's let's play it off. It's really amazing
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.360]   This is for a bird's eye point of view. Is that Bristol?
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:42.880]   Uh
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:44.480]   It was real
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:47.520]   So look at that. He's what and so what had how did that help him?
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:49.760]   Uh, he he
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:53.520]   Well, he didn't win but he but he qualified he beat some people out of the qualification
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:56.000]   Well, he went off the track. Go underline
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000]   Anything like that before in my life
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.440]   Go to line 80. You'll see a better view but chestain explained
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:07.040]   He played a lot of nascar on the game cube bingo. That's the thing that's interesting
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:11.920]   That's our angle. I see and I could play this audio. He's talking about it on the game cube with Chad
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:16.960]   Growing up and uh you could get away with it and I never knew if it would actually work and I
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:22.160]   I mean, I've done I did that when I was eight years old and watch that
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:25.040]   so now so
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:26.400]   How?
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:31.520]   So in the game cube you can do this. It seems dangerous. See what he did. Yeah, he just he just kept
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:34.320]   Fifth gear and kept going
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:36.960]   Okay
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:37.440]   Wow
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:43.040]   So I thought I'd ask car guy at all but that just was fun again. Yeah, no, there was a lot of coverage of this. I saw it uh
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:45.840]   again the trick is
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:48.960]   Play more video games. I think that's that's uh, I see
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:52.240]   If you get in a Parsons learn how to make uh
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:56.160]   Fashions in the digital world. I guess it makes sense that Martin's videos
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:03.120]   Because martin'sville the the big key for that race is always breaks keeping the brakes cool and
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:07.280]   He totally eliminated the brake problem. Yeah
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:12.160]   Your door got pretty hot but the brakes are nice and cool. Oh
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:16.800]   Yeah, the car afterwards here you can see the scrapes on it obviously but yeah
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:19.920]   I mean, I drive like that in regular
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:24.640]   But no one gives me a medal for it in fact
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:27.200]   It gets really upset
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:33.440]   All right, let's do a little google changelog thing if you don't mind here
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:38.240]   The google changelog
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:48.720]   Google had its ai day and then that's a bunch of ai stuff. They're gonna have you know, they're watching
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:53.840]   Open ai and stable diffusion and mid-journey with these art
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:58.560]   You know ai generated art so they're gonna start doing a text image
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:03.920]   Thing called image in it's very first very limited public outing
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:11.360]   Uh, this is in the test kitchen app. So you in fact all the stuff i'm gonna talk about is in the test kitchen app very limited. Yeah
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:16.880]   So, uh, it's using lambda we talked about lambda right the same one that uh
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:19.840]   the one's alive takeover. Yeah
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:27.360]   And it's gonna be adding a constrained image and requests of parts of what it causes calls a season two
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:30.400]   update to the app
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:36.880]   Um, here is a city dreamer. Yes terrible looks like material design
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:39.520]   Yeah
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:45.520]   Uh, we're gonna I have to install my assignment this weekend is to install a stable diffusion on my computer at home
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:49.120]   We're gonna try this. I hope it works. I'm gonna
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:53.760]   Photo not photoshop adobe had some type of plug-in
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:56.800]   Okay, you and I will compete around with it too
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:01.120]   So because what we want to do is have our christmas card this year, you know last year
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:05.120]   It was all we did a zoom christmas card this year. We want to have a stable diffusion
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:11.600]   No, no two years ago. We did the zoom last year. We did the meta metaverse. Oh, that's right
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:16.160]   We were in them. We know had no legs. Right. So we're trying to do trendy. So this year we're gonna do
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:21.760]   I'm gonna get a we'll have to take a real picture right now. I'm gonna try it with the uh last years or a couple years ago
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:25.760]   Card with real people see if how look you know see if I can make it look good
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:29.840]   I think i'm gonna use the image to image plug-in which takes an image and then makes a
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:34.160]   Image and I might because you could do it disney style. You could do a rikowski style
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:38.480]   You got various styles, but you do it with photoshop too. Let's see which one you know, let's see what happens
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:43.120]   I'm definitely not gonna just put it and just take the you know office shot
[01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:50.080]   Well, that was what you're thinking of doing a drone thing. Yeah, I don't know. Here's wobble
[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:54.160]   Imagine a monster using google's text to image models
[01:58:54.160 --> 01:59:01.360]   Dorky. Yeah, sorry google too little too late. It's gone. It's gone way past you now. They're trying to be so safe
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:03.440]   They don't want to have another yeah
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:05.200]   Yeah
[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:08.320]   The problem is these aren't safe and they they're all sorts of
[01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:11.760]   Issues, but that's you know, that's part of the fun of it
[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:16.480]   Google's AI is also doing your writing for you. They invited a bunch of uh
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:19.360]   Watch it Google
[01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:23.520]   Watch our writers and try wordcraft a quote magic
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:28.160]   Text editor. This is the uh the article from the verge
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:31.920]   Um, I have to say i'm not victoria song
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:36.320]   Gave us some examples. I was very underwhelmed
[01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:42.160]   Um, I started by giving wordcraft the prompt penguins swimming
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:47.760]   It then generated a few different story ideas might be good there like if you're blocked
[01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:52.160]   And because I love baby animals. I went with a mother penguin sitting on her eggs
[01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:56.240]   From there. I could tell wordcraft to either continue the story
[01:59:56.240 --> 02:00:00.800]   Add another prompt or talk to a chatbot for more ideas
[02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:05.200]   I opted to highlight the eggs and had wordcraft offer more description
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:11.200]   The results were all sorts of surreal one described the eggs as having a leathery texture
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:15.840]   But I went with the option where they were the size of grapefruits and covered in downy feathers
[02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:19.280]   Never mind the fact that eggs covered in feathers aren't really a thing
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:25.280]   At one point I did have wordcraft short and a lengthy continuation of a single sentence
[02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:28.720]   As well as have the chatbot generate some conflict
[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:31.920]   Hence the seal eating mama penguins babies
[02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:38.160]   The mother penguin tries to fight back, but it's no match for the seals sharp teeth
[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:42.080]   The baby eggs are eaten the mother peg penguin cries out in grief
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:46.560]   She hears a loud splash and looks up her baby has been I thought you ate the baby
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:48.960]   Her baby's been thrown into the water by the seal
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:51.520]   The baby is struggling to stay afloat in the cold ocean
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:54.160]   The mother penguin dies into the water
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:56.960]   She grabs her baby and their beacons swims to shore
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:00.880]   She wraps her wings around the baby and huddles next to it. Oh, this is so dorky
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:06.480]   Well, I mean it's impressive that a computer wrote it right but yes, it is. Yes. It's not great writing
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:08.480]   No
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:12.560]   As you can see from the final product patoria says the writing is fairly basic
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:18.000]   There are also a lot of things that contradict the baby eggs are eaten, but then a baby is floating in the ocean and rescued
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.640]   Despite the fact that they were actually hatched
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:23.520]   Anyway, uh
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:27.680]   I think you're safe you writers for a little bit longer
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:34.880]   You have do you have the same so maybe that's like James choice
[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:42.640]   Oh, could you know actually that would be interesting if there were a prompt to say write a right about baby penguins a la james choice
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:45.920]   That was fit right in then we'd have something
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:51.920]   Yes, the mother penguin said yes. Yes. I want to have a baby. I'm gonna jump in the ocean. Yes. She said
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:56.800]   Google is discontinuing sport support for the standalone street view app
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:01.360]   Pulling it from app stores and another one of the google graveyard
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.280]   Sure
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:10.080]   Uh, you still have street view and maps, so I guess you don't need a dedicated street view app. All right, makes sense. Yeah
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:13.040]   But you know
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:15.040]   Uh google one for android
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:20.400]   This is about as minor a thing effect. I think I had this last week and decided not to do it
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:25.680]   Google one for android gets a slick home screen redesign. Yeah. Yeah, I hope I
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:27.680]   whoo
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:30.640]   Whoo, this shows
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:33.760]   how hard it is
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:39.360]   For nine to five google to find something to get excited about and for leo to find something for the changelog
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:45.840]   Google this is new and exciting google expands its flood and wildfire tracking
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:49.200]   Just as climate change isn't real
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:51.600]   um
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:55.360]   So uh, it's it's a they launched a tool called flood hub
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:03:00.560]   Which patches together forecasting across 20 countries. It's also rolling out
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:05.280]   improved wildfire tracking after piloting the program in the us
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:14.160]   So apparently according to the nine nations half the world lacks adequate early warning systems for disasters like flood and fire
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:16.400]   So this will be a big thing
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:18.800]   Expanding our machine mobile phones
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:22.960]   Yeah, where or if your friend has it you know everybody run
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:26.480]   expanding our ml based flood forecasting
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:33.840]   Oh, it's I guess the green dots are where you could expect uh flooding. So that's a that's good. That's useful
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:37.200]   So that's the flood hub
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:42.000]   Uh, yeah probably less useful in the us
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:46.000]   Google has added
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.600]   Well, we have floods and wildfires here, but I think we know exactly we kind of know
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:52.080]   Google revamps assistance
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:55.120]   Its assistance parental controls adds a kids dictionary

[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:53.040]   that are slower
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:55.040]   more expressive

[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:26.800]   And grab this drag on
[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:29.440]   survey says
[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:32.880]   And it's just slow
[02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:35.600]   Here computers mess
[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:38.080]   I think is about the internet
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:45.360]   Let me uh, let me take a picture of uh from let let's do this. I'm going to export this
[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:48.240]   I'm going to do this
[02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:51.760]   Find a video of uh, my son's french fries
[02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:55.040]   Nice download that
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:59.120]   He's making slow mo french fries
[02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:01.840]   Look at that
[02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:03.280]   slow

[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:09.920]   He's the opposite of slow mo and his stuff
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:12.800]   All right, so I got that
[02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:16.000]   Why did he pick up one put it down and pick up another one? I'm confused
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.200]   He did it in real time. It happened a lot faster than you seeing
[02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:23.680]   Oh, crud. I can't maybe it wasn't the right. I can't upload a video. Yeah
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:31.120]   Yeah, I can't I can't do a video. So never mind. Well, mine just mine just finally returned and it says that it's
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:34.640]   University of Louisville football players. Was that correct?
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:37.600]   No, it's not it's actually my son's team
[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:41.200]   But they both were red and white so yeah
[02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:43.840]   You try yeah
[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:49.120]   All right, let's see never mind the fact that my son's team is right on the front of the jersey here
[02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:49.920]   Did I
[02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:51.920]   Did it couldn't read the text
[02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:58.240]   All right. I'm going to download uh, these these flowers. I don't I what kind of what kind of flowers are those?
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:03.680]   I'm wondering it's boogin vie right there. Don't tell it. I'll tell you what this is no hints
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:07.680]   Let's see. Let's see if google can figure out
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:10.000]   What it is
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000]   It says it's geranium ivy
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.760]   Oh, is that correct? I didn't know if it was boogin vie
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:18.720]   No, I know I don't know if that well like does look off the clothes
[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:20.880]   Oh, you lot of examples there that look like a label
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:23.440]   That looks like it. I thought this works amazingly
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:28.400]   And by the way, it sends me to burpee to come to buy some seeds
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:30.320]   By the seeds right?
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:32.320]   Yeah, so that's cool
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:37.360]   So, you know what that's a cool feature. So I take a picture of something not only do I know what it is
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:41.760]   But I can now buy some seeds if I want to this is the long-awaited feature
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:44.880]   You're gonna watch a tv show and you won you want the outfit you click on it
[02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:49.200]   Everybody thought smart tv was going to be over the years here. Yeah, it's here
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:53.600]   I used to have that for plants. I have something called plant net that does it only for plants
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:56.240]   Yeah, yeah, I have that as well and I have it for birds
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:59.280]   And for uh variety of stuff, right?
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:03.760]   But it's cool that it's right there in google now. So that that worked really well. I figured out what it was
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:06.800]   And my plant net
[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:08.800]   My plant and re-learning here
[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:12.800]   It's a calypy dark red germanium
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:17.040]   No, that's not a germanium
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:20.720]   Like god have I been saying that wrong?
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:22.720]   Okay
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:29.120]   Only if you're talking about the table of elements google play android games now available on your pc

[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.680]   So that's interesting you need windows 10
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:50.000]   We got that you need windows 10
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:53.040]   um
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:56.080]   Microsoft oh, this is interesting
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:02.960]   Oh, no, yes, so microsoft which has added android appster windows 11 did it with the amazon app store, which is
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:10.400]   Uh, but google has its own separate app to bring google play games to the pc. So they said home on bayer

[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:38.160]   Uh the great courses that's cool
[02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:43.520]   Prime time channels will not get preferential treatment and recommendations are search results
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:48.160]   But did they mention a price point there
[02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:51.520]   No, because all of the streaming services are
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:57.920]   Pretty much added those are yeah having those is add-ons, you know five dollars here 10 dollars there
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:02.320]   If you go to youtube and the movie and shows selection pick a movie. What would you like to?

[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:22.160]   Gets fed up with his recruits and says i'm going to show you
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:23.440]   How to do this

[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:42.960]   They said we got the shot. He said god. Thank god. I'm never doing that again
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:49.680]   That was awesome though. It wasn't quite a way that goose's son sort of reminds me of salt hank in this movie
[02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:52.160]   Well, that's good because i remind you goose right?
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:55.600]   No, no
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:12:01.040]   There he looked a lot like goose didn't it's because he had that mustache that just a mustache

[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:15.280]   That is true you're right

[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:07.360]   So anybody who's a giant nerd like me and then we'll talk about tractors because that's also cool
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:11.040]   We talked about this in the show and I want to know how this would work. I'm so glad you did this. Oh
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:16.560]   They bought their own spectrum in 2020 at the cbrs auction
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:23.040]   So and then they called a cellular equipment company probably eric center nucchia
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:29.360]   They won't tell me which and they said hey, we've got spectrum. We want to build our own private 5g network inside of our
[02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:33.280]   Factrix which covers like four million square feet. Okay
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:36.080]   So and then
[02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:41.440]   They did it with an lte so it's not 5g yet because it's not out the end equipment isn't there
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:44.320]   Okay, so
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:46.480]   Now they own their spectrum
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:53.680]   They built their own network. They hired like 20% more people in their Wi-Fi and it division basically
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:57.840]   They're wireless it division and they were like go learn about cellular networking and they did
[02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:03.040]   And they're running it just like they're at and t or somebody like that except it's only in the smaller network in that one area
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:05.360]   so pretty awesome
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:10.400]   Very cool. They're expecting to run like thousands of sensors on it
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:15.680]   Um, they wouldn't let me take pictures except for these two things. So I didn't get to cool factory stuff
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:18.400]   So this thing on this bar here's a micro cell
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:22.720]   That is an lte micro cell and they've got 14
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:25.840]   That's all replaces 100 Wi-Fi access
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:32.160]   And they can throw way more sensors on it. They also have much better latency
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:38.720]   Apparently Wi-Fi one factors are really terrible for Wi-Fi because there's big metal devices running around
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:44.320]   But also he was like when our employees would start their microwave during lunch hours
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:48.320]   Our Wi-Fi network would go crazy. Oh, and I was like, oh, but that's not it
[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:51.120]   So
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:52.560]   I was like, okay
[02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:58.720]   Um, so there's a lot of interference now they can control that and it's pretty awesome and they're gonna upgrade it to
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:00.640]   5g
[02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:05.200]   Um in june the 3gpp which is the governing body for the 5g standard
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:10.160]   They released something called release 17 and basically it has a lot of things associated with latency
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:15.680]   It has a device location associated with it. So all the factory deployments are going to start happening
[02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:20.800]   Now that that's out in the world and people are starting to make end devices because right now
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:24.000]   Like in their test labs. They've got like dongle
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:29.360]   It's like dongle nation because they can only get the 5g for like dongles just shoved into everything
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:31.920]   So annoying it's like a backbook
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:33.280]   Uh
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:35.280]   Okay, so that's the 5g story
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:40.640]   3 million square foot factories served by 14 lte micro cells
[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:43.520]   I wonder if they plan to put those out in farms
[02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:46.160]   in farm fields at some point like become a
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:53.120]   Specialized 5g network for farm equipment. That's it. They can't because they only bought five
[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:59.680]   The way they only bought spectrum in five geographic areas the five counties that they operated
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:04.400]   So they do have it outdoors. They have a test track outside of that factory and they will put it there
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:05.920]   but
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:08.640]   Well, actually you don't have to create your own. I guess you could
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:13.360]   Sign up with whoever the incumbent is in that in your area and use that. Yeah
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:17.360]   Okay, so that's it now. Do you want to know the coolest thing I learned? Yes
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:19.920]   Okay
[02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:21.920]   I need y'all to understand that
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:25.760]   The factory where I go they make
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:32.480]   These machines are 50,000 pounds. Okay. They are huge. It's a combines
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:36.560]   It's called a combine because it combines like 20 something
[02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:38.480]   Operations
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:41.600]   So massive machines and we did not talk about right to repair
[02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:45.920]   I am aware and I have opinions on it and they are not favorable to jondere, but this was not a
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:48.240]   This is a factory tour
[02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:51.680]   It was not a software analysis tour and I've talked to them about right to repair
[02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:56.240]   I'm just gonna let let everybody know because I know people are like ah jondere right to repair true
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:58.480]   That's not a bad idea
[02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:00.640]   okay, but
[02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:06.560]   The factory tour starts they have these giant shelves and on them are just sheets of metal
[02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:13.440]   Just sheets of metal and the first step is these robots pull off this thing into a cnc kind of
[02:20:13.440 --> 02:20:18.480]   It's a laser cutting machine actually and they just cut like every freaking part
[02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:23.600]   There are did I say my story how many parts there were? I don't remember. Yeah, that's what tesla does too
[02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:27.520]   They bend their own metal. Yeah, it's like they cut their own 18,000 pieces
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:31.680]   And at the end you get this tractor that is
[02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:38.800]   Enormous like I come up halfway to the wheel on this thing. I mean, I know it's amazing. It's ridiculous and then
[02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:42.320]   And then
[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:45.040]   They they have in the factory so they're building it all together
[02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:47.200]   It goes through all these many millions of square feet
[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:53.920]   And then they have a gantry that runs up the top and they pull the tractor along a gantry over your heads when it gets done
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:56.480]   so then
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:20:58.480]   You know how they paint it green
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:02.720]   How they have 11 olympic size swimming pools
[02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:08.400]   Nine of them are filled with water and they just dip dip
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:14.880]   What they dip the thing in the parts or the whole no they just dip the ball whole
[02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:17.040]   The whole of the tractor
[02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:21.760]   Wow like all the green bits and then they come and spray paint like it's not every
[02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:26.480]   But it's a massive theater house that things massaging seats
[02:21:26.480 --> 02:21:33.280]   Oh, yeah, well, we have people who are podcasts in these giant combines. Yeah, yeah
[02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:38.080]   They're they're from 15 hours a day when they're harvesting exactly they drive themselves
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:42.240]   And john dear built their own factory operation software
[02:21:42.240 --> 02:21:46.560]   Which if you're in industrial like instead of buying something from like seaman's or
[02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:51.840]   Schneider or rockwell or anybody they built their own they just do everything
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:53.520]   So
[02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:55.520]   It's pretty cool
[02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:59.600]   Okay. Yeah the buy to youtube.com slash tractor spotter
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:01.120]   For this
[02:22:01.120 --> 02:22:06.560]   Informative video. Yes. This is pretty awesome. It's pretty cool. I want I mean look at those things
[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:10.480]   That's what they make there. Yeah. Oh, I that's why I picked it. No
[02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:17.280]   That's cool. So that's not even the biggest comment they make. I mean they make bigger even bigger ones. It's kind of amazing
[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:21.680]   And they dip it and I mean that's hysterical. Yes, crazy
[02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:28.480]   Yeah, they're big and then they have they do have a spray like for other parts and spray and chumly did point out that they don't dip the whole tractor
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:33.680]   It's a big body, but it's a lot like obviously the shires are not yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:36.960]   Look, it's got tractor. It's got a tank tread
[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:41.600]   That's amazing. Oh, yeah. Yeah, these things are awesome
[02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:46.720]   I don't know watch more of this youtube channel by the way. It's all tracked. Yes, that's
[02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:52.640]   Tractor spot net into show notes. It's kind of amazing
[02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:57.680]   Everything you could ever want is in a is on a youtube channel
[02:22:57.680 --> 02:23:00.160]   And I'll I do search for that model and
[02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:06.080]   There you have it in air. Yes, eric duckman saying go to other factories. They do this. I do
[02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:11.360]   I love going on factory tours like every time I go someplace everyone's like look you want to see my data center and I'm like no
[02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:14.080]   Show me where you make stuff. It's so much better. Yeah
[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:18.640]   Uh, thank you stacey for that report direct from michigan
[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:22.320]   No, sorry moline moline
[02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:25.360]   Moline
[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:31.760]   And you were I thought it was an Iowa. It's all cry I was across the river. I didn't know the I used to be an iowa
[02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:33.200]   lean airport
[02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:37.040]   Well, the design wait, I thought you grew up in new jersey on the tomato
[02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:42.400]   I went to four elementary schools in three states and four high schools in three states
[02:23:42.400 --> 02:23:47.200]   So you didn't my father got out of the military so we wouldn't move but he was in sales. So we moved
[02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:49.200]   Oh, it's illinois
[02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:53.680]   Yeah moline illinois. I thought it was saying jeez. Okay. Thank you
[02:23:53.680 --> 02:23:56.400]   You know
[02:23:56.400 --> 02:24:00.640]   You said you were in vietam. It's actually a problem with you. She's the heartland left
[02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:06.640]   Yeah, exactly again. It's journalists. It's all flyover states to you is it? Yeah, yeah, it's all the same
[02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:13.920]   Originally, I thought it was in Iowa because it's across the river from Iowa. I was talking to a friend of mine and I was in he was
[02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:18.080]   He was from moline and I was like, yeah, I
[02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:22.960]   I'm going to moline, but I've never been to I've never been to that state. So it's really cool
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:29.200]   He's like you've never been to chicago and i'm like, oh wait. It's in it's in illinois same state. Yeah. Yeah, bless you
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:31.040]   You never know
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:34.000]   Was dan with you the podcaster was he there?
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:37.440]   Oh, oh dan my secret my
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:42.800]   She mentioned that I podcast with yes, and and she disclosed in this article jondere did play for your hotel room
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:44.800]   I was a nice hotel room anyway
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:47.600]   It was I paid for my because I was I was
[02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:54.880]   You did your flights. Yeah, I did my flights and everything else my car, but they just appropriate to disclose. They're like, yeah, right?
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:59.520]   Right. And if we thought you were you sold out as that cheap
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:01.520]   I mean come on and we know you're not we got
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:06.960]   They did give me a hat and a thing of kettle corn and the kettle corn was delicious. I'll take the kettle corn
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:09.280]   How big was that?
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:14.400]   The hats actually one of the hat I got at ces like three years ago, but
[02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:17.040]   I have a jondere green hat
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:19.840]   We have a I have one of those two we have a friend of the family
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:24.480]   Sean who comes over to a family events driving his tractor
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:32.480]   And uh, it's like the upstate of south khaki like it's kind of like khaki
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:37.680]   I have uh, I have some pictures of lisa in the in the kaboda
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:42.240]   There she is. There she gone. There she gone. There we go in her kab
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:46.320]   Yeah, that's shawn's tractor. He drives that too. Uh, anytime he's going anywhere
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:48.720]   And that's the one wonderful thing about petaluma
[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:54.640]   Is uh, you can get stuck on a road driving five miles an hour behind a giant tractor and it's that's way
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:26:02.720]   Is he actually far more is this a a a a conceit? Is it a pretentious vehicle that he owns? Yes. Yeah. No, I think he uses it
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:08.320]   I think for what you think he does for beer runs beer runs
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:17.680]   Hey, why talk about a new sponsor somebody I've used for years and years and years as true bill
[02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:21.840]   Uh, true bill is now rocket money and it's even
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:28.400]   Better now we all have subscriptions like many many subscriptions in our lives, right?
[02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:33.520]   And the problem with these subscriptions they renew automatically every month and it starts to add up
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:36.320]   rocket money
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:39.440]   Makes it easy for you to find subscriptions
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:42.160]   And cancel them
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:45.600]   80 percent of people have subscriptions that just completely forgot about
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:51.200]   Maybe it's an unused amazon prime account or a hulu account that never gets streamed or you know
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:55.200]   And the thing is if you can get a list of those and see it's very easy to say. Well, no
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:57.840]   I don't want to pay for that anymore
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:27:05.200]   This app is the way to find out what you're paying for track all your expenses
[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:10.560]   And cancel subscriptions you don't use I don't know how much money over the years
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:15.120]   I've been using this that it saved me hundreds and hundreds of dollars a month
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:21.920]   Rocket money that now if you've used true bill in fact I had true bill on my phone and turned into rock money
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:26.160]   You'll have to do that automatically, but if you never used it get it. It's fantastic
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:33.360]   First thing you're going to do is install this ios or android and see that you'll hook it up to your check accounts your various accounts
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:36.640]   It uses plaid to do that so you know, it's absolutely secure
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:43.120]   And then it will as you as time goes by and it sees those subscriptions come in it will add them to a list
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:48.800]   And you can get rid of them when when they pull americans they ask people how
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:55.040]   What do you think you're spending on subscriptions? The average number of people say is 80 dollars a month 80 dollars a month and
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:59.840]   The truth is it's closer to 200 dollars or more
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:05.680]   People don't know that's the problem and that's they know that the people do the subscriptions they know that
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:09.760]   You could be wasting hundreds of dollars a month on subscriptions you forgot

[02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:36.320]   Yeah, thank you rocket money. Yeah, thank you. They're really great
[02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:40.880]   Um, it's I think it's the same. Yeah, it's the same people to do rocket mortgage. Yeah
[02:31:40.880 --> 02:31:46.480]   So I guess rocket mortgage acquired to bill and now uh now they're rocket money
[02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:49.440]   Love it. Good job
[02:31:49.440 --> 02:31:53.040]   We we've always loved rocket mortgage great company
[02:31:53.040 --> 02:31:55.680]   All right now. I think we should wrap it up
[02:31:55.680 --> 02:32:00.240]   With stacy's pick of the week. I've been waiting for this review
[02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:03.840]   Yes, so and I didn't do this one
[02:32:03.840 --> 02:32:09.280]   Kevin did it. Um, but I trust Kevin. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah
[02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:13.840]   Just in case um he reviewed the google
[02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:18.960]   Nest yphi 6e. I always want to add like
[02:32:18.960 --> 02:32:25.280]   This is the latest one. This is the glossy tick-tack. I believe yes. Um, I think we talked about it. Oh, yeah, there's a glassy
[02:32:25.280 --> 02:32:27.360]   There it is
[02:32:27.360 --> 02:32:29.360]   Um next to his ear. Oh
[02:32:29.360 --> 02:32:33.440]   And a wise base station. So he's got three different products
[02:32:33.440 --> 02:32:36.880]   Comparable products to review. So that's cool
[02:32:36.880 --> 02:32:42.960]   Well, the wise base station is probably probably. Oh, that's not Wi-Fi. That's uh, that's for his wise stuff. Yeah. Yeah, okay
[02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:51.680]   Yeah, um, but so his his to sum up Kevin who is a very generous reviewer like kevin's feels like
[02:32:51.680 --> 02:32:56.960]   The pro there's probably a market for this product somewhere would probably be kevin's summary of
[02:32:56.960 --> 02:32:59.920]   his reviewing thesis. So
[02:32:59.920 --> 02:33:06.320]   It didn't he compared it to the ear oh sixes that he was running and he didn't see any significant
[02:33:06.320 --> 02:33:09.120]   Speed boost which you would expect because six e
[02:33:09.120 --> 02:33:11.920]   Is a third
[02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:18.000]   chunk of airwaves that the FCC has allocated for Wi-Fi. It's fairly new they launched it in 2020
[02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:22.240]   He will wait a minute. He says he does have two devices that support six e
[02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:25.200]   And those are 15 20 percent faster
[02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:29.280]   Yes, yeah, so he did see modest speed boost on those but
[02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:36.160]   Most people don't have those devices yet. Yes unless you have a six-e compatible device. You won't see anything. Yeah
[02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:43.120]   You won't see well you'll see the wireless LAN does use six e between those devices. So the back call between your
[02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:45.200]   routers will be
[02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:49.760]   Faster, but that's kind of negligible neither here or there most people don't care
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:54.880]   He did so he didn't see big improvements on the six Wi-Fi six
[02:33:54.880 --> 02:33:58.800]   But if you were on Wi-Fi five, which is what google's last Wi-Fi product was
[02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:03.040]   You should upgrade because you're going to see speed improvements there
[02:34:03.040 --> 02:34:06.000]   and
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.400]   From a smart home perspective, which is what we care about
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:14.960]   No change because there's not going to be six e smart home devices for a considerable amount of time like
[02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:18.240]   five years
[02:34:18.240 --> 02:34:20.960]   Because they don't they don't need it
[02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:22.560]   And
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:25.280]   Yeah, what else do you want to know? Oh, oh, this is the best part
[02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:29.200]   There are Google is putting in a lot of subscription stuff
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:37.680]   Sorry, Google is putting a lot of features that in other programs are subscriptions such as like parental monitoring and down like
[02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:40.240]   Downtime or shutting off your kids wireless
[02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:45.280]   Um, I believe some security features are also going to be part of that
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:53.440]   Some of these features I know that you like I would pay like $99 now for an irro subscription for a year
[02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:55.840]   Right. That's for euro pro right right
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:35:05.120]   Yeah, and irro got rid of their cheaper one. So now that's your only option is euro pro six or euro pro. Sorry. Yeah, okay
[02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:13.200]   Um, no, it's called a plus how is it as a home automation router because that's part of it. It's got thread, right?
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:20.160]   Well, he couldn't test thread thread is not he there's no thread. It's not appearing on his he has a
[02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:25.680]   He has several thread networks in his house and he looks at them through the evap because I have a lovely
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:31.360]   Cheat sheet there and none of that is happening for him yet. So it's not a home automation hub
[02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:34.640]   It's not even a border router yet
[02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:37.120]   um
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:39.200]   So so yeah, so
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:41.760]   These are it for the price
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:44.000]   They're pretty good
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:45.200]   and
[02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:49.600]   I you know, I'm just they have are nice. I had the I bought the original google mesh
[02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:52.880]   Ranners and was very underwhelmed with them at the time
[02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:57.040]   Uh compared to your were you just basic it off speed euro. Yes, this thing is
[02:35:57.040 --> 02:35:59.680]   Uh reliability qos
[02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:05.680]   But I tell you it's hard to review wifi god bless kevin. It's a very hard thing to review
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:13.840]   Uh, but just empirically and putting it I installed it for my daughter a few few family members and stuff and was underwhelmed euro was much better
[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:18.000]   Orby better still for speed but euro had better features
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.880]   um, so google
[02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:25.280]   I'm not surprised to hear this isn't like I thought maybe it would be hey, this is their new pro
[02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:27.520]   but
[02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:30.080]   I'm kind of underwhelmed. It sounds like kevin was as well
[02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:35.040]   Yeah, I would say I mean look for normal people
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:42.560]   It would probably be fine, especially if you're coming up like I have family members who are still running like wifi for right and
[02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:45.520]   You know at the price point
[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:47.600]   This is really good
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:54.000]   Um kevin's network or his home layout makes it so he's he needed all three of them
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:59.680]   Yeah, even though his square footage is not so he paid 400 bucks for the three pack
[02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:02.080]   Yeah
[02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:04.480]   But like my let's see what were my euro?
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:09.520]   Pro six euros are more expensive a three pack of euro. I think is more than 300
[02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:13.120]   I'm sorry 400. He spent 400 pardon me
[02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:18.240]   Yeah, so the euro's pro six e which would be the comparable one
[02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:24.160]   A three pack well, they're on sale now, but they were selling for 699. They're on sale right now for 419
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:27.920]   Okay, so that it's pretty close in price 20 bucks more. Yeah
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:32.400]   All right, you're right the Orby's are faster
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:38.800]   You tend to see from the trit the more traditional vendors. I tend to they're still competing on
[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:42.480]   speeds, but I will say you know, I have a gigabit network
[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:48.480]   I don't like I don't need my stuff to be super fast
[02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:50.400]   um
[02:37:50.400 --> 02:37:52.240]   like
[02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:59.280]   Other than my television like most of my devices on my home the late latency matters more to me than capacity
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:03.600]   That's right. And that's what these all of these mesh routers, especially the euro are designed to do is to
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:06.880]   prioritize the the devices that need
[02:38:07.920 --> 02:38:14.000]   Consistent throughput and low latency and you know and and and understand that and that's one of the reasons you pay for that
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:19.920]   What is it's the euro security? What do they call it now the top of it's secure plus is the subscription
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:23.520]   But that's why you pay for that because it's doing a lot of uh intelligent
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:28.240]   You can do prioritization for free without a subscription on the google Wi-Fi
[02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:35.120]   Okay, which is nice. Yeah in kevin with kevin prioritized. I don't know something nice, but you have to do that manually
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:38.960]   Uh, you could you have to go to the app to do it
[02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:42.960]   But you could just always prioritize like your work computer if you want it
[02:38:42.960 --> 02:38:49.440]   Probably your own it'll notice what's going on the problem people have with that is it's sending information back to amazon
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:54.320]   All the time about your slices what how you're using them what you're doing and so there's issues
[02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:56.800]   So google and kevin writes about that which
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:01.600]   You know, I make him do because we talk so much about this in consent is
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:07.040]   If you to get some of these features like the family features and device prioritization
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:12.560]   You do have to share your network data with google because that's how it's going to
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:16.880]   Figure out what to prioritize. So you have to use their nest Wi-Fi cloud service
[02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:24.000]   There you go and that is on by default. So if you don't want to share that you need to turn that off manually, but you'll probably lose some features
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:29.120]   Um, yes, but if you don't care about those feet like if you don't have kids or right
[02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:32.160]   mr. Jeff, thank you stacey
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:37.200]   So good to have you back. Thank you. Mr. Jeff jar is indeed. What's your number?
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:42.080]   I want to mention a few things real quick jack door. See held on to his stock and sort of
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:47.840]   Sort of he because it's not twitter stock anymore, right? He had a billion dollars in twitter over
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:51.280]   So what he did is he rolled it over a billion dollars now
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:53.440]   Oops
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:56.160]   I would have taken the cash 18 million shares
[02:39:56.160 --> 02:39:58.800]   18 million times 54 20
[02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:01.600]   That's a lot of money
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:05.440]   It's a billion bucks. He's saved. He saved Elon having to pay him a billion bucks. That was one mention
[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:09.440]   That's his in a way. That's him saying I believe in what he learns about to do
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:15.040]   And I think my that's this will be worth more because i'm keep this i'm keeping my chips on the table
[02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:16.880]   Yep
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:22.400]   Mastodon we talked about an awful lot mastodon has a patreon their ad the server is on its volunteers
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:28.320]   It's it's folks. They're hiring people. So if you go to patreon.com/mastodon i'm about to do the $10 a month
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:31.920]   Let me be clear about this though. You're supporting Eugene
[02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:34.800]   Eugene's and
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:39.280]   You're not supporting your necessarily your instance every instance may also have its own
[02:40:39.280 --> 02:40:43.440]   We don't ask for any money on twitter. That's social, but many other servers
[02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:49.520]   Need your supporters now more than ever have this idea before I asked you yes, okay now more than ever because
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:53.680]   Suddenly there goes an onslaught you had a number earlier that what was it?
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:58.320]   70,000 Eugene had 70,000 in one day new users
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:02.240]   So you can imagine didn't we haven't been crushed on our server
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:06.240]   But you can imagine some of these big servers like mastodon social which is I think Eugene's
[02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:09.280]   Yes, everybody
[02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:11.280]   So this patreon is for
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:13.760]   the software
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:18.880]   For Eugene not for Eugene, which I want to support Eugene. Yeah, I love that Eugene on the show by the way
[02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:21.440]   Okay, well try to get him. All right, so then
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:24.560]   So then the thing I wanted to show you today
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:26.720]   I just came across
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:32.320]   Ant I was in mastodon. I was doing twitter during the show. I was doing mastodon. Oh, I like you. Thank you
[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:35.600]   And peter rojas peter rojas
[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:38.960]   Great thing called infinite conversation
[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:42.160]   Yeah, this is an ai experiment
[02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:46.560]   finding an ai version of Werner Herzog
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:49.520]   and the philosopher schlavejicke
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:53.760]   Having a conversation with voices if you would go there
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:59.760]   See this is why I think your mastodon is better than mine. I have a snake writing a bicycle on my
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:03.600]   my mastodon I
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:05.600]   Feel like your
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:12.240]   It's better than I'm gonna follow how do I follow the people you're following? That's who can go to me is you I follow
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:17.280]   Yes, I can I might do that. All right. Let me find that link. All right. So go to infinite. It's right there. So it's in the um
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:23.840]   The runout infinite conversation.com just just just just before a minute or so. It's too much fun. What is this?
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:26.560]   So this is this is a ai
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:32.400]   It's an ai pretending to be Werner Herzog and schlavejicke speaking of entertaining
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:39.920]   Have you seen any good movie lately? That's Werner. No, I haven't been to the cinema in a very long time
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:43.280]   Maybe that's yes. I saw one filmed by a friend of mine
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:47.840]   He's a well-known hamnerium filmmaker for instro person
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:50.720]   He made a lot more about friends were full
[02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:53.920]   I watch a lot of american cinema
[02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:59.920]   Who is who this is that you can enjoy cinema even without its ideological the second guy was burning
[02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:03.280]   The car change he has a deeper voice. Oh good
[02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:05.440]   But it sounds like a great scene
[02:43:05.440 --> 02:43:11.200]   I have seen the wild punch on video and there are some very beautiful scenes in it
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:15.440]   But how do you react to the dominance of collie with movies?
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:18.160]   Do you think it's on the way in or no?
[02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:23.760]   No, I think it will always dominate my god. This is like my dinner with andrea recreated
[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:29.280]   I love it. I absolutely love it. It's all made up. I would love to see them watching
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:34.320]   I don't know if the other both alive right or what I'd love is both watching this and it'd be just hilarious
[02:43:34.320 --> 02:43:40.160]   I feel like that might be the most elitist thing i've ever seen it is it is great
[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:43.360]   Somebody if you really wanted to go down market could do leo and jeff
[02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:47.040]   exactly, I think that would be I want it how can we
[02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:51.840]   So we want this I mean you may never have to make a show again
[02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:56.480]   It's not a democracy more apparent
[02:43:56.480 --> 02:43:59.200]   Yeah
[02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:04.000]   And I had to sit through the two of that y'all doing that I think it would be like our version of hell
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.560]   Yeah, the reaction shots to you shouldn't be worth it
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:12.560]   Our holiday films still our dreams or do we have different dreams nowadays?
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:20.560]   Of course if you have a billion doors and confidence new digital technologies then through special effects
[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:23.600]   You have so many ways to make films that are interesting
[02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:29.680]   I don't think so of course. I it is a strange but fascinating
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:36.080]   Absolutely. Yes. It's much better if you fast forward. I might add it is it is it is
[02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:42.720]   It's hilarious. That's how I run the show. I you get one sentence and i'm cutting you off
[02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:49.440]   Nobody ever called me a
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:52.160]   Good listener
[02:44:52.160 --> 02:44:59.120]   Anything else that's good those are nuts. I love this infinite conversation. Thank you. That was great. That was great that came out of um
[02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:06.160]   My dinner with andre has a 92 percent on rotten tomatoes. Oh, yeah, it's one of the crazed movies ever
[02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:08.160]   Yeah, it is
[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:10.320]   You don't like my dinner with andre?
[02:45:10.320 --> 02:45:15.040]   Okay, to be fair. I did first see it in my english class. Oh, right?
[02:45:15.040 --> 02:45:18.320]   It's like 16 and I was like right I want to die
[02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:22.080]   What did you do to that teacher to make the teacher show you that that age? Yes
[02:45:22.080 --> 02:45:25.360]   We should also mention by the way
[02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:28.000]   So you think everything in the world's going behind a paywall
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000]   and and and
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:33.040]   Business insider got bought by actual sprigger in germany
[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:37.600]   Which believes like burdock religiously and paywalls and they put a paywalls all over. I can't go in that
[02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:42.560]   I can't go in business insider anymore. I guess what what they're moving half of it back outside paywall
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:49.120]   You know why I stopped doing stories from business insider because I can't it's such a strict paywall
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:53.040]   You don't get one article. You don't get anything. You don't get a quarter of the article you get nothing
[02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:56.400]   And it's frustrating as heck I stopped going to that site
[02:45:56.400 --> 02:45:59.920]   Too late actual. Yeah, is axilla person
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:05.280]   Axel was a person. Yes. He was he was a conservative who built his headquarters
[02:46:05.280 --> 02:46:08.320]   Ass on to the burly wall to say yeah
[02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:11.040]   To the communist. Oh, that's hysterical
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:14.240]   And prueh your thing you're fine
[02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:21.520]   Uh my thing the week pick of the weeks the folks had wack them announced a news uh centic pro
[02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:24.400]   27 27 inches
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:29.040]   This is uh something definitely for the illustrators and designers out there
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:35.120]   Um, I wouldn't necessarily need it for uh photo editing, but I do like using a centic
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:40.960]   It lets you draw directly on the thing. So your monitor is also a trackpad. So
[02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:47.760]   Ah, oh, that's cool smaller bezels on it. So it's it has a smaller footprint than the previous models
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:54.320]   And of course they give you more um points of pressure with the stylus and so forth hdr screen
[02:46:54.800 --> 02:46:59.760]   It's it's it's freaking beautiful. Is this better though than something like the microsoft studio
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:02.800]   Uh or I mean so many
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:05.120]   This dude is now I
[02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:10.880]   That I was using that you used to have it was nice, but it was nowhere near it wasn't as good as a centic
[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:13.920]   It was nowhere near as a responsivism as a wackum. Okay
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:19.600]   Well a lot of mues wackum digitizers, but I think probably wackum saves the best stuff for their own
[02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:23.920]   Yeah, they put the secret sauce in for theirs. Yeah, santique is the state of the art
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:25.920]   It's only 3500 dollars yet
[02:47:25.920 --> 02:47:31.280]   3500 and and I will say this I've actually reviewed another
[02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:34.480]   Santique competitor before here on the network
[02:47:34.480 --> 02:47:40.480]   Um, so wackum they better get the work because people are starting to catch up. What does bertman Roy use?
[02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:45.520]   I know he uses wackum tablets. I bet he uses a centi it's probably a centi. Yeah, it's probably a centi
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:52.000]   The very cool mr. Bertman Roy. Oh, I love bert and my other pick is daniel Suarez
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.240]   I got a notification about this because I didn't know
[02:47:54.240 --> 02:48:01.440]   Apparently daniel Suarez has another book time to get time to call him up time to get a triangulation on here
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:07.440]   You go we've interviewed him about every pretty much every book. He's done. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, this is the sequel to delta v
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:10.640]   Oh
[02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:13.440]   We love delta v didn't we john? Yeah, I like delta v
[02:48:13.440 --> 02:48:20.880]   I like delta v demon and freedom is still my favorite. Oh, amazing books. Yeah, amazing. So this is a pre-order
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:23.040]   It's not gonna be out till january 24th
[02:48:23.040 --> 02:48:26.800]   So
[02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:30.720]   I wasn't really expecting that notification last night. What that's awesome
[02:48:30.720 --> 02:48:37.200]   And we will uh get in touch with daniel and have him on let's have him on it be you know what he could be part of that new thing
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:40.240]   We're doing uh start of the year. Oh, yeah
[02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:43.280]   Yeah, do stasis book club
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:49.520]   It could be a stasis book club too. Oh, you can do that too. Would you like to have an author on with you stacey? I think that'd be cool
[02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:55.040]   It would be cool, but it would also change like the nature. Yeah, because you wouldn't want to be down for that. Yeah
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:49:03.760]   Uh, I mean, I would still be mean because i'm gonna be mean about this this silly book that we're reading right now a long way to a strange angry boring planet
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:07.200]   I I knew this would be controversial
[02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:10.240]   Tomorrow

[02:53:08.640 --> 02:53:10.640]   Uh, what else you got it?
[02:53:10.640 --> 02:53:18.560]   What else you got for a sand oh a family bragging moment
[02:53:18.560 --> 02:53:23.840]   Oh, yeah, I just wanted to brag on my family because you know, that's what I always do here on the show
[02:53:23.840 --> 02:53:26.000]   It's part of my picks. Um
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:30.480]   A couple three weeks ago. We had a serious injury our quarterback was hurt
[02:53:30.480 --> 02:53:34.960]   And it shook us up a good bid and I my son the hard head
[02:53:35.200 --> 02:53:41.040]   He felt pretty bad and you know, he's now he's got to step in and stood back up quarterback. Well, he's the cutie now
[02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:45.280]   Yeah, oh they had to pull him off a defense to put him on offense
[02:53:45.280 --> 02:53:51.120]   And you know we took it pretty hard because it's it was his friend and you know, we all have this how serious was the injury
[02:53:51.120 --> 02:53:55.040]   We don't know if he'll be back. That's that's about honestly
[02:53:55.040 --> 02:53:57.040]   um
[02:53:57.040 --> 02:54:01.520]   So we played the first week and he did okay, but we lost and then last week
[02:54:01.920 --> 02:54:07.600]   Uh two weeks ago. I should say we played cardinonoumen at their place. Oh, this is an his tough 27 years
[02:54:07.600 --> 02:54:13.120]   This is a north bay football power cardinal newman. Yes, that's remember us talking about them last year
[02:54:13.120 --> 02:54:17.120]   Yeah, we've been last year and our place. Let's put it that way
[02:54:17.120 --> 02:54:20.080]   These are starting at our place last year. Yeah, and then
[02:54:20.080 --> 02:54:26.240]   Last week we beat them there for the first time and as hard head gone 80 yards. Oh my god
[02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:34.400]   Look at him 27 years and so he's quite proud and pumped up and then our last game last week
[02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:36.480]   But we're off he
[02:54:36.480 --> 02:54:38.480]   Over again
[02:54:38.480 --> 02:54:40.480]   Yeah, four touchdowns last week
[02:54:40.480 --> 02:54:46.800]   179 yards rushing and the week before against cardinonoumen at 122 yards rushing and to touchdown
[02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:53.040]   Wait and go number four squad is just just you think you might play football in college
[02:54:54.240 --> 02:54:57.280]   I told him it's his best bet to be a two-sporter
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:00.960]   Do college and track because he wants to run track. He wants to be in Oregon
[02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:03.520]   You could see that 80 yard run he could run
[02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:07.680]   He wants to be an Oregon duck, but in all honesty. He doesn't have
[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:10.560]   Oregon duck sprint speed just yet
[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:15.440]   But he could still you know walk on and still play. Is that you hugging him
[02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:18.320]   Here and then press democrat
[02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:21.680]   Uh, yes, and and I want to give a shout out to the press democrat because
[02:55:22.800 --> 02:55:26.800]   Cameras are usually I guess they're always watching and they caught the two of us
[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:29.920]   That's a father who loves his son
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:32.960]   And he's strong enough to pick him up apparently
[02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:38.000]   Next thing I had to let him know look I could still toss you a little ass around if i'm
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:42.960]   Oh and i'm so happy for you
