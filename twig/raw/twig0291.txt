[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.240]   media news
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.120]   Anchors whatever we want to talk about Jeff Jarvis is here from his waterlogged office at the city in her city in New York
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:13.560]   Good to see you little tiny spot here. This is big enough for one chair sitting up against her filing cabinet with my microphone here
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.600]   Trying to act like this is normal
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.120]   TV you can do it from any crappy corner doesn't really matter where I am
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.240]   You see behind me this where they store the sodas for parties in your office now out in the hall
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.240]   they had to move all of the
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.840]   cabinets
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.840]   Away from the opposite walls to cut they cut like a foot and a half in the bottom of
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.760]   Numbers and numbers of walls around here then go up and dry it out. God knows what they've got there was a snow emergency
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.480]   it snowed
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.200]   It froze it froze in the hell hell froze
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.000]   You had it was frozen pipes is that a minute? Who's that wait a minute? What wait a minute?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.920]   What I'll close wait a minute what am I am I dreaming?
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.520]   Hey, Javu am I dreaming? Did I lose my mind? It's Gina Trappani
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.560]   Asia Gina am I back in 2014? I know
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.760]   Love you we miss you how's everything going to think up?
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.440]   Things are good. Thanks. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, we actually just launched a new insight last week
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.040]   It's I think it lets you know now when you're when your friends have changed their avatar
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.200]   So you get to you could admire high res beautiful pictures of your friends when they change up their avatar
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.120]   So that's been really fun. I asked you this before
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.160]   Is this Ruby on what is it? What is the
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.440]   This is a good question. Yeah, well, you know think up startup start off as an open source project
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.240]   So one of our requirements was like hey, somebody should be able to run this on the simplest cheapest
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.800]   You know, I'm seeing package. So it's it's PHP. So it's a lamp stack. It's a land
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.920]   It's a it's it's old school lamp stack. They ain't nothing new or fancy going on here much to my
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.920]   Shagrin, but it's old technology that works. So, you know, it feels very
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.760]   modern, I guess that's the design, right? It's the design right right yeah, but the back end is just is straight PHP
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.960]   Which you know, you know what it's easy to do. It's easy to maintain
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.880]   I'm all I'm all about the node JS and I know you're like fancy
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:20.520]   No, that's that's the right way to do it if I was building where you were building. Yeah, you choose your technology on what you're building
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.800]   That that is the right choice. I'm very proud to say though that the great team that's doing this at Fort kitchen
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.960]   So it's already contributed some of the code back to the Drupal core. So we're not
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.300]   Maybe this core, but yeah, so because we're using an open source CMS Drupal
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.040]   As the back end for the API to serve the API actually everything we're all the stuff we're using is still open source nodes open source, right?
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.320]   So
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.800]   But yeah, they did something cool. I guess I don't understand it, but they said hey, yeah, we contributed it back
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.520]   So that's nice. That's awesome. It's a good feeling. It's a great feeling
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.180]   Yeah, it's an open source software to be able to contribute back to it is great anyway, Gina said when Gina
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.200]   I don't feel so bad. Yeah, there you go, right?
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.360]   When Gina left us she said very kindly she'd come back once a month
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.560]   I mean she's got to focus on her startup and we understand that but it's really nice to have you you were at all about Android last night
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.000]   Yeah, that was a lot of fun. It's great to be here. You couldn't be completely rid of me. Yeah
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.400]   No, that's why I'm right by the way chat room said did Jason think I was talking about him when I said but that's why I always say Jason
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   Yeah, yeah, it always throws me off
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.840]   Just just to make sure that you understand the distinction. I like to think that I'm that important to the website using Jason
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.560]   Yeah, I've never been busier than I am right now
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.120]   There is a lot of Google news this week
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.160]   But I think we're gonna start with the one that Jeff Jarvis is so most excited about which is
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.160]   This happened minutes before the show began the new pixels here. Oh, I should say by the way if you're I
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.520]   Got to explain this. There's and this only matters if you're watching live
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.800]   We flip flop windows weekly and twig this today because of travel schedules Jeff. You're going to murder Madrid
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.480]   right tonight, yeah and
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.440]   And then Paul was just coming back from Colorado. So it worked out great. Everybody was happy
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.600]   But if you're tuning
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.920]   That'll be after this week in Google this week only
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.640]   Yes, anyway new pixel is here
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:24.200]   Apparently it's been seeded to people because tech crunch has a review the verge has a review Wall Street Journal has a review
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.240]   It's up on the rundown - they like it. I would have given one to Jeff Jarvis Google. I really well, yeah
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.280]   Just let me let me review it for God. Yeah, I'm the old I'm your only friend and pick and crime and pixel land
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.760]   Is it an actually mock that this comes out like like a couple of months before Google I owe
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.600]   I mean are they gonna get they're gonna give everyone do that again. Well, I don't know what
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.360]   They don't seem to repeat themselves on the things they give out they seem to be very different every year
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.680]   So you've had a cardboard wondering. Yeah, right
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.880]   It looks exactly the same, right? I mean it doesn't look any different from the pretty much exactly the same. Yeah, yeah
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:08.680]   But it's got newer processors. I presume these are the broad ones the screen comparison. Does anybody know it's the same I think
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.800]   Same screen same screen. It's 3/2 still that weird aspect ratio
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.640]   2560 by 1700 still touch so it's
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.120]   Exactly the same in those specs the color gamut is wider
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.280]   That just means that you can show more colors. It's got a different color space. It is
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.960]   Cheaper
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.440]   999 for the I5 version and then they have an LS
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:42.560]   Which does not stand for a luxury style it stands for damn or luxuries sedan
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.200]   It stands for literally Google says ludicrous speed. It's an I7
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.400]   And I can't think of any reason you'd need an I7
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.960]   for a
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.960]   Chrome OS but
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.920]   Remember this is what these are mostly used. What do they say like 85% used in by Googlers? Yeah, yeah
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.280]   So obviously this is what Googlers wanted
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:10.840]   They said I want more speed more tabs to eight gigs on the base model of RAM 16 gigs on the LS version
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.000]   But 999 for the base model 1299 for the LS yeah
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.800]   Video said 12 hours of battery life. Yeah
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.720]   Within 50 minutes you get two hours of charge value. Yeah, that's the connector
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.920]   That's the biggest thing and this is the second device. We've seen now. There have been others
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.600]   I think there's a there's an Asus out there with type C connector
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:39.680]   But the Mac book that was announced on Tuesday was the first I'd seen with a type C charger
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.800]   This is good news. I would love to see a mass move
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:49.040]   From laptop makers to the type C port for charging because then we could use one charger for everything
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:55.240]   It's Apple once you see yes, that's really so unprecedented that they finally used us. I know
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.680]   It's just for the one Mac book the new Mac book. Yeah, that's gonna be the choice way type C
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.940]   Which is a USB 3 port? It's a standard 3 actually it's a 3.1 port
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.600]   will do
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:15.320]   Not only power in and out by the way you could charge a phone from it, but it will also do data
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.440]   Just like a regular USB port and video so that is your video port
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.360]   Oh, so you can't charge and do video at the same time
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.120]   Well, no Jason go back and what's on the other side because I see two USB ports
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:35.000]   Actually three with the type C and I see an SD card, but I don't see any other video ports. So yeah, I guess it's I'm seeing it
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.020]   What's that appears to be a type C on both sides or two C's?
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:44.000]   Okay, well that's better than actually so you could do both right. Yeah, you could yeah, I love your thing
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.160]   I am I think it's good to buy just for that. I wonder if you could charge from either side
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.760]   Man, I just it's a night the pixels just a nice computer. It's really
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.320]   Beautiful I just
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.040]   Price drop is nice, but you know what get it down 800 and then talk to me like it just seems like
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:08.720]   No, it's a beautiful computer, but look at the Wall Street Journal headline. I don't think it's that far off
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.060]   She doesn't buy retail 999 for a laptop that only
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:19.000]   Surfs the web that's such a lie first of all it doesn't just
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.040]   Right, that's a headline writer that yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.640]   Like a thousand dollars is a is a place
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:36.120]   Phone what is where's the iPhone cost you it's a thousand dollars
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.040]   This is the iPhone of Chrome OS machines. This is this is the this is the
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:48.900]   Rain man computers if you want a technology cost you a thousand dollars if you want to buy it go to store
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.880]   Dot Google com it's on sale now in and the newly redesigned Google store
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.000]   whoa
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   This is pretty huh? This is pretty this is pretty right now in excess six in excess nine some Android where watches
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.080]   I thought the next player was gone isn't the next player dead yet?
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.160]   Chromecast
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160]   Nest learning thermostat
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.160]   ah
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.160]   And the Chromebook pixel alright, so let's see shop now. Can you buy it? Can you get it?
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.640]   Did you buy it? Yeah, you can buy it. Yeah, I bought it any nine
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.240]   So you really have all choices
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:30.120]   Why would you get an LS I guess why my background is because I'm that importantly? Oh, I deserve the best
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.600]   Should I should I should I buy it?
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.840]   Oh whoops, I slipped. Oh man
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.600]   I slipped
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:44.400]   Pay for I try to pay review your purchase. Oh, I see it's still oh
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.680]   Don't show that I'm not I'm off it right now
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.080]   No chances should I ship it here?
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.920]   Yeah, why not?
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:59.120]   $1,081.42 with tax you're not gonna get ludicrous speed no
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.280]   Sorry, I have to be the voice in your ear
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.520]   You to the next level to crispy
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:13.240]   Yeah, it's good that they named it that both clearly that's for the goolers. That's what they'll give you
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.320]   You are the god of the internet
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:27.720]   But really I do I do question the
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.960]   But this is just to show you can make a beautiful machine. I think this isn't oh, yeah
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.040]   Well, they really did was just update. I mean they did what I'm kind of willing to what I all longer about a real
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.320]   I think just updated the dinner. It said so they did one thing you didn't want or they didn't do one thing
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.640]   You did want I'm really unhappy about this what no LTE
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.680]   At all
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.160]   None maybe but didn't okay now, but this did this happen last time two years ago
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.800]   No, but I'm pretty sure they announced both at the same time
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:02.740]   Oh, they did they did he's a long wait for the LT it was and I waited for it and this time
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.040]   I was the LTE they gave out at I owe
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.200]   Yep
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.560]   This time no, I was always not happy that the LTE only work with Verizon
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:19.400]   I've been making kind of a point of looking at all the Chromebooks as they come out and even the low-end Chromebooks now the new Samsung Chromebook 2
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:27.400]   Acer there are a lot of really nice Chromebooks out there there are a lot less. I mean we're talking 300 bucks not
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.620]   Oh, yeah, yeah, so this is this is kind of ludicrous and
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:37.640]   Maybe I should you know, but the problem is I bought I bought the oh who wasn't not the
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.680]   It has HD screen
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.280]   So the problem is the text was just six. I know no no no no the
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:52.360]   Chromebook oh a Chromebook. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, there was a one with a touch screen 1080p touch screen that was almost impossible to use
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.600]   Because there's a tiny tiny tight. Yeah, I could you know my old eyes. I can't do it. Yeah
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.060]   Chrome it's a main the chatroom Scotland calling
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.360]   No, I'm sorry Scott in Fort Collins
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.680]   Chromebook is the answer to a problem that doesn't exist
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:13.480]   Is that is that fair? I don't know if that's go listen to your clock I
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:20.840]   Have been I have been saying you reference that's an old for Collins and we still listen to him
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.720]   I
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:28.000]   Have been saying for a while that the Chromebook really does make sense in certain environments in schools
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.840]   It makes a lot of sense not a thousand dollar one, but it makes a lot of sense for our students
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.240]   You know the journals of students who need to do video when they can stuff now
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:45.360]   But by social journalism students by entrepreneurial students. Yeah, they could use it and maybe and maybe a
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.280]   Lot of users who call the radio show for instance. I say what do you do web?
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.100]   Email web surfing. That's what they do. Well, here's the other one
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:15:01.100]   Secure it's it's you don't have I think a sale a sales force could use it. Yeah, right?
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.000]   You go out you make presentations. You're on the cloud. You're it's all you're doing and and you know
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.440]   You'd be absolutely fine for that and if you're a corporate IT. This is kind of a dream
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.740]   Because you just don't have problems with viruses and
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.000]   Support John for the very young and the very old
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   I just bought one come on knock it off I'm supporting you
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.400]   Yeah, I've completely come around since we first started talking about this and I remember getting in a little tussle with Sundar Pichai
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:39.360]   And and he really was defending it. This was early on I said I don't understand it and I stand corrected Sundar you were right
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:44.280]   This is googlers googlers because we know there are a few of you out there watching if there's gonna be an LTE
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:49.720]   Blink twice. Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, something. Yeah, do something for me
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.480]   Oh Jeff here. I'm a bit a friend of the pixel blink blink
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:59.660]   To tide you over I was fed by Jason
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:09.100]   Anyway, that's exciting that we we had you know reported the rumor actually wasn't really a rumor was confirmed by a Google executive
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:17.040]   At a meeting and in fact there it is the new the new pixels here the new pixels here the phone books in the phone books in
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.880]   It's gonna be expensive a couple of months for me
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.180]   Apple watch
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:28.820]   $17,000 which one did you buy you didn't buy the $78,000 Apple watch you first of all you can't buy them to
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.660]   April 10th, but I will be buying one of them
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:38.560]   Can you still run Linux? I mean crew Tana is still vital and around and alive
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.560]   But there's somebody in the chatroom who says he's he's a developer
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:48.840]   He uses a Chromebook all the time. He uses Linux uses Linux editors a problem the problem unless they've changed this
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.040]   The problem is you needed well at the time you need a dev mode
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:57.100]   So it's flakier, right and then you couldn't now you can reverse but you couldn't reverse at the time
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.080]   Oh, really once you went ahead you couldn't go back that was a commitment
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.240]   Yeah, and so you could rebuild with a with a stick with a USB
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.880]   You know an image right but it was a real pain in the butt
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.760]   Chrome Linux is there what is your he's in the chatroom right now? What is your suggestion?
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.500]   For doing that is just is it still crew ton?
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.600]   I guess you know it's it's a little tricky to install but you did right?
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:27.520]   I even if I can do it. I went through a few bad features, but I finally got there sticking my tongue out. Yeah, I'll apply
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:34.060]   But if you're if you're a Linux jockey, then you're gonna be able to do what I couldn't do he uses
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.060]   I want to he says crew
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.540]   to use better than
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.700]   Chrome
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.700]   Well, I don't know is does that work with the
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:47.600]   The dual boot it's not really a dual boot. It's a it's because it's the same
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.060]   kernel
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:55.300]   You just you can start up and you could you could you can go great thing is you can flip back and forth with the key
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.340]   You don't have to boot right that's what's so amazing about it. Yeah
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.700]   Making me want to do it again
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:09.060]   But I don't know what you showed me that I feel like you were in the backseat of the car on the way up to Petaluma on a
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.980]   trip
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.340]   Yeah
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:17.500]   Yeah, I you see I've gotten you slathering over in a few times
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:22.820]   So the nice thing about kroblun 2 is it supports so the pixel isn't Intel
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:28.100]   x86 most of the other Chromebooks are arm aren't they or many of them some are Adam
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.420]   There's a mix, but to kroblun 2 apparently requires Intel
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:38.300]   I said it. Okay, so I will look into this because that sounds like what I want to do with my old
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.980]   I'll do it with the old pixel
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.980]   Yeah, right yeah, I'll do that
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.780]   kroblun 2 is also dual boots says chrome Linux
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:50.780]   Repartition your drive so that would be an argument to getting the ludicrous speed friction just for the
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:56.540]   Why yeah, if you're any if you're a googler. Yeah, that's usually the Linux and that makes sense
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:01.540]   So you don't have that crouton is the one that lets you do the flip back and forth by pressing a key
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:07.480]   You cannot do that. I thought there was a form that would allow you to run a Linux window on top of chromo
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.000]   X that would be my ideal if I had a little bash shell on top of Chrome
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.100]   Can you do that maybe not?
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.620]   Sounds familiar. I thought krooton could do that now anyway. I will yeah
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.820]   I don't I mean it's been it's been a year and a half since I ran it. Yeah, I'll have to do some research
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:30.260]   The other problem was at the time I couldn't get Netflix on the machine because Netflix wouldn't operate in dev mode because it wasn't secure to Netflix definition
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.500]   So that's that's the big story numero uno
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.100]   not much more to say about it except
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:43.540]   There I why I guess is the question does Google continue to make a thousand dollar Chromebook when no one else does
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:48.540]   It's three times. Well, I mean besides googlers. Who's the who's the market for this and besides googlers and Leo
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.460]   and Jeff
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.060]   Yeah, he was not really a market Leo buys everything I
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:02.280]   Literally I literally buy everything just because we want to review it and Leo Leo was the mickey of technology
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:09.140]   Well since Google doesn't you know like seed one to me three weeks earlier and and I wouldn't want them to because then I would feel
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:15.380]   Obligated so I would have replied it you would have done it and I would I buy it anyway
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.280]   I bought my last one. I buy this one. Yeah, I
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.540]   Did not buy the last one. I should be clear. That was a Google I/O gift
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.300]   Yeah, me too. Yeah, me too
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.660]   I my when my wife left her job in San Diego
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:32.500]   She handed in her computer and her phone and I gave her the pixel and we got got got her an excess five and she's she's still there
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:37.500]   She's her it's her main computer interest. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:42.460]   Once I got the printer working that was the one thing once I got you know cloud print set up
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.740]   She's hasn't I expected her to you know come to me
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.740]   I'd be like I need to do this and I can't do it here
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:52.100]   She has it hasn't happened. It's been over a year and sometimes I see her using her computer and I'm like
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:58.860]   Oh, that's a nice machine. It is really pretty is weird. It's a three two. It's so strange to see a square screen in this day and age
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.500]   So do you guys still use your Nexus 6s?
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:07.780]   Yeah, I'm one plus one still yeah one plus one I'm six
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.780]   well
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.900]   You're in luck because apparently this Google
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:20.500]   Wireless carrier that they're about to start an MVNO that is a the weirdest thing of all may only work with the Nexus 6
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.980]   Are we we still haven't got?
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.260]   Confirmation or half-week that they're gonna do this Wall Street Journal leaked it out
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:35.660]   But I teased it at mobile world Congress. Yeah, but I don't know if we have exact confirmation of all of these details
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.220]   Yeah, he did say soon like the next few weeks
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.140]   So we're still waiting for the other shoe to drop on that that could happen anytime now
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:49.140]   But the rumor is first of all it will be an MVNO mobile virtual network operator with using both
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.620]   its T mobile and sprint and
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:22:01.660]   Wi-Fi and will seamlessly hand off from one to the other depending on which connection is better and it will be much less
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:07.020]   Expensive, I think that's the only reason that Google would want to do that is because the price would be so much better
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:14.860]   But the Wall Street Journal also says it will only work on a Nexus 6 and that I don't know if that's a technical
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.380]   That might just be to start
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:22.540]   They do say that it's not going to work on older Nexus devices. So if you have an exes five
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:27.540]   It wouldn't work with it. I you know, I don't know if that's a technical issue or not because I had a
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.460]   Republic wireless Moto
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:37.940]   I think it was a Moto G. I can't remember was a Moto of some kind from a public wireless that did that hand off from
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:45.220]   Sprint to Wi-Fi and it did it seamlessly did it beautifully. I actually tried it when I reviewed it for before you buy I started a call
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:51.020]   In the house actually what I did is I called my voicemail and I started leaving a message in the house
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:57.380]   Got in the car drove away and at no point was there any audible handoff and I just went from Wi-Fi to sprint
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:02.380]   Seamlessly and beautifully so there's a there's a piece I just put up on the rundown from Kevin Warbach
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.620]   Who's from the Wharton Business School Kevin's brilliant about the stuff he worked with the FCC
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.620]   He knows his stuff really well
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.100]   He argued that that this is the uber of wireless. Yeah
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:19.980]   That it disintermediates because because what it means is now anybody can provide wireless to the thing and back and forth
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:27.220]   It's gonna go to the hot women. No, that's not that's not what he meant. I really want to retire this like uber for
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:32.220]   I heard you moan. I just I'm so tired of
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:38.420]   Okay, but it'll be it'll be something else next month, you know, these it's this has been the light uber 4 though
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:44.060]   Has been around it's this has been sticky and persistent nothing against Kevin and I totally get what he's saying here
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.060]   But yeah, he says he doesn't like it either
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:52.620]   She also says that this is the one of the reasons they're going to use the Nexus 6 is
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:59.980]   Yeah, I know I thank you, Jason for highlighting. I hate the X of Y comparison rights were buck
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.980]   But I can't think of a better way to describe this
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:07.400]   I'm not saying I'm just saying I think it's a I think that's a fine thing to say
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.500]   I just it's specifically the uber 4 because that is been
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:16.460]   Like uber 4 is like uber for weak metaphors, but okay, all right
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:23.700]   Analogy is I guess I should say basically you are the uber for
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.140]   The uber for anti uber nice. Yes
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:32.380]   Well, let me say what he means by this and it what would he I think
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.380]   Actually, it's Timo Riley who created this
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.660]   metaphor, but he said
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:44.300]   Riley said uber is an example of the Internet of Things cars become the network devices with phones as sensors
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:50.940]   This is Tim classic Timo Riley because he kind of he's able to kind of out of the box kind of think about this stuff
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.900]   And I think that's a very interesting and apt way to put it
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.580]   so the idea is
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.220]   industry as a service
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.420]   So
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.980]   Eliminating kind of the friction the commerce friction
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.900]   and just having
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.660]   Having it be
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.700]   Kind of you just press a button the bills paid. You know, it's all magical kind of I
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:19.820]   Think this is great for Google. I think what Google wants to demonstrate is it's possible to have a good wireless carrier
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.820]   I wish they had bought that 700 megahertz
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:25.340]   Spectrum it was very expensive horizon got it
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.380]   But it would have been great to see Google really go in all in on this however
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:34.380]   That in this case they're gonna be able to sit on top of existing networks get a much better deal
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.260]   For some reason I never really understood
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:42.220]   Sprint resells its wireless service for much less you can buy sprit get sprint from
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.500]   much less expensively
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:49.900]   Than buying it from sprint directly actually think all the all the phone companies do this so
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.140]   and and this and and
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.420]   Labels this as a trial and that's why it's Nexus 6 only. I
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.380]   Don't think there's a technical reason it can't be anybody else
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:08.020]   I'm sorry. I'm talking about I'll shut up you want it
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:12.180]   Want it yep, I mean my phone won't support it my current phone won't support it
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.860]   But I'm in I'd get the phone that supported it
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:18.020]   Well, especially if it's a lot cheaper
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:23.860]   There might be issues though because you it is sprint or T mobile neither of which has a great network
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.700]   I'd love it if they had one of the biggies in there. I wonder how they fill in each other's
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.860]   You know lack of coverage. Maybe that's the idea
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.180]   Yeah, and well if it's if it's sprint
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.460]   It can fail back from
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:45.580]   4g to 3g if the 3g is still CDMA so that's the other issue sprint is is a CDMA voice carrier T-Mobile's GSM
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:51.220]   So they must be using voice over LTE for sprint which means it's probably all LTE all the time
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.660]   But I don't know about that
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:27:01.940]   But that's an issue to that's an issue too because T mobile does not help voice over LTE everywhere the other big question is how they price it because
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:06.980]   Well, it's gonna be a little bit of data. It was unlimited data - that's the that's the key
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.420]   It's got Google Scott and a little bit of data don't they?
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:15.780]   You know that could be the thing that makes me leave AT&T because the only reason I'm still on AT&T is what I wind about no LTE of my
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.020]   Chromebook
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:21.900]   Kevin Marks came in and said, you know you cry baby. Why don't he didn't say that but I inferred it
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:30.460]   Why don't you just tether and I said a because it's a pain in the butt to do that my current Chromebook just goes online and
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:34.140]   B I'm still on the grandfather AT&T plan that was doesn't love tethering
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.580]   But Chi said they are not competing on price though
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.620]   So here's the other interesting thing. This is not they're not the first company to think of this
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:49.100]   Xfinity Comcast has for a while and it's been getting heat for it remember
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:56.460]   Been taking if you're a customer you have their Wi-Fi access point been using some some of it for
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.260]   Wi-Fi access everywhere so I
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:07.340]   Everywhere in Petaluma pretty much now I have Wi-Fi because there's so many it's a Comcast neighborhood neighborhood and there's so many Comcast users with
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:12.900]   Xfinity Wi-Fi access points that I get free Wi-Fi everywhere I roam and
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:17.980]   Actually, we're box speculates it. Maybe Google's thinking about doing a deal
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:24.060]   To get access to that Wi-Fi then it would be cheap right because you'd rarely be using minutes
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.860]   Yep
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.980]   And then maybe put some balloons up
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.500]   And who knows?
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:38.780]   Loon would not be a good choice for this. I think latency would make that an unappealing choice
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:46.420]   I'm actually probably somewhat related but the latest version of Android 5.1
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:53.620]   Just pushed out a couple of days ago and one of the features of that is for Android to recognize whether a Wi-Fi signal
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:58.500]   Actually has internet access or not and if not to just bypass it all together
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.140]   So it doesn't just connect to it and then you realize you can't get anything from it
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:07.340]   So if you're hopping around all these Wi-Fi networks that actually makes a lot of I'm gonna repeat because I'm that's all I do is repeat
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.340]   Byself, I'm gonna repeat my desire from last week
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:15.940]   I want a standard that says I hear by agree to whatever stupid Wi-Fi rules you have
[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:20.740]   Just go ahead and connect me. Yes. I won't do anything bad on your network
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.660]   I don't know how I would just connect me
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:29.020]   Just get me past the blah blah sign me in
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:37.460]   And it's you wouldn't connect to one of these networks that has the sign and page where you have to agree and
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:41.660]   Because that does not that is not internet access. That's in intranet access
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:45.540]   And Gina how often do you run across a network like that? I hardly ever see those networks
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.740]   So there's got to be something else happening here that we don't realize
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.740]   I mean if you are a Comcast or a cable vision subscriber in my neck of the woods
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.820]   Yes, you can go on because but you're you're already authenticated as a customer
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:59.540]   Unless Google gonna do a deal with those with the cable companies
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.540]   I can't see that happening as a competing with them
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:07.420]   I don't see that much open Wi-Fi in the world anymore remember those days of what we call it was plotting
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.820]   What do we call it when you went to drive?
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:18.100]   What was that was that quaint look look there's Wi-Fi here isn't that cool? Yeah, you know
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.420]   The phone books in the phone books in
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.300]   Not anymore in fact
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:30.620]   The cable vision sells Wi-Fi only phones in your area. Yes, they do
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:36.460]   Okay a Wi-Fi only I guess you know that would work for your kid at school
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.940]   Maybe no because the whole idea
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:43.460]   I guess cable vision is doing the same thing Comcast is doing which is using a little bit of your
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:47.740]   Barring a cup of access from you so that anybody walking by can use your your
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:51.220]   Access place that yeah, I also think I'm not sure that you know I see it
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.100]   I see these connections come up most often when I'm in commercial places
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.860]   So I think they must put
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.300]   Access points around on poles and things too. I don't know
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:07.140]   I've been meaning to ask about that. Maybe so chat room answered well because where you do it most often see it
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:13.300]   It's in commercial spaces. Yeah, not you know, I'm not in a residential neighborhood where I can be anywhere near somebody's Wi-Fi
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:18.540]   That's what I get a strong about its finity wireless. It is it's most strong in residential neighborhoods
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:24.060]   I've been able to literally just walk through small neighborhoods and never leave Wi-Fi. It's amazing
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.420]   Wow, yeah
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:36.740]   And pay up apparently cable vision has deals with XFINITY as well so if you
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:42.540]   Who's the cable provider in Brooklyn? Is it also cable vision time Warner? Yeah?
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.260]   You didn't say that with joy, Jina
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.260]   Oh
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:32:00.780]   To go over the top so maybe time Warner is forward thinking or maybe you'll be Comcast soon. Don't forget. It's already spun off. Yeah
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.300]   Oh, they spun off HBO
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:08.900]   It's got off time Warner from AOL time Warner cable time Warner cable from time Warner
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:14.740]   Oh, it's not part of time Warner time Warner as we knew it has spun off AOL confused time Warner cable and
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.660]   time-making
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.860]   Spun off
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:25.660]   So what you have left in time Warner movie studio HBO CNN
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:30.080]   That kind of stuff. I think this is a really kind of it's kind of a gorilla form of
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:37.060]   Wireless access is as these companies beef up their Wi-Fi everywhere apparently in Vancouver
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:42.820]   One of the chatters is telling us Shaw a big cable company there is building out street level Wi-Fi
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.180]   throughout the entire region
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:49.820]   So it's interesting ambition of these cable companies expands
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:56.580]   What what is the security implication of this maybe this is a little bit of an attention
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.260]   But if I see Xfinity Wi-Fi in my Wi-Fi
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:04.940]   And it's gonna connect to it automatic like I would say no because I'm like well
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.740]   I don't know who that belongs to I don't want my phone connecting to a random person's Wi-Fi
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:17.380]   What is the security aspect of this when you're connecting to hundreds of Wi-Fi access points while you're roaming around town? Oh
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:22.140]   Who cares who cares? All right, that's a good question. I don't know
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:29.380]   I didn't even think of that in order customers that set up the default and just left it open they didn't they didn't add a password on their
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.400]   Round no no it's not that at all. It's actually done by Comcast
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.820]   Okay, so if you subscribe to Comcast and use and use their wireless access box the box
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:43.500]   They give you which I don't it will automatically create this Xfinity Wi-Fi account
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:49.060]   Nothing you're doing you can opt out of it, but it's opt in it's not opt in it's opt out and
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:55.340]   You're now, but it doesn't go against your bandwidth. All right, so it's and it's completely firewalled from yours
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:59.180]   They insist it's fired wall from your stuffs that makes sense
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.980]   So it doesn't go against your bandwidth for charging
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:07.380]   But what if everybody in the house is watching movies and somebody walks by watching a movie. That's a good question. Yeah
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:12.660]   You only have so they I think they say we add more we give you more capability we
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:19.900]   Bump you up. Oh, you don't know we don't give it to you. Yeah, we use it for us. Yeah, the router could certainly do that
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:26.900]   And I do have to log in so in order for it to work
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:31.140]   The first time I use it I have to log into my Xfinity account
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:37.820]   But you're right the phone doesn't really know if it's it could just be an open access spot. I
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.540]   Mean what is there?
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.820]   My voice is going I think you're right. I think it could happen
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:47.780]   Is there anything stopping just random person from setting up setting up an Xfinity?
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:51.140]   You know naming it the same things that your phone recognizes and it's like well
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:54.700]   I connect to these by default so I'm gonna do it and then something bad happens
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:02.540]   Sorry to rain on the parade guess I'll be forgetting Xfinity Wi-Fi
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.260]   Three question works nicely
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:12.380]   And then somebody else is pointing out that phone or FON which was started many years ago has been doing this for some time
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:18.340]   That was the plan phone was gonna or FON was gonna create a mesh network of Wi-Fi
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.220]   and
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:28.060]   You would get a FON router and you would then get free access to global Wi-Fi in other locations and apparently
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.140]   There are 14 million
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.700]   Access points all over the place
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:38.340]   This is not well known in the US, but I think it is available in the US. Oh, yeah
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:43.620]   Yeah, but I don't right, but you got to be you know play the odds of being by you have to get a Fonera
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:49.700]   I'm under Fonera. I'm not buying one. I'm just looking honest
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:00.540]   Looking what's the over under on how much Leo is gonna spend on today's episode of this week?
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:04.180]   Have a budget, you know
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:11.180]   It's well like you could tell it's a European country. It's forty nine comma zero zero dollars USD
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:14.100]   For the grandma FON with a fun era
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:18.060]   We have fun era for business. Let's see more details
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.860]   So it's a little a little doohickey
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:30.580]   Classic FON sharing features with is it phone or FON? It's spelled FON. Oh, it's probably phone, isn't it?
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.740]   But that's very confusing because it's a homophone
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:37.780]   I'm sorry
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.540]   The new front era is so small it fits in the palm of your hand
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:46.700]   But don't let it's tiny size for you for your 802.11 compatible comes with WPA encryption and a powerful antenna
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.940]   It looks powerful
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.340]   Huh
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:37:02.700]   So that's not expensive it's $50. Oh, no, I mean it's it's a Martin Vosowski started phone and it's a it's a cause
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:07.540]   Yeah, I need to get Wi-Fi everywhere. So he's not trying to make it make up money out of it. It's just well
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:10.140]   Yeah, no, it's a business, but he's also trying to make it
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:16.300]   You know do good well, I live in the country so I can't really do much good with it
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.300]   I guess we could put one in the window here. I
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:23.500]   Never see any of these around so I think it's not widely used
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.700]   That's neat though if it were widely used. I think this would be great
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.900]   Yeah, part of my pay is in gadgets. That's exactly right
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:38.020]   It's actually the reason I got into tech journalism in the first place
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:44.060]   30 years ago as I stop I just I want I couldn't afford to support my habit
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.580]   So I had to find a way to a means to do that
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:49.860]   Like keep the salary I'll take the gadgets
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:55.460]   It actually kind of happens that way we said we'll say you know what
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:38:01.140]   So what else is new? She'll say your draw this this month is all in gadgets
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:05.860]   What else is new on this store? It's just it's a new design. It's pretty pretty
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:09.420]   But nothing else is different about it
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:15.700]   It seems like Google's really trying to be you know retailer right right
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.180]   Which is an interesting thing for them?
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:21.180]   Can't be a big part of their revenue can it?
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:26.340]   It can't be right they can't be selling an you know a lot of this stuff, but
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:30.340]   But they have to make it accessible. They have to make it accessible
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.100]   They've got more and more stuff to sell
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.660]   I mean if you go to a Best Buy you know the Google section is get you know gets bigger and and I mean this is
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:42.820]   Well, this is a good looking site to that point. They just opened a Google store in I'm so jealous
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.300]   Why do you K in the London curries?
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.260]   New York
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:54.500]   Yeah, that's a strange place. Why not New York? Yeah Google yeah, yeah, because Best Buy is gone
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.780]   Circuit City is gone
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:01.940]   Actually Best Buy is not gone. I should I prematurely killed best radio shack is radio shack is gone
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.620]   So this is inside now
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:10.980]   I was so there are British listeners will have to help us with this Dixons, which is kind of I'd say like the Walmart of the UK owns
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:17.620]   Curries, which is their electronics store, right and inside the curries one curries only
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.820]   in London Google has opened a Google shop and
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:29.820]   It does not big it's kind of we used to see those in Best Buy's Apple had an Apple store and well
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:35.140]   You have it Best Buy now you have huge Samsung so yeah Samsung Google yeah big Microsoft
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:44.180]   Very common now so it's in the Tottenham Court Road curries PC world. I've been in there. Have you? Yeah, is it big?
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:47.860]   That's the store. Yeah, it's not as big like the German
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:51.980]   Electronic ones are much bigger Saturn much bigger, but okay
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:58.620]   And check this out they launched Google launched Google Shop at Curries VR tour for your cardboard
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:08.860]   I mean Google's done this kind of thing. I mean I remember in terminal to it SFO the virgin terminal
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.740]   There used to be a little chrome kiosk there you
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:14.980]   They've done chrome shops
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.100]   Android there's an Android land shops in Australia
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:23.140]   They have done chrome stores before in fact in curries
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:29.620]   I've actually argued for some time that they'd be wise to I mean Europe all around would have been wise to have had
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:33.900]   Google retail presences just to make friendlier with the world right oh
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:40.060]   That's what I think and play but don't just play with the hardware play with Google Maps
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:43.300]   I understand what it can do and you you know go into that geodesic dome
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:48.020]   We will listen at I owe listen this is the description the shop will host regular classes and events
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:52.380]   Including tutorials about online security as well as how to use Google devices
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:57.060]   It will also hold virtual space camps to teach children the basics of coding
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:03.180]   Open house events where teachers can test potential educational tools. You're right. This is a PR effort
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:07.820]   Which stage should do more? Yeah? Well, by the way, what's the security lesson biochrome book?
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:14.140]   Maybe second factor authentication on your Google okay, all right. That's that's true
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:20.500]   That's true. Yeah, and then I if I were them I'd put some more information on making and storing secure passwords and
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:24.100]   I
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.220]   Maybe they think it's a cheap in the brand, but I don't think
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:31.300]   All of us who've ever visited the Google HQ's, you know, Valhalla
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:35.940]   Yeah, for a walk into the swag store. So the swag store
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:40.300]   I was just gonna say that every time the few times I've been to the meant to the campus same thing the group
[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:44.980]   I've been in it's always like when do we get to go to the store and the store is just packed full of you know
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:50.500]   stuffed androids and t-shirts and all kinds of gear and I mean it's merch and people love it
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:55.820]   I bought stuff there, you know and imagine if over Europe you started seeing people walk around with Google t-shirts
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.380]   Yeah, as long as they do your with eggs and maybe it's no accident
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.940]   They're doing this they're doing this in England and maybe they will do it in German and rest of Europe
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:09.060]   The shop includes a large screen called portal that will allow users to fly around the world using Google Earth
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:15.380]   They'll be a deal with that right there'll be a doodle wall where wannabe budding artists can paint their own Google logo
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.500]   That's all you can paint those a Google logo
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.220]   so and
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:25.580]   There it is see you could paint within the Google but and then a chromecast pod
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:29.780]   Where customers can watch Google play music movies and YouTube?
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:35.840]   In Mountain View they have from from whatever conference they did it for they have a selfie booth
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:40.260]   Ah, which is right there. Yeah, they used to call those photo booths
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:44.260]   For black and white pictures of you and your honey
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:47.420]   making funny faces
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:53.200]   But now it's but the difference is this is an auto awesome photo booth. Yeah, nice
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:58.300]   Whatever you do becomes a lot of awesome immediately and then you can share that be awesome. We're watching
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:02.660]   Yeah, you look really good automatically and another breaking story Google's been busy
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.660]   We have three breaking stories today
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:09.060]   Google has launched an interactive events app for Android and the web
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:14.780]   Now is this the real logic? I kind of snuck out like yesterday didn't it? This is this is the real thing now, huh?
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:19.140]   interactive - events dot with Google
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.720]   slash web
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.540]   Wow, and here's a little legal disclaimer, which I have to accept
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:30.480]   You know, they didn't have to make this such small type, but I guess if you're doing a legal disclaimer, you should
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:37.320]   Why should why nobody wants to read this? Yes, we know you collect information. That's okay. I love you Google
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.660]   Sign in with Facebook link dinner GitHub. Yeah, let me look in. Oh
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.300]   That's new
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.940]   Interesting or Google which I'm using I
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.020]   Have no events. Oh
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:56.260]   What good is this? Oh, so what is this so if I had an event code I?
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.960]   could
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.520]   Put it in here
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:04.000]   What is this to what this was such a promising onboarding?
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:11.940]   Nowhere nowhere nowhere is bill nothing Leo you have nothing last train to know Westville
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:16.260]   It makes me feel bad about myself. I have such a boring life, too
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.840]   You have no events
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.880]   You have no life
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.080]   Can somebody give me an event code
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.920]   Please
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:30.040]   Events what I don't understand what I mean. This is like an upcoming kind of thing or what?
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.280]   Let's see
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:39.720]   I'm gonna show you something I really like that I just found out about if you heard about forecast F O R E K A S T
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.480]   No, I
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.480]   Should have made this my pick of the week my tool of the week. It's an open source
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:53.760]   Karma-based calendaring solution the crowd sourced calendar of the internet
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:45:01.280]   So you can you can add stuff to it in different categories and then you can vote them up
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.320]   So the stuff that is voted up is what you see
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:10.080]   So here is somebody who Angelica Calico was mere casting from the NASA
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.560]   Test firing of the largest most powerful booster ever built for NASA this morning
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:20.640]   Ryan Hoover was doing product hunt radio with mere cat founder and others. So these are and I'll log in
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:24.840]   But I guess I'll do that off the camera, but it's kind of cool. So you can add an event
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:32.560]   It's kind of like product hunt for events and then people vote them up. It's neat. Yes, tomorrow is Alfred Hitchcock day all day
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:39.880]   The live stream of the Atlas 5 rocket launch Facebook warns that your page likes may decrease substantially tomorrow
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.840]   Sid Myers starships releases. So it's kind of like a geek calendar and then of course Friday south by south west
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:52.840]   I saw the West do we miss that folks? Are you guys going? No, no
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:57.320]   I missed the south by south by southwest of yesteryear
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:01.760]   Oh, I joined I joined Twitter at south by southwest eight years ago
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:10.280]   Wow, that's what south by southwest was a lady lady. Yeah, and even then I was like, oh this thing has jumped a shark so
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:15.520]   That says about it's already big in south by forget it
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.080]   at it
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.080]   So in 2007
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:23.080]   Yeah, yeah, I that was the well
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:23.320]   Okay
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:29.480]   So that was a south by that Twitter kind of long launched meaning that they set up those those displays in the hallways with tweets
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.800]   And I spent the whole conference just sort of like that as Twitter thing
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.200]   I stupid and then I flew home and joined Twitter like at home
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.320]   And I think my first tweet was like I'm home about to take a nap, you know
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:45.640]   And now it's your business so there and I know
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:51.200]   Eight years later my crystal ball was not working your startup would be ball around Twitter
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:59.760]   Yeah, you'd be a lamprey on the giant eel or whale of Twitter or whatever that is a dicky bird on the backs on the shoulders
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.600]   so
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.320]   The interactive services meant for Google's
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:11.800]   Things so I know for example, so that's where you're they release like an IO app or something like that
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:17.560]   Instead, there's this you plug in the event code and then you can do things like, you know interact with
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.080]   Speakers take no
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:24.640]   Code it's meaningless. Yes. Yeah, all these things. Nobody gets invited to
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:30.000]   He said bitterly about never going to site geist. Oh, I'd love to go to site guys
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.240]   But that's for people who advertise on Google
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:36.320]   I know but they bring in cool people because they're there's money there. That's what makes a need I
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:46.040]   Be very windy today because there's no LTE no LTE you'll see what you've done Google you've made an enemy
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:53.760]   All right, so there's your three big breaking stories, but but oh still have a Google change log, you know
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.440]   It's since genius here. We're gonna make her do it. Oh, yes, okay
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:00.480]   I'm gonna win you guys
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:12.160]   We I don't think we have anybody at South by this year wow, I think nobody at all I'm going Miriam's going probably I
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.700]   believe she's there for something yeah, but I was asked to
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:21.520]   Moderate a panel and I said no there you go. I said nah. I gotta do my shows
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.240]   Yeah
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:31.480]   Because I was at the I may I ask you at the hike what did it cost you to do the mondo great stuff?
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:37.920]   You did the mondo stuff we did like it's CES where we had a booth and it's crew and we brought that was
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:45.240]   20 people we never did South by like that, but well actually we did a live broadcast from South by one
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:49.800]   Where South where we had a good president in the low six figures oh?
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.600]   Yeah, a hundred thousand plus
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:59.640]   Wow most of that's like flying people there and feeding them and I'm clothing them. Well you feed them well, too
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.800]   It's like it's like I have a great statement on my back
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:11.080]   No, we did we had that remember we had that lovely dinner at the Brazilian sword. Yeah sword meat place. Yeah. Yeah. That was fun
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:14.960]   If I had meerkat then I would a mere cat at it
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.960]   I did I
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:27.640]   Was right before the crowdsource I turned on the live view showed them the bill
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:34.040]   Was like and then I and then we went over to stubs barbecue. I walked to stubs barbecue from there
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:39.640]   Thank God otherwise it was casting along the way podcasting or streaming on the video along the way and then did the crowd surf
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.120]   Yeah, those were the days weren't they?
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:49.920]   Yeah, so there we go. It wasn't just Twitter. So Twitter was 2007, but was it 2008 that four square broke out at?
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.200]   South by
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:56.560]   By the time I got there there were yeah there I am by the way being lifted
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:01.520]   That's great by the and so your reason you can see me is because I've got a camera on my face
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.420]   That I'm holding on a staff like Gandalf
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:09.440]   Aiming at the selfie stick selfie it was the original there before everybody else
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:17.240]   All that hair I had hair and look at the backpack which is the streaming unit is like a 30 pound
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:22.880]   Yeah, I feel like Dan rather at the 1968 democratic convention
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:27.080]   fact that you know or that Dunesbury guy with a satellite dish on his head
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:34.320]   That was a lot of fun, but but what we realized quickly was it's just a party. Yeah, there's no news
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:37.040]   no, and
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.040]   I think for sure was 2009
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:45.520]   Was it 2009 okay, so there was nothing of 2008 oh maybe there was something in 2008
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:55.360]   Was an Austin company copy for Square all the day those were the days
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:00.760]   All right, I
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:04.720]   Think this would be a good time to take a break come back and do the the change log
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.520]   What do you say? There's still a ton of news?
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:12.600]   We've got the Google CFO is moving on wants to spend time climbing mountains with his lovely wife
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:17.880]   Did that do you read money as he has people can carry him up the mountain did you?
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:24.240]   Did you read Pishette's goodbye letter to make you want to quit made me want to quit yes?
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:27.800]   And you're your boss I can't quit
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:33.040]   But it made me want it. I'll read it out loud. We'll do a dramatic read
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:38.800]   It'll make you all want to quit your jobs and go travel the world
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:45.080]   Nest is looking for ahead of audio. What could that mean and
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:51.480]   Google compare finally launches. We've heard it was going to but it's here. There's a lot of new stuff
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:55.200]   It's a good week if you're a Google watcher. Oh
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.360]   And then I want to talk a little bit about Giga oh
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:05.240]   Think we have yeah, I want to hear yeah, I got good. It's good stuff first. Let's talk about my mattress
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:14.000]   Somebody said I could tell Twitter's jump the chart the shark you're doing ads for mattresses now when you find a great mattress
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:20.360]   even geeks have to sleep my friends and this is you know all of the advertisers we have are
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:27.360]   Tied in some way to the new economy and that's really I think if there's a common thread they may not be tech companies
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:34.400]   Casper isn't exactly a tech company, but it wouldn't exist if you couldn't if the internet didn't exist Casper is one of those companies that is
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:40.400]   Redefining what commerce looks like and it's an it's an interesting one it's a challenging one because people say well
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:44.000]   I need to lie on the bed before I buy the bed, but I got to tell you
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.720]   Five minutes on a bed I could tell you from personal experience five minutes on a bed in a showroom
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:54.520]   Where there's sales girls looking at you and your wife and waiting for you to do something bad
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.120]   Is not a great way to figure out if that mattress is comfortable. We bought a mattress and we didn't like it
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.440]   It was too firm
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:07.120]   Fortunately, we love our Casper and here's how Casper gets around that showroom problem
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:12.320]   You get the mattress you try the mattress for as long as a hundred days
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:19.600]   Free delivery and painless returns within that hundred day period so you can literally sleep on it for three months and say
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.860]   Yeah, no, it's not right for me, and they'll take it back. They'll come get it and say thank you very much
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:28.300]   We appreciate the opportunity to take to that you gave us a shot
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:31.760]   Not returning my Casper in fact. I've bought more caspers
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:38.520]   Casper's in our guest room caspers in my son's dorm room. Well, he's in a house. So not a dorm, but
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:45.240]   He loves his Casper Casper mattresses combined latex on top and memory foam on the bottom
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:50.000]   To give you just the right sink and bounce. They are so comfy
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:56.240]   So comfy and yeah, they come in a box. That was a queen size mattress easily easily fit through the door
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:00.920]   Simple to do it. I I just love it. That's one of the reasons we got it for my son
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:05.680]   He's up three flights and he couldn't have had a big mattress upstairs. He wanted a king
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:13.160]   Mattresses started $500 for a twin 950 for a king. That's a lot less than that showroom mattress, but it's a lot more comfortable
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:17.440]   It breathes. It's cool. It feels great. They're made in the USA
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:22.680]   Even Aussie the wonder dog loves Casper. You will too. In fact, you'll save an additional 50 bucks
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:28.000]   Because you're watching this show if you go to Casper C A S P E R
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.280]   Dot com slash twig T W I G
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:34.040]   $50 off any mattress
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:38.880]   This is an example of the this is the uber of mattresses an
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:44.560]   Example of how the internet can revolution. I well it's kind of true. Oh
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:52.800]   You have a Casper. I'll come home with you. Yes, exactly make my friends fast. Yes with Casper
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:56.940]   It's not how we're selling it. Jeff sorry
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:03.240]   But I think that's probably how my son is I think it would be actually they are no actually on on on mysterious on hard stern
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:07.480]   It is how they sell it. No. Oh, oh well. Yes
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:10.360]   Well, let me put it this way
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:16.320]   Henry's very happy with his new mattress and I think it's getting a lot of use
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:19.200]   But you know college kids sleep a lot
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.760]   Casper comm slash twig
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:26.880]   Love it love it. It was so much fun. We opened the box in the mattress
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:33.120]   It looks fun. I want to get way. I want to get one just to see it's so much fun
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.720]   I didn't open the box for a long time because I wanted to make sure we had all the
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:42.360]   Camera set up so we could because I knew it was gonna be exciting and I told Henry I said please make a vine of your mattress
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.920]   Unboxing it, but he never did I was disappointed
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.680]   Anything I tell my son to do
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.480]   darn kids does the opposite
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:57.520]   But that's gonna change Casper daca my daughter's in the big apple right now. She went out to visit friends and
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:02.480]   You know, it's neat. I'm getting pictures back. She's she's got so many friends in New York
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.200]   It's really the place for people. She's 23 people her age really
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:10.880]   Flocked to Manhattan, don't they yeah, you should do it when you're young. It's a wonderful place to be
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:19.600]   And so she's there's tons of friends there. She's her uncle James who's the dean at Yale drama school took her to a Broadway show went backstage
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.600]   I mean, it's she's having a full
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:27.760]   I hear that it's freezing white. She says I know I got a coat actually got pretty good weather this weekend
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:33.600]   It's kind of the cold melting isn't it? Yeah, yeah, it's melting. It's melting. It's disgusting. That's the worst time
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.600]   I
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:42.640]   Say all right, let's uh do we still can we dust off dust off the changelog? Yeah, let's do it theme
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:55.840]   Time for the latest the new stuff from google. Here's jina trapeani gotta shake off my ringraust here. Okay, what we got
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.520]   Thank you to Jason for putting this together
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:07.040]   I've been so out of touch with iOS. I had no idea there was not a native google calendar app for
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:10.080]   I was I just it's been a while
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.120]   I'm
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:16.080]   But that that wrong has been righted google launched google calendar for iphone a native app
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:22.240]   On iOS and this of course you used to be able to get google calendar because I knew I had my google calendar on ios
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:25.760]   When I did when I was using it, but it used to be available. Maybe a google sync
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:29.760]   This is the full tilt android experience google calendar app
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:37.440]   Uh, it's got google it's got events from gmail support which automatically converts emails and calendar events that have places and times and dates
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:42.960]   Uh assists that make suggestions for things like places and contacts and the schedule view
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:48.240]   Uh that we I say we all i'm sure that not everyone that listens to the shows is as on android
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:52.960]   Uh, but it really really nice experience has all the sort of up-to-date newest calendar stuff
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.960]   So that's that's and that's available in the app store now
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:58.560]   And it has a widget or whatever apple calls them a notification
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.800]   Has an item for the notification
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:04.480]   Oh very nice. Yeah, what does apple call those rich notification fingers?
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.440]   Are they widgets? They're calling them widgets, right do hikis
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:13.040]   Jimmy jams. I don't know, but that's good. That's good. You don't have to call it on the watch a complication
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.240]   A what a complication
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:19.360]   On the apple watch when you you have a watch face, but you can add
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:23.200]   Like weather and and it's called a complication
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.320]   That is it's interesting
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:28.320]   Funny I mean as a job
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.520]   No, I think it's a horror it might be a horological term
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:34.480]   They're using a lot of watch terms in this thing
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:39.600]   Interesting a complication. I that's what I want. I want more complicated. Don't you? Yeah
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:45.600]   By the way, you can't get the google calendar for iOS right now because the app store has been down all day
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:51.200]   Oh, really all their services have been down up and down and it's been a mess and
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:55.680]   I haven't checked lately, but that the apple has like google does the status thing
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:59.040]   And it hasn't been indicating any problems. Maybe it is now
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:02.960]   But uh, yeah, they've been having all sorts of problems even the status is down
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:07.680]   Uh, that's not a good sign. Well, let me see. Let's let's look apple support system status
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:14.240]   Yes, you'll look green. Oh, well, then the app stores down. I tuned stores down mac app stores down. So it does show
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:19.920]   I feel for multiple store services all users are affected been going on since six this morning
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:26.320]   Ah, that's a long time. That's a long time and it's the stores. I'm not sure what that's all about
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:33.600]   Oof. Yeah. Well, good luck apple engineers. The app store comes back. You can get the google calendar on it
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:36.960]   Good luck
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:41.120]   Android 5.1 we talked about this at length actually last night at
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:46.880]   Oh, I want to hear about it. I missed that. Yeah, uh, google announced at android 4 5.1
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:52.240]   This is a minor update to uh point release to lollipop is rolling out to next devices now
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:59.200]   It's been posted to the android open source project, which means that people who flash it'll be it's available to flashing parties everywhere
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:03.680]   Uh, and the new new features are pretty good multi sim card support
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:10.320]   Multi sim card support device protection for loss of stolen devices now of course android had this before but this
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:14.240]   This is this is a new way to do it. It requires google sign-in. So you lose your device
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:18.640]   You sign into google uh ton locket, but it works even after someone has
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.280]   reboot and factory reset the device
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.160]   Uh, which is pretty pretty pretty cool. Yeah
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.160]   And hd
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.160]   Thugs you
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.640]   Yeah, just try to wipe my phone. Just try a wipe it
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:35.680]   Places where kill switches like that have uh been implemented show really good results
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:42.640]   Right, even like I think I saw some in hat and statistics for iPhones and it really drops the number of uh, thefts and uh, so that's good
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:48.560]   Yeah, it's good. That's good. And then hd voice calling uh for compatible devices and carrier
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.120]   So, uh, I think you you both would have to have
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:58.800]   Nexus six on the right carriers in order to in order to enjoy this hd voice calling but voice calling but it's there
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:03.360]   And then there's just a bunch of little just minor lots of lots of icons got animated
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:08.640]   There's some volume settings updates. I mean this was kind of just a you know polish and um, you know
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:13.360]   Minor minor update that kind of I think make the whole lollipop experience better
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.320]   I of course had don't have lollipop in my one plus one yet
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:20.400]   And no one on all but android last night had gotten five point one yet over the air
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.360]   So that but that should just check my six. No
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.480]   Let me run into my next seven while you keep talking and i'll
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:31.840]   Okay, Jason. Did you just have you seen it on your phone? No, I keep checking
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:36.560]   Which you know, we already know really does not a whole a lot of good
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:44.320]   Right. Um, as I said last night. I was tempted to flash it, but I knew once I did that I would then be authorizing another
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:51.040]   Uh device on my google play music all access account and because google's so limiting on that now
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.960]   I didn't want to run up against the limit
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.760]   So I decided not to do that because those authorizations are precious to me at the moment
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.480]   right
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.920]   And then uh
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.760]   finally google released
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:08.800]   released a standalone pdf viewer for uh folks who aren't using google drive
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:16.320]   Um, yeah, it's released standalone to the to the play store that makes it easier to open pdf
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:20.080]   So you've probably got a few different options. I yeah, we tried to last on the show and it's like, you know
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.800]   a quick office pdf viewer and then the drive viewer
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.480]   Uh, but um, I think this is targeted toward android for work
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:30.000]   Folks, but it's open and available to everyone in the play store now
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.600]   I just I you know, it's for years, especially on windows
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:40.160]   Viewing pdfs has meant downloading an additional program in the case of a doe reater program full of bugs and holes
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:43.920]   It was such a blessing that google drive just we can read it now
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.480]   Just you can't change form life
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:52.880]   Yeah, it should be treated like a text file. It should be a system utility a pdf at this point is such a ubiquitous format
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:57.840]   You know apple does it that way they offer, you know, they come with a program called preview preview, right?
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:03.040]   Right, but google had to do it for a chrome OS. I think you know that that was a necessary
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:08.480]   Uh, and it what a great feature. So let's see about tablet. This is my nexus seven, which is currently running
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:11.040]   I think 502
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:16.880]   Gosh, don't you hate that. Let me check it's not you'd lie. My system is not up to date
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.000]   Like saw the google changelog. No, well, yeah, it's not available in the seven either
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.320]   so
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:30.400]   Well, it's on its way the next time you see that little robot. You'll know it's 5.1
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:38.400]   And I should just show you but one more thing leo has now written his first android application
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:45.120]   It's very stupid and simple because it's uh, it's the app of better though, but I you know I wanted a little
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:52.160]   Account down timer for the radio show and and um so app inventor may I took you know
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:55.360]   The hardest thing was getting used to the idea of like I had
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:59.920]   You know, I couldn't do a case statement. I had to do multiple if the analysis things like that, you know
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:05.440]   Real programmers will go. Oh, this is you know, you're fighting app inventor, but for a non programmer
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.960]   It's great. You can actually make a APK you can give to people
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:13.040]   I just uh download the APK put it on my google drive and I could put it on an android device
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:16.640]   And it's a very stupid little simple thing. It just counts down how many seconds left
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.760]   If we were on the radio show right now, I'd have you know, like three minutes of talking left
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:26.800]   Then when it gets down to two minutes, it gets yellow when it gets to 30 seconds. It gets red when it gets to zero
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:29.120]   Then it goes to the commercial. It's goes blue
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:33.280]   It's very simple, but but it's really handy and I used it this weekend
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.680]   So the bill so that's the app inventor from uh, it was from google. It's from mit now
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.000]   If you search for app inventor too, it's very easy to write and create new
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.880]   Uh, new APK so you can install on yours or anybody's
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.480]   You have to be able to install third-party APKs, but that's easy to do
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.880]   So he says he's counting down the number of viewers
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.760]   I hope not
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.720]   Can you go the other way?
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.040]   About Leo stupid app
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.520]   And that is the google change
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.440]   Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.440]   It's so nice to have Gina here
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:13.120]   I feel the greatest everything going well for you
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.040]   Yeah, things are good. Things are good. Now that spring is starting to happen
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.040]   I'm feeling a little bit more human
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.160]   In a little less like what did I do the reason for winter
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:26.800]   It's just you know, it's just you can't enjoy anything less. You know suffering
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.600]   It's so that you can enjoy spring
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:34.480]   I've been trying I was discussing this at length of the friend like like is spring better because we earned it
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:40.480]   You know what I mean? Like is this I think I think so. I think this is on telling myself anyway. No absolutely
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:42.640]   Absolutely
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:46.160]   Spring is coming march comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.040]   That's what they say have you heard that before?
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:52.000]   Okay
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.840]   Let's take
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.680]   Let's take a break lots more to talk about our show today brought to you by hip chat.com
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:04.480]   This is I'm on hip chat all the time on my android device on my iPhone on my desktop. There's a web app for
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.200]   uh, apap, you know, Linux
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:12.480]   Uh, I actually there may be a dedicated app for Linux. What is hip chat? Well, it's designed for teams
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.960]   To keep them on the same page
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:19.600]   It's like instant messenger. So you'll immediately be able to use it and understand what hip chat is
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.880]   But it adds video chat document sharing screen sharing
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:27.840]   Code sharing it's really great for develop a lot of developers use a hip chat
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:32.000]   We're using it with our development team in austin. That's doing the new website
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:38.880]   Uh, and it's just it's it's like having a permanent record of everything that went on. It's real time. So it's not asynchronous like
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.600]   email it's ssl
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:46.640]   So it's fully encrypted it integrates with 57 other services
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:51.040]   That developers like like github and jira and zendesk
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.680]   So, uh, you're you're really
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:59.840]   Very productive with hip chat. It's easy to set up fun to use and i'm telling you by the way fun is part of this
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:05.280]   They have emojis and there's a little uh plugin called linky that when you paste a link in it
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.440]   It does a little preview of the page and the hip chat thing
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:11.200]   Just just little things like that make it make it really a pleasure to use
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:16.960]   We liked it so much, uh using it with four kitchens. We started to use it with our engineering team and our sales team
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.200]   Um, I just love it hip chat. So here's the deal. It's free
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.640]   You know, there's a freemium version anyway that you can use free forever
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:30.480]   But there's also a full version and you're going to get that for the next 30 days if you go to hip chat.com/twig
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:35.600]   That includes additional features like video and screen sharing hip chat.com/twig

[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:59.120]   Slash twig hip chat.com
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:03.280]   Slash twig. We're a hip chat house. I think I could say that now
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.880]   Um, I have at home my hip chat's always running
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:12.960]   We scrum every day. We have the hip chat going. I feel so agile
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:19.120]   It's kind of fun. You know, it's fun. It's like a mountain goat your agile. I'm climbing the hill
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:26.080]   Have you done like full-on agile development, Gina? I have I have not I have not I definitely have used
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:33.040]   You know parts of it. I'm a cafeteria agile practitioner. I guess you say like you're a cafeteria catholic. I understand
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:36.800]   Exactly exactly. Uh, and I think for most people that's the right way to go
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:41.600]   But if you have a big complicated project with a lot of moving parts and a lot of moving people
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:47.920]   And this is a perfect example where you have a various stakeholders and you know lots of different developers
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:52.960]   There's a developer for Drupal actually there's several there's developer for no js
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:57.200]   There's developers for the dust templates. There's a designer and the only way to do that I think
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.360]   Is with some real structure and agile's very interesting very process heavy
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.880]   But I found it to be really fun. We're having a good way. It's it's
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:09.920]   Really interesting and I think we're getting a much now that the product that the bridge is almost built
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.320]   I feel like wow, this has really worked
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:17.920]   At first it's like very process heavy and you go nothing's happening. Yeah, I like uh, uh, we're spending a bunch of time
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.840]   Yeah, deciding how we're gonna do things. Yeah designing programs, right?
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.600]   You know who know what he wants to spend time writing tests
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.960]   Writing a design writing a spec you want to get in there a code
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:33.920]   Yeah, it's true. It's the hard part is the front up front work, but it makes a big difference
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.880]   It's true. Yeah, you should write. I hope you'll write up or do a show or you know, maybe on an insights word
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:43.200]   I would love to hear about about your impressions because this is your first time full on agile. Oh, yeah
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.680]   We did a little scrumming with lullaby
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.360]   Uh, but it was really like you say just a little here and there
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.880]   They may have been fully agile internally, but we weren't exposed to it. This time we're fully exposed to it
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.120]   You know, it's really good. It's really interesting
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.240]   um, I understand why
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:06.240]   It's a way of managing complexity and that you and software so complex you really need this
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:12.800]   Yes, especially when you're plugging together different things the way that you are. Oh my god. We're doing what we're doing. It's insane
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.920]   Can't wait to see it
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.120]   I should bring you in a little bit and bring you into one of some of our meetings and show you
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:22.720]   We'll be doing a beta. So there's gonna be three phases of development
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:27.920]   But we're gonna be doing a private beta soon and when when we do that we'll certainly invite you guys all along
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.920]   I'm a global host
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:36.880]   And those of you in chat will probably be part of it as well. I want the the the users to get a chance to bang on it a little bit
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:39.440]   Great. Can't wait. Yeah, yeah
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:47.520]   But all the programmers understand that huh? Do you feel pregnant? Yeah, I feel like i'm in week 38
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:52.640]   Oh, it's it's like this such delicious agony when you're building something
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:56.080]   I'm in this space right now. We're like you're building something you're really excited about it
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:59.440]   You know exactly what has to be done. It's not quite done yet. You can't wait to show people
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:04.080]   Yeah, yeah, and then and then there's the postpartum after it launches and all you have is a list of bugs
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.640]   So get ready for that really looks pretty though. Oh, and I know we're gonna have but you know, I think
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:16.800]   In a way though this process this agile process does make the bug squat. You're really squashing as you go. I think
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.480]   So a very good way to do it. I don't know. We'll see
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:25.200]   We shall see the new android where street art pack is out
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.160]   Thank you scooter x in the chat room. I don't even know what i'm gonna look at here
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:33.600]   You got it. Yeah, I just got it. It's like
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.240]   It's just a bunch of
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:41.120]   Funky watch faces exactly street art and this is from google education of all people is it?
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.360]   Yeah, I didn't realize that yeah
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:49.120]   So this is so one of the nice things about anywhere and I think now all the attention shifting to apples watch
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:52.080]   It's going to be interesting to see how and read responds
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.720]   You know, we've heard some people say oh they should make it compatible with iOS
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:02.800]   Um, but one of the one of the things the apple watch does not offer is third party faces
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:06.560]   You have to use apples faces and they're only half a dozen of them of course
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:16.160]   So third party face space is huge in uh in android where but google is also doing new faces all the time. So is mo to roller
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:18.240]   um
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.240]   Is there more than one or is this
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.240]   uh
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:27.280]   There there is i haven't played around with it too much. I just even showed the time all install it
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.800]   We'll find out
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.520]   You have to install it as uh with all android where uh faces on a phone first
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.960]   And then it communicates at some point
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:45.680]   To the watch so i'll stall it on my phone. I will say the uh the flat tire of the mo to 360 is not doing it any favors
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:53.360]   You can only see the top half of the number six at the bottom. So what do you think how hard would it be to make android where work with ios
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.840]   Apple works with both you won't have the full set of
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:03.280]   Yeah, I know that somebody's got it working. Um, i've seen at least a proof of concept
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:07.360]   Would it be apple could apple get in the way of that? I guess they could they could not approve android where
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.920]   Right support maps
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.920]   Yeah
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.600]   Huh?
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:18.160]   Well, i'll be getting a watch too of course an apple watch too. I'm not going to get the gold one
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:22.000]   Don't even think about it. That's for connye and the good company
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.160]   So really quickly are you filled with desire for this watch? Well, i'm feeling about it
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:32.240]   I'm filled with desire for everything. I just i'm a walking bag of desire
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.800]   Okay
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.720]   A new, uh, walking sack of techno lust a new garage door opener is happy
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:43.040]   Yeah, no, but then i'm not having only happy for five minutes. Then it's like what's next
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.880]   Yeah
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.000]   You know i'm about lust for basically announcement. Were you excited about the announcement?
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:48.720]   Did you feel like
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:54.080]   You know, this is something i can't wait that you're switching ios and you're gonna go full tilt and just and watch it up
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.760]   Well, we knew the what we knew everything about the watch already except pricing availability
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.720]   There was nothing new to say about the watch really pretty much
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:04.080]   What we didn't know at all about was the new macbook
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.320]   And i'm actually really excited about that. It's two pounds
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:14.880]   It's only about twice as thick as a an iphone. I mean, it's really it's like half an inch thick
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.960]   um
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.960]   Type-c connector only
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:24.800]   Not even just one just one that's really irritating. Well their claim is
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.160]   We're gonna you're gonna get nine hours battery life and apple by the way
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.920]   Unlike a lot of people including i think google is when they say nine hours
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:37.040]   You really will get nine hours a lot of times companies say nine hours and you get five and a half or six
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.320]   Because they say well your mileage may vary but but apple really tries hard to give you accurate numbers
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:47.920]   So the idea is uh, you know, I don't know how how many hours a day do you think you use your chromebook
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:51.760]   Me? Yeah without being plugged in
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.040]   Well, that'll be plugged in. Yeah
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.400]   Not nine hours too. Yeah
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:03.040]   So the idea is you've got that type-c connector for all the other times that you're not charging
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:08.240]   And then when you and then you'll do I think the theory is you'll do with your macbook
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:14.000]   What you do with your phone and you're watching now you just plug it all in at night wake up the next morning and you get all days left
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.520]   I'm very type-c
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:21.760]   Usb extender situation. They have a $79 of course
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:27.600]   connector you plug into it that gives you a standard usb that gives you a power type-c connector
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:32.000]   And get and gives you video hc a full hdmi video out
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:35.440]   So if I wanted to do this if I bought that machine which i'm not going to
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.400]   I wanted to do this show. Oh god
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.360]   Let's see if you got the connector you because you need the camera, right and you need power
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.400]   Well, you could do it. Yeah
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.440]   And you
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:51.360]   Usb you need a usb hub because you'd need uh, you need a hub and I couldn't do
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:55.200]   Usb's one for the mic and one for the camera and I couldn't do a monitor, right
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:16:00.000]   There is by the there are by the way, there's an Asus. It's very similar
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.560]   Came out six months ago
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:08.080]   Uh almost as thin 2.6 pounds not quite as light has all the ports
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:11.200]   But there's a problem you have to use windows and I
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:14.640]   Windows yeah, so this is what happens to the airbrand isn't the smaller than an error
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.640]   It is and it makes the airbrand kind of confusing because this is uh
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:26.400]   So this is a macbook period. It's not a problem with an air. Just the macbook. Oh, that's interesting. I'm thinking
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:30.320]   I'm thinking
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:34.320]   That what they'll do is eventually phase out the air. They're gonna keep it pro. They need to have
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.880]   Mac books that have all the connectors and everything
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:40.960]   But i'm thinking if what you want is thin and light this is what you want
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:48.240]   Does the pro still have a uh drive? Oh, yeah pro has well, there is one optical drive
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:52.560]   There is one mac with an optical drive. It's not a pro. It's just a weird one. Okay
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:55.440]   I don't know how long that will last
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.320]   so
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:01.200]   It's I don't know I like thin and light
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.200]   But then I also like crumbucks on I'm kind of crazy
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.160]   uh, let's see
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:15.680]   So the cfo of gold he's only been there six years you think though in six years you can make enough money that you'll never have to work again
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:20.160]   Patrick pishette
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.360]   Google's
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:28.160]   Chief financial officer apparently very well liked he's the guy's been handling the analyst calls since larry page's voice problems
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.920]   Uh is leaving and he wrote a quite a uh
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:35.760]   I think larry page said interesting
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:42.160]   A goodbye letter. It starts pretty traditionally after nearly seven years as a cfo
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:45.760]   I'll be retiring from google to spend more time with my family
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.720]   And he says yeah, I know you've heard that line before
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:53.360]   So he talks about climbing mount kill him and jarra with his wife tamar
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:58.080]   And they enjoy the view and their their kids have grown and out of the house
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:02.000]   And tomorrow out of the blue says hey, why don't we just keep on going?
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:08.880]   Let's explore africa then go to india then the great barrier reef then ant article
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:15.920]   And he says I remember telling tomorrow typical prudent cfo type response. I would love to keep going
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:19.360]   But we have to go back. It's not time yet. So she says
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:23.280]   Great question tomorrow reminds me a little bit of house of cards
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.040]   I
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:29.520]   Clear under what saying to frances. So when is it going to be time our time my time?
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:33.120]   In this case pishette said okay, I quit
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.840]   So he's he's gonna phase out slowly
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:40.240]   He's gonna he says I want to wait until we find a googly replacement
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:44.080]   He literally used that word a googly a new googly cfo
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:49.280]   And help him or her through an orderly transition, which will take some time and then i'm off
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:52.160]   he's 52
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.600]   But obviously made enough money in seven years. Oh, well, too good for him
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.680]   Yeah, right on it makes me want to quit
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.320]   When is it my time?
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:04.800]   Man all the stuff about his kid is just killing me. I know you're reading it. Yeah
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.520]   Yeah
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.520]   Because you're there right now, you know
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:13.600]   Yeah, we're you know, we're in the thick of the cheerio and crusted minivan
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.640]   We are we're in the thick of it. We are in the thick of it
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:24.000]   You know, and it's so funny because I hear people with older kids, you know talk about with such nostalgia and like, you know
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.800]   You know, baby was up with an ear infection all night like I was
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:30.720]   And of course like I love her and you know and she depends on me
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:34.800]   But it's it's a weird thing, you know when you look back at that at that young time and think of it so
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:40.400]   I would do it again in a heartbeat. It feels like such a grind right now. That's what everyone says
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:45.680]   They need you in a way that they don't ever need you. Anyway, I didn't mean to go all like no with you in fact jeff and
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:51.040]   Both I'm sure have that experience of if we could go back maybe not the first two years
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:58.320]   If we can talk to when they can talk when they once they're three or four, you're just entering the best time
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:04.720]   You're just getting out of the worst time jeena. Yeah, but what but I would go back and do that a heartbeat, but I think also jeff
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:09.840]   There's a human's have a short memory for pain. Yes. Yes
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:13.360]   Have second
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:15.360]   Have another child otherwise
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.360]   Yes
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:21.680]   Yeah, but wow. Yeah, this is this is quite a this is quite a letter
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:28.080]   Isn't what isn't it what all the grown-ups tell you though jeena is oh enjoy this jeena. You're never it's so it's the best time
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:33.040]   It is that's what everyone says and I and I and I try to but it's it's hard
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:36.240]   It's hard. I didn't feel that way when I was in the middle of it either
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.800]   It's like can I get out of here
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:41.360]   When do I get to go to work?
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.440]   There's yeah, there are some days when it's like if we could just if I could just make it till bedtime
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:53.680]   And do they sleep maybe we could watch an episode of house of cars. I'll sleep in the middle of it
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.240]   Yeah, like that's exactly okay. No spoilers
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.880]   I finished season three
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:01.040]   Yeah, have you finished it jeff?
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:05.760]   Haven't started I kind of started but but getting some bad reviews. It's very different
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.480]   You know, that's almost a
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:15.680]   Have you watched any of it jeena? Yeah, we're we're a few in four maybe four in it's a little different, isn't it?
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:16.880]   Yeah
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.640]   Not so much in a good way
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.640]   Francis is kind of a wimp
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:26.400]   Well, yeah, I don't think this is a spoiler
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.520]   I don't think this is a spoiler, but if you don't like spoilers put your fingers in your ear
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.080]   I don't think this is spoiler, but in the last episode
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:40.080]   He yells and he loses his accent and I can't figure it out if that's because kevin spacey can't talk like this when he's yelling
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:45.840]   Or if they're telegraphing something that we're gonna learn about in season four. It's very strange
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:48.960]   Give me a hand sign is it over yet?
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:53.600]   So what he said was
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:57.600]   I'm actually very curious what you'll say about it jeff when the time comes
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:02.640]   Um, I should have downloaded it on my next seven so I can watch that on the plane. Oh do it now
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:06.880]   But I already paid for the one I started. I can't you can't download it. You know, it's so weird about house of cars
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:13.680]   And I can't figure this out is that some of the there are definitely some high-profile product placements for windows phones in it
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:20.720]   Uh like very high profile, but there's also iPhones and max and it's a very strange
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:23.440]   Thing they didn't get an exclusive on it
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:28.480]   I actually think they do a nice job. I like the way they just they display text message conversations
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:37.360]   Oh, it is windows phones. Okay, so it's funny because I thought oh they just picked a generic style for uh, you know, no, it's windows
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.160]   Okay, I clearly mikersoft gave them some money
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:43.760]   Um
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:47.840]   But not enough money for an exclusive. I guess that's the bottom line
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:52.320]   Um, yeah, there's windows phone sounds in it. There's a clear shots of screens
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:55.360]   Um
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.360]   Interesting
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:01.520]   Yeah, I I was a little disappointed. I confess not not not horribly so but
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:04.080]   It's just different. It's different
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.240]   It's different
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.680]   Uh
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:12.480]   I I'm gonna have to defer to jina on this. We wouldn't even have this story in the rundown if you weren't here jina
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:18.240]   Microsoft and google collaborate on angular 2 framework type script language
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.360]   what
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:25.280]   What does that mean? What is angular 2?
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.120]   So it's a web
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.240]   framework
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:33.440]   JavaScript framework. Yeah pretty pretty popular pretty well known
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:39.680]   I think some at some point somebody threw an angular t-shirt at me at at google. I owe at some point. I'm looking at it
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:47.840]   It looks great. Yeah, listen the more collaboration. I agree. That's better. That's great. You know, mikersoft makes a browser
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.600]   Uh
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:52.240]   Google makes a browser. I think I think collaboration is a good thing
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:58.160]   I don't think it's uh, you know is microsoft's kind of well. It's not a framework. It's a extension of javascript
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:04.880]   Uh, which I presume compiles into a javascript angular 2 will be written in type script
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.680]   and uh
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:09.680]   I presume at some point compile into
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.000]   plain old javascript
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:18.880]   Yeah, that's interesting. That's gonna be written in type script. Yeah. Yeah, I have I have friends working the microsoft stack. Absolutely love type scripts. Okay
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.600]   So, but then there's dart
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:27.920]   I'm it's so confusing. It's so many frameworks out there. It's it's really yeah
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:31.840]   What is a framework? Is it uh, it's not a language
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:34.960]   No, it's it's written in a language
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:41.200]   It's basically it's libraries that you can use to do to do very common actions without having to write all the code yourself
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.280]   Mm-hmm
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:47.040]   And then different frameworks have different take different approaches and are better in different situations
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.880]   Uh
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:54.720]   But yeah, I guess that's that's the simplest way to explain it right right Ruby on rails is a framework
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:01.280]   That's written in Ruby. It's a python framework. Yep. This is a javascript framework. Okay
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:06.800]   JavaScript is a probably a great language to know. I mean seems like so much is done in javascript
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:15.120]   Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. It's it's crazy. Well, because now javascript especially with things like node run server side as well as client side
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:20.080]   So it's really javascript and and and Jason has really come the the language of the web, right?
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:25.840]   Google has launched we'd heard rumors that they were going to launch an insurance
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:31.840]   Agency in fact what it looks like is google compare for auto insurance
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:36.480]   So this is from a search engine land
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.720]   um
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:44.560]   They with the tool which I guess is an app or is it a way it must is an app or website? I guess it's an app
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:50.320]   Google delivers 14. This is where you don't want to use it 14 sponsored listings
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:53.680]   from insurers with rate quote information
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:26:01.440]   Then you can buy policies online and by calling an agent from your phone is it just auto insurance or that's what it says right now
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.840]   Now it's only in california. So that may be why
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:09.040]   You you could probably see it, but it wouldn't be any good to you the program's going to roll out to more states
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:12.160]   The reason is insurance is regulated state by state
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.880]   So you have to go through the regulators in each i should have this in the change log. It looks like it's a web app
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.560]   Yeah google.com/compare/auto insurance
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:27.920]   So they we've been this has been rumored for a long time google at what a google employee got an insurance license
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:30.880]   There's been a lot of evidence that this was about to happen
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:39.040]   Google will act as a lead generator more than just add facilitator and pricing will be based on a cost per acquisition
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.040]   So they get a cut in other words
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.120]   So
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:47.440]   Does google have to go to the insurance business because self-driving cars have better be self-insured
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:51.600]   Well, it's i mean it's a business. It's a profit center. That's what i'm saying
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:56.720]   Is preparatory to autonomous vehicles if i don't drive the car why ensure me
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:02.000]   Ensure that which drives the car and that which is liable right
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.920]   What what are you ensuring then the computer?
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:12.160]   Yeah, you're ensuring the software seriously right if there's a bug of the software that kills somebody
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:15.760]   Am i liable because i'm sitting in the car?
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.040]   That means yeah, this car insurance has to be changed a little bit has to have some sort of
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:25.920]   There's already liability protection in your car insurance, but there might have to be some sort of umbrella protection for bad code
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.720]   Yeah, wow
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:31.440]   Met life and mercury insurance
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:39.840]   Two of the partners who offered quotes as google compare for car insurance rolls out to more states google says we'll also introducing ratings
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:45.600]   And reviews that's going to be pretty important as well as local agents support for providers with agent networks
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:58.400]   Insurance panel membership contact form so yeah, they're looking for more people to join the club. It's a business
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:03.200]   Google doesn't sell airplane tickets, but they're pre i mean uh
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:09.920]   So it's interesting, but they kind of i wonder if they have the same kind of relationship through it with airlines if you book
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:13.520]   Can you book through google no it sends you to there's the airline site
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:16.480]   But maybe you make a little money on the side i don't know
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:26.320]   Softcard which was isis poorly named it turned out which was the carrier's attempt to create a google like wallet
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.880]   Verizon for instance
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:32.080]   offered isis/softcard support
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:37.680]   But google bought softcard and now shutting down the apps for android and windows phone
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:41.200]   So i don't know what this means. I guess google wallet will
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:49.360]   Will take over uh google announced a deal with softcard to pre-install google wallet on us carrier devices
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:56.160]   I guess they i thought they bought softcard, but whatever softcards killing off the wallets
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:00.960]   And all wallets will be terminated
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:04.400]   Yeah, it's like install google wallet
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:10.000]   It was a joint venture between at and tt mobile and verizon i remember verizon blocked google wallet on my verizon phones
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.800]   Because they wanted to use their solution same idea tap to pay all that stuff
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.760]   Uh, yeah, he's wallet now
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:23.120]   Softcard pointing users to download google wallet
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:28.960]   Which does not have tap and pay on it on windows phone just on android and there is
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:33.040]   No issue on ios because there never was a softcard app for ios
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:39.120]   Uh, oh it's ten minutes to twig
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:41.680]   I get ready for twig
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:45.760]   I'm going up. Yeah, but i'll earn shit off. Yeah better get ready
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:49.440]   Uh, i'll find a number where's that number?
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:52.480]   Is that when you do that ten minutes
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:55.040]   Depends because i go through if i find one
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:30:02.160]   One of the things the apple watch does that's really interesting is wifi so the android where is bluetooth it ties your phone by bluetooth
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:06.720]   But you get outside of bluetooth range it's disconnected and it no longer has communication with the phone
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:13.040]   The apple watch will use wifi so as long as you're within the wifi network that your phone is on at home or at work
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:17.920]   The watch will work you can get a hundred feet away in our building i can go all the way the other side of the building and still
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:21.920]   The watch would still be connected to the phone apparently android where is going to get that
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:26.240]   Which is a i think great but now that's a software release
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:29.360]   But i think the watch would have to have wifi built in
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:38.560]   A source knowledgeable with android where's product roadmaps tells the verge the next software release will turn on wifi support
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:43.120]   Meaning features like notifications and google now will work when a bluetooth connection is unavailable
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:47.600]   Most did you know this most android where watch is already have wifi built in
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:50.880]   So it is literally just a firmware upgrade
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000]   What will happen to the battery life?
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000]   Ah good question
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.600]   Battery the mono 360 every firmware update has improved battery life
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:02.000]   Yeah
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.040]   What you know one one day out of a hundred it will suddenly get confused and
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:10.080]   Down but generally it's very good. Yeah, I think this is a huge
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:15.360]   Feature big deal. Yeah, my house. Yeah, the phone my watch will use the connection with my phone
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:20.960]   Which you know i leave in the front room and go in the back all the time and i installed that actually installed an app that lets me know
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:25.600]   That buzzes, you know when the watch is lost connection with the phone and it's all the time
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:28.560]   So this this would be huge that would irritate the hell out of me
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:35.200]   Yeah, it was stupid it was it was one of the first android where apps i ever installed and i was like oh, this is very useful and it's terry
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:39.680]   It's it's just like reminding you that it's not working the way it should work, you know
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:43.360]   I love it. I am thrilled that google is saying okay
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:48.480]   We're going head to head with apple watch. They're not they're not gonna go. Oh, well. It's over
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:51.840]   They're they're they're gonna try to maintain feature parity
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:54.880]   What I want to know is when is the pixel of watches coming out?
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:32:01.680]   Like a super nice one. Yeah, what was wasn't there a nice the lg r is very nice
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:07.120]   Well, there's the other one just there's another new one that came out of mw sim very it's like a thousand dollar watch
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:09.600]   Isn't it was big as you would invest
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:16.800]   Money and something you know it was weird. It has no life shelf life. No, no, that's why the
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:23.280]   $1000 apple watches just it's absurd. It's only for people who for whom $17,000 is like $20
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:30.240]   Here is the android where ad that was released just before apple's event
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:37.600]   Hi, hi, honey. Hi. Hi. Hi. What everyone is minus you could call me multiply. Just so you know. Yes. Yes. I'm my guy
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:40.880]   Very sprockets. This is me on the regular
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:45.280]   Yes, you know that I go. This is me on the regular. So you know
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:48.400]   I love I have to say I've loved those be together not
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:56.000]   Yeah, what is it a great campaign together? Not the same. Not the same. Yeah, it's exactly right and they're very soft sell because they don't really
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.320]   Say anything
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:04.400]   But it's and you can tell it's and right what's the social version of of fake different? Yeah, I love it
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:12.720]   Although I'd say I I'm I was surprised by the number of options that there are going to be for the apple watch
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:18.560]   Because it seems like apple generally goes with you know, this is the one true good thing
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:23.760]   Right, but it seems like apple watch. There's a lot of stylistic and options and price ranges
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:29.280]   Remember that whole thing about fragmentation difference the different apple watch sizes have different screen resolutions
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:34.800]   So for a programmer, yeah, that's a pain. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:37.520]   Just a little different
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:38.720]   So
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:41.360]   I guess we won't hear the word fragmentation from apple for a while
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.560]   So twitter bought periscope
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:49.920]   Which is a video streaming service that's gonna I presume be tied to twitter
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:52.720]   unfortunately
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:55.840]   Just in time for south by south west miercat launched
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:01.680]   Actually launching it in the last month and all the everybody's using miercat now. That's the thing miercat
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:05.440]   iOS only unfortunately which peeps me no end
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:10.880]   Miercat is I always only yeah, I don't know if uh, periscopals be supporting
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:16.880]   They will the miercat team actually got a bunch of their member their uh, you know
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:20.960]   Their programmers together over a weekend and created an app for android
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:25.840]   They call an unofficial miercat app just for viewing miercat video. No, no. I don't want it
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:31.520]   I want to stream right they're working on that and it'll happen eventually so there's a this is not a new category
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:34.240]   We've all played with quick remember quick. Yeah qwik
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:38.000]   And social cam no quick was bought by who bought quick
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.200]   Was it facebook somebody bought quick
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.840]   Yeah, um
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:49.040]   What's interesting is that we're in a new age skype skype bought quick
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.320]   That's right
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:53.280]   And there was social cam from justin.tv same idea
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:35:00.160]   But I used both and I loved the idea but streaming was really rocky and and people it was hard for good to watch
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:04.240]   But we've just approved so much our bandwidth and our cameras and our phones and stuff
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:10.560]   I mirror I did an hour and a half miercat yesterday with at the end of mac break weekly into lunch. We had a thousand viewers
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:16.800]   It was incredible and the and it's friction-free because it's twitter so you sign up with your twitter account
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:25.600]   It automatically tweets that you started the stream people can chat in the stream, but their chat comments go out as twitter comments as well
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:28.240]   It's really interesting
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:34.160]   It's and you know what it clear that they're planning that this is gonna they're hoping to be the thing at south by
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:42.080]   Todd lesson um so I got shot a correction from david schmitt on twitter that the
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:45.360]   Highway
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:49.280]   Well, I was in the wrong age is silent
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:55.600]   349 euros which right now is gonna be the euro as i'm going to be rich tonight. I was about to hit parity with the dollar
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:57.680]   No, it's like a buck seven
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:59.680]   Yeah, what the what?
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:03.200]   Guess I I thought the american century was over. I guess it's not
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:06.800]   um
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.800]   friend feed
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:16.960]   Officially dead. I love friend feed. It was the uber of social it was the uber
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:26.240]   This is the uber of shown we're the uber of podcasts. We totally are so facebook bought show title
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:33.840]   Yep, and bret taylor who was the creator of friend fee became the cto facebook and it's been there so long that he's actually
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.320]   I think he just left facebook didn't he go he left a while ago didn't he he's doing his own thing
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:44.880]   Uh, but this is sad. They bought friend feed for 50 million dollars. That's nothing chicken feed
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.840]   um
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:51.360]   So I guess they're putting it putting it to bed
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:55.920]   Uh the reason no one's using it. Oh still alive. Huh?
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:00.880]   Did you know it was still alive? Uh no well everyone's while I go to friend feed.com and i'd see that
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:06.320]   But it was all it was a ghost town because it because the mistake friend feed made which from which google learned was
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:09.600]   They allow you to pipe other feeds into friend feed right
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:12.000]   The fact that was the whole kind of the premise of it
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.800]   So I uh still have a friend feed account and it's still being posted all this stuff is just being cross posted from other
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:21.040]   So yeah, it's very much alive
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:26.560]   But uh, it's not what he's using it. It's a very much of the great
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:31.680]   Uh, it was a nickelodeon game show and my favorite game category ever was dead or Canadian
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:35.440]   That's terrible. It is
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:41.440]   Uh, but that's kind of something friend feed or dead. Yeah, it's uh, I have no idea some of these sites are still around
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:46.640]   Yeah, I love friend feed. I really thought this was like i see q is i see q still around
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:49.440]   Uh, that was purchased by aol. I think a well
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:54.560]   I still was a folded in. I don't know. I see q. Let's see
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:57.120]   Let's surf to icq.com
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:04.880]   Why yes, it's still around with video calls free messages and low-cost phone calls, but the site is really slow
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:09.600]   Can you measure the portion like out there? What? I'm the product manager for icq
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:16.960]   Sorry any chance I could get to play the sound effect for my i cq. That's right
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:20.640]   That's what that was yeah, that was the icq sound
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:27.360]   Said it's so familiar. Yeah people are looking right now. They're looking at their computer. So I know I got a message
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:34.880]   We've been maintaining this is uh friend feed's statement to recode
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:37.280]   We've been maintaining the service for the last five years
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:41.680]   But usage has been declining steadily the community is now just a fraction of what it once was
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:44.400]   Even this we've decided it's time to start winding things down
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:47.760]   Our thanks go out to the friend feed community for its many years
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:50.560]   Bye bye of sub-bye. Bye. Bye. Bye
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.760]   ball
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.840]   That was an act whoa higher
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:59.840]   Uh
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:03.360]   Anything else we want to talk about before we take a break and get our tips. Oh giga home
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:06.640]   Oh, yeah, so what happened?
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.120]   Seriously, what happened?
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:13.120]   There's an interview here with Matthew engram actually i haven't read through it
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:14.320]   Somebody in the chat room
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:19.680]   It's journalist if you got it we and we got to get matthe matthew engram and kevin tothful both regulars on our show
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:23.120]   uh great writers uh stacey higan bottom
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:26.160]   jenko recgers the
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:31.280]   ome had left the side a year ago because he wanted to become a venture capitalist. I think he was
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.960]   You know still part of the company. In fact, he tweeted
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:40.640]   Yesterday or the day before when the news came out. I just left giga home for the last time and
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:46.480]   You know my heart is breaking. Um, um, home has not I don't think given any interviews
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:51.200]   Were there any indications?
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:54.480]   You know, sure, are there any indications this is going to happen before monday? No
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:59.360]   You were just totally blindsided. Yeah, and I think the majority of staff were as well
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:05.280]   We were writing right up to the announcement kevin toffle posted an apple watch announcement minutes before the news came out
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:10.560]   We did get a new ceo recently. So I think people thought maybe there needed to be some changes maybe some
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:14.720]   Strategic changes, but there was little literally no talk of even layoffs
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:18.880]   But I think when I looked at the about pages as I was I couldn't find the ceo on it
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.880]   So
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.880]   So what happened? Uh
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:28.960]   Giga home, which is a great tech blog one that we read religiously and many of its contributors were
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:32.160]   regulars on this show and other uh twitch shows
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:37.440]   Um had taken I think eight million dollars in venture funding over the last couple of years
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:43.920]   No, that was just last year. I think total of three million 23 last year. I think so. Yeah, holy. I think you're right
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:46.480]   eight million last year
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:51.120]   Um, but weirdly enough they say the on their clothes
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:55.600]   They put a closing announcement on this on the page saying this is it. We're shutting the doors
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:00.240]   And they said uh the the creditors own us now. We're done
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:05.840]   So it's not a bankruptcy exactly. It's not a chapter. It's just go. We're going on
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:10.800]   Giga home recently became unable to pay its creditors in full at this time as a result
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:16.400]   The company is working with its creditors that have the rights to all of the companies assets as they're collateral
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.800]   all operations have ceased
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:23.600]   We do not know at this time what the lenders intend to do with the assets or if there will be any future operations
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:31.280]   And that was lenders of course with were senior 22.3 million and six rounds according to how do you go through 22.3 million and they had ads
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:34.080]   Yeah, is this bad
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:35.520]   last eight million
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:41.440]   The last eight million in February 2014 from read all severe ventures alloy ventures true ventures and shay ventures
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:42.960]   Wow
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:48.160]   They didn't have a lot of ads. They have some ads true and loi. We're in for a lot of it. That's a google ad
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:51.200]   These are all google ads
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:55.280]   What is this what is this portend for the future of uh, I know
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.440]   I see everybody's don't want somebody want me to a story on that
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:03.520]   We don't know enough to know anything right danny's all been wrote a good piece about how you know being the being the tortoise is a better way to go
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:07.760]   Um, don't take my thing is one you're the same way
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:12.720]   Um, I you know, I think that's one lesson in a media company unless you have an entirely new model
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:14.800]   We have no credit so
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:22.240]   And no other owners and no other owners so the in order for us to go out of business people would just have to stop watching and advertisers
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:26.400]   Would have to stop buying ads both of which could happen at any time, but it wouldn't be a sudden thing
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:29.920]   It would be a slow slow degradation
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:34.800]   Um, so something this sudden is is kind of odd. I don't I can't it's very odd
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:37.840]   I don't think that's why I think speculating is pretty meaningless
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:40.640]   I mean it's fine to contrast and look you know, danny's almost pieces a good one
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:45.360]   Saying here's how i'm running this right uh rafid Ali doesn't believe in taking too much
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:50.240]   Venture money. I think he's right. Um, so it doesn't mean that
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:54.400]   For well for instance, and somebody in the chat room said said it
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:58.640]   I don't who cares there's a hundred other blogs. I don't
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:01.760]   People no longer go to a blog and read the stories
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:04.560]   They get links from twitter or other sources
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:09.440]   Yeah, well the difference here is the gig ome was making money not just by being a tech blog
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:14.400]   But it had its high ed reports. It had events. It was trying to move past just a volume based
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:16.960]   How tech crunch made made
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:20.080]   Made its money was it said oh, we're gonna do we're gonna do conferences
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:23.600]   There's a lot more money in conferences than there is in being a tech blog
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:28.560]   Yeah, you're still dependent upon advertisers sponsors for it, but it's it's you're not dependent upon a
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:34.480]   commodifying business of impressions the mass business model is dying
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:39.600]   What's unknown now their big big data conference structure is coming up in a week
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:43.440]   Yeah, I don't even know who the lenders are
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:48.960]   Yeah, so who so when these creditors are not talking about their invest they're not their venture capitalist
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:51.360]   No, because your lent your lenders are senior to that
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:54.240]   Okay in a bankruptcy
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:56.160]   Oh in a bankruptcy. Yeah
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:58.000]   So that could be rent
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:04.000]   That could be servers. It just could be lines of credit too, but it could be they
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:10.400]   You got eight billion dollars venture last year and you have and you can't pay your creditors. Yeah
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:13.120]   I mean, I don't want to speculate. This is
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:16.000]   Yeah, I mean this could just be straight up mismanagement
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.600]   I mean I hate to say this because we love you
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:21.680]   Oh when we love oh and we love all the writers there and we love their work and we've talked about it here, right?
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:25.600]   But it's possible that this isn't like a sign of what's coming in the future
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:28.320]   It's possible. This is just straight up mismanagement
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:31.760]   By the way, it has to be so there's no conclusion to be drawn
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:39.200]   It's not it doesn't mean that tech blogs aren't going to be lucrative or you're not not even lucrative self-supporting or not necessarily
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:41.520]   I would love to hear and I and who knows
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:46.480]   You know if it gets me as if you go to the about page
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:49.280]   business team
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:52.320]   No ceo there all vice presidents executive editors there
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:57.440]   The ceo disappeared sort of I don't that's what that's what strikes me as odd here
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:00.240]   Is that he took the money and ran no
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:02.080]   board
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:05.200]   The board was read also via true alloy
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:11.520]   Oh and shave ventures. Yeah, so the board was four ventures and the founder well
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:18.880]   What's really sad is there are a lot of people that we love out of work all of a sudden without a preparation and
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:25.600]   We if I could hire them I would but I don't want to I don't want to bankrupt my company either and uh
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:31.440]   So on the editorial on the editorial side is signy Brewster is karson barbera
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:33.760]   caramel de michis
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:38.880]   Kay farenbacher. We've had many of these people on kevin fritchard. Derek Harris Stacy higob bottom matthew ingram
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:40.880]   We love you matthew
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:47.280]   There's a long list of yanko records kevin toffle was just on last week. I think oh I so well boarski
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:53.120]   Paul while boarski who was ceo he stepped down in september 2014 and they had a interim ceo brought in
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:58.000]   But he's not on the he's not on the on the no business listing
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:03.600]   Uh something that's a little something we are so
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:07.760]   I think this is this is not something to extrapolate. Yeah, good
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:10.640]   We know more let's hope let's hope not and om hasn't spoken
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:15.040]   No one's spoken really except matthew with this uh one interview with the clummy of journalism review
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:18.080]   Om just said to kara swisher not now dude right
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:23.920]   Cara of course reached out and said what really was said was some of the other tech blogs piling on
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:29.120]   Yeah, that's mean. This is a lot. Well, you know what? I've seen this happen with other closures
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:32.320]   The various thing would think I think was stacey was out on twitter immediately
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:37.280]   Just singing the praises of every single staff or why you should hire them. Yes, which is a generous thing to do. Yes
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:39.120]   Yes
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:44.560]   Yeah, and these are all very talented folks who I I don't think are gonna have trouble finding their next thing
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:49.200]   Uh, but certainly we should all help them recco their work and we will and we do yeah
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:57.680]   Uh one reason this is so strange giga. Oh, it seemed like it was doing so well. What should the takeaway be for other media outlets cga r asks
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:02.400]   Uh matthew engrom everyone has their own favorite lesson matthew says danny sullivant search engine land
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:07.120]   Talked about what this says about taking venture capital money when you're a media company and that's part of the story
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:11.920]   Giga om has been vc finance from the beginning other media startups were not and when you take venture capital
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:16.400]   Their golden handcuffs in a way. It's a foustian bargain you make certain promises about your growth
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:21.920]   If that growth doesn't materialize then vcs lose interest in your company fails, but they didn't say it was a vcs that pulled the blood
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:22.880]   No, no
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:28.400]   Means it was they ran out of money and obviously the vcs chose not to pour more in and at 22.3 million
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:32.480]   I get that yeah, they ran out of runway. Yeah, but the issue here was they ran out of runway. Yeah
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:34.800]   um
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:37.920]   And so was where they had a burn rate of eight million
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:46.160]   Well, my name is a couple of million. I mean, but well, they but they went through eight million dollars in the last year
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:52.320]   That's a lot and they had revenue on top of that. That means their their burn rate was higher than that at 10 million. Yeah, whatever. Yeah
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:55.040]   That's a lot. It's a lot
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:56.560]   We don't know what their deaths were before that
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:01.680]   I mean and the fact that the you know, the math he was totally blindsided that they didn't they didn't do any cutbacks or
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:04.880]   Starity manager, you know, I mean generally you see this coming right? I
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:10.240]   It's that's why it sounds like just kind of mismanagement if somebody messed up who handles the money
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:13.440]   but it's it's sad and um
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:15.360]   As a you know
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:19.360]   Before I was a business business owner. I would have maybe rolled my eyes and said oh, you know
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:23.600]   They took BC and they made about now as a business owner. It's like I really has like feel the hurt
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:26.480]   I could really can feel you know what it's like. Yeah, you know, uh,
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:32.320]   As he says there are 22 people on the editorial staff, so it's a you could you could easily have a
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:38.240]   Multi-million dollar burn rate for that alone. What's your total staff Leo 20? Yeah
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:43.680]   But we don't know what their business
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:48.080]   But their business side and events side and sales side. I don't know what their total total was right
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:54.240]   I would imagine it was north of 30. I know I'm did post on his blog, but it was mostly it wasn't and what happened?
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:56.240]   It was just sad. Yeah
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:00.480]   Okay, well there we go. Well, that's a Debbie downer
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:06.640]   You know what it's what happens and meanwhile vox is going into the entertainment business
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:10.800]   So this is this this is this is also breaking news has happened during the show vox is
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:13.440]   So vox which owns start with SB nation
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:15.840]   Right
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:17.840]   Am I wrong exactly then the work?
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:25.280]   It's a blog company then the verge. Uh, they have a gaming what curved they bought curved and they started vox as a brand
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:27.440]   They have polygon, which is a gaming brand
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:31.360]   Now they're launching an entertainment division and have signed a deal
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:34.720]   Uh with wme who's that?
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:38.880]   Is it an agency is that an agency must be

[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:57.680]   Wow one of the powerful things about vox is they hit so many different verticals said daniel porter headed digital at wme
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:00.160]   Is that william morris?
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:04.960]   There's a wealth of a baby. I think it may be to uh tell stories that hit different audiences
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:10.800]   So vox which was a sports blog and then a tech blog and then a lifestyle blog and then a gaming blog

[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:51.760]   They have such a good search engine. It makes it easy to find exactly the image you want
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:55.760]   You could choose individual image packs or get a monthly subscription. That's what we do
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:03.680]   Um, we have the 25 a day. I think uh subscription, which is great for a publication. We all of us use it
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:06.240]   And uh, it's great
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:09.920]   Download any image in any size you pay only once it's uh, it's a really
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:17.760]   Wonderful way to bring life to your project and their ipad app is awesome. We'll be award-winning
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:23.200]   Let's you search on the go. You can display images during presentations. You can share light boxes of images
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:25.440]   In fact you do that part for free
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:27.600]   Just create a free account
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:33.120]   And you'll get to use the search tools. You'll get to use the light boxes to save images for inspiration or to share them with others
[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:39.760]   Multilingual customer service there in more than a dozen countries worldwide full-time customer support throughout the week
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:42.720]   So create the free account. You don't have to give them a credit card number
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:46.320]   You might want to though because then you're going to see images and say I need that
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:50.320]   But let me tell you once you start once you decide you need to purchase
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:56.880]   Get an image my recommendation is do what we do get an image subscription package, especially since I can get you 20 off
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:54:02.960]   Any image subscription package when you use the africode twig 315 that's for march 2015
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:06.160]   So twig 315 20 off

[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:02.400]   So

[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.040]   You want to click on one of the results, but it's a nice a nicely formatted
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:36.960]   Knowledge graph card that tells you the ingredients and kind of how to put it put them together

[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:16.080]   It was just catching up to being just chasing those chair lights on the on the cocktail front and ps chup says and I think he's right that
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:21.920]   google was asking people to uh rate and update the recipes like is there a link there that says
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:24.720]   Got a better idea on how to make an old fashion
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:30.400]   Click click this link. Oh, that's well. That's part. We remember that how to how to eat sushi
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:35.040]   The bot right right so you kind of do want people because these are clearly
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:37.280]   Just algorithmic they're pulling them from
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:41.040]   From from pages. This is these aren't editors writing these
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:45.680]   How to make an old fashioned nice just ask how to make a
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:50.720]   Ex I wonder what it'll tell me if I say sapphire and tonic. How do you make a sapphire in total?
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:52.960]   No, it doesn't tell you
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:56.960]   It's a gin
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:00.080]   Oh, there we go
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:02.880]   Nice cubes add
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:04.960]   That's a
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:09.280]   Stereacle that's the simplest recipe I ever saw I can make that that is a
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:13.280]   I like that the text gets bigger
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:20.720]   The box that's great schools like you obviously need this larger text if you're googling how to make a gin and tonic
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:22.720]   And here's a photo
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:30.800]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, do you have a pic of the way do indeed?
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:34.240]   Loon
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:39.760]   Google says the balloon that brings internet access can cover a state the size of
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:42.080]   Well, Rhode Island
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:47.360]   Has an 80 kilometer radius. I mean is it radius or diameter? Oops. Oops. I forget
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:51.360]   80 kilometer
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.920]   I'm messing this up aren't I how big is a
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:56.880]   Diameter diameter
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:03.440]   49.7 mile diameter. No, that's about the size of Rhode Island. Oh, I see the the footprint of the
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:05.840]   Footprint of the thing. Yeah
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:08.960]   So
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:13.520]   Balloon that would be a big balloon. They've done tests with it at 4g getting 10 megs
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:15.920]   um
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:20.800]   The record setter has been up for 187 days. Google says that's plenty because they want to upgrade the technology all the time
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:22.480]   So three months is fine
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:24.240]   anywhere from
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:29.840]   So the record setter circumnavigated the globe nine times enduring temperatures as low as minus 75 to
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:32.320]   centigrade
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:37.520]   Wind speeds as high as 291 kilometers per hour soaring to a height of 21 kilometers
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:41.600]   And drifting over more than a dozen countries across four continents
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:48.160]   So I just found that interesting and that might have something to do with their cellular ambitions as well
[01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:50.960]   It might well wouldn't be full else fails loon
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:54.960]   and provide like self-service worldwide with balloons
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:58.160]   Be kind of interesting, right?
[01:58:58.160 --> 01:59:00.480]   How do you make jizz frozen?
[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:02.240]   Is that in there?
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:06.720]   I just tried how to make a million dollars. That didn't do anything. I did how to make meatballs and it shows
[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:09.600]   It shows me how to make meatballs. Oh, you did. Look
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:12.160]   Combine the milk
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:16.400]   Breadcrumbs pour the milk over the breadcrumbs set aside whisk the egg
[01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:20.400]   Combine the egg and ground meat. I don't know what this comes from the kitchen calm
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:22.960]   But that's in the knowledge ground. How do you get to these?
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:25.920]   I search for make meatballs
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:30.160]   I don't make milk meatballs myself, but
[01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:36.800]   Apparently I tried to say it makes cash on the rocks. It gave me nothing scotch on the rocks. What is it gonna say?
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:39.440]   Oh, that's why
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:42.160]   make nagroni
[01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:46.080]   I I can't show it on the show. Yeah, there you go. There you go

[01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:53.440]   garnish with
[01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:58.640]   If this from this came up in my mind because sam bittles hysterical, but unpublishable
[01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:00.560]   article
[02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:02.320]   Ungocker
[02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:07.120]   Basically has a pledge that uh, you will never sleep with anybody wearing an apple watch
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:09.280]   I
[02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:12.960]   Know sex for apple watch wares
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:19.040]   And if you haven't read it, it is it is exactly what you hope sam bittle will write
[02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:21.520]   mocking
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:23.120]   The apple watch
[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:29.040]   Googling right now. Yeah, it's not a talker. It's very funny. I say with my model 360 on so okay
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:34.640]   And this is another question. What happened to dan lions who was the uh, uh, let her in chief of, uh
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:37.360]   gocker for like three minutes
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:43.040]   Right then got a book deal. It's not see you later. Well, I know he also started some kind of a startup thing, right?
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:46.480]   So what uh, what's the d so okay, so who's now in charge?
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:51.200]   Over there. He he took over valley wag not not gocker entirely but valley wag
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:54.480]   Biddle was the guy at valley wag. It was quite good
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:59.760]   Oh, well, yeah, it was quite something. This is great
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:02.960]   But I can't show it
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:06.480]   Rude our family friendly status immediately
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:12.960]   I don't know. I don't know. I I can't keep track of the master at gawk. I don't know who's who's uh
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:20.160]   We we we always I talked to jina about this because she because life hacker which she founded it and is a gawker property
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:26.720]   She knows max. It looks like max read is the editor in chief at the moment. Oh, okay. He gets a temporary
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:29.520]   placeholder
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:34.480]   Well as paul for to we says max read is the eponymous max read he gets a lot of
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:37.040]   So
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:38.720]   He would be
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:42.720]   My uh, my tool is something we talked about a few weeks actually more like a few months ago
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:51.040]   I really like it and I want to give him another plug. They now have a pro version of known I set up my uh self-hosted
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:56.400]   Known, but if you go to with known.com. This is a ben word miller and uh erin joe
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:59.120]   Uh, oh, what's erin's last name miller
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:06.240]   Uh, there or is it rich is a great guys really great and this is you know, it's a blogging tool
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:11.200]   The idea is that uh, it's your your place on the web and then when you post
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:16.400]   You can cross post to facebook and twitter and now linked in and four square and soundcloud
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:19.520]   Uh, they say google plus pages are imminent
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:23.920]   Um, and that'll be a feature of the new pro version $100 a year
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:28.000]   Uh, and I wanted to support them. I just I think they're doing such a great job
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:35.840]   And I'd been running a self-hosted one, but I just moved my uh, my known blog leoville.net over to uh, their hosted solution
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:42.560]   Um, so just a little little plug for them. I think they do a great job and um, it's so much fun when you make a post
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:45.680]   They'll i'll sign in real quickly and show you
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:49.360]   um, what it looks like when you make a post because
[02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:55.920]   Sign in please mr. Guest sign in please
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:00.640]   Uh, because it's uh, it's kind of neat. So if I make a new post
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:05.120]   I have all of these i've added all my twitter accounts my facebook pages
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:11.840]   Uh, if I do a post that is a as I just did a check-in I can have it go to
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:15.840]   Uh, four square as a check-in on four square
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:21.440]   Um, this is kind of nice. So basically the idea is everything you post should start on your own site and then
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:25.040]   Be syndicated or sent elsewhere if I post a photo
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:29.200]   Uh, I could put it on twitter facebook linked in flicker as well
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:32.080]   Is in there and they seem to be adding more all the time
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:36.560]   They were gonna do a whole education thing, but now they're just doing this platform which I think is much better much smarter
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:42.080]   I like oh, so oh that's interesting because I noticed that they uh, they still have the known for education
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:43.520]   But do you say this is a good they have there?
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:46.960]   But I think I think it's a smart to just make it a make it a product and see where it goes. He uses it
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:52.080]   It's a good server. I like it. It's kind of like tumble log or tumblr or maybe uh, I miss postress postress
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:57.200]   The idea postress was you email stuff to your blog and it then from there can go elsewhere post haven is
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:04:00.560]   kind of the uh haven for postress users
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:05.360]   But uh, this is I think is very slick and elegant they keep adding features to it. I like it
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:09.920]   So take a look at it's free to use the basic version and then they have a
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:14.800]   Pro version which just came out with known dot
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:20.640]   Calm and I I will continue to post little stuff because you can do it from your phone too
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:24.640]   They also have a little they have some little cool little javascript things like here's a
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:27.280]   See if I got to find it
[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:34.080]   Uh older it's a there's a little you can lose little javascript plugins. This one's from the uh, uh, night
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:38.480]   Uh fellowship or night folks where you can whoops
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:45.200]   You can embeds. I know a wedding picture. You can embed, uh, some javascript. Let's make this bigger
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:47.840]   That'll play back uh audio
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:50.320]   So for you could podcast with this very nicely
