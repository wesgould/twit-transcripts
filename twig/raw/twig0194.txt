[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.040]   One billion Android phones.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.880]   Within the next nine months, we'll talk about that.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.140]   Eric Schmidt says he likes Facebook home.
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.680]   That mark, he's a nice boy.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.280]   And a preview of the new HTC One from Android.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.020]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.280]   the show where we cover Google, the Googleverse,
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.440]   the cloudverse.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.240]   We just talk about whatever the hell we want to, really.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.320]   With Gina Trapani, smartawear.org,
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.400]   and thinkup.com.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.320]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.960]   Hello.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.680]   Good to be here.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.000]   So nice to see you again, also the host, of all about Android.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.160]   All about Android.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.720]   I got a little something for you today.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.960]   I'll show you.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.480]   Oh, boy.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.640]   Oh, you got the one?
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.160]   Oh, you figured it out.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.600]   Sorry.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.600]   Don't.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.600]   It didn't mean that.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.080]   It didn't mean to pre-enter it.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.040]   I'm so excited that thing is so beautiful.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.920]   Oh, I love it.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.400]   I'm in love.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.960]   But anyway, we'll talk about it in a moment.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.880]   Because first, I have to say hello to our other hosts,
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.200]   Jeff Jarvis, from BuzzMachine.com,
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.840]   Professor of Journalism.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.920]   Graduate Professor of Journalism.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.720]   I love you anyway, Jeff.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.680]   I love you anyway.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.240]   You're going to keep this up, huh?
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.800]   We're going to have a few--
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.480]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.920]   Just before the show, you're doing the Salty Mic Chromebook
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.080]   again.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.840]   You won't let it go.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.440]   It's my fault.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.000]   Oh, now it's my fault.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.920]   Yes, it is.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.440]   OK.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.960]   Jeff is also Professor of Journalism at City--
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.480]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480]   --resit of journalism, it's--
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.120]   Or as Peter would say.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.120]   It's not--
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.280]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.320]   You weren't really doing that.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.520]   Were you doing that?
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.480]   Oh, yes, I loved what I was.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.880]   I loved what I was.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.880]   Hey, look, there's another person here.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.280]   Also with us Lamar Wilson, YouTuber Lamar Wilson,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.640]   the host of our show this week in YouTube every Sunday
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.520]   on the Twitter network.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.160]   How are you?
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.840]   Good to be here.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.560]   Nice to have you.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.280]   He's also, of course, on YouTube Lamar Wilson.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.360]   Hey, I got a YouTube story.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.800]   We'll lead off with a YouTube story.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.000]   You know our show this week in YouTube?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.640]   Blocked on YouTube.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.280]   Oh, no.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.120]   What?
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.800]   Blocked already?
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.480]   Well, not the show, but--
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.480]   The whole damn show.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.800]   The latest episode.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.040]   Well, there's only one dude.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.480]   This is the first episode.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.960]   Well, we have zero still on there.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.920]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.760]   Oh, yeah, there is an episode zero.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.320]   It's a zero.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.200]   It's a survive.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.120]   So is it--
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.280]   Is it T-W-I-Y-T on YouTube?
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.520]   YouTube.com/T-W-
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.960]   It's this week Y-T.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.480]   This week Y-T.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.600]   This week Y-T.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.480]   Now, we're theorizing that maybe we
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.680]   don't get as much slack on this because we're
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.240]   a new YouTube channel.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.200]   I bet that's what it is.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.120]   That's why we need-- we have a contact at Google.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.080]   We need to push this probably to him.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.040]   Because I think that's what it is.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.520]   It's a new account.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.840]   And a lot of spam accounts come up new,
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.880]   and they start putting up illegal content right away.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.080]   Right.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.960]   So they're probably treating us no differently.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.760]   That's what I would guess.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.880]   I would hope.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.800]   So what-- the weird thing is that it
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.600]   was one of those automatic content things.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.200]   And it was by sigh.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.920]   Remember, sigh was very famous in his first video,
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.280]   Opal Gondam's style, that he let everybody do anything
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.040]   they wanted with it.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.320]   I don't know if they issued takedowns,
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.680]   but it was very free.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.680]   And there was-- it was sigh was--
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.240]   That's what he never did.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.360]   No, no, no takedowns.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.840]   Well, boom, he's got to know his song.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.880]   Now, I guess he's a big shot.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.080]   Doesn't need anybody.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.240]   We played just a few, maybe 15, 20 seconds of his new video.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.960]   Right?
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.480]   And talked a little bit about it.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.240]   How hard it might be to do it.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.280]   It wasn't even the whole thing.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.960]   No.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.440]   Which by the way, sucks.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.680]   But here's the interesting thing.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.280]   Now, Chad, correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.280]   But they said the automatic content filter detected
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.680]   as a live performance of that song.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.680]   Yeah, the live performance of sighs of news--
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.240]   the new song.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.400]   I don't even know what that's going to be.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.560]   So we appealed it.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.320]   They did have the appeal process.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.240]   And they said no.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.680]   Well, no, they said sure, but it's
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.560]   going to take us-- it could take us up to a month to get to it.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.960]   No.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.160]   Which for a new show is a big deal.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.880]   That's episode--
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.400]   I could make that go faster.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.120]   That's ridiculous.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.800]   Well, we're going to pull in all our chips with people like you.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.920]   You know what I think you should do?
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.120]   You should go back and edit it.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.200]   You should just have a sunscreen that says,
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.000]   "Sigh as a jerk" during that time.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.960]   That's a great idea, Jeff.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.280]   And we did that.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.800]   Except--
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.600]   And it's still?
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.160]   Except now that our account is no longer in good standing,
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.240]   we can only upload videos less than 15 minutes long.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.520]   We'll have to have a mini show.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.080]   "Googlers, YouTubers."
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.240]   No, I have a guy.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.960]   I have a guy.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.120]   Let's take care of her.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.960]   We're theorizing that-- because first of all, it's fair use.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.160]   We didn't play the whole song.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.720]   It's a new show.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.760]   It's commentary.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.400]   And normally, we can make that appeal.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.800]   Because we get knocked down all the time on all of our channels.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.480]   But there's so many shows that do-- what's trending does this--
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.160]   I mean, that's the basis of their show,
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.240]   is to put other people's videos in there.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.800]   And they get away with it.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.200]   So they get there.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.400]   Yeah, but she has a lot better looking than I am.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   And I think that she--
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.560]   This is accurate.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.400]   So--
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.000]   Now, let me show you.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.320]   I just got an email from YouTube.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.240]   It happens all the time.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.640]   I don't even know what show this is.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.320]   This might be a Twitter episode.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.400]   They just blocked it.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.960]   This video contains content from a Brazilian radio--
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.760]   it doesn't, by the way, from either of these--
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.240]   in a Hungarian television station.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.800]   One or more of whom have blocked it.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.440]   They pulled this video down, even though there
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.080]   is-- I guarantee you no Brazilian or Hungarian content
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.040]   at all.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.920]   There have to be penalties for these bad take-backs.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.040]   This happens so much.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.680]   We need some sort of slap shield law or something.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.040]   And from an article, I think we saw--
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.240]   and we talked about maybe two weeks ago,
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.440]   I have to dig it up.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.840]   This may actually get worse with some new rules.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.760]   Remember, yeah, we talked about this universal guy
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.280]   in--
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.120]   UMG.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.280]   And so there might not be any appeal processes.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.680]   That's something you actually brought to light.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.600]   The episode before--
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.200]   Well, I think you should be--
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.480]   I mean, I think you should threaten
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.160]   Si and these come back.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.960]   It's with suits.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.280]   Counter suits?
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.360]   Yeah, suit them.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.200]   They're clearly losing your business.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.480]   There is tangible damage to you.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.400]   I think that's going to turn this around a bit.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.800]   And Google finds itself in the middle of those things.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.600]   They don't want that.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.080]   No.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.080]   And like I said, we have a rep that
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.720]   reached out to us.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.040]   They like to show-- they've blessed the show.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.800]   They have a place for that.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.880]   That was YouTube in the name.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.760]   And so that's the guy I said I was going to reach out to.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.960]   Because he said, if you have any trouble, let me know.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.600]   Hey, guess what?
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.200]   We've got trouble.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.960]   We've got trouble.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.200]   And so I'm not going to whine about this.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.360]   But what it does raise is this larger issue.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.720]   If YouTube wants--
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.800]   how do they balance this?
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.440]   I mean, I remember when YouTube started,
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.640]   before Google bought it, we were talking to the founders of--
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.680]   I think it was Jeffrey Chen we were talking to,
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.120]   one of the founders of YouTube.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.320]   And I asked him that question.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.240]   This was the six-month-old startup.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.840]   Aren't you going to get sued out of existence?
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.000]   And he didn't have really a very good-- he said no,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.640]   but he didn't have a very good answer.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.040]   I think he was already negotiating with Google.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.680]   I have to think that this was the best way to save this company
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.240]   is to pair up with Google.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.080]   Google's response is, no, we're going
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.980]   to use the Safe Harbor provisions of the Digital
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.040]   and Name Copyright Act.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.280]   We're going to offer DMC takedowns.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.920]   And content providers will have a good recourse.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.120]   But now it's swung so far in the opposite direction
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.600]   that independent content creators like me,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.520]   and I'm sure others, right, Lamar, are getting hurt by this.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.480]   Yeah, it's so many people that are getting hit by this.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.400]   And some, again, journalists like yourself
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.320]   or just people who are innocently just
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.200]   trying to create good content or commentary
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.720]   are getting hit unfairly.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.880]   And again, there may be no appeal for us in the future.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.440]   And I think, on one hand, on a business side,
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.760]   they feel like they have to do this to keep everybody happy.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.440]   That's on the business side.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.920]   But it hurts content creators like us, obviously.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.960]   And so I don't see a way out of this
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.080]   unless we do what Jeff said and some type of legal action.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:53.640]   I can't--
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.040]   I can't go around suing Hungarian television
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.440]   and Brazilian radio.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.400]   I'm not going to-- I don't-- I'm not litigious.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.520]   I think you're right, Jeff.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.840]   That would be a good thing to do.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.240]   But I think there's an opportunity here
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.160]   for the likes of an EFF to give cover to a Google
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.920]   to say that there's a real tangible business damage
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.360]   that's being caused here.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.560]   And we can't just really nilly take this.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.720]   And the goal to force is Google to say
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.760]   that if you issue three bad takedown notices in a row,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.360]   you're out for a month.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.720]   Let's penalize them.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.920]   So there's a couple of--
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.400]   Yeah, there's a couple of things that come to mind.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.680]   First of all, I think--
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.840]   and I've mentioned this before-- that people are gaming it.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.200]   I don't think either this Brazilian or Hungary.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.920]   Now, normally what I would say is
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.880]   they wouldn't do a takedown.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.960]   They'd want to have ads placed on our content
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.280]   and make a little money off it.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.000]   So a takedown-- I don't understand the benefit of that.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.800]   But it's obviously an erroneous takedown.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.880]   But the second point--
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.800]   So we think this is because the ad ran on that channel.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.400]   And so they're matching--
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:50.760]   No.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.480]   I mean, the video that you featured also ran on this--
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.400]   No, I'm hungry.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.560]   Well, I hope not on Hungarian radio.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:56.840]   And--
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.560]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.840]   Maybe they did some commentary.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.000]   I mean, you know, maybe you kind of a similar thing, right?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.800]   And then the bot sort of erroneous picked up,
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.440]   made the match run related to--
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:05.940]   I don't know.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.560]   I'm trying to imagine how this happened.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.680]   But anyway, so go ahead, Leo.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.320]   I didn't mean to interrupt.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.360]   So that's one issue.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.880]   And both those videos are down.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.880]   In fact, our channel-- this week in YouTube channel
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.960]   is down now because we can't upload content to it.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.240]   More than longer than 15 minutes.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.360]   But then there's the second issue,
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.840]   which somebody in the chat room pointed out.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.800]   What this does do is push independent people like Lamar
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.080]   and others to go work for these YouTube partner channels.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.720]   Because the YouTube partner channels have the cloud
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.120]   and to protect you.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.040]   Which is interesting because I feel like that's
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.960]   what YouTube wants to happen.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.800]   At first, I wonder why YouTube allows--
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.040]   I'm thinking.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.400]   Allow these networks to exist in the beginning.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.960]   But YouTube is still going to get--
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.240]   they still take their-- what is it?
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.080]   45% cut no matter what.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.200]   So they don't care if a network comes in
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.640]   and wants to cut you out some more.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.880]   It takes the pressure off them to have to offer technical support,
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.480]   to have to offer any kind of support.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.640]   They can say, hey, you talk to your network.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.040]   And then they'll have a rep who will handle the whole network.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.280]   So I think that's where they're moving to,
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.400]   where their hands off.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.880]   It's like, hey, a universal made a deal with maker
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.680]   or whoever it is, that's their business.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.240]   You deal with them.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.880]   And I think that's just the wrong direction.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.440]   Because I think the whole beauty of YouTube
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.040]   is the democratizing nature of it that gives anybody a kid
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.480]   in Hungary who wants to do a show, a chance to do a show,
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.120]   and get global distribution.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.040]   But if he's at a major disadvantage,
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.840]   because big companies can stomp on him,
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.080]   I don't think that--
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.360]   What proportion of your views comes on YouTube?
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.000]   It's not hugely significant.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.280]   That one that they pulled down had about 5,000 views.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.720]   But this week in YouTube is going to be a little more
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.320]   significant.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.600]   It's a show about YouTube.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.240]   And not being able to post those shows on YouTube
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.480]   hurts us pretty badly.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.360]   I just-- I think it also should make people question
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.720]   whether YouTube should be part of their distribution
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.320]   strategy.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.240]   Yeah, the nice thing about YouTube is you get free bandwidth.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.640]   But if you get pulled off all the time,
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.240]   this is not a good way for you to consider--
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.120]   maybe you should look at Vimeo or somebody else.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.720]   I think that hurts YouTube.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.440]   Yeah, it does.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.000]   It'll be interesting to see what they say when
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.080]   you speak to your contact.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.160]   It sounds like you need to talk to a human.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.600]   Yeah, I've emailed him already.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.920]   So he'll give back to us.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.440]   I have a Python script that can interact with him beautifully.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.800]   And I've been writing him.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:38.160]   We should just have-- really, if you're going to talk to YouTube,
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.240]   you should have a Python script on your side.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:40.640]   I agree.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.680]   I feel that pie.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.520]   No.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.360]   They do claim they're improving the content ID system.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.960]   I've yet to see any evidence of that.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.280]   All right, moving along, because I
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.200]   don't want to make this all about me.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.160]   You want to see my new phone?
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.160]   Yes, we want to see what's--
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.040]   We should put all our shows on Daily Motion, even this week
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.960]   in YouTube.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.960]   What do you think?
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.160]   Daily Motion?
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.200]   Well, why?
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.000]   I don't know.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.440]   I don't think I've ever watched a Daily Motion video.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.360]   It's big in Europe.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.480]   Is it Yahoo or rumor to be bidding for them?
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.440]   Yeah, that was the rumor I thought.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.640]   To me, the user experience of Daily Motion is worse than--
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.200]   It's so crap.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.200]   Yeah, because of all the ads and stuff.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.480]   It used to do some neat things back in the early days.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.440]   It had some innovative things.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.880]   It's owned by French telecom, I think.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.640]   So that's probably not a good choice.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.240]   Oh.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.920]   So the HTC One came--
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.640]   One did it show up.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.560]   This morning, I had ordered it and said overnight it.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.160]   And of course, it's available in AT&T as of yesterday,
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.560]   the 16th, and they overnighted it.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.000]   So I got it on the 17th this morning.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.160]   This is what many say is the best, at least in terms
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.760]   of attractive hardware Android phone.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.200]   Look, the top new phones are obviously the Galaxy S4,
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.800]   which looks just like a Galaxy of any kind.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.760]   I think if you're willing to go outside of Android,
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.560]   the new iPhone, which should come out sometime in the next few
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.840]   months, will certainly be a contender.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.080]   And I think the Nokia Lumias are very nice.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.560]   HTC also makes a very nice 8X for Windows 8.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.160]   But we're Android users.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.680]   We love our Android.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.960]   Right, Jeff?
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.480]   Yes.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.280]   OK.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:28.960]   I can't remember.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.880]   You're using an Android phone now.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.960]   I live in La Vida Google.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.000]   La Vida Google.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:35.480]   I am.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.080]   You got stuff.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:36.080]   I am.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:36.080]   I am.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.080]   I am.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.080]   I am.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.080]   I am not my line.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.080]   Somebody else is.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.080]   I'm in the Google wife.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.080]   I'm in.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.080]   I'm in the shop.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.320]   Well, and I got to say, that's the best thing
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.320]   about a Google phone.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.320]   What is that?
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.320]   Next is 4.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.320]   And next is 7.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:47.320]   4.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.320]   Next is 7.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.320]   I am not just in the operating system.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.680]   I am in Google's pants.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.680]   What?
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.680]   What's in there?
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.680]   Oh, OK.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.720]   There's a Python in there.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   Oh, it's a.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   Aww.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.720]   Aww.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.720]   There's a Python script.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.480]   We should talk about the Google Drive
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.160]   downage after the HTC One.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.160]   Google Drive downage.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.160]   Outage.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.160]   Outage.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.160]   Pwnage.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.280]   I like that script for 20.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.280]   I saw Jeff moaning on Twitter.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.840]   I'm like, oh, no, please.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.840]   So I've only had this phone for a little bit.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.200]   And I had to actually call AT&T to activate it.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.480]   I'm not sure what the activation issues were.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.280]   But-- and it will be available, I think, on every carrier in the US.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.240]   And, of course, it's available around the world.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.560]   This is a gorgeous, gorgeous phone.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.400]   1920 by 1080.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.880]   Now, I haven't changed the HTC Sense.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.880]   This is the new Sense.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.600]   Remember, they said they had this new content thing.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.200]   It's kind of flip board on the front page.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.240]   You can specify what the sources are.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.240]   I like that.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.240]   Aww.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.240]   It's pretty.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.240]   Look at that.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.240]   So that's the front page.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.840]   I put Facebook home on it a minute.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.680]   But the new Sense is flat.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.760]   Notice that's the new style.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.760]   No more gradients.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.200]   No more rounded corners and so forth.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.440]   Very fast.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.600]   And I tell you, this screen is so gorgeous.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.000]   And everybody has said that.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.680]   1920 by 1080.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.160]   But they've done some odd things.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.600]   There is no home button in the middle.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.640]   Just a dead HTC logo.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.720]   It doesn't do anything.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.400]   The home button's a little to the right of it, which is an odd place for it.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.680]   Oh, that's weird.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.960]   Yeah, you've got to get used to that.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.760]   And then the back button is to the left of it.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.840]   And you know how I feel about the new Google standards.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.680]   What do they call that?
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.720]   The new Google programming interface.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.520]   The one that no one listens to?
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.520]   That nobody does.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.520]   What?
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.520]   A la.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.520]   Mahalo.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.520]   Hello?
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.520]   Hello?
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.520]   No.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.520]   You know, the...
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.520]   Cholo.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.520]   What?
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.520]   No.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.520]   Holo.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.520]   Holo.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.520]   The holo.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.520]   Okay.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:46.960]   So the holo is you have those dot dot dot menus everywhere.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.120]   So there's no menu button.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.840]   I really like a phone with a menu button.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:57.320]   However, there's the, you know, the holo style buttons up here so I could see a menu there.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.480]   This is 4.1.2.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.160]   It's not 4.2, which is too bad.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.160]   But...
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:08.120]   And given how much HTC has customized it with Sense 5, I doubt we will see...
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.640]   It'll be a while I think before we'll see it.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.800]   I still don't have 4.2 on my note too, which is frustrating.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.280]   The other negative on this...
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.280]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.280]   I had to root it and put it...
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.880]   Yeah, I don't want to do it.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.880]   Yeah, I don't either.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.880]   It's a mistake.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.880]   Don't do it.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.880]   The other thing that is interesting, of course, is beautiful unibody aluminum case.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.040]   I think I read that it took 70 minutes to mill each individual case.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.400]   And it's beautiful.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.160]   No removable battery, no additional memory.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.000]   You can't put an SD card in it.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.640]   But I have to say, it's the closest thing to an iPhone running Android.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.840]   I mean, it's just gorgeous.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.320]   The other thing that's odd, of course, is that they're doing something very strange with
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.080]   the camera, which I support.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.360]   It remains to be seen how good this is.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.160]   It's a 4 megapixel camera, not even a 5.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.760]   It's a 4.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:04.280]   But they've done it because that way they can make the sensor have larger pixel sizes.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.920]   These pixels are 2 micron compared to the half micron sensors, pixels on some other
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.920]   phone.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:22.680]   So 2 micron means great low light performance and it's a F2 lens.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.680]   Most people do internet photos and you in general don't need more than 3 or 4 megapixels
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.680]   to be honest.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.680]   But most of us are uploading online.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.920]   It's the key is the sensor, how good you can make the picture look.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.400]   The screen is so good that the viewfinder looks fabulous.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.400]   I don't know.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.440]   I don't know how good the picture is going to be.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.440]   But yeah, so we'll see.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.680]   Yeah, it's pretty crisp.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.200]   Can you disable sense?
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:52.000]   This is my only objection with this phone is that it's not kind of the pure Android
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Google experience.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.800]   Is it possible to disable sensor now?
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.520]   I don't know.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.680]   I don't think so.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.200]   Although, of course, you could put another launcher on it, right?
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.720]   Yeah, you could put another launcher.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.160]   So I'll probably end up putting nova launcher, which I like on here.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.160]   But let me see.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.200]   I mean, I doubt there's this turn off arc.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.840]   Sense by the way, the new Sense 5 is-- I mean, look how pretty that is.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.200]   It's really gorgeous.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.000]   But yeah, I think a lot of people want it.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Better than Samsung's?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.680]   Yeah, it's much better than TouchWiz.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.680]   TouchWiz is a little junky.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.680]   Don't like it.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.360]   Yeah, I doubt you can turn off sense, but you could always put another launcher on here,
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.360]   which I may end up doing.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.360]   I'm going to put a home on it first.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   Right, and home is compatible with the phone.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.800]   Right, this is one of the home phones.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.800]   This is the other thing.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.800]   The sound quality on this is fantastic.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.800]   It's Beats Audio.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.800]   I don't have a huge amount of respect for Beats Audio.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:47.280]   But what's really cool about it is that they've put stereo speakers on the front left and right.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.280]   Nobody does this.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.760]   So if you're watching a movie, you've got speakers left and right, so you have a little bit of
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.760]   stereo separation.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.760]   I just wanted it back.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.760]   Yeah, the sound quality.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:59.280]   I don't know if you can hear it, but the sound quality is superb on this.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.640]   You can't tell.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.800]   But it really is a beautiful sounding phone.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.800]   So, stereo.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.800]   Well, I'm so...
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.800]   Go ahead.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.800]   No, I said, I'm so...
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.800]   I heard that.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.800]   That was it.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   Watching your videos, Lamar, on a 1080p screen with stereo speakers.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.800]   Oh boy.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.800]   Now, if you put it this close, it's just like a big screen.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.800]   I don't know if I would be putting my videos that close at all.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.800]   Please.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.600]   Pocket review of the HTC One, so far, it's beautiful.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.960]   I mean, this is going to be my main phone for at least.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.120]   It looks like a gorgeous phone.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.120]   It really looks gorgeous.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.920]   Nothing you'd be ashamed to pull out at an iPhone Fest.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.760]   Yeah, it looks very much like an iPhone.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.480]   I realized, oh, that's a beautiful phone.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.480]   I want that phone.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.960]   I was like, oh, that looks like an iPhone.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.360]   But you know the compromise is now.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.120]   It's 4.1.2 HTC cents on top of it.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.520]   Buttons are a little odd.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.560]   No removable battery, which I regret.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.800]   And no SD card.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.080]   You know, I got to say, since I've gone back to Android, I have...
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.400]   Especially with this Note 2, I have yet to even care about a removable battery.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   I just have not...
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.800]   The Note 2 is huge.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.800]   That's a giant battery.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.920]   Yeah, so it's been a great experience in that sense.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.200]   My mom is now my experiment.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.000]   She's getting the Note 2.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Your mom?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.560]   How is she doing with it?
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.560]   You know what?
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.080]   She loves it because I didn't tell her about the stylist right away.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.240]   I let her play with it a little bit.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.800]   And I said, oh, there's also this.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.800]   And she's an artist.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.120]   And she's sketching now on it.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.120]   She loves it.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.120]   Oh, nice.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.120]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.840]   My mom, I gave my mom a stylist for the iPad.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:35.840]   She just has...
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   She has nails.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.720]   She has long nails that she has done.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.960]   And when I hand her the stylist, she's like, oh, so much better.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.960]   You know, it just made, you know, she liked it a lot more.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.760]   But that's really cool to hear an artist sketching on it.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.240]   Yeah, she's having fun.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.040]   She's like, I can make cards.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.040]   I said, yeah.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.040]   Aw.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.440]   Yeah, so she's figuring it out.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.440]   This is a real challenge.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.640]   She's 80 years old.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.640]   Sharp is a tack.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:03.000]   And she's...because she has an iPad and a laptop, but I've been putting...I installed
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.200]   LastPass and I'm teaching her how to use LastPass.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:11.560]   Her passwords...she has a document, a word document on her desktop called passwords.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.720]   Aw, passwords.doc.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.720]   So...
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.720]   LastPass.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   Like teaching mom how to use LastPass.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.720]   That's...
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.720]   First of all, ambitious.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.720]   Yes.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.720]   Extraordinarily.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.960]   I haven't gotten my wife onto LastPass yet.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.960]   And she's no slat.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.960]   She knows...
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.600]   She just has no patience for anything that isn't easy.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.560]   It's less about her not being able to get it.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.480]   It's more about her just being like, this is ridiculous that I have to go through this.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.280]   Like, who you thought are system passwords.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.280]   You know?
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.280]   And LastPass is...
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:45.000]   I mean, I use it and I love it, but it's a little nerdy, you know?
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   It's pretty nerdy.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.640]   She seems to be getting it.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.600]   She likes the idea that she only has to remember one password.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.120]   We created a nice long password.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.120]   She's like, okay, now I'm going to write it down.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.560]   I said, no, you're not.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.440]   LastPass password has to be up here.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.440]   She said, I can't remember anything.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.160]   I said, well, we're going to work it out.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.600]   And I came up with a mnemonic for her and I think she'll remember it.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.440]   Of course, I just kept a copy of it just in case.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.240]   Anyway, it was a wonderful son.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.240]   That said, oh no.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.240]   No.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.960]   She's going to hate me when she gets home and can't figure out how to use her phone.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:19.120]   But she had a feature phone, like a really old, bad feature phone that didn't even work.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.360]   So this is going to be her first...
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.280]   I bet that big screen is perfect for her.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.280]   I just...
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.280]   She loves that.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.800]   That's why I went there exactly the more.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.760]   And it's actually a much lower resolution than this, ironically, than the HTC One, even
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.440]   though it's five and a half inches.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   But she can read.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   It's much easier.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.920]   I made the text a little bit bigger.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.920]   They have a...
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.360]   Samsung has a simple launcher version that is perfect for her.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.360]   So we'll see.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.360]   When is the next...
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.920]   Do we know what the next Google phone is coming out?
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.920]   The official?
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.920]   They haven't announced.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.920]   I imagine at Google I/O.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.920]   Right.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.920]   Are you coming, Jeff, for Google I/O or not?
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.240]   I was like, "Now you say them."
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.240]   So here's what we're going to do.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.800]   And this will be the first announcement of this.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.960]   We decided yesterday I've been chewing on this.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.160]   I couldn't think of another way to do it.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.840]   Google was not going to give us anywhere to broadcast from Google I/O nor were they
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.640]   were going to give us additional passes for technical crew.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.000]   So if we were going to do anything from there, we would have to leave the building.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.360]   And so I've decided we'll all be there at the keynote.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.840]   We'll do a live broadcast, as we always do, of the keynote.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.200]   But Tom Merritt will host that here.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.880]   You and I and Gina will all be in the audience going, "When do I get my phone?"
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.880]   And then...
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:31.360]   And then if it's not under our seat, we'll allow a little time to get in line and get
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.360]   the phone.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.480]   And then I'm going to drive you all up here.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.240]   And we'll do Twig at pretty much as normal time.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.240]   Maybe a little later.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.760]   You don't want to blindfold on me on the way.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.760]   Oh, I forgot.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.760]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.760]   Okay.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:46.760]   You're driving.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.760]   You're driving.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.760]   I'll drive.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.760]   I'll drive.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.760]   And I'll tell you what...
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.760]   Y'all, yeah.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.760]   I never...
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.840]   I'm going to go to the edge or near the middle.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.840]   I always...
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.840]   Right down the middle.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:56.840]   And I drive the speed limit.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.840]   Hold on.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.840]   Not the edge.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.840]   Not the edge.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.840]   Oh, I feel so bad.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.480]   This is going to be a fun ride.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.080]   Gina, you'll have to sit in the back seat and hold Jeff's hand.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.080]   No problem.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.080]   Oh, I like that.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.080]   It's okay.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.200]   It's going to be like this.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.600]   So Guess who is getting his Google Glass as we speak?
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.600]   Mr. Scoble.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   Oh, there it is.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.800]   Oh, you're on a frozen...
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.800]   No, we're not.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   No, we're not.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.320]   This is from last week.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.760]   Oh, this is me and Jeff.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.760]   We're fighting.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.960]   Dad and Dad are fighting.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.760]   And poor Gina, she's just shitting her.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.760]   Don't fight.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.760]   Don't fight.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.760]   Oh my God.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.760]   It's next.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.760]   Thank you, Chad.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.760]   That's awesome.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.760]   That's completely involuntary.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.760]   I didn't really...
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:47.240]   You got the guys got the big eyes and everything.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.240]   Ooh.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.740]   I love that.
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:50.740]   I want that.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:51.740]   I just put that on Facebook.
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.300]   I just realized how sad it is.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.060]   I said you all are frozen as if I'm not paying attention to your clothes at all.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.460]   You're the fact that you're not in the picture, all of that.
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.060]   But that's okay.
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.060]   We were frozen.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.060]   It just was...
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.060]   You're a server there.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.300]   I'm not a good time.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.300]   So...
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.740]   We're gonna drive us up.
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.420]   Yeah, and we'll do the show.
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.580]   So we'll have our coverage of it and maybe we'll have some free stuff under our arms when
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.580]   we come up.
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.500]   So what about the day two?
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.500]   You can go back.
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.060]   I can't help you there.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.060]   Okay.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.060]   I'm gonna learn it all.
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.060]   I'm not...
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.060]   I know they do three keynotes.
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.060]   We can't do...
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:30.780]   But last year, the big one with Sergey coming on the roof and all that.
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.780]   That was the first one, right?
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:32.780]   Yes, but day one is...
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.780]   Day one.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.060]   I think they've wised up because a couple of years ago it was like day three had all
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.260]   the big announcements.
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:42.060]   But I think they've wised up and they realize press has very limited attention span.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.060]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:48.660]   Last year I was supposed to be there, but I have my appendectomy.
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.660]   That's right.
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.660]   I couldn't go.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.660]   This will be your first Google I/O without your appendix.
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.860]   I was gonna be going at a much longer trip, but I've decided to shorten all my trips.
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:58.860]   I'm taking...
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.060]   I'm going to London tonight for basically one day.
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.820]   I'm coming out there for two days real fast and back.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:04.820]   Oh, Jeff.
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:05.820]   And so I'm doing only short trips now.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.820]   And...
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.340]   Don't run back to San Francisco after Twig.
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.740]   I hope we can all have dinner.
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.700]   And yeah, because I owe Jeff a beer or two.
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.900]   I'm gonna spill it on his pixel.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.900]   Oh, man.
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:18.900]   No, I know.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.500]   Does your nice little Italian restaurant serve crow frequency?
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.180]   Yeah, I'll have some crow.
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.020]   I'll eat some crow.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.020]   So anyway, Scoble's getting his...
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.580]   We're gonna be in the back of the car.
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.060]   We're gonna be in the back of the car, Gina.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.380]   And she's gonna be able to use my pixel the whole way.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:35.380]   And she'll be saying...
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.380]   Oh, right.
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.380]   Because if you got the...
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.380]   Yeah, yeah, you got the connected one.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.380]   I'm gonna be like, "You guys talk.
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.180]   I'm gonna prep the show, Doc."
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.180]   I'm a little disappointed.
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.700]   I tried AT&T's LTE on the one here.
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.500]   It's five megabits down, one megabit up.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.260]   I mean, that's fast enough.
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.260]   But I was hoping for fast enough.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.260]   That down is nice.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.820]   Five, but I get 20 on Verizon LTE here.
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.100]   But I think more people have AT&T here, probably.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.340]   You know, a lot of iPhone users in Penaluma.
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:09.340]   So again, you're cutting me off because I want to be angry.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.180]   Scoble's getting his glass today.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.180]   Oh.
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.180]   Yes.
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.180]   11 AM, I believe.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.180]   As we speak, he's one o'clock.
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.780]   He's getting trained.
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.580]   On Seinfeld.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.580]   Scoble!
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:25.180]   Yeah, and there wasn't unboxing last night.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:28.540]   Someone did one that was posted.
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.020]   So I hate unboxing videos, but I watched it.
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.020]   Big question.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.020]   Big question.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.020]   Poor question for all of us.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.020]   Yeah.
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.020]   Which color?
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.020]   What?
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.020]   There's colors?
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.020]   Oh, I didn't realize there was a choice of colors.
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.020]   Oh, yes.
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.020]   Pandereen being one of them.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.020]   I'm not wearing...
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.420]   Well, maybe you should if you're gonna wear Google, you should have...
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.420]   You know.
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.420]   It's like black.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.420]   It's like black.
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.420]   It's not really orange.
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.900]   Oh, you know, chat where are they?
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.180]   Where are the colors?
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.180]   I lost it.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.180]   Oh, interesting.
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.180]   I didn't know you.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:59.700]   So the way I understand they're doing it is the first 2000, the people who got it at
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:04.420]   Google I/O got reservations last year, I thought they were gonna get them first.
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.420]   It did.
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.420]   Well, I haven't got mine.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:11.340]   I got an email saying that I was gonna get an email with details soon.
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.140]   And I think you did too, Leo, or Jason did.
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.140]   I did.
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.140]   I did.
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.140]   I got one on it because Jason was the one I actually bought.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.660]   Jason, you got the email about getting an email or did you get the email for the email
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.660]   for the glass?
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.700]   He's still on email already.
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.100]   He got the first, the preliminary, same one you got, Gina.
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.300]   Yeah, the email saying there was gonna be an email.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.700]   So it's in your name.
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.380]   Okay, that's fine.
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.780]   Just let me know because I got the credit card.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:35.780]   Okay.
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.780]   'Cause we're getting it.
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:37.780]   The middle, we can get it.
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:42.420]   But so I'm a little disappointed and maybe they're doing it to like special brand ambassadors
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:43.980]   like Robert Google, Robert Skoll.
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:49.620]   Well, Robert also gave up his, uh, his iPhone and everything and gave his loyalty to Android
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:50.620]   Force.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:51.620]   I'm sure that's been up the process.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:55.180]   You know, I hate that because I've been using Android for a long time, you know, and then
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:59.660]   a not co says I'm giving up the iPhone and gets all his attention and scobles is I'm
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.660]   giving up the iPhone.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.100]   I mean, what am I gonna do here?
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.940]   I'm sure Skoll was like first in line and I owe last year.
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.660]   Maybe that's why maybe he has one.
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.900]   I have 737.
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.900]   Yeah, you're, you're way ahead of me too.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.900]   I'm like 1894.
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:14.900]   Yeah.
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.900]   So I should hear soon.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.900]   You should hear soon.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.900]   On the top half.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:18.900]   Don't you feel sad for 666?
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.740]   I mean, that person has to know I would have raised that.
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:23.740]   I'll trade.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.540]   I'd tell walk on.
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.540]   Yeah.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.900]   Do we get to keep the paperweight?
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:33.540]   This college student actually tried to sell his, I think it's a hit to he, his, uh, his
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.060]   invitation on eBay for five grand.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:42.460]   I put it at the bottom of the glass section and the dock, but then he rescinded it.
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:46.300]   No, this auction is being removed due to finding out the Google glass cannot be resold once
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.300]   obtained.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.340]   How do they stop you from doing that?
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.860]   ID, it probably hardwired the idea.
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:55.380]   Yeah, they, they, they linked the ID to your, uh, your Google account.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.420]   Haven't you heard about the Google police force?
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.420]   Yeah.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.420]   It's only a matter of time.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.380]   They just, they're, they land on your roof and helicopters.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:03.380]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.380]   So have you seen that?
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.620]   I swear this colors is an important decision.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.220]   This is an important decision.
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.940]   I'm going to go, I'd go black.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.060]   I like I do it like I know why.
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.060]   Black.
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:18.860]   Either black or white, white glasses, leo, really thick, but they're not really glasses.
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:21.460]   They're just, uh, the color of the thing.
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.060]   It would look like it.
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.060]   Right.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.060]   Yeah.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.060]   Yeah.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.060]   It's this whole thick thing.
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.060]   Yeah.
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.060]   Go, go, go with a nice pomegranate.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.060]   Pomegranate.
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.060]   It's like five color.
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.260]   I wish I could find it.
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.460]   So the spec sheet is out.
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:41.060]   I could talk about the specs while you're looking for the illustrations of the colors.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.060]   Adjustable nose pads.
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:48.020]   And you get two extra pairs.
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.060]   Two extra pairs, extra nose pads and two sizes.
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.060]   That's nice.
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.940]   Durable frame fits any face.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:58.420]   High resolution display, the equivalent of a 25 inch, they're the colors.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.780]   So there's kind of, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a,
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:06.220]   charcoal, canjourine, shale, cotton and sky.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.220]   Good Lord.
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.780]   The sky is awful.
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:13.780]   The sky is, is, is windows eight phone blue, Lumia blue.
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:14.780]   Black.
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:15.780]   Charcoal, tangerine.
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.780]   I think you're talking about charcoal.
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:18.780]   How many would I make sense?
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:19.780]   It's charcoal.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.780]   I mean, the other ones just, it's too gaudy.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:22.780]   Yeah.
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:23.780]   Agreed.
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:24.780]   I don't know, Lamar.
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.140]   Lamar, you know, you could make a statement with the tangerine.
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.140]   I don't know.
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.140]   I might want the gaudy.
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.140]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.140]   Yeah.
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.140]   I mean, a statement would be made.
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.140]   Please steal me.
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.860]   Nobody's gonna steal that.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.180]   No, because it's useless.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.420]   It would match your, your Ikea Kimstra chair behind you.
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.500]   Hey, hey, that's a new chair.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.500]   Oh, I like that.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.500]   I haven't seen it before.
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:45.500]   Very nice.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.500]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.500]   Right.
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.500]   Red.
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.500]   Did you put it together yourself?
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.500]   Of course not.
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.700]   Is it, is it an Ikea?
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:52.700]   It is.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:57.700]   I know when, when I first got this place, I paid the extra 400 bucks to let them build
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.700]   my whole place.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.700]   I have no energy for it.
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.340]   Because I had just driven 3000 miles.
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.340]   No, no, no.
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.340]   I was, I mean 2000 miles.
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.900]   I was not going to put together.
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.380]   I get the feeling nailed.
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.780]   You build your own Ikea?
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:09.780]   Oh, you bet.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.780]   You do bet.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.780]   Would you like to come to my house?
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:14.820]   I built my own two.
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:15.820]   You do too?
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.300]   Only time I feel like handy and capable when it comes to tools and strategies.
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.500]   Work you do too, Chad.
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.500]   You do too.
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.980]   I'm in the middle of building a bookcase.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:26.740]   Lamar, you and I are the only pussies in here.
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:27.740]   That's terrible.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.220]   I didn't know that I thought it was too hard for human.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:34.740]   I thought the whole idea was, well, the furniture only costs you a hundred dollars, but it's
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.860]   five hundred dollars to a family.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.060]   I thought that was the whole thing.
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.060]   It's really cheap.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.060]   No, no, no, no.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.060]   It used to be they wouldn't deliver.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.060]   All right.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.100]   Here's you hit one thing.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.740]   I am such a fan of Ikea.
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:45.740]   I hate Ikea.
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:46.740]   Oh, I love Ikea.
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.740]   Well, no, why do you like the picture?
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:49.740]   I love it.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:55.580]   I was when it came to Philadelphia, I was so amazed that it could happen.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.740]   My wife and I were so amazed that we said we've got to go see the country where this
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:02.020]   was created and we actually made us go to Sweden on vacation.
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.020]   What?
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.020]   Because of Ikea.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.220]   You know, there's horse meat in the meatballs, right?
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.900]   I am proud that I'm here.
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:08.900]   Not anymore.
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:09.900]   Oh, not anymore, okay.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:10.900]   In my Honda.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.540]   And then I put her all together myself.
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.540]   We did.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.540]   All right.
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.420]   Well, you know, we have an Ikea here and I went and I bought two bedroom sets in my office
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:23.500]   furniture, but I didn't have the nerve to assemble it.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.500]   It looked daunting.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.500]   No, it's fun.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:26.500]   It's fun.
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:27.580]   It's it's it looks daunting.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.580]   No.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.580]   And there's no words.
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.220]   It's just pictures of strange ball headed people.
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:33.220]   Yeah.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:39.580]   It's fun until you twist that one piece in and lock it and realize that the real hot
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:45.020]   is aligned and then you have to in my case go to my wife and be like, please fix this.
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.980]   Oh, I guess what happened in my case.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.820]   And I think I said this before it got became a mean, but looked at all the furniture.
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:54.060]   I was like, Hey, nobody got time for that.
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.060]   I like all put this together.
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.060]   I ain't doing that.
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.060]   That's my exact reaction.
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:07.980]   Is I this is yes, it was cheap furniture, but I'm going to pay 500 bucks.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.500]   That's what I paid for two bedroom sets in an office.
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:15.220]   That's not too bad to assemble it, but I just I've decided it's kind of I just I don't
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.220]   like them.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.780]   There's something I feel I have never done such a good job of derailing the show is right
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:20.780]   now.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.780]   Okay.
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.260]   So that that table is cheap.
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.260]   That's 329 bucks.
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.260]   They're great.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.260]   They're great.
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.580]   But then it takes four hours to assemble it.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.580]   What's your hourly rate?
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:37.580]   I'm going to have you over how I worked out all my nervous energy during the pregnancy.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.620]   It's like, okay, let's put the babies dresser together.
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:40.620]   Well, I'm encouraged now.
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.300]   I think I can do this now.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.740]   I think if you guys could do it, I should be able to do this.
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.060]   I thought you had to have some skills.
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.500]   I fit our entire dining room set.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.180]   It will be had it in my Honda Civic.
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.500]   There's no way of that.
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.500]   It's not a Civic.
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.500]   Yeah, because it's just flats.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.220]   It's a bunch of flats.
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.220]   Nothing's too big.
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.420]   Yeah, this whole big set.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.540]   I mean, then we've grown up since then we have a, you know, like a grown up.
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.380]   I'm going to have to try it.
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.380]   I've assembled furniture.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.860]   I just I looked at that and I thought this looks really hard and I hired somebody.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.860]   Gina, Gina is right to it.
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.660]   It's one of the distracting.
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.660]   Yeah.
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:16.660]   All right.
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:17.660]   All right.
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.460]   Well, it turned out that there were two pieces missing from my desk.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:22.240]   So it's been sitting on pieces on my floor for six months.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.940]   So I have to go to IKEA to get those two more pieces.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.380]   Yeah, you go you go into through the exit and you go to the desk there and you say, I
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.060]   need the him and the and the right.
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.940]   That's what they said.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.020]   You are an IKEA pro.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:35.860]   Oh, I am.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:36.940]   I'm telling you, man.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.140]   I am telling you.
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.340]   I know IKEA.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:42.940]   I the ad agency for IKEA was done.
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:43.940]   He don't know.
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:44.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.660]   Also the ad agency for entertainment weekly.
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:51.540]   And so we sat in one of the first meetings about entertainment weekly and I said, IKEA,
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.940]   you represent like, yeah, I love like you.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:53.940]   I started telling all these stories.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.820]   I was like, you know, and I tell all the rules of my house right out of IKEA and he probably
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:01.740]   just sits there and I'll censor myself and he just said, you are effing disturbed.
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:02.740]   Okay.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:08.500]   So the chat room, Web 7771 and our chat room said Dan Ariely, who wrote predictably irrational.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:16.740]   He's a brilliant, interesting guy who does the psychology of economics and econometrics.
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:21.420]   And he says, Dan Ariely says, this is an intentional device from IKEA.
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:25.940]   He says, because you put so invest so much in assembling this furniture, you love it.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.540]   You have now invested in this furniture.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:35.340]   It's like the reason in early cake, when early cake mixes came out and you could just
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.420]   make a whole cake for the mix.
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.420]   They didn't eat eggs.
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:38.420]   They didn't eat milk, just water.
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:39.420]   They didn't like that.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.420]   They didn't like that.
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.420]   So that's why they took the eggs out.
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:43.260]   You had to put the eggs in so you thought you invested something in it.
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.260]   Isn't that funny?
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.260]   That's interesting.
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.380]   That's why I feel like my furniture strangers to me.
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.700]   Like I'm not comfortable sitting on us.
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:54.260]   You and I are alienated from our bedroom sets because we didn't put the time in to build
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.260]   them.
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.460]   I still have my beloved stock home chair.
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.460]   I'm at my jerk or desk.
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.460]   I won't give this thing up.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.460]   I love it.
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:03.460]   I absolutely love it.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.460]   They stop making it.
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:08.020]   It's funny when I moved across country to California, like I really struggled like I
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:12.300]   back in Brooklyn, I had all this like a furniture that was like under $100 because I was in
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.300]   my 20s or whatever.
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.660]   It's like I really just should have gotten rid of it instead of moving it across.
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.020]   You invested it.
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.020]   You invested it.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:23.500]   I was like, I built this thing and yeah, I made it with my own hands.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.820]   That was, it's true.
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.660]   It's a very effective psychological trick.
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:27.660]   It is.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.660]   It worked for me.
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:29.660]   All right.
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:31.180]   I got to now I feel bad.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.180]   I'm going to assemble.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.180]   I'm going to go out.
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.940]   Now, of course, we have to have tapered this too.
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.940]   Why?
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.940]   Maybe when we come up for IO, we'll go get your missing pieces.
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:40.940]   Oh, it's something funny because we'll do the wrong thing.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:41.940]   Okay.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:42.940]   It'll be funny.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:43.940]   It's good.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:48.460]   So everybody, the first time puts it in sideways and then you go.
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.820]   And you realized it was so illogical of me.
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:54.140]   I clearly see now what it was trying to tell me.
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.860]   We have is that shelves, those shelves out there, Ikea?
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:01.060]   So we have, there's a shelves where we put our snacks for the employees.
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.860]   There's one shelf that's put in backwards.
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.460]   So you see the press would instead of the laminate.
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.300]   And ain't nobody going to ever fix that.
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.820]   Right.
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:11.820]   It's glued in.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:12.820]   It's glued in.
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:13.820]   It's burnt as it can't fix it.
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:14.820]   It's glued in.
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:18.380]   And so you can use your Google Glass to monitor yourself building this.
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:21.860]   Oh, because that's the problem is you have the piece of paper and you got to go back and
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:22.860]   forth.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.820]   If I had the glass, I could have the instructions piercing my eyeball.
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.740]   You see how I brought his back.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.900]   I brought his back, baby.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.900]   Thank you.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.660]   So the, so it's a high resolution display.
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:33.660]   Thank you, Lamar.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.380]   You're the John C. de Vorac of this episode.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.460]   Oh, I don't think so.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.860]   It's a high resolution display.
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:44.140]   The equivalent of a 25 inch high def screen from eight feet away.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:44.980]   That's pretty small.
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.700]   But that's also got a BS.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.460]   It's still a little weird.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.540]   I mean, I guess they have to create some sort of comparison.
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.940]   That's like saying this is the equivalent of an 80 inch screen.
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:54.940]   Right.
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:55.940]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.620]   Well, but no, they're talking about the angle.
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:04.260]   You know, the camera is only five megapixels, 720p video.
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.060]   So it's kind of a lower quality, but that's fine.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.580]   Again, this is four megapixels.
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:09.100]   Five's fine.
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.420]   The audio, this worries me, bone conduction transducer.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:18.500]   So that's when you have the thing on your, on your temple that goes, and you're supposed
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.500]   to hear it.
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.860]   I've never found those work very well.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.660]   Wi-Fi Bluetooth, 12 gigs of usable memory.
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:29.420]   You can put some apps on this sinking with Google, Google cloud storage, 16 gigs of flash
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.780]   total.
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:36.300]   They say in battery life, a day of typical use, but some things like video and hangouts
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.260]   are more battery intensive.
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:40.380]   You charge it via micro USB.
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:45.540]   This is the thing I found most interesting compatibility, any Bluetooth capable phone.
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.860]   Ah, so it's goable didn't have to run over Android.
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.380]   That surprised me.
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:54.340]   But if you want to use the my glass app, which you can get by the way now in the store, you
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.740]   have to have Android for.
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.260]   And by the way, by the way, here's a problem.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.740]   So I downloaded and they've done it again.
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:00.740]   They've done it again.
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.540]   According to one report, it won't work with apps accounts.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.700]   Oh, just trying to move everything over to my app.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:10.100]   I have to, I have to now do something that I'm going to be committed to it.
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.260]   But my Gmail account.
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.820]   That's really frustrating.
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:15.820]   That is frustrating.
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:21.140]   Rex Hammack, who's this wonderful guy, publisher in the south who I've known online for years,
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:27.020]   he finally moved his Google Plus over to his own account, his apps account.
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.940]   It took a month and he lost stuff along the way and he's kind of saying, unless you have
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.700]   a really good reason to do it, don't do it.
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.980]   So now I'm sitting with Trumpidation saying, I'm going to do this again.
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:38.180]   I'm going to commit to something because Google didn't get their act together.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.980]   Yeah, that's a bummer.
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:46.380]   Yeah, Molly issue, I guess it could be solved since it's connected to your phone is that
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:50.700]   it doesn't have, you know, 4G just automatically built in.
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.940]   So this thing is always on, but I'm assuming you're required to have a phone.
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:57.300]   You speak it there that puts the beer in your mouth.
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.300]   Geez, Lamar.
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.740]   No, he has a hat for that.
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.740]   Absolutely.
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:11.020]   All right, and now apparently another city has been named.
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:15.140]   God, this is the jealousy episode.
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:19.540]   Yeah, first it was Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:24.140]   Then it was Austin, Texas and now Google fibers going into Provo, Utah next.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:25.580]   Oh, you're kidding me.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.420]   Oh, I didn't hear about that one.
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.420]   Just happened.
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:29.420]   Just happened.
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:30.420]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.900]   So what's interesting about that is that they're rolling it out so fast.
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:37.180]   I mean, I thought that Casey was just a demo, but maybe not.
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:42.260]   Maybe they want to maybe there's more going on here than meets the eye, right?
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:46.860]   Oh, I'm not moving to Utah.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.060]   Provo is a very techie.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.420]   These are all the three things these have in common.
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.540]   Well, certainly Austin and Provo.
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:57.420]   Yeah, Silicon Prairie, they're calling it Silicon Prairie, Silicon Hills, Silicon slopes.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.220]   These are all big tech cities.
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.700]   We got the Silicon Alley here, darnit, Google.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.160]   Well, yeah, what about that?
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.640]   And what about Silicon Valley?
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:12.420]   Well, what about Telecom Valley, AKA, Petaluma, California, U.S. of A?
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:18.540]   I have the former ATD headquarters in my town.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:21.020]   So what is LA called?
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.740]   Sin City, baby.
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.180]   A farm-pit of America.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.160]   No, don't say that.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.860]   My old professor at Claremont, his wife would never come down because he was in the arm-pit
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:30.860]   of America.
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:37.300]   Did you read the FAQ after you looked at the specs?
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.140]   Kind of tongue-in-cheek funny.
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:41.500]   You can't scuba in glass.
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.260]   That would be kind of tempting.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.220]   Scuba dive in Google glass.
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.220]   You can't get wet, apparently.
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.860]   You're in the rain.
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.220]   Well, it can get a little wet, maybe.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:54.980]   Maybe you have to wear a hat.
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:56.380]   Some people actually think of it as scuba dive.
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.220]   I guess they had to put that in there.
[00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:01.580]   Maybe we're actually assuming that work.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:05.500]   And Gina, they've released, besides the app, have they released an API?
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.500]   They have.
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:07.500]   They announced the API.
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.220]   They call them Mirror API.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:15.300]   It looks like very, very simple REST API, OAuth.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.100]   They shipped SDKs in Python and Java, of course, since Google.
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.100]   That's what they do.
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.460]   Yeah, and they've released guidelines as well.
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.140]   What's interesting, I haven't had a chance to dig into the Mirror API yet, but you don't
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:30.180]   actually run apps on glass from what I can tell.
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.380]   Oh, and by the way, glass apps are called Glassware.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.300]   You don't run apps on glass.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:40.820]   Now, for some reason-- and I guess I just didn't-- I was thinking that Glass ran Android
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:44.260]   on it, but I don't know if it's actually true.
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:46.420]   So the apps don't actually run on glass.
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:48.260]   It's a cloud API, right?
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:56.020]   So the user kind of authenticates their glass with the API, and then you send API calls to
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:59.900]   Google through the cloud, and then it notifies your glass.
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:01.740]   And that's how you show those timeline cards.
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:07.020]   Also, really interesting, they're at least in terms of service, the Mirror API, no ads.
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.020]   Ads are for--
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.020]   I saw that.
[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:10.020]   You cannot have an ad.
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:11.020]   Which is--
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.020]   Very Apple-like.
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.020]   Fascinating, right?
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:16.700]   I mean, Google is an advertising company, and the companies that are releasing the first
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.860]   sort of Glassware apps are ever known New York Times, Twitter.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.540]   I mean, these are all ad-based businesses.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:27.980]   So I can't tell if this is a launch thing, or they just want to keep it clean for launch,
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:28.980]   right?
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:33.660]   Because to me, I'm huge on advertising, but to me, one of the things about Glass that
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:37.020]   I would love to see is things like, hey, there's a four-square special at the place
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:41.220]   down the street, which is kind of an ad, right?
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.100]   I mean, New York Times top stories.
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.740]   Those are going to have ads on them, right?
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:49.300]   I mean, I imagine if I had had Glass, I would have found out about the bombings that this
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:53.100]   week on Glass versus on Twitter, which is where I actually found out about them.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.100]   So it's interesting that no ads part was very, very interesting.
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:59.260]   It must be just about sort of having a clean launch.
[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:03.540]   And the advertising thing has been one of the critics' sort of biggest points, right?
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:08.220]   Like, oh, yeah, let's give the world's biggest advertising company real estate right in front
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:09.220]   of your face.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:10.220]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.660]   I'm actually happy about this.
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.460]   I don't want ads on my Glass.
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:14.780]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:18.780]   I'm happy, too, but I'm also just perplexed.
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:24.260]   I do think that there is a real value to location aware offers, maybe.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.220]   And those are those not ads?
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:30.340]   I mean, are there?
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:34.380]   Well, on four-square, everybody's content is kind of the same.
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.380]   Right.
[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:40.380]   So I think what's going to happen is your Glass will drive you to your phone and your phone
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.940]   is where you're going to find the commerce.
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:42.940]   There you go.
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:47.380]   I think one of the best apps that should be on here, in my opinion, is that Field Trip
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:48.380]   app.
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:52.300]   I played around with that when I was in New York, and I was really helpful to it.
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:57.620]   It will just pop up local landmarks as I was driving by them in a cab.
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:01.340]   And that's an example of where the full app is not going to work on Glass.
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.340]   I don't think very well.
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:06.100]   You're going to do the last version of that, and you're going to go to your phone for more.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.100]   Absolutely.
[00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:09.540]   You'll just pop up, "Hey, you're here," and then look at, "Yeah, you're right.
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.540]   Look at your phone for more."
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:15.100]   And this is going to be a little universal sign for Glass.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:19.060]   Notice the eyebrow pinch.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.700]   I would imagine, I wonder how much information will be on there.
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:24.460]   I think some of this has to do with the fact that there's not.
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.860]   Did they give the resolution on the screen?
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.020]   There can't be probably a lot of information on that little screen.
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:32.820]   So it's going to be a chime and an icon.
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:33.820]   Yes.
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:34.820]   Look at you.
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:36.460]   It's an answer to a question.
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:39.180]   It's a little bit of direction.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.820]   You're not going to be reading the New York Times on your Glass.
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.340]   You're going to say, "Bullen, something's happening."
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.100]   You're going to go to another device.
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.100]   Right.
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.100]   It's going to be breaking news.
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:49.100]   Yeah.
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.900]   But imagine on a day like Monday, by the way, our hearts and...
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:53.900]   Yes.
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:54.900]   Indeed.
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:55.900]   Yes.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:56.900]   There's go out to everybody in Boston.
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:00.300]   But imagine on a day like Monday where everybody's fixed to the news.
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.980]   Probably a lot of people watching on TV.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.820]   In a world where everybody's wearing glass, that's all people are going to be doing is
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:07.300]   like looking up into their glass, right?
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:08.900]   Well, I don't know, Leo.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.500]   That's what this is making me think, but maybe not.
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:16.180]   Maybe what the Glass does is alert you, which you're not going to be staring at it to read
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.180]   a whole story.
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.180]   Right.
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.180]   You're not going to be reading the whole story.
[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:20.180]   Right.
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:21.180]   It's the emasculating to look at your phone.
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:24.420]   He's never going to live that down.
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:25.420]   No, he's not.
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:26.820]   Or he's not.
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:30.980]   But it didn't say in effect it did.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:34.740]   The point of glasses so that you don't have to look at your phone.
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:38.620]   I think for most notifications, it makes sense.
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:41.860]   These are all questions that Robert Scubble will be answering later today.
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:43.380]   Where is Robert?
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:44.380]   So mad.
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:45.940]   Is he picking up his parents?
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.020]   He had to go and get it at Google.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:49.020]   Yeah.
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.020]   Okay.
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.820]   But does that, but I'm wondering, does that, we're all going to have to do that?
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.420]   I guess we have to get trained.
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.660]   It's a York LA or San Francisco.
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.660]   That was for the people were invited via the Twitter contest.
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:01.420]   What about, well, oh, I see, right?
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:02.420]   They're all explorers.
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:03.420]   All of us are explorers.
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.180]   I saw some different.
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:08.700]   I saw some option to mail, I don't know.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:11.980]   Yeah, I thought they were going to mail it to us Google I/O recipients.
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:17.740]   No, trust me, Robert wanted to go to Google to parade up there to get it.
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:18.740]   I know Robert.
[00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:20.700]   Here's the question then.
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:29.260]   So, when I get it, I can't do anything right, like change my Skype in Ubuntu.
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:31.180]   I won't be a programmer in any of the glass.
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:36.140]   I'll be using whatever is made available to me and trying to figure out the implication.
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:40.900]   What I'm hearing from you, Gina, is that I won't be getting glass apps.
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:44.820]   I'll be getting glass ready phone apps, right?
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:45.820]   No, no.
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:50.060]   So from what I understand, the apps don't live on your phone and they don't live on
[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:51.060]   glass.
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.060]   I believe that you authorize these apps.
[00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.060]   These are basically web apps.
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:57.140]   You authorize these apps through your glass account on the web and that they have, you
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:00.300]   grant them rights essentially to push notifications to your class.
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:01.300]   Okay.
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.820]   So what you have here is the glass play store.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:06.100]   No, the glass app store.
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:07.100]   I think so.
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.100]   More like Chrome apps.
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.100]   That's it.
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.100]   More like Chrome.
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.420]   Yeah, I guess you'd say more like Chrome apps.
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:15.180]   I mean, I think there's going to be a section in your Google account settings, which is
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:17.940]   like, just like in your Twitter account settings, these are all the accounts that can touch
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:18.940]   my Twitter.
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:22.740]   It's going to be kind of like these are all the apps that I have authorized to interact
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:23.740]   with my glass.
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:24.740]   Why?
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:28.900]   Challenge are amazing because because it's not like you're going to have, you know, 100
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.460]   apps constantly alerting you.
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.460]   Jesus, though.
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:33.700]   And how are you going to call up a new app?
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:36.060]   I feel like getting pizza now.
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.300]   How do you go to that app?
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.980]   There's a voice command to go to an app.
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:41.180]   It's going to be very interesting.
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:42.460]   I mean, I think it's going to be okay, Glass.
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:47.460]   I mean, I think I think you're going to be able to summons an app different ways, right?
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:48.460]   Voice, right?
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.620]   There's a way that you take a picture by doing some sort of gesture.
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:53.380]   I'm totally, totally not completely sure.
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:56.260]   But your question about the store, that's interesting, right?
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:59.460]   There's going to be some kind of place where there's going to be a store or a place where
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:02.140]   all the apps, you can discover glass apps, right?
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:06.420]   It didn't climb to Perkins just to announce that they're going to be investing in Glassware.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:08.780]   We had the picture of them last last week, right?
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:09.780]   That's right.
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:10.780]   Yeah, we talked about it last week.
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:11.780]   I'm not entirely sure.
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:12.780]   I'm not entirely sure.
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:13.780]   It's head.
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:14.780]   Right.
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:15.780]   Right.
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.540]   But that storage, that 12 gigabytes of storage, that's a lot of storage.
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:22.220]   And it's automatically, from what I understand, sync to Google Cloud Storage, right?
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.740]   So you're not keeping anything on Glass.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.700]   I think that's just for...
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:26.700]   Going through your phone.
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:27.700]   No.
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.700]   Blue tooth to your phone.
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:30.700]   Yeah, blue tooth to your phone.
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:31.700]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:32.700]   Blue tooth or a Wi-Fi?
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:33.700]   It was a blue tooth or a Wi-Fi.
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.580]   Yes, it uses Wi-Fi and blue tooth.
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:36.580]   Right.
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:37.580]   And look at this in the My Glass app.
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.620]   You get a QR code.
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:45.900]   It says, "Take a photo of the QR code with glass to start screencasting."
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:51.300]   That means I can watch the output of my glass on my phone, right?
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:54.860]   Oh, that's so meta.
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:55.860]   So...
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:59.540]   I'm watching me watch me watch me.
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:01.620]   I'm not sure what the app is for that.
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:06.260]   You do, when you first install My Glass, they do say, "We're going to link it to your Google
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:07.260]   account."
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:08.260]   Oh, here's the unboxing.
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:09.260]   Well, this is unboxing Glass.
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:10.260]   See, I threw glass.
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:15.220]   The tech crunch says they're shipping the first 2,000 units.
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:19.620]   I don't know if they're shipping them to a depot where you go pick it up or...
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:21.780]   Who is this person doing the unboxing?
[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:22.780]   Dan Mignon.
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:23.780]   Dan Mignon.
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.780]   Oh, he was the first one.
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:26.780]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:27.780]   So that's...
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:28.780]   What's his story?
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:30.340]   How come he's the first one?
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:31.340]   Is he a developer?
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:34.220]   Oh, they have Snap-On Sunglasses.
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:35.220]   That's cool.
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:37.180]   Yeah, well, and I need to get Snap-On Glassers.
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:41.300]   I need to get that made, which is going to become wildly expensive.
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.060]   Do you not have contacts, Jeff?
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.060]   Eww.
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:49.580]   So I can wear this with contacts, although how well this will work, I don't know, because
[00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:53.140]   each contact has a different prescription so that I have near and far vision.
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:56.460]   I guess I'd want the near vision.
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:57.460]   I don't know.
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:58.460]   We'll have to see.
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.460]   Ha!
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:04.780]   And they have Snap-On Clear Glass so that you could wear that in science doing science.
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:05.780]   Really?
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:06.780]   No, I don't know.
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:08.780]   But they do have Snap-On Clear Glass.
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:09.780]   Oh, yeah, they're Snap-On Clear Glass.
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:10.780]   I don't know what they're saying.
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:11.780]   I don't think...
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:14.620]   In fact, I think they said in the FAQ, these are not protective.
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:16.460]   Do not solder in these.
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:19.820]   Yeah, no, I want a prescription, but I don't think there's any...
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.900]   At this point, you're not going to be able to wear them, Jeff.
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:23.900]   It's going to be a problem.
[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.060]   Or you'll wear them over your glasses.
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:27.260]   Well, that's going to be awkward as hell.
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:31.060]   They had a picture of a guy, our age Leo, who said, "You know what?
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:33.180]   He's a happy glass user inside Google."
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:35.220]   But like, "Oh, it's our old fart in Google."
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.220]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:38.780]   Look, we have somebody over 40.
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:39.780]   Look!
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:40.780]   That's our guy.
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:42.780]   Oh, good wear glass too.
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:43.780]   Thank you.
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:44.780]   She's the least.
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:49.180]   That was the picture that was like a glass will fit for even people who wear glasses, right?
[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:50.180]   Yeah, but how?
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.620]   I know if you go to up until that had been like models.
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:56.260]   Early on, we're not going to have that option.
[00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:57.260]   Well, it's a template.
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:59.460]   I mean, you probably could get glasses made to that.
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:01.660]   It's just a template.
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:02.660]   That's what these are.
[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:04.460]   You know, this is a template.
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:05.460]   Okay.
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:06.460]   Fashionable version.
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:13.180]   I'm really hoping we'll get ours before Google I/O so we can all wear them around and
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.180]   talk about them.
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:15.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.180]   There would be many people at Google I/O wearing them.
[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:17.180]   You're so jealous.
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:18.180]   We were just talking about it last night.
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:21.020]   It wouldn't give me a press pass.
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:22.020]   They wouldn't give you a press pass.
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:26.220]   Well, see, that's because you weren't yet a host of this week in YouTube.
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:29.020]   Now you'll get a press pass next time.
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:30.020]   We all do.
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.020]   Yeah.
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:32.020]   Ron had trouble in all that Android.
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:33.020]   No, you know what?
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.500]   They're very, and that's why, remember we said, "Can we get a crew in?"
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:36.500]   And they said, "No."
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:37.500]   They're very tight.
[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:40.540]   And understandably, this is really for developers.
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:41.860]   Less so for press.
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:43.580]   Yeah, I'm taking up oxygen.
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:44.580]   Yeah, me too.
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:46.300]   I feel bad about it.
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:47.300]   Yeah.
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:49.260]   Oh, if you really feel bad.
[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:50.260]   Not that bad.
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:51.500]   I gave Jeff mine last time.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:52.500]   Oh, no, Kevin Marks.
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:53.500]   I gave mine last time.
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:55.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.660]   That was your cue, I think.
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:59.940]   He's welcome to it.
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:03.860]   What did you do adjacent hell with your cue?
[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:05.860]   Did you ever get the cue from your Google I/O?
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:06.860]   Did you give it to me or whatever?
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:07.860]   No, no, no, no.
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:08.860]   I got the cue.
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:11.100]   I still have it set up at home.
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:12.620]   It basically just collects dust.
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:13.620]   It's a tractive ballway.
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:14.820]   In a circular fashion.
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:15.820]   Yes.
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:16.820]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:18.740]   Okay, so please, the minute.
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:20.660]   I don't care if it's the middle of the...
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:22.300]   Hey, did you have a baby yet?
[00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:23.300]   No.
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:24.300]   No.
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:25.300]   I'm sure you won't get it the minute.
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.100]   Well, that's what I'm looking about now.
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:29.620]   We have to do some sort of transfer of possession here.
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:31.780]   You're going to be at home with a newborn baby.
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:34.260]   You're not going to be emailing me saying, "Hey, come get your glass."
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:39.100]   I could set up some sort of auto filter for the email that I did get.
[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:40.100]   It's all right.
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:41.100]   For that email address to go direct to you.
[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.100]   It's all right.
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:43.600]   Listen, Jason has a newborn.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.600]   He should have glass.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.600]   Sorry, Lee.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.600]   You should be wearing glass.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:47.600]   That's a good point.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:48.600]   He's using his newborn all day long.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.600]   That's a good point.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.100]   It's like basically the best use of glass.
[00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:52.100]   Come on.
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.100]   I'm sure.
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.100]   Okay.
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.100]   That's a very, very good point.
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:57.100]   Jason, I'm putting a word in for you.
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:58.100]   I'm going to feel guilty.
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.100]   Yeah, but I'm paying for it.
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:05.100]   And the only reason Jason ordered it right was because I said, "I want it."
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:07.300]   Because I wasn't there because I didn't get to go.
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:11.620]   If you pre-order glass, draw enough yesterday on TechCrunch says, "Here's what to expect
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:14.140]   once your number is called."
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:17.820]   You should be getting an email saying, "Oh, my Windows 8 has crashed again.
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:19.780]   I need a Google Pixel."
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:24.780]   Crash.
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:25.780]   Crash.
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:28.340]   Actually, it's Chrome that's crashing.
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:29.340]   All right.
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.340]   Pixel is running beautiful.
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.140]   I can imagine Windows ever crashing.
[00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:33.140]   I know.
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:34.140]   Oh, man.
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.140]   Was the screen not blue now?
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:37.140]   No.
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:39.140]   It doesn't go blue anymore.
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:41.380]   It just does its own color.
[00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:43.020]   All right, let me try it.
[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:44.020]   An Internet Explorer.
[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:46.300]   It may just doesn't like Chrome.
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:47.300]   Here we go.
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.380]   If you're one of the people who signed up last year, but in case you weren't sure, glass
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:52.620]   is really shipping as we speak, my number was called.
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.020]   Oh, Drew got his number yesterday.
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:55.020]   Okay.
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.300]   I received the following email, which comes along with a phone number to call, a unique
[00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:00.340]   code and a link to glass safety notices in terms of sale.
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:03.300]   You have to accept those.
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:04.300]   Then choose your color.
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:05.300]   We talked about that.
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:06.300]   There's the color.
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:09.100]   The toughest challenge of all.
[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:12.960]   You can choose to join us at our pickup events at our Google offices in Mountain View, New
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:18.440]   York or Los Angeles, or you can choose to have your glass shipped to you.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.800]   It's your call, but we'd love to meet you in person.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:24.360]   Oh, Gina, what are you going to do?
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.560]   Wait a minute, though.
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.200]   He says he's 933.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.200]   We're 737.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:30.640]   Jason, check your mailbox.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.440]   Check your check your mailbox.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:39.040]   Oh, we were told by other glass explorers, the fulfillment is not going in order.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:42.400]   It's an order of importance.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.720]   Apparently, it's an order of importance and scoble and all and offer more important than
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:46.720]   Lilo May.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:51.480]   Yeah, I'm convinced if your name was on it and mine wasn't, you probably would have
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:52.480]   gotten yours.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.320]   No, you, that's nice because he works for me.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:57.080]   He has to say things like that.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:58.800]   I would like to go down to get it, though.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.600]   It would be fun to go down to Mountain View and get it.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:01.600]   That would be fun.
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:02.600]   That would be really fun.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.240]   I was just going to go tell it.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.240]   Right.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:08.480]   It should give you a loaner piece that you could wear during the whole experience of
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.440]   getting the glass, right?
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:14.160]   It says you'll meet with a member of the glass team to have them fitted properly.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:17.960]   So you don't get that if you just get them shipped to you and then get a basic walk through
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:18.960]   the device and operating system.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:21.320]   You're encouraged to quote, "Bring a friend."
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:22.320]   Good.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:23.320]   So I will bring a friend.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:24.320]   That's good.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:25.320]   So we'll bring a camera, man.
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:26.320]   We'll bring Jake.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:27.320]   That's good.
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:28.320]   We'll have somebody shoot it.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:29.320]   And you should bring Jake.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:32.200]   If you come to LA, I'll be your friend and then we'll have wine afterwards and you'll forget
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.200]   that you have it.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.200]   She'll leave it on the bar.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.200]   Oh, look.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.200]   I mean, let's take glasses.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.040]   I'll make sure they get them back.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.040]   Wow.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.040]   Well, this is so we're getting close.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.440]   I like that idea.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:49.120]   So if your glasses get stolen, it's going to say, "Hey, Bozo."
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.120]   Exactly.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:58.720]   Well, I forget if the gloves will come up with the term of art now for a person who behaves
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.120]   badly wearing glasses.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.120]   Of course.
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:02.120]   Glass hole.
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:03.120]   Glass hole.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.040]   I knew it.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.760]   I knew that.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:07.760]   So you got glassware.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:10.400]   Glass was a good name for a trademark glassware.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.720]   Glass hole.
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.720]   The mirror API mirror glass.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:16.440]   I like that.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.440]   Looking glass.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.440]   Alice.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:21.720]   And I'm still, Jeff and London saying this class thing is totally oversold.
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.840]   I am still skeptical.
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.320]   I just want it because I want to try it.
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:29.160]   But I find this hard to believe that this is going to be anything but a car wreck.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.600]   But we'll see.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.600]   Why are you laughing?
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.600]   I just think it's funny.
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.360]   You think it's going to be a car wreck.
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.440]   It's going to be a car wreck.
[00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:39.960]   I always say that.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.560]   I don't always say that.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:43.240]   Dvorak always says that.
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:44.760]   Some technologies I love.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:47.360]   I'm, look, I'm a pro technology.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:48.920]   I'm a technology lover.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:53.960]   But you also have to say, "Hey, when something's kind of like this isn't going to, this can't
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.240]   possibly work."
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:58.680]   And I just, I find this hard to believe that people wearing these little things is going
[00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:59.880]   to go anywhere at all.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:04.600]   Oh, but look, I mean, the Pixel, mind you, I adore the machine.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.600]   It's wonderful.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.480]   I've said it's not going to become huge.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.040]   Glass is not going to become huge.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.400]   Self-driving cars are not going to become huge.
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.400]   I can't wait.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.400]   I'm Google.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.400]   It's going to take a long time.
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.400]   Right.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.400]   But Google is really pushing this.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:20.440]   I was listening to one of my favorite podcasts besides yours, Theo, is a guy named Peter Day
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:25.520]   at the BBC, who does a show called It's a Business Show, I forget the name of it.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.800]   But Peter Day is a world of business.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:32.080]   And he interviewed Eric Brynjolfsson and his co-author of his name, you always forget,
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.440]   because you're so proud you remember Brynjolfsson and he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:51.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.440]   And he can't remember the other name.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:59.440]   And we're now in the second 32 iterations of Moore's Law.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.440]   Right.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.440]   And we're in the second 32 of wild innovations you never could imagine.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:09.120]   So one of their examples is, for example, that they said one of the things that will never
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.440]   be taken over by machines because it just can't be as being a truck driver.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.440]   Because there's so many decisions you have to make and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.440]   And of course now we have this.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.440]   And we have UPS drooling under the chance of getting this.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.440]   So I think that's where Google is.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.440]   That's the whole moonshot talk.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.440]   The whole, you know, X-labs is they're pushing.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:31.440]   They're trying to push because it still goes back to saying the more we use the internet
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.440]   for the more reasons the more money they make.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.440]   And they're set up in a position better than anyone else, including Facebook, to make money
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.440]   that way.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.440]   So I think that you're right, Leo.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:44.440]   These things in and of themselves as Google branded products, they don't care if they take
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.440]   on.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:49.440]   But if they push everybody else, things will come out that will be good for Google.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:54.440]   But really, do you think so somebody else is going to make glass and it's going to take
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.440]   off?
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:00.440]   We're going to see, yeah, I think we're all going to see some measure of notification
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:04.440]   that's going to be acceptable and will work, whether we'll have a camera on at the same
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.440]   time or not.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.440]   Might be a watch.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.440]   That's where I mean, people will try.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.440]   Yes, there have been cries before.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.440]   But I think, I think notification up by your eye makes perfect sense.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.440]   This is geeky and everybody's going to make fun of it.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.040]   Everybody made fun of us walking down the street talking on a phone and then talking
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.040]   without the phone, right?
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.440]   So we adapt.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:28.760]   Yeah, I think there's some kind of constant notification structure that we're going to
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.760]   want.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:33.240]   I'm not adverse to the idea of glass.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.840]   I just think it's ungame.
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.640]   But this is not a product.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.560]   No, I mean, I wouldn't expect it to be.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.560]   You're right.
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:42.560]   There's no reason.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:48.040]   Of an idea where they've gotten 10,000 people, right?
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.800]   10,000 people in on it.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.560]   And actually covered the basic costs of it while they're at it.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.800]   So there's going to be all kinds of development, all kinds of surprising, wonderful things.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.440]   As I mentioned, my student, Andy Cropa, is coming up with something that's going to
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:03.720]   help people with dementia and Alzheimer's patients recover their days using this.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.720]   Right.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.720]   I'll wear it.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:06.720]   All kinds of applications like that.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.720]   I'll wear it.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:09.920]   And my pebble watch and my monomer.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.920]   I'm going to wear them all.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.920]   Did you get your pebble?
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:12.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.920]   You still have a gun?
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:15.920]   No.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:16.920]   So here's the deal.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:20.600]   So they sent me a note saying, hey, yeah, you ordered yours in a color.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.200]   We're having trouble with a color.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.200]   So would you like black?
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.120]   And I said, yes.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.120]   And then nothing.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:30.720]   So I sold one since I've already sold yours.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.320]   He's like received and sold.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.520]   Leo, I laughed at the car wreck thing just because I listen, I'm skeptical too.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.680]   I don't know how to feel about it, but I just I just don't presume to know that I know
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.680]   the future.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:43.520]   I just want to try it to get an idea to be all thought that it was crazy that we'd all
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.280]   walk around wearing headphones, right?
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.960]   There's plenty of technology we all thought that would be crazy that no one would accept.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.760]   So I just I just kind of want to try it.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.120]   I got to tell you though, I, you know, Jason was saying last night, oh, you know, people
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:57.280]   when we go to Google I/O, a lot of some people are going to have glass and some people
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.280]   are going to have glass.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.280]   Lots of people are going to have glass.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.280]   Hasn't have glass.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.280]   Yep.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.680]   I don't know if I'm going to walk around with the wearing these things in public, you know,
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:08.120]   like right now, I feel like just the kind of the social implication is I've got $1,500
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.320]   to disposable income.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.920]   I'm connected to Google or I've access to Google.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:18.120]   I'm, you know, living sort of the techno utopian lifestyle that sort of this early access to
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.480]   these types of things signifies.
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:24.480]   I'm not sure from ready to identify all that.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.480]   No, I agree.
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.480]   Last fall.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.480]   Right.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:28.480]   Yeah.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.480]   Right.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:30.480]   Exactly.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.480]   It is very much.
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:32.480]   It's a 1%.
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:33.480]   It's very much flaunting.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.040]   It's very much a 1% thing.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.040]   Yes.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.040]   1% this is a reference Leo will understand.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.000]   It's like wearing a NARU jacket.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   Worse.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.440]   Although that pretty much marked you as a glass hold.
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:51.200]   This is going to be one of those things like I remember when the Kindle first came out
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:55.960]   and I got on a train and people, you know, it's that, oh, what is that?
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.960]   Right.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.960]   Can I see it?
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.960]   Can I touch it?
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:02.880]   And I have a feeling and you don't, I don't let them because I'll show you, but you can't,
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.640]   you can't have my thing that I just got.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.920]   This is my precious.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.600]   So you can imagine people saying with the glass, oh, can I try it on?
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.600]   And it's that privacy invasion things.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.840]   Gene, I kind of agree with you.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.680]   It's going to be weird in public.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:18.760]   But we all have that experience when, you know, at least certainly I did with the first
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:24.160]   iPad and the first iPhone, whenever you have a new technology and you're the first kindles
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:29.880]   a very good example, you do get attention, but this is a, that's generally positive attention.
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:34.240]   I think Gina's point is this kind of going to be negative it like, oh, look at him over
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.240]   there.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.240]   It's something.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.240]   Right.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.120]   Is he recording the first brick phone?
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:42.160]   That's a really good, you know, the thing about that's a good example.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.800]   Yeah, because it's on your face.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.400]   I don't know how many people are going to say, can I try on your glasses?
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.240]   That's a very personal thing to say.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:53.120]   You know, I might have said to someone, can I see your Kindle, but I may, I wouldn't ask
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.120]   them to wear their glasses.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.280]   But that's the interesting, Gina, right?
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.400]   You can't share it the way you can share the things.
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:02.040]   No, you can't show his Kindle to somebody even while holding on to her dear life.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.880]   Yeah, because you're wearing it's funny.
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.640]   You know, if when I take the baby out and I have her in the stroller, people will touch
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.880]   her and talk to her and stuff.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.440]   If I have her in the ergo, if I'm kind of wearing her on my chest, people are much less
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.240]   likely to touch her because it's just kind of a personal space thing.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:17.200]   It's a different stream wearing something and carrying it, right?
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:20.600]   So, but I think with glasses going to introduce the whole like, are you taking pictures?
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.200]   Are you recording me right now?
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.200]   You know, and I think that people are just kind of kind of stare at the little cyborg thing,
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.880]   you know, and be like, what's that?
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.080]   You know, and distract them a little bit.
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:33.280]   I predict, I predict it's going to become such a cliche in Saran's, it's so used to seeing
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.000]   it out there that it's going to become no big deal.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.600]   And a lot of people spent money to look cool or look cool anymore.
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.400]   And it's going to be just really, I think you should loudly say, Gina, we are a bork
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.560]   and then just scare the heck out of them.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.480]   I am a locketus.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.480]   You wanted something?
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:50.480]   Let me ask Gina.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:54.440]   But with the glass app, somebody in the chair and said you could say, well, yeah, this is
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.440]   glass.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.440]   Let me show you what I'm seeing.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:57.440]   Oh, that's true.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.440]   That's cool.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.440]   Yeah, that's nice.
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.440]   Yeah, that would be cool.
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.800]   That's probably why they do that.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.800]   Right.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:08.560]   I don't think because they're $1,500, I don't think you're going to see a whole bunch of
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.120]   them around for a while.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.160]   Oh, it's San Francisco, I'm saying.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.160]   That's a lot of money.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.360]   I'm interested to see what was that.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:18.560]   For something that is very, something that is very speculative.
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.680]   There's a lot of rich glass holes in San Francisco.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:24.080]   What do you want me to go to drop down to?
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:30.000]   I predicted a very aggressive $500 price when a year from now, just to get into people's
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   hands.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.400]   Is that too drastic of a drop?
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.880]   Yeah, I don't think that's the interesting question Lamar.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:45.240]   You can imagine this phone to get this to the price that the Nexus 4 got to.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:48.560]   They really had to do some neat things and subsidize, right?
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:51.080]   The class, what's the expensive technology there?
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.960]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.720]   That's a good point.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.720]   I don't know.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.680]   I'm not so sure it's so, it's so, it's really.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:02.360]   I think it's just the tiniest of it, the compactness of it.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:06.600]   Yeah, what you've gone through that expense to namertize that, it's not like you're buying
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.600]   a big piece of beautiful gorilla class.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.240]   Well, we'll know pretty quick because presumably I fix it.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.760]   We'll have a copy of it.
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:16.280]   You know, have one sometime in the next few days and they'll do a tear down.
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.280]   Tired down.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.280]   They'll do a tear down.
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:19.280]   We'll know what's in there.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.280]   I'm thinking more and more that it isn't enough.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:25.440]   We'll not run apps directly, right?
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.680]   So it doesn't have to be quite as fast or powerful a machine.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:33.120]   Yeah, if it's dependent on your phone, for the most part, I can't see them going over
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.600]   $500 for this.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.280]   But even that's a lot.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.600]   I think that's too expensive.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.280]   It has it two antennas in it, right?
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:44.800]   It has your Wi-Fi and your Bluetooth antenna in it.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.840]   It has some smarts in it to handle the memory offload and that kind of stuff into display.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:50.840]   Right.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:54.200]   It's got the little display, but that's not, you know, that's just a LCD.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.200]   Right.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.200]   All right.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.200]   Let's take a break.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.680]   We've got to do our change log.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.760]   We've got lots more to do.
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:06.840]   Jeff Jarvis is here from City University of New York, the author of Public Parts Lamar.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.600]   Wilson from his own YouTube channel, Lamar Wilson.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.840]   And of course, our new show just launched this week.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.200]   It's called this week in YouTube.
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.520]   It's every Sunday, right before Twitter on the Twitter network.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.520]   Thank you for being here, Lamar.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:21.400]   Jennifer Panney from smarter word.org buzz machine, buzz machine.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:26.880]   That's Jeff's smarter word.org and think up dot com.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:27.880]   Get ready.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.160]   Get the trumpets change log coming up in a bit.
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.360]   But first a word from shutterstock.com.
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:36.200]   Shutterstock, amazing place.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:41.840]   If you're a publisher, if you're a blogger, if you need images, if you need illustrations,
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:46.600]   photos, vectors, video clips, you got to go to shutterstock.com.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:51.520]   What I'm going to log into my account before actually before I do that, let's do some searching.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.800]   One of the things they have the 25 million stock photos.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:58.480]   So you got to figure, shutterstock is going to do something really extra special.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:02.640]   Let me log in here, Chad, for, yeah, thank you.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:05.120]   They've got to do something extra special with the search.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:10.000]   And in fact, they have about the smartest search I've ever seen in my life.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.280]   You don't have to be a member of shutterstock to try it.
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:14.640]   You can search for emotions.
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:17.640]   You can search for colors.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:22.120]   They have a spectrum search tool that lets you choose a color from a color wheel.
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:27.280]   So you can pick all the images that you want in the colors that you like.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:34.400]   You could search for cranky hippos or happy hanbagangas or look at this.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.400]   This is green.
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.600]   I'm green in the, look at this, pretty.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.600]   So I'm using green.
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.920]   So now this is very useful because if you are designing something and you want to use
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.960]   a particular shade of green, you can get images with that kind of green.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:47.960]   Isn't that pretty?
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:51.920]   That just makes me, that's a search for forest in a particular spectrum shade.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:55.080]   Shutterstock.com.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.880]   They add 10,000 images every day.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.280]   So there's always something new at shutterstock.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.240]   You could choose two ways to pay.
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.240]   And I like this.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:07.240]   You can get individual image packs or monthly subscription for the best deal.
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:10.200]   25 images a day with a standard monthly subscription.
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.920]   That's really popular for publishers.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:14.760]   If you're a blogger, you got to have an image with every blog post.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:20.600]   You'll see in fact a lot of the blog posts, say images, courtesy, shutterstock at the bottom,
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:21.600]   that kind of thing.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:24.000]   We were talking with Joshua Topolsky.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:31.440]   He said, when I was at Engadget, we used shutterstock like crazy for inspiration for
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.160]   planning for just fun.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.120]   Let's try, give me a word, a noun.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.800]   Earth, earth.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.040]   Ooh, that's inspiring.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:45.480]   Look by the way, earthquake, earth, day, earth, globe, earth from space.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.240]   Just want to have a bunch of images of earth from space.
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.240]   These are so great.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:53.540]   Then they have these light boxes, which are beautiful, which means you can use the light
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:12:00.520]   boxes to share images with coworkers, both for inspiration.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.400]   See save to light box right there.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.640]   I'm going to create a new light box.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:09.920]   We're going to call it earth images or earth tones and then share that with others.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.440]   I just love shutterstock.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:15.120]   The greatest search tool, the spectrum tool, the shareable light boxes all make it a really
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.720]   great tool for anybody who needs images in their publications.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:22.440]   Ooh, I don't have my iPad with me, but the iPad app.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:25.480]   Webby award winning iPad app is just fantastic.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:26.960]   There's also a global company.
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.800]   They have offices in more than a dozen countries.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:35.600]   That means multilingual customer support, of course, multilanguages on the site, and
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.640]   Germany, China, Italy, Brazil, Belgium, and so forth, they're all over the place.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.320]   Of course, dedicated corporate reps in each of those countries in full time customer support
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:44.920]   throughout the week.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.720]   Shutterstock, try it today.
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.560]   You don't need a credit card to set up your free account.

[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:12.640]   We thank Shutterstock for their support of this week in Google.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:16.520]   Now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the Google--
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.520]   Google Change Log.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.520]   The Google Change Log.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.520]   Whoo.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:26.520]   Gina Trapani, what's new on Google?
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:30.160]   Did you hear about the new inactive account manager?
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.520]   Yeah, for when you die?
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:32.520]   Yeah.
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:36.080]   When you die, oh, when you stop using your Google account, Leo, which, you know, could
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:39.000]   be death, but could be other situations too.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.680]   I could move to China.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.040]   You could move to China.
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:44.240]   So Google launches a new inactive account manager.
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:49.680]   This is a part of your Google account settings that lets you specify what happens if you
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:53.320]   stop using your Google account for a certain amount of time.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:57.320]   So you choose a timeout period, three months, six months, nine months, 12 months.
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:02.240]   You add your phone number, and you add 10 trusted friends or family members.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:04.680]   Their phone numbers, their email address.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.560]   And you let Google know, hey, you know what?
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:10.040]   Get in contact with these people and give these people access, for example, you could
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:15.280]   say, give these people access to my account to download my data through Google takeout.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.200]   Or you can tell Google, you know, just shut down my account after so much time.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.080]   Yeah, you may not want, for instance, anybody to see what's in that account.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.960]   So you may just say, hey, Google, after three months, six months a year, if I don't log
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:30.120]   in, they send you an email saying, hey, you're not logging in, we're going to do something.
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.560]   And then they delete it, which may be what you want, right?
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.560]   For privacy.
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.560]   Right.
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.560]   Absolutely.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.560]   Yeah, they give you a month.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:39.040]   So they email you, they contact you, they try to contact you, and you give your phone number
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.320]   as well to say, hey, you know what, you know, in a month from now, we're going to take
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:46.000]   this action that you specified in the inactive account manager.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.400]   You have to turn this on.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:52.480]   So Leo, did you, Leo, did you, you still have the email you set up on Twitch?
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:58.240]   So it's still set up that is you were laughing that, oh, well, if I remember going back and
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.240]   change this.
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.640]   Oh, yeah, I set it up on Twitter this week.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:06.120]   And the message that goes out to all my friends when I die is I was Batman.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:10.720]   You're right, I forgot to take that off.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.720]   Whoops.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.800]   Yeah, you can also set up an automated response that goes out to people who email you after
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:22.040]   this, after this event of inactivity comes the time out period.
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:25.000]   So I haven't actually set this up here to have to kind of think this through, like who
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.440]   are the 10 people who I'd want to give access to my Google account, or do I want to do
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.440]   that?
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.680]   Do I want to just have it deleted?
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.000]   I think it's so great.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.280]   I just, I wouldn't want everything deleted.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.040]   I would kind of want my videos still up.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:41.480]   I wish they had a way to specify which parts can be deleted and which parts to stay.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:45.960]   The writer has talked for a long time about the need for, you know, kind of a digital
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:51.040]   will and a digital executor who can follow your wishes.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.040]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.040]   Definitely.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.040]   That's what this is.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.640]   I mean, my plan was like, well, I'll just leave my last pass, you know, my one master password,
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.640]   you know, behind.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.480]   Which person life will be to figure out?
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.480]   Right.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:03.480]   Right.
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:06.200]   Which my loved ones will not be able to figure out, especially my wife, she'll be like, of
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.240]   course she made me use this stupid thing.
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:12.800]   I love last pass, but you know, it's a little, it's a little complicated for the non, the
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:13.800]   non-power user.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.960]   But you know, the fact is I change my master password sometimes, you know, things happen,
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:17.960]   you change your password.
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:20.560]   So it's just hard to keep it up to date and where do you keep it?
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.840]   Do you lock it in a safe somewhere?
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:27.080]   So I really like this and I hope to see, and I think that as sort of the web apps mature
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:32.000]   and this becomes an issue that more apps, more hosted apps will do this sort of thing.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.680]   But you say, what happens to my data if I disappear?
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:35.680]   Good.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:36.680]   What else?
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.680]   What else do it?
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.880]   So the, oh, next up, the Chrome beta for Android got a new update, a couple of cool new features
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.560]   that will soon see unstable.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:48.800]   These features move pretty quickly from beta to stable.
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.320]   There's a new full screen on phones mode.
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.600]   As you scroll down the page, the toolbar kind of gets folded under and disappears.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.440]   And when you scroll back up, it reappears.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:00.000]   You can see your URL.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.200]   When you search in Google in the search box, the keywords that you search for right now
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:08.800]   in the stable version, you search in Google and they appear in the Google search box.
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:11.880]   You have to go edit them in the search box in the page.
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:18.760]   With this new update, they actually stay in the omnibox, which is the URL key word area.
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:22.160]   So that makes it a lot easier to edit your searches after you search.
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.160]   That's good.
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.320]   Yeah, which is nicer.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.960]   And also on tab history on tablets.
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:31.120]   The Chrome beta on Android tablets, you long press on the back button, you will be able
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:34.160]   to view your tab history.
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:39.160]   Speaking of mobile search, Google has been making some changes to some of its results.
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.520]   There's a new quick view badge for sites like Wikipedia.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:46.640]   So if you search for, I think the example they gave was poker hands.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.840]   The Wikipedia page is the first, happens to be the first result.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:54.880]   You'll see a small blue badge on the bottom right hand of the search result, which Chad
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:56.400]   is showing us right now.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:00.080]   And you click on that and you can see a preview of the Wikipedia page.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:03.600]   So you can read the Wikipedia page without actually going to the Wikipedia page.
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:06.400]   Just quick access to the information you want.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:10.400]   Kind of along those lines, Rotten Tomatoes is getting, the website Rotten Tomatoes is
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:13.960]   getting some special treatment that apparently more websites are going to get.
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:18.840]   If you search for Rotten Tomatoes on your phone, the results will actually break out
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:23.360]   Rotten Tomatoes categorization of movies into subsections actually in the results.
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:27.640]   So I think the top result is what's in theaters right now.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:30.080]   Show me theaters now, what's in theaters now.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.880]   And then the first option is best movies in theaters right now.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:35.960]   So right there in Google search results, you say, show me the best movies in theaters
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.200]   right now, which makes a lot of sense.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:42.360]   If you're searching for movies on your phone, chances are you want to go to one.
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:46.160]   And Google says that this kind of functionality will roll out for other websites.
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:47.160]   >> Love that.
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:51.440]   >> Many sites will have similar functionality going forward.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:56.840]   Also in Chrome, and this is on the desktop when you install Chrome extensions, Google's
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.840]   adding some security measures to protect you from malicious binaries.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:06.400]   I guess Chrome extensions that don't follow all Google's guidelines about how to deploy
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:10.440]   and change settings, maybe that they shouldn't be changing.
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:13.760]   Google's starting to flag those as malicious and we'll show you a warning if you try to
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.040]   install them.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:18.360]   So we always welcome that little extra security.
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:21.880]   And finally, we talked about this earlier, the Google Glass My Glass Companion App is
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:22.880]   out for Android.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.040]   It's in the Play Store.
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.800]   It's Android 4.0 and up only.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:28.880]   You can't do anything with it unless you actually have Glass.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:35.320]   And the web-based set of wizard for when you do, if you do, get Glass, is also live.
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:39.960]   So the My Glass Companion App just gives you, like Leo said earlier, just lets you get
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:44.200]   SMS and navigation pushed from your phone.
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:50.160]   And Leo, they said that Glass will work with any Bluetooth-enabled phone, but the My Glass
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.240]   App is only available for Android or on above.
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:56.960]   So I don't know if that means Glass doesn't work with the iPhone.
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.360]   It may be interesting to see.
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:02.160]   It's a very fancy expensive earpiece.
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.160]   Yeah, perhaps.
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.760]   Well, the My Glass doesn't do much.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:09.480]   The biggest thing it does is that playback the video that you're seeing through the phone
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:11.600]   and then it lets you set up some stuff on Glass.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.600]   I presume it.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.600]   It's a API, right?
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.000]   So you can write apps to write it up on the phone.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:23.320]   It pushes SMS messages to Glass and it uses the GPS of your phone as well.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.320]   So navigation, location.
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.480]   So that's significant, right?
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:30.600]   I mean, those are two huge cases for Glass.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:35.240]   So that's out for all of us who don't have Glass yet.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.240]   But will soon.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.240]   That's all I got.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.040]   Okay, did you already install it?
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:40.040]   I did.
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.080]   I want to be ready.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.080]   You want to be ready for the minute that it arrives.
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:46.360]   I haven't installed the app and I'm totally going to install it.
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:53.520]   Gina, with the Bluetooth 4.0, which I'm assuming all the Android phones will have, you can
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:56.440]   have multiple devices at the same time, right?
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.480]   Because I sometimes play my radio.
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.280]   Through the phone and other.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:04.080]   Yeah, lots of Bluetooth devices.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.080]   Cool.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:07.800]   But oh, wait a minute, though.
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:10.520]   Can you have multiple paired?
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.840]   That's what I was asking.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.840]   That's a good question.
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.840]   I don't know.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:16.320]   I don't think so.
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.320]   That will be.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:18.800]   Yeah, that's a big point.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.200]   I don't want to get in the car and not be able to use my Bluetooth connection to my phone
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.760]   because I've got Glass on.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.680]   Oh, it's interesting.
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:27.680]   Hmm.
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:28.680]   I'm not getting it.
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:29.680]   That's it.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:30.680]   That's it.
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:31.680]   It's done.
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:40.360]   And that, speaking of done, is the Google change log.
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:41.360]   Facebook.
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:45.360]   Kind of ran down like that.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:51.600]   Facebook Home is getting terrible reviews on the Play Store, but you explained this,
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.600]   Lamar.
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.320]   48% of users gave it one star.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:59.240]   Lamar says, "It's just because they don't have a phone that can use it."
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:02.440]   So, people say I was incorrect with that.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.680]   And I probably was.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:08.440]   You have to install something in a Play Store before you can review it.
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.440]   Oh, okay.
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.320]   I have no problem taking that back.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:15.960]   I still believe that these people who got it didn't spend more than five minutes, but
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:16.960]   then got disgusted.
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:17.960]   They just don't like Facebook.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.280]   It's a chance to vote on Facebook.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.280]   It popped up.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:22.280]   They freaked out.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.280]   Right.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.280]   And then they gave it a one.
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:28.160]   I just think people on Android stores, particularly, they probably do it in Apple Store, too.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:32.400]   I'm, excuse me, the Play Store is that they're too quick to judge them without giving something
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.400]   sometime.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.400]   Right.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:40.840]   I personally like Facebook home because I'm looking at it from a different point of view.
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:44.760]   For the person who's immersed in Facebook, this is perfect.
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:48.960]   And I don't care about Android on the bottom, and that's really what Facebook wants you.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.800]   They don't want you to care about the OS.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:54.720]   They want you to just use Facebook and the apps that you love to use.
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.200]   So I'm going to install it right now.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.360]   You don't have to be afraid to say you like it, Lamar.
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.360]   She doesn't sound.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.360]   No, no.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.840]   I mean, I think it's a really good, well-designed app.
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.720]   We reviewed it last night on all about Android.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.480]   Ron Richards reviewed it.
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:11.360]   And he's not a huge Facebook user, but even he was like, you know, this is really well
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.360]   designed.
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:15.080]   And I interacted with Facebook so much more having this up.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:18.800]   And for someone for whom Facebook is the main thing they do on their phone.
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:20.480]   And, you know, for me, it's just Twitter.
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:22.200]   Twitter is one of the main things I do on my phone.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:25.680]   I mean, I do social just doesn't happen to happen to be Facebook.
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:28.560]   It makes a lot of sense that, you know, you don't have to tap through a bunch of apps
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.640]   in order to get stuff done.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:33.160]   So I mean, I really liked the idea of Facebook home.
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:39.080]   I don't happen to be a huge Facebook user, but I think the concept that is very powerful.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.560]   You know what, those people were wrong.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:45.000]   I just installed Facebook home on this HTC One, which I thought it supported.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.480]   I was able to install it.
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.480]   But then it said, thanks for installing Facebook home.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.440]   Your device is not supported yet.
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.600]   So that would, I would give it a one star after.
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.600]   So you can write, can you right now?
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:55.760]   Can I write a review?
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:56.760]   Hell yeah.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:00.000]   And I give it one star because it doesn't work.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.440]   So you could install something even if it's not compatible?
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.840]   Well, I guess in this case, a lot of times no.
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:05.840]   Okay.
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:06.840]   Yeah, it's weird.
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.720]   Usually you shouldn't be able to, but there are some apps when it happens.
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.760]   And I don't know if that's because they're rolling out.
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:12.760]   You see one compatibility?
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:15.320]   I mean, they said they were going to work on the one.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.960]   It might be just early.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:20.920]   You might just be, you know, one of the first people who has the one in the bar.
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:21.920]   Interesting.
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.920]   But that is a frustrating experience.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.920]   That's a frustrating experience.
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.600]   That's a frustrating experience.
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:28.840]   That deserves a one star review.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.120]   Yeah, I think that would explain a lot of those bad reviews.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:35.120]   Meanwhile, Eric Schmidt says, I love it.
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:37.040]   Holy shit.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:40.560]   Holy cow.
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:44.040]   He has to say that, you know, why?
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.360]   He can't say I hate it.
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.360]   There's their evil.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.920]   That's the evil empire.
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.880]   You should trust us not Facebook.
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.640]   He has to appear open, you know, for open source.
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:55.280]   So he, you know, or the idea, that's what he was saying.
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.760]   So he, he has to embrace it.
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:58.400]   I've been behind the scenes.
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:01.600]   They're kicking their themselves that Google plus didn't do it first.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.040]   I wish Google plus would do it.
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:04.480]   This is just steal it.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:05.960]   It might make it actually use Google plus.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:06.960]   I would use it.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:07.960]   Just steal it.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:09.960]   Steal it outright.
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.120]   Just say, hey, nope.
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:14.360]   I like this, Schmidt said it took some guts for them to do it.
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.360]   It's good.
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:22.120]   And, and you know, in my opinion, it really puts, puts things like HTC, Samsung, to shame
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:27.440]   that they have to put all their crap where inside Android and embedded where Facebook
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:32.520]   can just lay right over it and, and you get all the function that you need and you can
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.080]   turn it off if you didn't like it.
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:39.800]   I have to say the, on the Sense 5, which is part of this HTC One, they have that, that
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:43.720]   home front page that combines a bunch of stuff.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.720]   And I kind of like it.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:50.000]   I mean, it's, it's, it's not quite Facebook home, but it's, but it's kind of, you know,
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.640]   you see all your, you see, you know, these are from Facebook, Flickr.
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:56.120]   You know, you see different posts from different.
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.120]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:58.800]   I was saying, go like that head.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:25:59.800]   Sorry.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:02.240]   We pointed the camera somewhere different.
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:06.640]   So this is, this is my, this is the front page on the HTC One with the traditional sense,
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:09.160]   date and weather, although it's nice and flat.
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:13.840]   And then here's a, here's a picture from Coachella.
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:18.120]   Here's Facebook postings, Flickr postings.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:21.320]   I presume Twitter as well and so forth.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.520]   So I think that's, that's, that's a nice way to do it.
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:25.840]   It's like flip board.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:26.960]   And that's somewhat like home.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:30.840]   I don't have the chat heads, but gosh, Google could just, well, maybe when they come out
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:33.840]   with Babel or Babel or whatever the heck they're going to call it.
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.600]   Someone on Twitter said it's Babel.
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:36.600]   Like the, yeah.
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:40.400]   And it didn't look like he is a Googler, but he seemed pretty sure that it's Babel.
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.200]   So how would he know?
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:43.360]   I know, right.
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.600]   We don't know when Google tells us how to pronounce it.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:50.360]   That's, you could be either way, but the Babel fish in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:51.600]   is pronounced Babel.
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:52.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:58.400]   Well, one of the ways I made, I made Facebook home really useful is I took things like,
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:03.040]   I talked about some Twitter, but I took things like Twitter, Mashable, Verge and all these
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:07.360]   things that normally have in Facebook, excuse me, and flip board.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.120]   And I, and I liked them on Facebook.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.560]   So now you're seeing them.
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.960]   I can see news as it happens.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.920]   I put breaking news in there.
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:17.440]   So it's really helpful.
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:21.920]   And the nice thing is you don't want to see your family feed of certain friends.
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:25.920]   You can turn them off of your news feed and just show your, you know, your news feed
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:27.720]   without a lot of the crap on it.
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:29.840]   So I think it has a lot of potential.
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:33.320]   I'm very positive toward it because that is where my audiences and that is where my
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.680]   friends are.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:40.560]   And they're just not on Google+, and I'm tired of pushing that wagon alone when it's not
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.000]   moving for me that well.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.560]   So no, I'm with you.
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:50.280]   But, but again, if Google got a clue and saw this and said we could do this, I would
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:51.280]   use Google+, more.
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:54.080]   I prefer to use that over Facebook, frankly.
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:55.080]   Yep.
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:56.080]   All right.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:02.600]   Any more, more people?
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:07.280]   Anti trust complaint against Android is an attack on open source, whatever.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.280]   Did you see this?
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:09.280]   I thought this was so surprising.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:13.600]   Andy Rubin, the creator of Android, who sold it to Google said, you know, when we really
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.360]   were thinking it was a camera.
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.000]   It was a camera operating system.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.480]   It's a great story.
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:20.800]   And it's so great to be that.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:21.800]   I hate that eventually.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:22.800]   You're right.
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:23.800]   And then it actually came from--
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:24.800]   You thought that was so wowy.
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:25.800]   Somebody thought to put it in camera.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:26.800]   It's a camera.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.800]   It is a camera.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:28.800]   We were right.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:31.760]   You know, it's so heartening, especially for people sort of just building new things
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:35.720]   to be like, oh, even something as successful as Android like had the pivot in its early
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.560]   days and figure out what it should be.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.560]   Right.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.960]   Like every good product has that moment of reckoning when it's like, oh, okay, maybe
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.240]   we're not this, but this is really working.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.240]   Right.
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.240]   Yeah.
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:49.080]   And they said the cameras weren't big enough market yet, which is true because it all went
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:50.080]   smart phones.
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:53.400]   So it was a good call on them to not allow that to happen.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:56.000]   But these smart phones are for many people, their camera.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000]   So yeah, as a way that also is a case.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000]   It's conveyed.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.640]   Um, now my Windows machine is frozen again, all right.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.400]   Oh, I'm going to buy a pixel.
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:09.400]   I tell you.
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:11.240]   Does that ever freeze on you?
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.240]   Jeff, you ever--
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:13.240]   No.
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:14.240]   No, it doesn't.
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:18.520]   I will say-- I'll tell you that today I had a brief moment of self-doubt when Google
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:22.640]   Labs and, and, and, and the drive went down.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:23.640]   I--
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:24.640]   Oh, let's talk about that.
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:26.640]   How long was it down?
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:29.920]   Not that long enough for everybody, but it was down for me.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:33.120]   The front page of drive, the directory was down for a few minutes.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.240]   I don't know how long I've been down before that, but then I tried to get to the rundown.
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:37.240]   I couldn't.
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:38.240]   That's why I went on.
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.240]   Then I only got to the one.
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:40.240]   I finally got to the rundown.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:41.240]   Chad said, oh, it was out late.
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.240]   I said I get to the morning.
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:44.040]   So I had to stuff in.
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:46.640]   But I'd say 15 minutes.
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:47.840]   It was a while.
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.520]   Yeah, it-- I was prepping for my show.
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.960]   I do a five by five and we use the document to get ready for the show.
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:55.080]   And I just couldn't get-- it was just a 500.
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:58.680]   And I was like, hmm, I don't know if I'm going to be able to do this show.
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:01.600]   That makes you second guess the cloud, doesn't it?
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:02.600]   Yeah, it did.
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:06.280]   Well, well, well, well, but then I went to-- unfortunately I didn't finish the experiment
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:07.280]   here.
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:12.360]   So then I said, well, but I have a Chromebook and I have a local storage of the cloud.
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:15.480]   And so I went to the Chrome app, the offline Chrome app.
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:17.120]   And sure enough, there was a directory of everything there.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.960]   I said it was synced seven minutes ago.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.320]   I said, great.
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:21.280]   And then I tried to open it.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:25.520]   And because I was online, it tried to go open up the online version.
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:29.200]   And I was about to then go offline to make sure that I actually did have it stored locally.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.720]   But then it came back.
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:32.640]   So I didn't fully experiment with that.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.560]   But no, I do have local storage.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:36.160]   But it does make you think.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.160]   It does make you say--
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:38.880]   It makes you think for a second, like, oh crap.
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:42.360]   Maybe I shouldn't keep stuff that I really need to be here all the time on here.
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:44.080]   Or do I have some automated way?
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:46.520]   Because the problem is I have more problems with Dropbox than I do with the cloud.
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:47.520]   Docs were expiring.
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:48.520]   So for this morning.
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:52.760]   The other thing, by the way, in full disclosure that happened on the Chrome book was I was
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:57.040]   getting these horrible, full page takeover ads.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:01.960]   And I thought this was like it was changing DNS and doing a route around.
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:05.960]   I thought this does not happen on Chrome OS.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:10.040]   But it was called infinity ads.
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:15.400]   And so somebody just-- and Twitter said just to go erase the cookies dummy.
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:16.400]   And I didn't.
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:17.400]   It was on.
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:20.160]   But where was that coming from?
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:22.200]   This thing called infinity ads.
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.360]   And what you would go to a site-- nothing to do with a site.
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:26.320]   It would suddenly open up a full page blow up.
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:29.920]   Which in the old days you did that by doing a DNS route.
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:30.920]   Right.
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:31.920]   It was really dubious.
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:32.920]   The ISPs-- what can't do that?
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:33.920]   Can't they?
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:36.120]   Yeah, there was an ISP in the Florida.
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:37.120]   I think it was doing that.
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:38.120]   It was pretty horrible.
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.400]   But how did you get that on your system?
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:41.400]   That's bizarre.
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:44.960]   When I raised the cookie, it was gone.
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:45.960]   Mm.
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:49.880]   So I sent them some stuff to troll you and be like, those dang cookies, they're killing
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:50.880]   the internet.
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:51.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:52.880]   Sorry.
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:53.880]   Sorry.
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:54.880]   Sorry.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:55.880]   Poor Jeff.
[01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:59.520]   We're baiting too much already because of the pixel.
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:00.520]   Yes.
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.240]   Well, that's just an odd thing.
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.480]   I don't understand this.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:04.480]   Yes.
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.720]   I stole-- there's something to be done here.
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:08.080]   That sure feels like malware, to be honest.
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.080]   It kind of does.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:14.840]   And you take the-- well, here's the other thing is because of you and the need for Skype,
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:17.880]   I don't know whether I'm less secure because I'm in dev mode.
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:18.880]   Right.
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:19.880]   That may well be.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:20.880]   Yes.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:21.880]   It may well be.
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:22.880]   Yes.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:23.880]   It may well be.
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:24.880]   That's our fault.
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:25.880]   It certainly is.
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:26.880]   Yes.
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:27.880]   Most certainly is.
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:28.880]   Certainly is.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:31.800]   Well, what we're hoping is that we can get WebRTC working.
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:32.800]   That would be very cool.
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:33.800]   That would be very nice.
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:37.680]   And then if you-- anything about that is you can write your own darned app to do whatever
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:38.680]   you want to.
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:41.800]   There'd be neat things you can do with that.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:42.800]   Right.
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:43.800]   Well.
[01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:44.800]   Right how?
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.800]   I'm just looking to see if there's anything else.
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:48.800]   You did it.
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:49.800]   You did it.
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:50.800]   We're done.
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:51.800]   The Twitter music.
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:52.800]   Did we talk about that?
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:54.240]   Well, it hasn't launched yet.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:57.520]   We've talked about it before, but there's nothing to see here if you go to music.twitter.com.
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.520]   Yes, sure.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:32:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:01.480]   We keep waiting to hear what's going on.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:02.880]   They have created a launching page.
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:04.040]   Oh, I know what else.
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:10.040]   The Galaxy S4 now available on all U.S. carriers this month.
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:13.240]   So I'm going to probably get one of my T-Mobile accounts.
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:17.000]   So we'll have a little head-to-head between this and the HTC One.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.120]   I'm going to get it on T-Mobile myself.
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:20.800]   Yeah, me too.
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:26.920]   And somebody said on Venture Beat that the crapware that comes on the Galaxy S4 will mark
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:30.320]   the beginning of the end of Samsung's smartphone dominance.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:38.000]   This is an opinion piece, obviously, by John Coateser than the mobile beat.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:45.200]   And he says it's because of this crappy stuff like the hover and the follow your eyes and
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:46.360]   all of that stuff.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:49.480]   There's so much kind of Jim Crackery.
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:51.240]   How do you pronounce that?
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:53.240]   Jim Crackery on there.
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:54.240]   I don't know.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:55.240]   Grandpa, how do you pronounce that?
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:56.240]   It's Jim.
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:57.240]   Good job.
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:58.240]   Good job.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:59.240]   Jim, Jim, Jim.
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:00.240]   I'm two dads.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:01.240]   I'm 62.
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:02.240]   It's two dads.
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:04.440]   I don't have to do one on me.
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:05.440]   You never.
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.440]   Jim Crackery.
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:07.960]   I'm way too young to understand.
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:11.800]   Jim Crackery, that's the man.
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.640]   I just made it up maybe.
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.720]   Gina and I are in our 20s, so we don't know.
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:17.240]   Yeah, you young people.
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:18.840]   You'll be old someday too.
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.200]   You, Stapper Whippers.
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:21.840]   Napa or a himpers.
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:22.840]   Yeah.
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:28.760]   So he's calling the Samsung apps like the eye tracking and all that crapware?
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:29.760]   Gadget.
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:30.760]   Yeah, gadget, gimmickry.
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:31.760]   Yes.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.760]   And I think he's probably right.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:36.200]   The Samsung thinks it's what what stings was that?
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:37.200]   Differentiates it, right?
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:38.200]   It does in my mind too.
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:40.200]   Yeah, it makes me say no, no thanks.
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:45.080]   Well, but is the difference between Samsung's translation app and its nav app and all that?
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:47.240]   Just that it's in Google's is just that it's not Google.
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:48.240]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:51.920]   Do we just not take Samsung seriously as a mobile app developer?
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:52.960]   That's a good question.
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:58.520]   Why are these mobile apps from the carriers so cr- are the manufacturers so bad?
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.000]   Because they are generally, right?
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.600]   They're not software development houses.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:02.600]   They're not.
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:03.600]   They're not web services.
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:04.600]   That's it, right.
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:07.160]   Even Apple zone apps are not as good as, in fact, Google's apps for Apple are bad.
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:09.200]   They're better than Apple's apps on the iPhone.
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:11.880]   Well, but also at the same time, there is a brand thing going on here.
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:15.240]   There was a study that's up on the rundown that says that people prefer Google search
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:19.520]   results even when it's just the Google brand put on top of Bing search results.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.920]   Good for Google.
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:23.120]   And also I saw the same things.
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.600]   They get five times more malware from Bing than you get.
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.640]   It's the old search results and you get it from Google.
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:30.520]   Now I will do one last story and then we'll get our picks of the week because we're going
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.520]   to wrap it up.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:37.120]   Coming up, Patrick Rothfuss, who is the author of a book series that I'm just loving.
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:39.320]   Called the Kingkiller Chronicles.
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:43.040]   Book series, a Trey Radcliffe told me, "If you don't like these books, I don't want to
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:44.680]   be your friend.
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:46.880]   You will join us on triangulation just a bit."
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:53.160]   The Neiman Journalism Lab published, I thought, a very affirming article for me.
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:59.760]   The end of big media, when news organizations move from brands like the New York Times,
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:04.920]   the Wall Street Journal, CBS, to platforms for talent.
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:12.480]   And the writers Niko Millet and John Whibi, who are the authors of a book called Milneco
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:17.600]   is the End of Big, How the Internet Makes David the New Goliath.
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.160]   Did you read this yet?
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:20.160]   Jeff?
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:21.160]   Yeah, I got the most of it.
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:22.160]   I got distracted.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.160]   Squirrel.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.480]   And forgot to come back.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:29.000]   I just like it because what they're basically saying is that news brands should invest in
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:34.400]   the people, the talent, the names because that's really why people follow a news brand.
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:37.560]   I think the interesting problem with this is that it's not right.
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:38.560]   It's right for you, Leo.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.560]   It's what you do.
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.560]   It's what one others do.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.840]   It's the existence of Lamar and folks like that.
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:49.040]   But my argument lately has been that thinking that we're in the content business as a trap,
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:52.840]   that we make a product called Content, and that it's about our value, what we bring to
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.160]   it is so wonderful.
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:57.440]   And I think in journalism at least, we should see it as a service.
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:58.440]   And the service has a hard way to do it.
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:00.040]   Yeah, and that's a very different thing.
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:04.360]   You're teaching journalism to young, impressionable children who should take your word because
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:06.960]   that's we need journalism as a service.
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:08.800]   It serves the Republic.
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:09.800]   It serves.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:13.320]   But instead what I see is all that a lot of people come in and say, "Oh, we have to have
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:15.320]   more long-form journalism."
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:19.000]   And I make fun of that because I say, "I don't wake up in the morning saying, 'I want to
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000]   read something long today.'"
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000]   No.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000]   I'll say, "A long-form journalism."
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.800]   In fact, you couldn't even finish this article.
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:24.800]   It's not even that long.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:25.800]   Exactly.
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:26.800]   Exactly.
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.800]   I thought that a little.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:29.800]   It's a shame.
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:33.240]   But I read it on my pixel and it was beautiful.
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:34.800]   So much more than that.
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:36.600]   It's just like, I don't know.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:39.200]   Looks good on this old Windows crap top, too.
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:42.040]   You can't even see it because it dies.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:45.680]   So I don't disagree for certain circumstances, but I also think there's a trap.
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:49.240]   There's an editorial ego trap here that says, "We are so wonderful.
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:50.400]   We writers."
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:55.160]   And I always remember the story that when I wrote the only time I ever worked and the
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:58.400]   same market as my parents lived is when we both lived in Chicago.
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:02.600]   And more than once, my mother would say to me, "Did you see this story about it?"
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:04.160]   And I would say, "Ma, I know.
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:05.160]   I wrote it.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:07.920]   No mother wouldn't notice my biological life."
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:08.920]   Right.
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:13.160]   Well, that's true on a platform where you aggregate a lot of writers, but on the other
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:19.920]   hand, Twitter is an example of a big ego creating a thing around the journalism.
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:23.600]   Here's in the article they say, "On Election Day 2012, more than 20 percent of the New
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:29.360]   York Times traffic to their website was Nate Silver's blog."
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:30.840]   And that makes a lot of sense, right?
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:31.840]   Yeah, it does.
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:35.280]   And I think the Times is smart to know that and to work with that.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:38.120]   And they've worked with these kinds of brands.
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:39.680]   And yes, they're aware of that.
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.200]   Now, there are a collection of brands.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:43.680]   Used to be the newspaper's brand would rub off on the writer.
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:45.600]   Now the writer's brand can rub off on the newspaper.
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:49.160]   The real test will be Andrew Sullivan, right, who's gone off on his own to do his own thing
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:52.400]   behind a paywall, no less.
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.800]   And so it'll be very interesting to see whether he can succeed with an outlet that is just
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:58.720]   him behind a paywall.
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:38:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:05.440]   But I think what makes something like this so successful and so interesting is that media
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:09.960]   right now, especially what this article is saying, is really personality driven.
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:16.200]   I know what I do on YouTube is people can, you know, they don't really care about what
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:17.200]   I'm talking about.
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:21.520]   They care about the person, the person and how I deliver.
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:24.840]   I think primarily that's why they stopped by my channel or that's why they invest in
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:25.840]   it.
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:27.400]   And I think it's the case for any writers.
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:33.120]   You know, there are certain writers I prefer to read on tech crunch and I do others when
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.160]   I read it because I just like their flair.
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:38.920]   And I think that's going to be the case whether we kind of like it or not.
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:42.800]   But I do agree with Jeff, you know, hopefully it doesn't become too egocentric where it's
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:44.040]   all about the writer.
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:49.040]   But I think the social aspect cannot be ignored here going forward.
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:54.480]   Or it's all commentary and no reporting because reporting is kind of a thankless task that
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:55.480]   isn't about personality.
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:56.640]   Or in real value.
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:58.960]   It's gathering facts.
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:02.520]   They also point out that social media is one of the reasons this has changed in order
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:06.800]   to capitalize on social media that brands, the media brands really have to put people
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:09.920]   first up front on Twitter and Facebook.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:11.040]   And that does make sense as well.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:14.040]   Well, I just like it because it just kind of affirmed my model.
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:15.040]   Yeah.
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:16.040]   I don't know for you, it does.
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:18.280]   Well, because it's all about us.
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:19.280]   Yeah, right.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:20.280]   Yeah.
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:21.280]   If I only had a pixel.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:22.600]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:23.600]   No, we're not.
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:24.880]   We're going to go right into it.
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:25.880]   Right.
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:29.160]   And time for our tip, our tool, our number of the week will start with Gina's tip of
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.160]   the week.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:32.960]   My tip this week is a really cool YouTube.
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:35.320]   So it's appropriate for Lamar YouTube Easter egg.
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:37.680]   I'm always a sucker for any strike.
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:44.200]   So YouTube celebrating the 57th birthday of the first commercially available video recorder.
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:45.200]   Okay.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:47.800]   So to celebrate, they added on certain videos.
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:51.000]   And I can't tell why some videos get it and some videos don't.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:58.160]   But on certain videos, a little tape recorder appears in the control panel on a video.
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:01.800]   And if you click on the tape recorder, yeah.
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:03.000]   Yeah, let's see.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000]   There's one.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.640]   This is an X is seven and right.
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:06.640]   So you click on a tape recorder.
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:07.640]   VHS.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.640]   Now pause it.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:09.640]   Pause it.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:10.640]   Pause the video.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:11.640]   Oh, I love it.
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:12.640]   I love it.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:13.640]   I love it.
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:22.720]   So for those of you listening in the audio, you get the lovely 1980s VHS effects, which
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:24.040]   I really appreciate.
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:28.160]   Most people watching this do not remember VHS probably.
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:31.640]   Sad to say that is so great.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:33.560]   That is so great.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:35.520]   Oh, I'm like a little mom.
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:37.160]   So really cool effect.
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:41.400]   And like I said, you can see that some videos and not all of them.
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:46.360]   If you add an end, VHS equals one to the URL, you can see it on the videos that it's
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:47.360]   enabled on.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:50.920]   There was a little knob, a tracking knob that would fix that.
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:51.920]   Yes.
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:52.920]   Oh my God.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:53.920]   Tracking.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:54.920]   Tracking.
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:55.920]   Wow.
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:58.520]   Touch me back.
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:41:59.520]   Technology.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:02.320]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:07.480]   Eric Schmidt says that within nine months, there will be one billion Android smartphones.
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:11.360]   We do those numbers all the time about how many.
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:13.080]   But that's that's a heck of a number.
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:14.080]   That's a Facebook number.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:16.440]   But that's hardware that people bought them.
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:17.760]   That's around the world.
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.560]   That's pretty impressive, I think.
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:25.320]   That's a huge and he mentioned one and a half million activations every day now.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:27.040]   They still don't know what that means.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.040]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:29.040]   I agree.
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:31.920]   I was not going to do it because that number just washes on me now.
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:35.280]   But yeah, it's a big million devices.
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:36.280]   That gets my attention.
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:37.280]   Wow.
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:40.480]   And they all have Facebook home because there's a billion Facebook people.
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:42.240]   I already did my right.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:43.400]   I already did my tool.
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:47.840]   And of course, that's the HTC one will stay tuned because the Galaxy S4 in a couple of
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:48.840]   weeks.
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:51.400]   Lamar, did you have if you want, you don't have to, but you could give us a tip.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:52.920]   You're going to get me a notice.
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:54.280]   Yeah, we didn't warn you.
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:55.880]   So no, you don't have to do anything.
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:58.200]   Your tip is do not build your own IKEA furniture.
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:42:59.440]   Get somebody to do it.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:00.440]   Yes.
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:06.040]   And to make sure you watch this week in YouTube because that's where you'll get the most YouTube
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.040]   news.
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:12.120]   You'll go with Google, but you get the more fine tuned news.
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:15.360]   But without the pretty face because, you know, Jeff won't be there.
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:16.360]   Sorry.
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:22.360]   And remember when you watch those VHS videos on YouTube to rewind when you're done.
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:23.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:24.360]   Be kind.
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:25.360]   Rewind.
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:26.360]   Absolutely.
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:32.160]   Today is, and I didn't know it until Dean Atkinson of some all came by and said, congratulations
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:35.440]   that this is the and brought us some wine, I might add.
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:37.440]   I said, Dane, did I name Dan Atkinson?
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:39.720]   Oh, Dane Atkinson.
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:40.920]   My eight is falling over.
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:45.160]   Today is the eighth anniversary of the very first twit, which we didn't even call Twitter
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:48.560]   at the time, August, April 17, 2005.
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:49.560]   So we got a little cake.
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:52.000]   It says, happy birthday, twit.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.760]   We are eight years old.
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:55.760]   And I feel like a seven year old.
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:56.760]   Hold on.
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:58.320]   I'm glad you didn't say happy birthday.
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.320]   You to it.
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:02.440]   They had to pull it off.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.080]   This video be pulled down.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.080]   Anyway.
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:06.080]   We had fun today.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:07.080]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:09.080]   Gina Tarpani, smarterware.org.
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:14.040]   She's the author of Think Up, which will soon be available for all in Sunday to download
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:15.840]   and put on their devices.
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:16.840]   And they'll be a hosted solution.
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:20.400]   But actually it's already available for you to do it, but they'll be a hosted solution
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:21.400]   coming soon.
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:22.400]   Indeed.
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:23.400]   Yep.
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:24.400]   Coming soon.
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:25.400]   Great show today.
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:26.400]   Thank you so much, Gina.
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:27.400]   Always great to see you.
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:31.960]   Thank you to Jeff Jarvis City University of New York professor of journalism, but also
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:41.320]   my inspiration and role model and all things except laptops and a nice boy.
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:43.520]   Don't burn the place down there.
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:48.960]   Yeah, there are public parts which you must buy at a bookstore near you and Lamar Wilson.
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:50.520]   So nice to have you back again.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:53.480]   Lamar's been on every show on Twit this week.
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:54.480]   It feels like it.
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:55.480]   Yeah, no, it's really great.
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:57.120]   I'm social hour on Friday.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:58.120]   Will you really?
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:44:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:00.120]   Yeah.
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:01.120]   I guess I guess.
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:02.120]   I love it.
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:05.360]   The log jam of self promotion here at Twit is broken now.
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:07.800]   And get ready because here it comes.
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:08.800]   I'm here to fix it.
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:10.800]   Thank you, Lamar.
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:12.440]   You might watch this week in YouTube.
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:16.840]   Don't watch it on YouTube though because it's downloaded from.
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:17.840]   She's Louise.
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:19.000]   Twit.tv/YT.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.840]   That's where you can get it.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:23.840]   We are not blocking ourselves.
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:27.480]   The Google rep just emailed us back say he's going to look into it.
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:28.480]   So hopefully it'll get resolved.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:29.480]   Thank you.
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:30.480]   Thank you, Google rep.
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.480]   You might be.
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:32.840]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:36.160]   We do this week in YouTube every Wednesday, 1 p.m. Pacific 4 p.m.
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:37.160]   What?
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:38.160]   What?
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:39.160]   What was that?
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:40.160]   Google this week in YouTube.
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:42.720]   This week in Google, whatever the hell it is.
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:43.720]   I've taken over.
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:45.600]   You're his new favorite.
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:48.160]   I don't like you guys anymore.
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:49.160]   Oh, geez.
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:50.160]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:51.160]   It's me and Lamar.
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.160]   No, no.
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:56.000]   This week in Google, we do it every Wednesday, 1 p.m. Pacific 4 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:03.440]   One plus 12 is 13 plus 7 is 2000 UTC for those of you watching in Switzerland.
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:04.800]   And we do invite you to watch live.
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:06.720]   But again, you can always get that after the fact.
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:13.200]   This case, the show is Twit.tv/Twigger, wherever finer podcasts are aggregated.
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:16.360]   I'm going to go put this cake out in the rain, but.
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:19.280]   A reference they won't get later.
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:20.280]   Nobody's going to get it.
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:21.280]   Somebody in the chair who said that.
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:22.280]   I love that song.
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:24.800]   I don't know if I can make it.
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:29.880]   It took so long to bake it and I will have that recipe again.
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:31.440]   Oh, no.
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:32.920]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.160]   We'll see you next time.
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:35.920]   What Justin Bieber sing that?
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:36.920]   Yes.
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:38.080]   I'm a believer.
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:41.600]   Just me and Anne Frank together.
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.120]   I knew you would get it.
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:45.480]   Can you believe he did that?
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:48.280]   Did he really do that or was that just a no?
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:49.280]   He did it.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:50.280]   No one's not.
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:54.640]   He wrote in the guest book at the Anne Frank Memorial.
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:58.480]   If you've ever read the Dyer Van Frank, it's a very moving story of a young girl who was
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:04.360]   hiding from the Nazis and kept a diary until she was in fact caught and her entire family
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:05.560]   was murdered.
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:11.760]   And Justin Bieber visiting this historic moving site wrote, "I have a feeling Anne would be
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:12.760]   a believer too."
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:13.760]   Oh, no.
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:14.760]   He did not.
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:15.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:16.760]   He's only 19.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:17.760]   Give him a break.
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:18.760]   That boy is self-destructing.
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:25.280]   It's right in front of our eyes and that's why we like it.
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.280]   Give him Google Glass.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:28.080]   You can see what he's seeing.
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:29.080]   Oh, Lord.
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:30.080]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:32.280]   Everybody, we'll see you next time on Twig.
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:33.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:37.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.580]   (upbeat music)
[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:46.080]   (breathing out)
