[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680]   It's time for Twig this week in Tech
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.960]   to show the covers all your technology
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.160]   needs from the Google.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.080]   Thank you.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.480]   I've got an "a" from the other room.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.400]   Thank you for watching.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.400]   And--
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.920]   I'm just unautomatic.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.640]   I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.520]   It's time for Twig.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.240]   This week in Google, the Google, the cloud, the Google
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.200]  verse, we cover it all right here
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.280]   with our good friends Gina Trapani of smarthereware.org.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.600]   Hello, Gina.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.440]   Hello.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.160]   How's it going?
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.920]   Oh, what's going great?
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.320]   Where's your bike?
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.480]   It's over there.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.080]   OK.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.800]   This is the newly lit and studioized Gina Trapani.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.320]   Yeah, I got some softbox lights.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.120]   I feel like a french fry on the--
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.320]   It's a griddle.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.960]   --on the shelf right now.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.960]   On the griddle.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.640]   Good to have you.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.720]   Also with us, of course, from Seattle, you speaking,
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.760]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis of Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.480]   Jake in the background.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.360]   Jeff wasn't a Jake Ron twit this week, which
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.520]   was a lot of fun having you.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.400]   Jake's ready to go home.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.160]   You can tell.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.840]   There's Jake.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.440]   He says, get me out of here.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.000]   There he is.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   He's waiting.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.800]   Get me out of here.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.880]   Enough with the hotel rooms, Dad.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.720]   You guys had fun, though.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.160]   You went to Google.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.440]   You went to Facebook.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.040]   You interviewed Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.200]   Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.800]   With @williams, I interviewed him at Twitter.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   And with Philip Pud, a Kaplan at Bitly,
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.840]   and at Bursley, we don't want to see him.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.240]   Where do you call it?
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.800]   Blippi.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.480]   Blippi, thank you.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.440]   Blippi.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.800]   Actually, this is for your book, Public Parts,
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.320]   which you're working on right now.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.720]   And I understand Pud said that I
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.640]   sold a lot of scales on Blippi.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.880]   Well, actually, he said you were a little late in--
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.360]   Matt Cuts was the first guy when I bought the scale.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.600]   And there was then the kind of viral buying.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.880]   And he said, oh, Leo wasn't actually at the top of that.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.760]   You know what I loved?
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.680]   Matt Cuts, who has lost so much weight,
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.280]   and he hasn't talked about it.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.960]   He's been quiet about it.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.520]   And he's only recently gone public,
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.840]   but he just looks fantastic.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.040]   So it's perfectly reasonable that Matt should sell so many
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.520]   scales.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.200]   Also with his--
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.680]   Matt just climbed.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.400]   Go ahead.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.200]   I'm sorry, Matt just climbed not Kilimanjaro.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.680]   He made it from Summit.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.200]   Holy moly.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.280]   Also with his there he is.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.120]   Kevin Marks, Ribbit.com.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.160]   It's good to see you once again from BT.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.040]   And on the whiteboard, if you look very closely,
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.760]   is the plan for global domination.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.600]   No, no.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   Global distribution.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.920]   Global distribution.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.680]   There it is.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.800]   You're-- I just want to point out something, Kevin.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.720]   I don't know if you know it, but your microphone is actually
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.320]   behind your head on your headsets.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.480]   That's because I'm using this one.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.160]   Oh, look at that.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.280]   He tricked us.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.800]   You can move that one back into the camera range.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.480]   It's a good mic.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.760]   That's that Yeti mic, isn't it, from a--
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.680]   It's the Yeti mic, yeah.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.560]   Well, I was just moving off my keyboard, so--
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.440]   You sound good?
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.600]   No, one of you sounds so good.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.480]   How can he sound so good with a microphone behind him?
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.000]   Tricky.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.640]   It's the magic.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.400]   You're a tricky fan, I hope.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.840]   So we actually-- we kind of voted you on the island last week.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.640]   Jeff, Gina, and I were talking about the Google Verizon
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.920]   proposal, which they hope to make law.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.200]   And Jeff really kind of made the most salient comment.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.000]   Why, Google, why?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.280]   And what we were curious about, having as a former Googler,
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.680]   Kevin, is what your insight might
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.640]   be into the internal divisions over this.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.840]   Google's a big company.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.040]   They may speak with a single voice,
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.640]   but they don't act more.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.200]   They don't internally maybe have that same point of view.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   Do you think there's some dissension among the ranks
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.640]   over this net neutrality move?
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.280]   Oh, I'm sure there is.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.720]   I mean, this is a complicated problem.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.760]   The challenge is always how do you keep the net open
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.280]   and how do you make it useful for everyone?
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.840]   And broadly, Google wants that.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.240]   And that looks like they've decided this is the best thing
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.760]   they're going to get for the moment.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.600]   That was my read on what they were saying publicly
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.920]   and some of the stuff I've seen, Vint Cerf and Richard
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.600]   Whit and the others say about around the topic.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.560]   I think for me, the bit that was weirdest
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.480]   was this split between wild line and wireless,
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.200]   because that's far too broad in my head.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.480]   I'd say there's difference between cellular and wireless.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.480]   We don't want them saying, oh, and Wi-Fi and white spaces
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.040]   and everything else should be non-neutral too.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.280]   That's the bit that makes me a little nervous.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.080]   If they say cellular internet, then you can make the arguments
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.880]   that you and Stacy and Kerber were saying last week about,
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.720]   this thing is different.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.280]   But I'm really careful.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.320]   As this passes through Congress and gets mutilated
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.680]   by the other telecoms, lobbyists, it doesn't end up saying,
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.680]   oh, we can do what we like to Wi-Fi as well.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.320]   Do you think it's fair for Google?
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.000]   I mean, it's a reasonable thing for them to say,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.400]   this is the best we're going to get.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.360]   And we wanted the protections for landline.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.960]   I mean, isn't the future in mobile
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.480]   and aren't they selling us out?
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.560]   I'm not sure.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.720]   I think I'm not sure.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.520]   I'm just saying it's out.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.600]   It feels like that a little bit.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.720]   But I think they're just trying to come up with something
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.800]   that gives them some protection.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.760]   I mean, the other bit for me is that there's
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.960]   a certain amount of a storm in the teacup for this.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.360]   If we actually believe that the internet is better
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.960]   and the cellular things will be worse,
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.000]   then we shouldn't be that worried.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.200]   They're just going to be less useful.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.320]   And we'll end up using Wi-Fi more like we are at the moment.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.120]   That's my long-term view on this is,
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.320]   if they want to make crappy networks that are less useful,
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.960]   well, and charge us money for that,
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.160]   then that doesn't seem like a great business model to me.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.000]   So the market will protect us?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.760]   I think over time, we'll realize that there
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.040]   are better ways of getting internet connectivity
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.720]   than paying a cell phone carrier $100 a month for it.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.800]   And then having an internet receiver for us.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.240]   But if that's your choice, the problem
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.800]   is that there's never been a free market in cell carriers.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.440]   It seems like they've all colluded it.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.720]   Let me play a little bit.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.920]   Just to show you that there is some talk about this,
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.080]   even in the mainstream world, John Stewart on The Daily Show
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.280]   last night, you sent me this clip.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.840]   He's got a new segment called John Stewart, Internet Predator.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.880]   It's a reality.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.840]   On one side, those who want the internet to remain
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.040]   a wide open marketplace of ideas.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.320]   On the other side, a larger group who
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.120]   have no idea what net neutrality means.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.000]   But it is an important issue.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.720]   A few years ago, a Google Vice President
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.960]   and one of the inventors of the internet put it best.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.920]   The biggest concern I have at this point
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.880]   is that in the absence of some form of protection,
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.720]   that the broadband service providers
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.560]   will be able to discriminate against the consumers as to which
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.400]   products and services they're able to reach.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.800]   We must preserve neutrality in this system.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.360]   This is been served for a while.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.720]   New Googles of the world.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.160]   New Yahoo's, new Amazon's to form.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.000]   Thank you, Obi-Wan.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.440]   Makes sense.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.840]   Google's unofficial motto is don't be evil.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.760]   So they would naturally oppose big corporations
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.200]   getting together to secretly decide what you can and cannot
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.480]   see on the web.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.800]   Am I correct?
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.680]   What Google is proposing with its partner Verizon
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.760]   is essentially a toll road system,
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.640]   a separate internet for wireless devices only.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.120]   I love his--
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.120]   What?
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.120]   What?
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.440]   Here's Google that you don't be evil.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.440]   Empire has gone from net neutrality
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.880]   will allow new Googles in Amazon's to form to net neutrality
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.640]   will allow new Googles in Amazon's to form.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.600]   Now, that's John Stewart.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.920]   He's a comic.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.600]   But I have to say, we've already seen surveys
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.040]   say that most Americans under 25 get their news from John
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.720]   Stewart, so he speaks for a large constituency.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.760]   Is that an unfair characterization of what's going on?
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.800]   It seems pretty much what we were saying last week.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.800]   Wasn't it, Gina?
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.040]   I mean--
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.080]   Yeah, and it was kind of funny.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.080]   I love how he said there was this larger group of people
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.720]   who have no idea what net neutrality was.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.240]   Well, that's true.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.040]   But I was gratified that he talked about it on The Daily Show,
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.320]   right?
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.760]   I mean, that shows that there's some interest in this.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.600]   Definitely, definitely.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.920]   I love that he covered it on The Daily Show.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.840]   I mean, it was oversimplied, and he laughed about it.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.800]   But yeah, I mean, he pretty much hit the nail on the head.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.320]   What about Google's response, PR response,
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.080]   which published on Thursday, which was the day
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.160]   after we did the show.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.360]   Someone on Twitter said, someone in Google PR
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.520]   is listening to Twig.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.440]   Yeah, well, I don't think it was just--
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.320]   It wasn't certainly just us.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.280]   Of course not.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.920]   But they said what Kevin said, which
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.720]   is this is the best we could get.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.640]   Right.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.200]   Right.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:23.520]   And did that--
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.560]   Why are they the ones getting it?
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.880]   That's a good question.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.840]   Why is it their deal to make this decision?
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.640]   Right.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.400]   Kevin, I saw somebody on Twitter or somewhere
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.680]   complained that we're so American centric on Twig.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.160]   Because, hey, we're American.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.400]   Sorry.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.720]   But can you add some international perspective here?
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.360]   Because you're both familiar with what's going on
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.920]   and the British political scene and work for a British company.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.560]   What's the-- where does this stand there?
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.360]   What's the comparison?
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.040]   In fact, were you in Britain when this all went down, Kevin?
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:57.400]   Yes.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:57.900]   Yeah.
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.640]   I've been whole out of the last two and a half weeks,
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.360]   mostly off net.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.800]   So I missed a big chunk of this debate.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:10.240]   So I didn't net neutrality as one thing,
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.160]   but there's this deeper legal idea of common carriage
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.360]   or in the UK EU, we call that mere conduit, which
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.640]   is the idea that everyone should have access to the service.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.720]   And they shouldn't be as long as they pay for it
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.960]   in the same way as everyone else.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.760]   And you don't discriminate based on who they are.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.160]   And this is a sort of deep legal principle
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.720]   that goes back a long way to the males and stuff like that.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.080]   And that's the thing that carries through.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.640]   And so part of the problem in the US
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.920]   is that the FCC moved the regulation of internet
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.480]   from a type that had common carriage requirements--
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.520]   that's title 2-- to something that didn't title 1 back in '96.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.000]   I think it was a bit while ago.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.720]   Stacy probably gave you more details on this last term,
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.720]   last time round.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.200]   Other places in the world, they do have common carriage
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.520]   requirements like this and mid-country requirements.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.800]   The other thing that is done is what
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.880]   we call structural separation, where
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.280]   you have different companies running different layers
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:12.800]   of the network.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.520]   And that's something we have in the UK.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.840]   There's a BT subsidiary called OpenReach, whose job
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.120]   is to just to run the cables, to run fiber, to run copper,
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.040]   to light it up, to get stuff running,
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.440]   and then to sell that to anyone at the same price.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.760]   So the rest of BT buys it from them at the same price
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.320]   as anyone else can, which stops us doing the virtually
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.440]   integrated thing that otherwise the telco seems
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.360]   to be the natural thing you want to do.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.280]   I think that's a good legislative structure,
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.080]   and something that was partially there in the US
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.920]   and then got eroded away over time.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.080]   And I don't know exactly the time on the details of that.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.960]   I'm sure you could find someone like Gordon Cook
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.080]   who could give you a chapter and verse on that.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.360]   But that is something that is different in the UK
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.960]   than in the US.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:03.000]   And the other thing that's different in Europe and the UK
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.520]   is that pretty much every carrier
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.680]   on the cellular spectrum is using the same standard.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.080]   They're all using GSM.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:18.560]   So you can buy a phone in the UK for 20 pounds.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.040]   Well, it's a pay-as-you-go phone,
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.360]   and you just put a sim into it.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.640]   And then you load that up for another 20 pounds worth
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.800]   of calling, and you use that.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.000]   And then when it expires, you can refill it again or not.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.840]   And you can buy--
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.800]   I did this last week with a colleague.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.080]   You can buy a little bag of sims for a pound each
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.640]   that belongs to all the different mobile networks
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.640]   and then load them up.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.880]   So you can plug them in and out of the phones
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.880]   as much as you'd like.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.000]   So how does that change this issue of a gated--
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.840]   well, actually, really a pay service on the mobile?
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.720]   I mean, they--
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.840]   Obviously, you get a different contract with those
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.480]   than you would with a monthly pay.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.400]   You're not watching television on it.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:12:59.920]   No.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.880]   So I bought a pay-as-you-go sim from Orange in the UK.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.920]   And what I got for that was I get so many tech--
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.680]   it's like 10 p.m. for calling, so many techs,
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.560]   like 300 techs a month, and 20 megs of internet a month.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.320]   So there's not much.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.040]   But you can actually use it like that,
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.560]   which means I can take an Android over there
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.080]   and plug it in and make it work.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.600]   Whereas there is more interoperability there
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.600]   because there's some standardization at the lower levels,
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.000]   and then there's competition at the upper levels.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.320]   My take on this is that overall, I think,
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.200]   we're moving beyond special networks to special purposes.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.080]   And the cellular networks are sort of gradually
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.120]   going that way.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.080]   They were very voice-focused networks,
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.080]   and they're becoming data networks.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.560]   But they're having trouble hitting that,
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.760]   and they're now saying, please use Wi-Fi.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.440]   Five years ago, the carriers wouldn't let you
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.160]   buy a phone that had Wi-Fi on it.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.440]   Now suddenly, they're pleading with you to use Wi-Fi
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.280]   instead of their networks for the high bandwidth issue stuff,
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.880]   because their modeling wasn't assuming
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.800]   that you'd be using Spotify or audio streaming
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.480]   or listening to Twitter or anything like that
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.240]   on your phone over the network.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.320]   They're assuming you were making calls or doing small,
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.080]   like, you know, transactions over it.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.000]   They're fools that they are.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.160]   Well, yeah, I mean, you're kind of in this,
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.560]   BT is in this business, right?
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.120]   And RIB is in this business.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.640]   In fact, I think if you wanted to pick a poster child
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.880]   for net neutrality, it'd be companies like RIB it or Skype,
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.880]   companies like, you know, that do kind of traffic
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.680]   that might compete with a carrier.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.280]   You don't want RIB it to be discriminated against.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.200]   No, I mean, that's, you know, when I was in the UK,
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.440]   I took my drive with me.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.080]   Now, my drive is a CDMA phone, doesn't work in the UK,
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.640]   but on Wi-Fi, I can use it as a web device.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.160]   But also I've got it set up with RIB it
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.040]   and with VoIP on it so that if someone rings my phone
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.720]   in the US after three rings, it routes it to RIB it.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.920]   And RIB it then calls me back over Wi-Fi on the same phones
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.720]   and it rings as a VoIP phone.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.840]   This is exactly what carriers hate.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.080]   To some extent, it's what carriers hate,
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.280]   but, you know, Verizon doesn't have an option to do that.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.120]   You know.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.240]   Were you to do that on a 3G network,
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.960]   they would really hate it because then you'd be using
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.240]   a wholesale bits instead of retail phone service.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.080]   - One minute bit.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.240]   Well, that's interesting 'cause I've got,
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.360]   I got the Skype client for this, for the droid,
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.520]   which Verizon promotes.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.520]   Verizon sent me a postcard saying,
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.040]   "Get the Skype client, you'll love it."
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.600]   And if you roll to the Skype client on the droid,
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.160]   it says, "I'm not running until you turn Wi-Fi off
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.240]   'cause I wanna bill you for the minutes."
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.200]   - Oh, and then they bill you for the--
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.840]   Now, they don't bill you for cell minutes,
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.000]   but they bill you for the bits.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.240]   They bill you something.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.240]   I don't show exactly what--
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.080]   - Oh, how interesting.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.080]   Yeah, 'cause we just got a story that Verizon's putting Skype
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.760]   even on feature phones now.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.920]   - If I launch it, it'll say turn off Wi-Fi or else.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.200]   - Yeah, I, that, MinduroidX does the same thing.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.600]   I didn't, oh, that's very interesting.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.560]   So there's another way around it.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.040]   - It doesn't work on Wi-Fi?
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.360]   - No.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.480]   - At all, like you have to be on--
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.320]   - No.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.160]   - Yeah.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.000]   - Yeah.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.120]   So they can bill you, basically.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.760]   They can't measure Wi-Fi, you're not using their network,
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.360]   but as soon as you use the 3G network,
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.960]   they can measure it and bill you.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.880]   That's what we're talking about, aren't we?
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.720]   - Yes.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.120]   Well, then the other one is that I just got the,
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.160]   that the, yeah, there we go.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.480]   I'm gonna go ahead and read that.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:37.200]   - Skype does not work on Wi-Fi, requires switching
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.440]   to a Verizon wireless data network connection.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.240]   And so what it does is it actually turns your Wi-Fi off.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.840]   - You have to explicitly turn off Wi-Fi,
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.200]   or it will just quit.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.680]   So it's not really Skype, it's really what it is,
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.520]   it's somehow else.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.920]   - Well, the problem with Skype, you know,
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.640]   Skype is great and it's had up as an example of this,
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.160]   but Skype is a proprietary protocol run by one company
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.920]   and they've got a Biz Dev deal with Verizon,
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.320]   that's what's happened.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.280]   Whereas the voice over IP stuff,
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.520]   the stuff that we do with SipDroid
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.680]   and the Ribbit routing and that is some standardized stuff.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.320]   You've got a Sip protocol stack that says how you connect
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.120]   and then you've got a bunch of codecs
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.800]   that are commonly agreed of how you move the audio
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.680]   and video back and forth.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.680]   That's the--
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.480]   - So as consumers-- - The consumers are a protocol stack
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.320]   that we can use.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.440]   - What we're seeing as consumers is Google, Skype
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.560]   and other companies are reying against our interests
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.520]   in favor of their own financial interests
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.280]   in favor of their own bottom line.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.200]   - Well, I'm not, you know, again, I'm not quite sure
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.880]   whether Google has a direct financial interest
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.720]   in this or not.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.880]   I don't see, you know, that, that,
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.920]   maybe that shoe hasn't dropped.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.520]   - Well, the only thing we can hypothesize
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.240]   is that because Google now sells so many Android phones,
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.760]   they're kind of in bed with Verizon,
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.680]   it just makes sense that they're going,
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.320]   that they like Skype and these other companies are gonna--
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.240]   - Yeah, but that may have been the ability
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.960]   to have a basis for talking to Verizon about stuff.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.400]   But, you know, Android is properly open source.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.600]   It's not fully under Google's control,
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.800]   which is a good thing.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.640]   One of the fascinating things that I've seen
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.800]   doing, you know, looking at this Android development
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.520]   is how many Android devices are showing up.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.680]   I wish I had them here.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.640]   My colleague has, we put a menager of these together.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.560]   - He literally does. - He literally does.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.680]   - More, there's hundreds.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.400]   - Hundreds. - Hundreds.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.120]   - There are all these little Chinese devices
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.440]   that are, that are, that are, that are, that are, you know,
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.440]   some of this big and some of this big
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.760]   and they're tablets and they're phone-like things
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.680]   and they're cheap, you know, you can buy them for 50 bucks,
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.120]   retail from China.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.360]   And they're not beautiful bits of hardware.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.320]   You know, they've got resistive screens, not capacitive,
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.240]   but they work, they run Android, they run your apps.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.240]   And that, for me, is a massive sea change.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.240]   You know, Google's sort of, to get the,
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.600]   powered by Google thing on the back, you know, with,
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.560]   with Google, you have to sort of do a business
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.800]   day with Google and sign up with Gmail and that.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.040]   But just to run and the Android builds yourself,
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:55.880]   you don't have to do that.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.360]   You just need to download the code, compile it
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.560]   and write some drivers.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.360]   And we're starting to see this sort of,
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.680]   all the consumer electronics companies are doing this
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.280]   rather than write their own firmware.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.120]   And so, you know, I predict within six months or so
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.720]   all the little photo frame things
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.280]   and all those devices like that that are, you know,
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.280]   that are all over the place and turned out
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.440]   why the consumer electronics industry will start
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.360]   to run Android just by default because it would be
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.600]   cheaper than building their own stuff for everything.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.520]   And that's going to start getting really interesting.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.320]   I'm not completely sure that Google's ready for that.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.840]   If you read the, what you must have to be an Android
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.360]   device spec, it says you must have a camera
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.320]   and you must have a whole bunch of different bits
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.600]   and pieces that need to be there before they will approve it
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.120]   as an official Android device.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.800]   Whereas actually what these guys are doing is saying,
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.960]   okay, forget the camera we're building tablets
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.000]   or we're building something that looks like an iPod
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.160]   but happens to be running Android instead.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.480]   And that's, for me, that's really interesting.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.280]   That gives us this sort of huge pre-cambrian explosion
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.200]   of interesting devices to work on.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.640]   Because the thing about Android is that it's the first
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.400]   open source consumer operating system.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.800]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.800]   - And that's, it is something we haven't seen before.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.960]   You know, we've had, you know, open source operating systems
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.520]   but they never had actually that much adoption.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.480]   Whereas, you know, I'm sure you've been waving the charts
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.880]   around where Android is like a third of all phones
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.640]   in the US and that kind of thing.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.600]   But I'm seeing this other sort of groundswell of gadgets
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.240]   that aren't, you know, aren't phones
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.080]   and not showing them those activation figures.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.080]   It's like the Kmart device.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.080]   - You all get it. - You guys seen that yet?
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.840]   - We haven't played with it, we've talked about it.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.200]   I haven't played with it yet.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.680]   - Well, I think, somewhere in the office is.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.640]   - Really? - Again, it's not a great device.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.920]   - Yeah. - You got one?
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.920]   - No, he's just waving his hand.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.360]   - I'm not raising my hand because of the latency I have.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.200]   - Aha.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:45.280]   - I was gonna say there was one bit of news in the feed
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.560]   is that the report that on Black Friday,
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.800]   Google and Verizon will announce a Chrome-based tablet.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.280]   - That's one way to respond, isn't it?
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.800]   Is to do a standard with Verizon?
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.640]   - A fall people.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.640]   - That challenges things like the organ.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.800]   That's what they did with the Nexus One.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.880]   They said this is the platform.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.920]   This is what it should look like.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.440]   You can buy other ones, but this is what we,
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.360]   this is the definitive Google experience.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.080]   Is that the idea of doing your own Chrome?
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.360]   By the way, it's, it doesn't, I don't know if it's Android.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.440]   I think it's, it might be Chrome OS.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.680]   - Yeah, that's correct.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.920]   - I think it's Chrome OS. - What they're saying?
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.840]   - Yeah.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.680]   - What did they announce it?
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.520]   Was that a rumor?
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.080]   - It's a rumor still.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.480]   A name source at Thon Mode Squad says,
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.480]   an HTC tablet running Chrome OS will be sold
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.000]   in Verizon stores November 26th.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.400]   Day after Thanksgiving, Black Friday,
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.800]   HTC and Verizon have not commented on that.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.040]   - Interesting.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.000]   - But that's Chrome OS.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.360]   See, I wonder why Google even,
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.520]   and we've asked this before, on the show,
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.840]   why Google even bothers with Chrome OS at this point.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.680]   They have a, there's a way.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.200]   - They have several things going on at once.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.040]   You know, they,
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.040]   - Well, let me, let me play this off for a second.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.240]   - Kevin, if you don't have Android on the device,
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.860]   and you only have Chrome,
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.680]   does that, I'm just thinking out loud here,
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.040]   which is dangerous,
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.000]   but does that then take away some of the functionality
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.280]   that we might want gives more control to Verizon,
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.400]   or does it give less control to them?
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.040]   'Cause it's purely the browser.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.400]   - That's a good question.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.080]   I think Chrome is purely a browser,
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:25.780]   and that means you're gonna do
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.200]   browser-y things with it.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.680]   So doing, it's not completely clear what you would need
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.840]   to do to do device access,
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.760]   to do things like telephony with it.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:34.840]   There's some, you know,
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.480]   I haven't seen a, I haven't run a Chrome build,
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.840]   and I've only seen the running,
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.480]   so I haven't actually done in depth comparison.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.560]   - So that means that Verizon isn't
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.640]   chargeable as a phone,
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.280]   then we can't get, what you just said, I think,
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.040]   is that others couldn't cut in on its phone
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.320]   and communications capabilities,
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.880]   and Verizon has the lock on that,
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.000]   not having Android, by just having Chrome,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.680]   so we're, we can use it as a browser,
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.960]   that's fine, that's all we can do.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.120]   Browser-y things to develop, that's it.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.960]   - So the challenge there is bringing those
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.880]   functionality to the browser,
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.240]   and they're not fully there yet with,
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.600]   you know, there's ongoing discussion, HTML5,
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.200]   about how to bring more audio, video capabilities
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.480]   to the browser staff,
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.600]   but that's not really egregious,
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.520]   there is an aspect for that yet.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.160]   - But you wouldn't have Skype there, for example.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.200]   - No, not unless they, yeah.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.040]   - Very convenient, you completely control
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.920]   what apps are on there.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.440]   - Right, but also you wouldn't have,
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.240]   you know, there isn't an HTML5 way of saying,
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.480]   capture voice yet.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.040]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.960]   So it couldn't be a phone.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.040]   - Yeah, well, depends if they put flash on it,
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.720]   then you could use the flash stuff,
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.960]   you know, we've got, we've built phones over flash
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.800]   that run in browsers,
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.160]   so if they've got flash in the Chrome thing,
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.280]   which they probably have,
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.320]   you can build stuff that way.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.000]   - Is there anything in HTML5 for that?
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.040]   - No, yeah, no, that's one of the interesting.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.440]   We need to work on, yeah, no.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.920]   I need to spend some time with the standards groups on that.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.480]   - Yeah, 'cause Ribbit with that.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.560]   - The irony is that it becomes less of a phone,
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.520]   and the phone company likes it more
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.600]   because it has more control.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.600]   (laughs)
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.120]   - Well, I'm not sure that, I mean,
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.440]   they will see it as an additional device.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.280]   You know, that's the,
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.600]   if you look at the iPad analogy,
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.120]   the iPad is not designed to be a phone device,
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.800]   and you can buy it with or without the telephony contract.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.720]   - Gina, I bet you agree.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.160]   I'd have to say I'm much less interested in a Chrome OS
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.000]   tablet than I would be in an Android OS tablet.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.720]   Yes?
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.200]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.600]   I'm just thinking about, you know, the Kindle app,
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.960]   and I mean, there are just certain apps
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.500]   that I would definitely want.
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.880]   Although this download squad piece suggests
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.160]   that possibly this tablet could be free
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.680]   with a Verizon contract,
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.760]   that's kind of interesting.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.880]   I mean, yeah, I mean, I imagine,
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.600]   so, I mean, we've established that the tablet
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.280]   is mostly a consumption device,
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.040]   and so you could browse and read,
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.760]   but I'm still, there's still certain apps that I would want.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.080]   And I think, yeah, I think I'm more excited
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.480]   about the idea of an Android tablet versus a Chrome OS.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.520]   Although I haven't really seen Chrome OS running.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.920]   Like I haven't, you know, I ran a kind of an early build,
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.720]   just to check it out,
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.240]   but I haven't really given it a fair shake yet.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.520]   So I wanna do that.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.840]   - You've done the hexa build, right?
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.680]   And that's what I did.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.560]   Yeah, we haven't done anything but the hexa builds.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.560]   - Yep, yep.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.600]   And it's a browser.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.500]   It's the way-- - It's a browser.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.760]   It's not even really,
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.280]   it doesn't feel like an operating system.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.600]   It's just a browser.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.320]   - Yeah, it's a browser and your favorite web apps,
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.160]   and that's great.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.000]   I love the web.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   The web is alive and well.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.840]   - Right.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.620]   Not according to Wired Magazine.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.560]   - I didn't want to record the wired.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.880]   - I didn't want to record the wired.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:37.400]   - Teacher, one more note is that we have a story
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.600]   in the feed that Google said in Germany,
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.920]   they're launching the Chrome App Store in October.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.240]   - So really, you're a great person to have on
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.080]   for this, Kevin,
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.680]   as you know probably better than most,
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.320]   what HTML5 can and can't do.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.320]   And really, everything that you're gonna see on a Chrome OS
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.720]   has to be an HTML5 app, right?
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.400]   It has to have JavaScript, CSS, HTML5.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.920]   If it can't be done by that, it can't be done by Chrome OS.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.240]   - Yes.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.240]   Yes, though, I think they do have flash in there as well.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.240]   So you have the ability to do the stuff that flash can do.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.880]   - I wish they wouldn't put flash in.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.840]   I have to say, 'cause it adds a lot of capability.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.480]   It also has security issues.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.560]   It makes it smaller. - It's just, yeah.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.360]   I'm not sort of anti-flash.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.400]   It provides capabilities we haven't sounded.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.240]   - Right.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.320]   Like capturing audio and video.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.280]   - You've got an audio and video capture tool
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.040]   built into the system, then having flash,
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:31.880]   so you do that is good.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.880]   - Right, right.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.360]   So I'm breaking up a bit.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.200]   - Yep, that's all right.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.120]   Welcome.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.360]   Verizon probably just noticed that we were doing the show.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.360]   (laughing)
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.320]   All the bits will suddenly get jammed
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.760]   somewhere down the road.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.320]   All right, well, let's take a break and come back.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.520]   We're gonna talk some more about this subject
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.200]   and there is more Google news this week.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.920]   I don't know how they keep coming up with more stuff,
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:27:00.080]   but Germany's getting some privacy in Street View.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.800]   Google TV, maybe it's stalling.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.000]   I'm very intrigued by what Apple's gonna do.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.120]   September 8th, they're gonna announce,
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.520]   well, we know something,
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.360]   probably new iPods, I think.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.800]   They're gonna announce a ITV and Apple TV
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.880]   to compete with Google TV.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.480]   We'll talk about that.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.480]   And Marissa Meyer, and why she should be careful
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.720]   on what she clicks.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.280]   Whoopsies.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.080]   Before we do that, I would like to mention my friends
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.960]   at GoToMeeting, that's the Citrix folks
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.160]   that do such great stuff.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.880]   And boy, I tell you, GoToMeeting on the iPad,
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.080]   and I think GoToMeeting on a Chrome OS,
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.880]   would be just spectacular on the iPad.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.720]   It's amazing.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.560]   You could take your iPad.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.400]   And I can't get to that side,
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.920]   as long as I'm on within Wi-Fi range.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.240]   Actually, I bet it would work on 3G.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.400]   I haven't tried it.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.280]   I get audio, I get video,
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.760]   I get your desktop on my iPad.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.200]   I can see what the meeting's all about.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.800]   It is a great way to get more done,
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.480]   bringing people together for either sales, training,
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:01.200]   collaboration, any kind of meeting.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.280]   You know, a meeting on the phone without the visuals
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.520]   just starts to really, I don't know,
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.400]   it's hard to keep people focused,
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.560]   hard to keep them engaged.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.040]   But as soon as they've got something to look at,
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.880]   it's a great web conference.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.440]   Now, I've tried a lot of web conferencing tools.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.280]   There is none better than GoToMeeting.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.760]   VoIP is included.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.480]   You can call via the phone or via your computer.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.920]   128-bit SSL, 24/7 customer support.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.560]   Easiest to use, easiest to stall
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.560]   and very affordable, $49 a month for unlimited meetings.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.160]   All the meetings you want as long as you want,
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.120]   as often as you want.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.480]   But I'm gonna give it to you free for the first month,
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.040]   so you could see for yourself.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.480]   I love it when companies offer free trials.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.120]   I think it's the only way.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.840]   We were talking about this yesterday.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.640]   How advertising, you know, for so many years
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.480]   was tricking you.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.400]   You know, you're gonna have bad breath
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.000]   if you don't use GoToMeeting.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.400]   Girls won't like you if you use GoToMeeting.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.600]   Instead, we're back to features and benefits.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.440]   This is the product.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.640]   This is what it does.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.640]   Try it.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.080]   You make the decision.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.000]   I think that's in the internet age,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.080]   that's called trusting the customer.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.160]   And I really applaud Citrix for doing it.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.120]   GoToMeeting.com/twig, T-W-I-G.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.960]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.800]   You be the judge.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.640]   GoToMeeting.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.480]   I think you like it.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.720]   GoToMeeting.com/twig.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:17.000]   We thank them for their support of this week in Google.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   So, actually, Neil also clicked the Tweficiency button.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.440]   And Marissa Meyer did.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.520]   And she apparently has a Tweficiency of zero.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.000]   And Neil Dash apparently has a Twoficiency of
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.560]   out of bounds error.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.120]   You know, knowing that Neil may have been
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.560]   just a really well-crafted joke.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.640]   Oh, it could have been.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.920]   Oh, it could have been, couldn't it?
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.560]   Yeah, I think he was joking.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.680]   I didn't even think of that.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.640]   Although you never know with him.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.680]   What a future he was joking.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.480]   It's his dry wit.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.400]   They've changed the Tweficiency site now.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.680]   There's a checkbox.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.560]   So you can calculate your Tweficiency,
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.160]   whatever the hell that is.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.040]   It's another one of those sites.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.600]   I like clout, K-L-O-U-T.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.080]   I think that's actually fairly,
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.280]   at least it has lots of pretty graphs.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.120]   That was great.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.920]   Tweficiency was just an OAuth app
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.400]   that the 17 year old was playing around with the Twitter API.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.560]   Yeah, and said, Twitter's turning off
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.840]   their basic authentication.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.640]   So everything has to go to OAuth in the next two weeks.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.360]   So you'll see a lot of those, which is great.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.240]   So you'll see a lot of people saying,
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.840]   "Hey, I have to retool my Twitter app
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.080]   because I have to go off."
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.160]   So he wanted to teach himself OAuth.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.840]   So he made this app, which I believe is sort of,
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.800]   just kind of for fun.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.560]   I don't even think the algorithm is anything,
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.320]   the calculation is very sophisticated.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.920]   So because it's OAuth, James Cunningham is requesting a token
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.160]   from Twitter, I'm gonna allow it,
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.040]   'cause I'm logged into Twitter.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.000]   Now this is the problem.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.160]   Marissa Meyer did it and it automatically tweeted
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.000]   her efficiency.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   I think I might have just done it too.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.840]   Whoops.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.680]   (laughing)
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.520]   - You did because you do it.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.360]   - You do it.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.680]   - Well, this is pretty.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.520]   - It will be for you.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.360]   (laughing)
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.200]   - Whoops.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.840]   - And you made some of Marissa.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.840]   - Well, nobody's changed it.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.320]   There's a checkbox, but I think I forgot to uncheck it.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.320]   (laughing)
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.160]   Whoops.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.080]   - It makes sense.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:01.920]   - Not your fault, Marissa.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.520]   We'll forgive you, 'cause I'm the same idiot.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.040]   (laughing)
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.240]   - But this is the problem.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.320]   So basically, OAuth gives you the ability
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.800]   to selectively give different preferences
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.080]   of different applications,
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.880]   but Twitter doesn't give you UI for that.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.080]   So if the app says, "I wanna tweet on your behalf,"
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.600]   you don't have a checkbox of saying,
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.080]   "No, you don't get a tweet on my behalf."
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:23.920]   - Right.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.840]   - So if you'd asked for that,
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.760]   you've either got to say, "No, I don't get to use this app,"
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.920]   or, "Yes," and then it will tweet on your behalf.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.400]   And there's a, this is a spammy mechanism
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.800]   that lots of these apps have done.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.520]   And Tervitions, yet I think, was trying to be spammy,
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.680]   he just built a sort of,
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.040]   it fought simple thing.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.120]   But because it was, you know,
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.360]   here's my thing, what's yours?
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.200]   And you think, what is that?
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.520]   And you click on it, it doesn't tell you information
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.680]   until you sign up.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.920]   And then you've gone around the loop.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.800]   He's built by the smallest self-propagating,
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.360]   stupid web thing, you know.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.560]   There was this thing, personal, hype quotient,
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.040]   which somebody did it,
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.200]   South by two years ago, to parody this movement.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.880]   And so when I saw this, it was exactly this.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.160]   He says, "My personal hype quotient is rising
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.160]   'cause I'm whatever."
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.480]   - 'Cause I'm hyping myself.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.440]   - And it spoofs this on your behalf.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.000]   But this is like the purest, simplest form of that.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.520]   - Well, at least mine is 1%, Marissa's is zero.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.080]   (laughing)
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.280]   - The key is when you sign up, you create an app.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.440]   You can say, I give it read access or read right.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.600]   So whenever you allow an app to access your Twitter stream,
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.000]   just check to see if it's read or read right.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.520]   Because if it's read right, it's very possible
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.240]   that it will send messages on your behalf,
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.080]   just in case.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.280]   - Right, but this is the problem.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.600]   The problem is you don't get an option to say,
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.640]   "No, you're any guy read only."
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.480]   - Right.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.080]   This is that same issue that we have
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.640]   when we install apps on our Android phones.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.720]   And it says, "I'm gonna do this, I can do this,
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.560]   "this, this, this, and this."
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.280]   You can't uncheck one of those boxes.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.360]   It's all or nothing.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.880]   - Yeah, it's true.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:47.720]   - That's right.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.680]   And there's a great post that Randy Farmer wrote
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.080]   based on some of the discussions we've had at.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.120]   I don't know if you can find it.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.680]   About this problems.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.560]   The problem is that how do you decide
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.960]   when to authenticate an application and when not?
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.840]   And the answer is, well, you try and you see
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.680]   what your friends have done.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.920]   But if your friends have been fooled by it,
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.360]   then they'll go there too.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.840]   So what Randy had a great debate
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.880]   that I had when you before last.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.400]   And we said, "What you want is to be,
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.000]   "for your friends to be able to say,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.200]   "this thing cheated me, I'm disallowing it."
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.960]   And when you go to the sign up screen, it says,
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.400]   Leo says, "This thing cheated me."
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.560]   Kevin says, "This thing cheated me."
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.400]   You go, "Oh."
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.680]   - Never mind. - Never mind then.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.320]   - So he called this, "The cake is a lie."
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.840]   He named it after the portal thing.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.720]   He said, "You want to be able to write
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.440]   "the cake is a lie on the wall of the app."
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.280]   - Right.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.640]   I, by the way, my personal hype quotient
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.080]   is a whopping eight out of 10.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.080]   - Oh, you're doing well there.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.920]   - Yeah, it says, "I'm currently on Book Tour
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.240]   "or I wouldn't be engaging in this crap."
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.480]   (laughing)
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:34:00.240]   - I defy you to, I defy you all
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.240]   to check your personal hype quotient.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.080]   - That's really funny.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.240]   Thank you for that link, Kevin, I appreciate it.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.280]   Kind of fun to play with.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.840]   Let's see, moving on to other stories.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.440]   We did mention this briefly, but let's say,
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.680]   let's say, apparently according to Chris Anderson
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.480]   in Wired Magazine, the web is dead
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:25.480]   that other forms of traffic have outpaced the web.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.480]   We're not gonna surf, WWW Forget it.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.560]   We kind of talked a little bit about this app thing.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.600]   It's kind of like that,
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.240]   as apps have replaced the web.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.920]   - Well, didn't Gina just go to his point a little bit.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.480]   I hate to say this, by saying,
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.320]   "Oh, I don't want something that's just a browser.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.400]   "I want apps."
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.640]   - Yeah, we did, didn't we?
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.480]   We said that, didn't we?
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.480]   - I did a little bit.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.480]   Uh oh.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.400]   - Uh oh.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.240]   - Uh oh.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.080]   - Oh yeah, and it's, you know, we want both.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:51.920]   - That's it.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.640]   - For the browser to be capable enough to do apps,
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.480]   that's what I was saying.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.320]   - We want choice.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.560]   - It's not quite there.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.480]   I would like the browse, the HTML5
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.960]   to give me as many facilities to build any app I want,
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.680]   and is getting there with the HTML5 stuff.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.400]   You can do huge amounts of things that you couldn't do before,
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.440]   but it's not quite there with device drivers
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.280]   and audio, video input and a few other bits and pieces,
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.680]   and it's not fully distributed across
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.000]   a bunch of different things.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.480]   So, but we're getting closer.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.400]   And, you know, there's the same sort of trade off of,
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.840]   is this thing standardized enough
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.040]   that I can write the code in one place
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.440]   and have it running lots of,
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.160]   lots of places not worried about what it's running on?
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.920]   The web is the best example of that we've ever had.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.480]   And Android is sort of somewhere along that line.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.920]   You know, we've got a bunch of different devices
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.240]   and it kind of runs on them,
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.960]   but you have to do a little bit of debugging here and there.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.520]   It's better than we've had, you know,
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.040]   with, say, running Java apps in the browser,
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.960]   but it's not, it's not completely smooth.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.760]   And the web isn't completely smooth either,
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.280]   but it's getting a lot better.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.280]   So, I think--
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.960]   - So, Gene, and just kill the web then we don't--
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.800]   - No.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:52.640]   (laughs)
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.000]   - If this is my defense, it in the web's defense.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.120]   Most of my favorite apps are add-ons
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.440]   to adjusting web services.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.960]   There are only a few things,
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.320]   like a few apps that I use that don't have
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.760]   a web component, Pandora, Mint,
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.280]   you know, MyTracks, the Twitter app, Gmail, Calendar,
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.680]   all these things have web-based components.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.640]   They're add-ons.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.000]   The Kindle app is one app that I really like on my phone
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.120]   and would really like on my tablet
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.200]   and I can't read my Kindle books.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.520]   Not that I can, but there isn't a web interface for that.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.240]   But that's a very, that's a rare exception.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.240]   And one of other apps--
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:26.240]   - Does it really matter if it uses HTTP or TCP or UDP or FTP?
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.880]   I mean, what do we care?
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:33.320]   Oh, let's preserve HTTP, like that's some magic thing.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.160]   - What is this?
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.280]   - It even works, Leo.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.120]   - Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:40.480]   - Just part of the wire story was arguing
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.400]   when it was calling a Facebook and app.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.200]   Well, in the broader sense, yes, it is,
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.000]   but it works on HTML.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.200]   - It's a web app.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.040]   - Yeah.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:49.880]   - It's a web app.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.240]   - So really, that right there kind of undercuts
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.760]   their argument pretty well.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.640]   Oh, you mean a web page is undercutting the web?
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.960]   Huh?
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.840]   - Well, I mean, also there's a certain amount of like,
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.520]   are we comparing similar things to it?
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.680]   Because the left-hand set of that graph is all protocols.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.160]   FTP, telnet, whatever, you know,
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.160]   use for news groups.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.720]   And it says web and does that mean HTTP?
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.160]   - So it means HTTP, then that video chunk
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.720]   should be mostly HTTP or HTTP web as well.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.560]   - That's right.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.000]   - Because most videos are HTTP.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:21.840]   - Right.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.840]   - What is the web?
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.680]   What is the web?
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.520]   Is it another question?
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.360]   - Well, that's not it.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.360]   - The web is an extremely--
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.200]   - The web isn't an agreement.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.040]   - It's a link.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.280]   It lives, it breathes.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.440]   - Right.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.360]   Look, as long as it's all on the internet,
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.200]   I don't really care.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.120]   I mean, look, this show,
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.640]   most people who are watching this show
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.640]   are watching it on a web page.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.400]   The transport that we're using in many cases
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.760]   is flash, in some cases is H.264.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.960]   In some cases it's HTTP, some cases it's UDP.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.800]   - Doesn't, I mean, who cares?
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.800]   The content is--
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:57.800]   - I find it ironic that both Wired Magazine
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.320]   and Rupert Murdoch are declaring dead
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.400]   the thing that's killing them.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.240]   (laughing)
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.320]   - Surprise, what a surprise.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.160]   Ooh, Conde Nast doesn't like the web.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.160]   By the way, we call that today.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.000]   - That was my comment.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.040]   It's like, why declares the web dead?
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.360]   The web is surprised that why is still alive?
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.200]   (laughing)
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.080]   - We called up today.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.280]   Frederick, my assistant came to me,
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.680]   he said, "I can't do it."
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.520]   I said, "What?"
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.680]   She said, "You wanted me to cancel
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.600]   "the Paper Wall Street Journal
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.000]   "because I get the Wall Street Journal
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   "I've had it on the web."
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.240]   And so I said, "Why am I getting the paper journal?"
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:31.480]   It cost me 10 bucks more to not get the paper journal.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.560]   If I want to cancel--
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.400]   - Free killer.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.840]   - If I want to cancel the paper,
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.920]   I have to pay more.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.600]   Rupert Marnock has set it up for some reason,
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.880]   I don't quite understand,
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.320]   that it's cheaper to get the paper and the web
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.160]   than to just get the web.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.200]   - Simple Leo, simple because he's charging
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.440]   all those paper advertisers as if you stare
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.360]   at every ad on those pages.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.160]   - So the thing that's lining our bird cage
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.480]   is making him money.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.760]   (laughing)
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.720]   He is a tree killer.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.040]   - He's ripping off the advertisers.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.560]   - He's an ad, and yeah.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.600]   - Which is not just him, it's always been the case,
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.920]   it's the big lie of print
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.200]   that you bought the entire audience in publication
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.200]   as if that entire audience paid attention to it all,
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.840]   but of course we didn't.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.880]   I'm not being a real man,
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.880]   I always threw out the sports section.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.520]   But the advertiser was paying for my attention.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.960]   - I have to say, as a podcaster,
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.560]   that's a discussion we don't like to get into
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.360]   because advertisers frequently say,
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.520]   "Well, you're counting downloads,
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.720]   "but who's to say they listened?"
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.760]   And of course, there's no answer to that anymore
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.200]   than they bought the magazines,
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.320]   who's to say they saw your ad,
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.160]   or they bought the newspaper,
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.000]   who's to say they saw your ad, we don't know.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.760]   And there was one move for a while
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.680]   to distribute special modified iPods
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.520]   that actually watch what you listen to.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.560]   Nobody, fortunately, thank goodness
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.120]   that's gone by the wayside.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:54.320]   - Well, I mean, there's last FM,
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.280]   that feeds back what you've listened to.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.880]   Your iTunes knows what you've played,
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.240]   and it propagates it back from the iPod,
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.080]   or at least it used to,
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.440]   it stopped working for mine while back.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.800]   So you can actually run little scripts on iTunes
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.240]   in the match menus and say,
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.280]   "Give me a playlist of things
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.760]   "I haven't already played and stuff like that."
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.240]   - But it doesn't show you you've listened to the whole thing,
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.080]   or does it?
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.720]   - It's, there's a threshold, I think.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.640]   It shows you what,
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.400]   you can find out what fraction you've listened to, I think.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.240]   - Really?
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.640]   - There is an API in there,
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.080]   but only if you've listened to it on an iPod or iTunes,
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.720]   you know, if I copy it to my Android and listen to it,
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:27.560]   it has no idea.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.040]   And that's the problem I've had with iTunes.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.640]   Once I started listening to podcasts on Android,
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.840]   it said, "Oh, you haven't listened to this,
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.760]   "I was gonna stop downloading it for you."
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.800]   It's like, "No, I have listened to it,
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.360]   "it's just not on your starting device."
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.000]   - So now we know that Rupert Murdoch, Condi Nast,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Prince, and the latest John Cougar, Melonkamp,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.720]   hate the internet.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.240]   Melonkamp says, "I think the internet's
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.560]   "the most dangerous thing invented since the atomic bomb."
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:57.680]   - Wow, and I thought McGinnis was bad.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.600]   - Okay. (laughs)
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:03.280]   Prince says, "It's full of numbers and that can't be good."
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.880]   (laughs)
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.720]   - I swear. - I don't know if it says
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:06.960]   we should be like the Chinese government.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.800]   That was a good one.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.640]   - There's good.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.200]   And just block the things we don't like.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.040]   - Yeah. - Not good for you.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.600]   We know what's good for you.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.440]   Moving right along.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.360]   So I think we've concluded the web is not dead.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.200]   That's good.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.040]   - The web's alive, still. - The web's alive.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.160]   Now, Gina, you have an article,
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.440]   are you talking a little bit about this Google Me?
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.560]   I think we're getting closer and closer to a Google Me.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.480]   - Yeah, I think so too.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:34.360]   You know, a former Google employee,
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.400]   I was asking him about what he knew about Google Me
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.840]   and the answer was nothing,
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:43.320]   but he said that a user experience designer at Google
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:46.240]   had done, Paul Adams had done a presentation
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.560]   and the slides were up on SlideShare
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:48.400]   and he said, "I think I'm gonna be--"
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.440]   - That's a really nice presentation.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.080]   - Yeah, if you, yeah, he said,
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.920]   "If you look at this presentation,
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.320]   "you'll get a good idea of what Google Me is gonna be."
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.080]   And it's an excellent presentation
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.720]   and I linked it on the friend feed.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.960]   But we had talked about how we really hope
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.400]   that Google Me just doesn't aim to clone Facebook
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.400]   and kinda catch up.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.960]   We're hoping that it's gonna do something different
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.800]   and new and kinda solve some of the problems
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.200]   that people have on Facebook.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.560]   And if this presentation is any indication,
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.480]   it's gonna do that.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.560]   Adams basically talks about how we all have
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.320]   these different groups of people in our lives
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.000]   and different levels of relationship.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.400]   He talks about this woman, Debbie,
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.000]   who lives in San Diego and has some friends in LA
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.440]   who work at a gay bar and they post kinda pictures
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.320]   from the wild nights at the bar on Facebook
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:33.880]   and she comments on those.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:37.280]   But she also coaches a 10 year old girl swimming team.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.920]   And so she's friends with some of the,
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.640]   some of her swimmers on Facebook as well.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.160]   And-- - Yeah, baby.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.480]   (laughing)
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.320]   - And during this sort of user research,
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:50.000]   you know, interviewing that they did with her,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.680]   she was horrified to realize that her swimmers
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:55.840]   could see her comment on the gay bar pictures
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.360]   and how that in real life just doesn't happen, right?
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.880]   'Cause you go to your mom's house for Thanksgiving
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.320]   and you behave one way in front of Uncle Bill and Aunt Mar,
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.160]   right?
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.360]   But when you're with your friends at Hooters,
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.360]   you react, you act a totally different way.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.680]   But on the internet, you know, it's one friends list
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.600]   and a status update goes out to everyone
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.680]   regardless of context.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.000]   So, it sounds to me like Google's really gonna attempt
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.160]   to make it easy to differentiate between strong ties
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.160]   and weak ties and also differentiate
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.560]   between different social contexts.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.600]   Now, to me, this sounds like a user interface.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.440]   - Nightmare.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.760]   Nightmare, yeah.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.600]   - A challenge.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.360]   - It is the hard problem.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.640]   The hard problem is specifying groups, yeah.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.800]   - Yeah, yeah, it is.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.720]   And you know, Buzz does a pretty good job of this, right?
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.920]   I mean, but-- - Well, they have it.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.560]   I don't know if does anybody use that?
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.720]   - Well, this is the question.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.560]   Does anybody use it?
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:44.880]   You know, are we gonna take the time
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.480]   to garden our various contexts and groups?
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.640]   You know, am I gonna take the time
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.560]   to post status updates to my family group
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.480]   versus my, you know, my kids group and my swim team?
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.640]   You know, I don't know.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.560]   But this presentation also talks about
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.040]   how important profiles are, which I think is interesting,
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.280]   'cause I do think Google profiles
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.240]   is gonna be central to Google me.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.400]   And how, you know, the way that we create
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.320]   our identity online, I mean, we all want,
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:10.760]   we all care very deeply about how other people see us.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.200]   Actually, there's a photo of a woman
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.720]   who is in high heels on crutches.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.440]   And he makes the point, like, you know,
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.240]   people care about what the perception is
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.520]   and what they look like to others.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.720]   And how do we do that online to various groups?
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.560]   But it's a really good presentation, I recommend it.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:26.640]   But if Google--
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.400]   - Smarterware.org is right on the front page of Gina's site.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.960]   So you can get to it that's the easiest way.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.440]   - If Google can pull this off,
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.960]   Google me sounds really neat.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.840]   I just hope that it's not just a sea of toggles
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.240]   and drop downs and checkbox.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.000]   - This is what the user interface is gonna look like
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   and I'm excited.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.240]   (laughing)
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.440]   - Yeah, I mean, you've got a bit of this in bars,
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.960]   but it's slightly buried.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.360]   And if you've seen this in bars.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.280]   If you go in bars, you can,
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.040]   when you create a new bars,
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.080]   you can decide which group it goes to.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.520]   - Right. - Yes.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.160]   - Yeah? - But does anyone do that?
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.360]   - Never, never done it.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.200]   I've never even said it up here.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.160]   - There's a little drop down at the bottom.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.200]   It says public on the web.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.600]   And if you choose that, oops, I've got crap in front of me.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.920]   - So when I create a new one,
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.000]   I could choose whether I want this public or private.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:12.840]   - And if you get private,
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.040]   it lets you choose which groups.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:15.880]   - And then I--
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.080]   - This is also where Zuckerberg goes by saying
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:19.920]   we have one identity,
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.760]   where people get, which pisses off people.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.360]   But this idea that you can completely fence off
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.640]   one world from another world,
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.280]   and they will never cross.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.520]   And as you just says, yes,
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.600]   the presentation shows there are new ways for them to cross,
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.920]   but they've always been able to cross.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.320]   - I actually, and you know what's nice,
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.160]   and this is where Google really has an advantage.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.640]   If you've been using Google contacts or Android,
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.160]   you already have set up groups.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.240]   You see, 'cause I was using Google Voice,
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.880]   I have different messages from my family
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.800]   and different messages from my friends.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.880]   And I have started Android.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.480]   So I can use, those groups are already here.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.320]   I could use those.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.040]   I could say, this goes to my family only.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.720]   - Then you do, and they are.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:54.560]   And in this presentation,
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:57.680]   he talks about how most people have maybe two to four,
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.720]   or maybe six strong ties.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.080]   Those people who you actually are gonna call on your phone
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.200]   a couple times a week.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.080]   And Google has that information,
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.200]   especially if you're using an Android phone.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.440]   They know who you're emailing, who you're calling,
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.480]   who your strong ties are,
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.240]   who your weaker ties are, more temporary ties are.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.440]   So they can use that data to help you.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.800]   I mean, it talked about how people self-sensor,
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:19.880]   when they post to Facebook,
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.560]   'cause they don't wanna say thing,
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.400]   they don't wanna talk about what they--
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.600]   - Or they wish they had.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.760]   - Or they wish they had, right?
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.240]   But they're not gonna post a tweet about,
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.120]   or whatever about what a jerk their boss is,
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.720]   if they're aware that their boss is.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.000]   - Oh, my employees do.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:31.840]   But, right.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.080]   (laughing)
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:37.080]   - My employees, the only ones who actually have bosses
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.280]   who are on Buzz, Facebook, Twitter, Google,
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.880]   all of that stuff.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.960]   - I mean, I just hope that Google me
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.400]   doesn't make you work too hard.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.680]   And I mean, if you're using Gmail,
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.400]   and especially if you have an Android phone,
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.600]   Google knows a lot about who your strong ties are.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.400]   That's one of the things that just changed this weekend,
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.000]   Buzz, they're making recommendations now
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.080]   based on who you email and stuff, right?
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.520]   You get a recommendation, recommend to follow.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.360]   - Right.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.800]   - Which is nice to just auto-following you,
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.240]   which is what they did before with it.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.960]   - Yeah, it's a big improvement.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.440]   - We've decided you should follow this person.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.280]   Wait, what?
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.600]   - Oh!
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.680]   - They've had that in Google Talk for ages.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.120]   It will arbitrarily add people to email them now.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:13.960]   - I hate that.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:14.800]   - I hate that.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:15.720]   - Slightly irritating.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.720]   - Yeah.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.280]   - But the other thing that they've got,
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.640]   which is in Gmail somewhere and is a bit subtle,
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:24.720]   is the, have you seen the, did you forget Bob,
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.200]   or is that the right Bob?
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.840]   Plug-ins in, what'd you call it, in labs?
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:30.680]   - I think it's in labs, yeah.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.480]   - Oh yeah, in Gmail labs.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.680]   - So there's a group in Israel that don't forget Bob,
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.920]   it is, and what the other one is, got the wrong Bob.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.880]   What those do is they look at who you email together
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.520]   as groups, and they say, wait a minute,
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:48.920]   you've just emailed Leo and Jeff,
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:51.320]   and you left out Gina, do you want to add Gina in?
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.200]   Or you said, you just sent that to the wrong Jeff,
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.680]   you're sure, normally you include Jeff in that group,
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.360]   and you've just included this other Jeff,
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.320]   and you've got the right one.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.880]   So it's looking at the patterns you use
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.080]   and trying to construct groups for you.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.000]   So that's an interesting, again,
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.160]   it's traffic analysis, kind of thing in Google's,
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.800]   fairly good at, and the challenge with all these things
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.360]   is coming up with UX for people,
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.920]   so they actually understand what's being asked of them.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.640]   And that's the bit that's gonna take them a lot of time
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.280]   to work through on this, is to say,
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.200]   actually, I don't want you automatically adding people
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.400]   to that group, but if you help me construct a group
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.520]   from the set of people I email frequently,
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.560]   that will be useful.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.400]   - You know what this really is,
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:32.360]   is a great kind of a public works project
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.200]   for social scientists.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.080]   Suddenly, if you're a social scientist,
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:41.080]   or a UX expert, you suddenly are a hot commodity,
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.480]   because this isn't a computer science problem.
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.600]   The computer science is done.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.200]   This is a UI problem.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.160]   This is a how do we teach people how to use this problem?
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.000]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.280]   I see Jeff's hand up.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:58.320]   - I'm not trying to get my penalty box here.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.720]   When we met, Maro and Jake and I met with Maro Zuckerberg,
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.240]   he said something at the end that I love,
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.840]   which is that Facebook is a technology
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.280]   and a sociology company.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.520]   - That's interesting.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.360]   - And it's really good, right?
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.200]   - It's basically, it's not.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.040]   - It's basically, it's trying to find the ways
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.120]   that people are behaving and help them do
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.000]   what they want to do.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.480]   - Does Google, Kevin, we have the right guy here,
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.480]   'cause Kevin Marks was in charge of profiles for a while.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.600]   I know Rick Clow is now in charge of profiles,
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.440]   but you've been--
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.120]   - I saw Rick, by the way, at Google.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:25.960]   - Oh yeah?
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.480]   - And he does promise to come on the show
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.840]   when he has something.
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.880]   - And did he, did he give it like a timeframe,
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.440]   like September or anything?
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.720]   - Did they not give you a timeframe?
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.880]   - It'll be done when it's done.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:36.720]   It's like Michael Lynch.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:37.960]   - That's Google rules.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.400]   It's like when it's ready, we'll ship it.
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.240]   - Yeah.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.560]   - So--
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.400]   - Or the key to the buzz.
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.320]   - Yeah, this is fucked.
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:45.160]   - Right.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.360]   - There's a bunch of bits and pieces
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.800]   that are built up that you need to do this.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.920]   And the profile is part of it,
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.920]   the contact stuff is part of it, the groups is.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.720]   The other piece of this is coming up with standards
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.520]   so that we can move stuff between sides,
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.240]   which is part of the stuff I've been working on
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.640]   inside Google and outside as well.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.440]   We've got the portable contact stuff,
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.160]   but the activity streams for sending flows
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.520]   of events back and forth.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.720]   And if you look at the stuff they're building up in bars,
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.480]   they're very much building on that work
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:11.200]   and doing that now.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.120]   And I suspect they will continue along that line.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.640]   So, and there's open social as well.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.000]   Open social incorporates a bunch of that stuff
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.120]   and standardizes it.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.840]   And that's still going on, you know,
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.280]   not as loudly as we were talking about it two years ago,
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.560]   but that's because the loud bits done,
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:27.040]   it's now infrastructure, it's now running on lots of sites.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.440]   And a lot of this is making sure that we can do this in ways
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.960]   that you can move between places
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.000]   and it isn't one giant model that belongs to one company.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.840]   And my experience with Google has been that they've done
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.960]   this well in terms of working on the standard stuff,
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.920]   but they've been, they perhaps have been less good
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.800]   at integrating into product and getting the UX
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:46.680]   and the sociology right.
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:50.040]   That would be something that even they'd accept.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.400]   - Are they hiring social scientists?
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.080]   Are they working on that?
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:54.040]   - Oh, I don't know.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:55.560]   I know, I haven't spoken to them.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.920]   They had a definite deficit in that area.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.760]   You know, they had ureas, their extensible sociologists
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:03.120]   'cause they hired him and he was doing a lot of that stuff.
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:03.960]   - That's his thing, yeah.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.480]   - And I'm not sure they've really replaced him.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:08.080]   They did just buy all the guys from Slide.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:11.760]   So there's a lot of experience of practically doing that there
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.400]   and that makes, I suspect that will be a good fit.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.520]   'Cause if you look, there was this big sort of slide
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:19.520]   of social gaming buzz in the papers, but it isn't.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.040]   Slide has always been about social interaction
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.680]   about self-presentation and things like that.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.360]   If you look at their portfolio,
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:30.360]   it's mostly photo sharing, top friends, stuff like that
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:34.280]   that is about structuring your relationships
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:36.280]   and presenting stuff to different groups.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:40.120]   - Can you think of somebody who does this well right now, Kevin?
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:45.320]   - Does this, this is, this UI stuff,
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:48.200]   the ability to parse this and make sense of it.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.960]   You know, one of the reasons Twitter succeeded
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:52.280]   is 'cause there was so little to make sense of.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.000]   It was very straightforward.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.440]   One of the reasons Facebook, I think, has faced real challenges
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:59.680]   is, and it shows up in their settings for privacy,
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:03.400]   it's hideously complex and it really goes over people's heads.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.000]   Is there somebody who's figured out,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.560]   has a complex system that they figured
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.440]   an easy way to demonstrate it?
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.080]   - Not that I've, you know, no, I've seen it.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:11.520]   I think this is a hard problem.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:15.800]   I think the problem is, is there's this sort of tension
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.760]   with declaring this stuff and not declaring it?
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.400]   I think probably the one that I think has been
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.200]   reasonably good, has been flicker
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:26.160]   with their very, very simple friends check box,
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.160]   family check box.
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.720]   So default public, but you can pick
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.080]   what those two as the constraint
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.560]   and then they're, you know, they're not alternatives,
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.760]   they're additives, you can decide friends and family,
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.480]   or just friends, just family.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.480]   And that was a, you know, a fairly early design.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.320]   I think they've got reasonably good uptake of that.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.480]   I think most of their stuff is public,
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:46.840]   but they've got a good uptake of shared stuff like that as well.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:50.600]   But there, you know, I'm seeing startups
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.480]   and people working about that was, you know,
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.000]   Greg Noreen, who, he's done a,
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.800]   got a startup called Little Grahams,
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:01.280]   which is about helping you sort of share your,
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.920]   your baby's first moments and stuff like that.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.120]   And, you know, a big chunk of the stuff
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.880]   that he's talking about there is saying,
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.440]   you have a set of different groups of people
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.240]   that some of them are the grandparents
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:12.320]   and want to see every damn thing,
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.320]   and some of them are your friends,
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.120]   and you just want, they just want to see something
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:17.080]   every now and then, and you want to help people
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:18.760]   construct those subgroups easily
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.000]   and connect the stuff across systems.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.440]   So there's, there's a bunch of people
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.280]   looking at this stuff, but it is,
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.000]   it is difficult to get exactly right.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.320]   And the hard part is trying to do it all in one system.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.160]   If you actually look at behavior at the moment,
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.480]   we tend to use different sites
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.240]   for different aspects of ourselves.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.040]   And you don't, you know, this, that presentation
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.840]   that you showed talks about that explicitly.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.560]   It says we have these different subgroups.
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.920]   And the way you model that at the moment is we have
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.800]   a bunch of people on LinkedIn and a bunch of people
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.560]   on Twitter, and a bunch of people in email
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.080]   and a bunch of people somewhere else,
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:48.840]   and in some things sites somewhere
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.440]   that we use for the soccer club or whatever.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.560]   And they're all separate groups that we've built,
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.880]   and we sort of police them by having them
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.560]   in different spaces that we use for those different tasks.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:00.120]   And the challenge is combining those together
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:03.400]   in a useful way without accidentally making it
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.880]   too easy for people to bridge them
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:08.760]   so that they can suddenly reveal to the, reveal your
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:13.200]   suicide goes membership to your LinkedIn friends
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.040]   or whatever.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:16.320]   (laughing)
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.560]   - Don't look at me.
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:20.200]   So Google, maybe one of the ways you can decipher
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.440]   what Google's up to is through API changes
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:25.360]   and there were actually three new buzz API features
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.080]   as a garden hose, but I think there's two
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.800]   that I think are telling.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.440]   There's an API, this came out this week,
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.120]   to return the people associated
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.800]   with a particular activity query.
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:38.080]   The example they give is if you wanted to see people
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.560]   associated with Red Sox near Fenway Park,
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:43.720]   you could then aggregate buzzes,
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:47.240]   I presume it's buzzes or searches around that,
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:50.120]   which I think is very interesting.
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:53.800]   And then you can now discover and explore content
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.760]   related to a particular post.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:00.600]   So developers can access and deliver Google search results
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:03.160]   related to the topic of that post.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:05.680]   So you could be looking at a GINA blog post,
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:08.640]   smarter where you could have a button on it that said
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:10.400]   what related things at Google would generate
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.640]   the related things out of that.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:15.880]   And this is a buzz API, so I guess it's buzz results.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.800]   - Well, we visited with, and Williams this week too,
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.240]   and where they're kind of heading with Twitter
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:26.680]   is much the same thing as they get to locations.
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:29.200]   People follow and gather around locations,
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:33.840]   they follow and gather around times and topics
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.560]   as well as people.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:38.600]   - Yeah, and that's the kind of search you wanna do.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:43.080]   Unfortunately, this search URL is giving us the raw XML here,
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:47.160]   but I mean, really kind of cool.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:50.200]   And that makes all the data that they've got
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.760]   embedded in Twitter or buzz much more useful
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:55.280]   if you can search it with these proper parameters.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:59.080]   In some ways, API reflects this UI problem.
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:02.920]   It is a way of exposing something that people might want
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:06.560]   in a way that a developer can make real.
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:08.880]   - Right.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:14.520]   - I'm sure that Kevin would come up with some apt phrase,
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:19.520]   but the API is intention kind of written into code.
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:22.080]   - There's definitely intention in API.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.680]   There are definitely times when you wanna do something
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:26.280]   and the API just doesn't support it.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:28.360]   But absolutely.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.640]   - So that's very much it.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:31.280]   It's a world view of,
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.200]   you're encoding a world view whenever you're building an API.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.800]   You're saying, this is the way the world works.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:38.480]   Call it, call it my way and it will work this way.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:41.560]   And that, the challenge of the standardization part of that
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.320]   is getting those different world views to care here
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.800]   and to say, well, yeah, you have this model
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.320]   of people behaving this way
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.880]   and you have this model of people behaving this way.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.760]   Can we actually combine them?
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.520]   Well, we'll add an optional location field
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.560]   so that the places that have it can put it in,
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:59.200]   the ones that don't, you can look at stuff like that.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.880]   If you look at the activity stream stuff,
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.920]   in most of the, the mailing list is people argue about,
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.520]   should this be called this or this?
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:06.800]   And is this thing like that?
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:11.200]   And is a location of point or an address
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.240]   or a sort of general geographic name
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:15.560]   and how do you say which it is?
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:17.520]   Sort of slightly fuzzy stuff like that,
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.840]   but that's how you actually get these things
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:20.920]   to move between sites.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:23.520]   Are we past baby steps on this?
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:27.600]   Yeah, no, we're starting to see actual activity on this,
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:28.720]   apart from the fun.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.240]   Yeah, we're starting to, you know,
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.960]   the interesting stuff about bars
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.840]   is that they are trying really hard to build this stuff
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.840]   on the, on the, on the OpenStannons
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.320]   and the OpenStannons guys are sort of keeping them to that
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:40.640]   and saying actually you've hard coded something
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.600]   that's Twitter specific here or whatever.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:45.200]   But they, but that's the, you know,
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.560]   definitely the vibe I get from that team
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.840]   is that they care about doing it that way
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:50.680]   and doing it well.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:52.200]   And they're more focused on that side of it
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:56.320]   than on, you know, hitting, hitting shipping deadlines
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:57.440]   for a particular things,
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.240]   which I think is encouraging.
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:03.520]   - We're gonna wrap it up.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.960]   I'm with this, gosh, there's so many things to talk about
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:07.520]   and I'm looking at our rundown.
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.240]   We have hundreds of items still in there.
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:11.040]   Is there anything, I'll give you all a chance.
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.480]   Is there anything that you think we've missed
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:15.720]   or something that you would like to bring up, Gina,
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:19.240]   that is going on right now that we should,
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.600]   we should talk about Google TV.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.760]   We really didn't talk about Wall Street Journal says
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.400]   it's gonna be a tough sell to partners.
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:28.760]   - There's a particular Android app that launched
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.640]   that may be your tool, so I don't wanna say it.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.120]   - Okay.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.680]   Go ahead, 'cause I don't have a tool.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.000]   - Is your tool an Android app?
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.080]   This is this one. - No, go ahead.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.440]   I don't actually have a tool yet.
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.720]   I have to think of it while you're doing your tip.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:41.000]   - Oh, okay.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.600]   What is the app you wanna talk about?
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.040]   - Voice actions.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.080]   - Oh, isn't that, did we not talk about that?
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.160]   - We didn't, so last week it was the day before
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:50.160]   the mobile announcement, right?
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.080]   - That's right, we speculated on it.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:54.240]   - Yeah, we speculated that it would be music,
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.720]   but we were completely off.
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.800]   - I love these mobile actions.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.520]   Unfortunately, my Droid X is 2.1,
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:03.680]   so I had to go to the Nexus 1, but it works very nicely.
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.640]   - It works really well, like surprisingly well, right?
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.640]   I mean, given, you know, Google Voice.
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:11.840]   - I got my doubts, but it's done really well.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:13.920]   - Maybe it's my voice, or maybe I know how to do it,
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:18.200]   but I get really 90% or more accuracy when I dictate to it.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.680]   I'm very careful, you know, I enunciate and so forth.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:24.480]   But I sent text messages, I almost said text messages.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:28.080]   Test text messages, I sent emails.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.560]   You can say, you could say note to self,
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.200]   and it'll send you an email with a note.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.320]   I just think this is really slick.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:37.680]   - Yeah, it's a great app, and it's in the market,
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:39.400]   Google Voice actions, it's really cool.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.920]   And I like how you dictate what you want,
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:42.240]   and then it gives you the prompt and says,
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.240]   "Hey, is this what you want?"
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:44.320]   And he says, "Yes, you know,
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:45.840]   depending on whatever the action is."
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:47.480]   - That's a good way to handle it, yeah.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:50.600]   - Yeah, it is really taking advantage of Android's voice control,
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.120]   which is something that, you know,
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.640]   the iPhone doesn't have.
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:56.160]   So, I mean, the last big mobile event was navigation,
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.560]   which is also something the iPhone doesn't have.
[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:59.600]   So I feel like, you know, they're obviously really trying
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:03.560]   to make a point of the things like voice actions
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.960]   that to differentiate themselves from other platforms.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.200]   - It was kind of a logical move,
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.960]   because that was already an advantage that Android had,
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.200]   which is you could dictate a lot of things.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.640]   And now it's just dictation everywhere.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:18.000]   There is this application on the iPhone that Apple owns
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.120]   called Siri that does this and more.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:25.240]   I mean, you could say, "Book me a table at Post Trio."
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.080]   - That's right, that's right.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:26.920]   - And it will do it.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.840]   So Apple has a technology in an app.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:33.160]   I would love to see them incorporated into the OS.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.000]   I think this may be--
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.080]   - Do you know what's an under in the marketplace?
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:37.920]   - I'm sorry?
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.880]   - What's it under in the marketplace?
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.560]   - Google voice actions.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.480]   - And they also went public with Chrome to phone,
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.760]   which anybody who listens to this show knows all about already,
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.800]   'cause it was your pick many, many, many weeks ago,
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.320]   and I've been using it for a while.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:54.200]   And that requires also 2.2.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.600]   So it's interesting, that's another thing I found interesting
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.720]   as long as we're reading tea leaves,
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.600]   that Google's starting to push technologies
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.440]   that require Froyo,
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.800]   even though most handsets still are not Froyo.
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.680]   - But we're getting there, right?
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.480]   - I mean, so the old droid has Froyo,
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.560]   that's been going out of the app.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.040]   - I upgraded my droid to 2.2.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.200]   - Yeah, my mind came up,
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.480]   they got two out of three hits.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.240]   - Yeah, the droid X doesn't, I really wanted to.
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.600]   Actually, that was another thing
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.840]   that was a little conversation about,
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.320]   I think Google and others were saying,
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.560]   let's just stop doing these manufacturer corruptions
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:30.000]   of Android and just put it out straight, please.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.080]   - Yeah, I have to apologize,
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.520]   my tip last week about hanging up a call using the power button.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.320]   I got a couple of upset email from folks who,
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.680]   you know, have a build of Android
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:43.080]   where that setting is not available
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.080]   and the accessibility setting.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.040]   So my apologies, I'm working with the pure clean pristine
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.080]   Nexus One where all the options are available.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.680]   - I'm very tempted to go back to the Nexus One,
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.320]   I love the big screen on the droid X,
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.560]   but I just, at the plain Google experience
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.160]   is still far superior, you know,
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.120]   to everything else out there.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:00.960]   - Well, you know, it depends,
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.440]   it depends what they do with it.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.160]   The sprint one is really annoying,
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.400]   because they've got a bunch of apps based
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:08.000]   in here that you can't delete that I don't want.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.320]   That's just nasty.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.080]   - You mean you're not a NASCAR fan, Kevin?
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.240]   - I was gonna say NASCAR,
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.920]   but I mean, I don't feel all of that.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.040]   - Also, you know, I haven't got a sprint sim in this,
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.720]   this is just a gadget for me,
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.400]   so it just sits there and salts at me
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.240]   because it's trying to contact
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.200]   sprint specific things that aren't there.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.600]   This was the Galaxy S,
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.920]   I mostly like what they did to it here,
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.400]   except for they changed the checkboxes
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.960]   to their own look of checkboxes
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.440]   that are gray with the big check mark in them,
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.960]   and then you get a green check mark of their check,
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.280]   and it throws me every time.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.520]   I think that's a check somewhere, it happened.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.080]   But the thing they let you do on here,
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.080]   which I hadn't seen on any others,
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.280]   they let you change the system typeface,
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.440]   which is kind of nice.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.400]   So you can switch it over to something else.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:56.280]   So that's, you know, I don't mind there being some,
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.700]   some variation on what they can do.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:03.040]   I wish they'd standardize where they put the power socket,
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.280]   'cause I've been carrying three of these around,
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.920]   I don't know where to switch them off and talk them in,
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.280]   but I also wish they'd standardize the bottom buttons,
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.440]   'cause I keep hitting on the wrong button on the Nexus One
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.120]   and the Dried, they've flipped the menu in the back button.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.480]   By the way, by the way, any--
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:19.080]   - Have read an edge case here.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.640]   - What's an edge case, and what it's--
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.280]   - It's time for a phone off.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.360]   - A phone off.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.200]   - You two, and how many phones you have?
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.200]   - Okay, it's a phone off.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.560]   - That's true, we haven't seen any.
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:28.920]   - You used in the last month, the L.A.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.920]   - Kevin's got me beat.
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.920]   - You used in the last month, Kevin's got me beat it.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.160]   - He's got every phone I would wager.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.480]   If he's got a dog in tablet in the office,
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.640]   he's got everything.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.280]   (laughing)
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.280]   - I've got three or four that were actually phone phones,
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.840]   but you have a-- - Do you have the street yet?
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.680]   - Do you have the Dell Street yet?
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.200]   - My colleague had one of those in the UK, yeah,
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.480]   so I tried to try that out briefly.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.040]   - What'd you think?
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.960]   - It's interesting, again, it's not,
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.720]   none of them seem to, none of the bigger ones, yeah,
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.840]   I've seen have as good touch control as the iPad
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.720]   or all these, this generation of phones.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.560]   I mean, a little disappointed with that,
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.160]   but it seemed an interesting device.
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.200]   I didn't have a chance to play with it
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.800]   for long enough to rave about it.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:11.520]   The Kmart ones does feel fairly nasty
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.960]   and does some slightly odd things.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.880]   - Yeah, I think Android does,
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.720]   and this is one, so when Apple advocates
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.920]   are comparing the iPhone to the Android phones,
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.240]   that's one thing they'll always say is,
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.960]   see, it's just slightly sluggish
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.840]   when you try to slide the screen,
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.200]   and that may be an Android thing, I don't know.
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.840]   But I always say, but where's your back button?
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.240]   That always gets them.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.240]   Where's your back button?
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.120]   What do you do when you wanna back out of something?
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:38.040]   - Well, I show people swipe and they go, oh, huh?
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.120]   (laughing)
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.640]   - Swipe is awesome!
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:41.720]   Swipe rocks!
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.280]   - I can't download it, you can't buy it.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.120]   Why can't I buy a swipe for the phones that haven't got it yet?
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.400]   - Swipe comes on the Droid X.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.600]   I know we had this whole argument.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.600]   In fact, Gina told everybody to get swiped
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.720]   and swipe got mad, then they came back to,
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.800]   okay, you win, and there's a beta, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.120]   - You just put it in this store for five bucks,
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:58.960]   they make money.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:02.520]   - They make tons of money because it is really a huge--
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.680]   - Wait, once you, no, because I got switched over
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:06.920]   to one of these, I switched over to one of these
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.120]   and it didn't have it, and it was like,
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.360]   I can't talk about this anymore.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.280]   How is this one?
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.600]   - What is this pecking?
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.720]   What is this tapping every character?
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.560]   I can't--
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.640]   - The HTC has its own damn keyboard,
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.000]   which is worse than either the standard Android or swipe.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.440]   So you sit there poking at it
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.280]   and it's making stuff up for you.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.000]   - By the way, if you do wanna get an Android phone
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.520]   and you've been eyeing the Samsung Galaxy S,
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:30.160]   today only, as we record this August 18th,
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.240]   T-Mobile is offering the Vibrant,
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:35.640]   which is their version of the Galaxy S for 99 bucks.
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.960]   So that's a pretty good deal.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.240]   And so you like that phone,
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.440]   I think it's got the AMOLED screen, which is gorgeous.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.640]   It's a smaller screen. - I do like it, it's nice.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.360]   - Yeah, some people complain about what Samsung
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:48.480]   has done with Android, but if it's only checkboxes,
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:49.520]   I can live with that.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.960]   - So any of the checkboxes, really,
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.800]   I think nothing else is really bugging.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.680]   It doesn't have a search button, which is slightly weird.
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:55.520]   - What?
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.080]   - It hasn't got a still screen search button.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.360]   You have to use the menu to find it.
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.320]   - Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.000]   That's it, right out.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.760]   'Cause the voice actions, you press and hold the search button.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.960]   - Search button, right.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.000]   - And the voice actions work.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.760]   You got it, huh?
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:10.600]   Huh?
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.880]   (laughing)
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.200]   All right, Jeff, you have any stories
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.240]   that we've missed that you want to cover?
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.960]   - Stories, no, I don't think so.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.360]   - Anything else you would like to say
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.920]   before we go to our tip tool and number?
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.000]   (humming)
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.040]   - Nope, nope, nope, nope.
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.280]   I think I've said my piece,
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.840]   talked about everything I want to talk about.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.680]   Let's get Gina Trapani's tip of the week.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.680]   - Picasa, which never gets as much credit
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.720]   for being a Google product as it should.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.000]   Fantastic photo manager.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.120]   There's a new version out, 3.8.
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.800]   You won't get the update automatically
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:50.640]   if you're running Picasa.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.280]   You have to go read, download it.
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.760]   But one of Picasa's coolest features,
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.000]   which is had for a while, is face recognition, right?
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.360]   So it'll scan, throw all your photos
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.560]   and it'll group all the pictures that I have of Leo.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.120]   It'll group together in a Leo pile.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.920]   And that's awesome. - She'll just throw them right out.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:07.920]   - 3.8 has this new awkwardly named face movie feature.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:12.600]   So I can click on the stack of photos of my sister
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.560]   and I can choose Create Face Movie.
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:18.200]   And it makes this really nice slideshow
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.160]   of just the face kind of centered
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.000]   and the pictures show up around it.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.040]   And it's really neat.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.560]   You can watch kids grow up
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.200]   and you can see kind of hairstyles throughout the ages.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.760]   - Oh, nice. - But it kinda in centers
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.280]   the face right in a fixed position.
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.040]   So it's a really neat visual effect.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:33.880]   I love it.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:34.720]   It's super cool.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:37.200]   I'm gonna make a bunch of these for my mom of mine FUs.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.360]   I think she's gonna love it.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.840]   It's just a tiny little thing,
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.440]   but the facial recognition plus this new face movie
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.760]   in 3.8. - Oh, that's nice.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:44.600]   'Cause I wanted that.
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.600]   'Cause when you do the facial recognition,
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.720]   it shows you all those little faces
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:48.560]   and you can slide through it.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.440]   And it was like, oh, there's almost something there.
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.320]   And they had that merged them together into one thing
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.480]   before they never quite worked,
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.520]   but that's nice.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.480]   I have to play with that.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.640]   - Yeah, face movies really neat.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:57.960]   Definitely check it out and play with it.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.440]   There's a video, there's a YouTube video
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.640]   on the link on the front feed
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.480]   that I'll give you with a little demo.
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:06.840]   - And Jeff's number of the week.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:10.000]   - I'll do two sets.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.600]   The first is tomorrow is the sixth anniversary
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.240]   of the Google IPO. - Wow.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.080]   - And even though Google stock is down 20% this year,
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:20.400]   it's up 39% in the six years.
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.640]   - That's the first since the IPO.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:27.040]   - The other number I'll give you is 45 or 43.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.760]   When Jake and I were at Facebook
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:31.680]   outside of the conference room where we met with Zuckerberg,
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.240]   there was a very big screen,
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.600]   with a very big countdown on it.
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.320]   Counting down from 45 days.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:41.880]   And so we asked Mark, well, what's happened in 45 days?
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.200]   And he's what?
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.400]   No, the number of Jake says,
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:46.240]   the other thing I can say that,
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.880]   it was visible to any visitor who was there.
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.200]   We didn't learn anything about it.
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.000]   They're counting down to something happening soon.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.480]   So that's what the keys are.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.840]   - That's a good number, 45.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.000]   We don't know what it means.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.160]   (laughs)
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.520]   - Secret number, the mystery.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.480]   - No one knew what it meant whatsoever.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.440]   It could be a new lunch in the lunch room.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:03.240]   It could be anything.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.840]   You know what, when we talked with Ev and company
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:10.400]   at Twitter and they've have every employee tweeting there,
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.120]   the interesting was that they said that,
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:12.960]   you know, what are their rules?
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.440]   Their rules are don't be stupid.
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.080]   Obviously don't talk about any secrets.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.320]   But the one I loved was this.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.640]   If you talk about something you're doing in your work,
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.840]   people will read into it.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:22.840]   Like, we're so excited.
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:23.680]   We've been up all night.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:25.000]   We've been working on this new thing.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.040]   Then the whole world thinks, aha,
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:30.280]   here is true's world acquisition strategy.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:32.640]   And it may just be some little upgrade
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.880]   and something you never ever see.
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.600]   So you never know what happens when it's not a company.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.560]   But the funny thing is,
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.600]   I felt as if Jake were going around,
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.520]   it was the new Hollywood Stars Homes tour.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.360]   (laughs)
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.240]   'Cause you go to these places
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:47.200]   and we watch them as if they're stars.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.040]   And they are.
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:52.880]   - So 45, I think, you know, tonight's the night,
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:56.080]   supposedly Facebook releases its location stuff.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.080]   And-- - That's right.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.960]   - When I think I can say this now,
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.200]   when I was at Food Camp,
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.840]   there were some Facebook people there with RFID tags
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.280]   that you would wear a little pin
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.720]   and you would check in with your little pin.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.080]   So I don't know if Facebook's gonna have a hardware check
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:09.960]   in feature.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.960]   I think everybody's doing geographic.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:14.040]   - Oh, they have that F8, I think.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.040]   - Yeah.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.040]   - So it's not secret.
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.360]   Maybe it's a demo of something, yeah.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:19.280]   But we expect that tonight.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.800]   Also in the calendar, the incredible,
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.720]   according to, I think Mashable,
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.520]   the incredible is supposed to get 2.2 today.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.560]   So if you're using a Droid Incredible,
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.680]   that would be a nice phone to upgrade to Froyo, I think.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.520]   My pick of the week is Zagat.
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:34.920]   The Zagat guides are just great.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.920]   I think they're a little expensive.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.960]   They do have them on iPhone as well as Android.
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.120]   It is $10, but I use it all the time
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.600]   because you could just say,
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:46.880]   if you're in a Zagat area or Zagat, whatever they call it,
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:49.400]   I think it's Zagat, you can find restaurants,
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.400]   you can find shopping and hotels.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.080]   And they are now, it's interesting.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:57.200]   They are now adding four square integration.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.800]   Everybody's got check in.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.480]   Everybody, Yelp now has check in.
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.960]   I am the Duke of many locations that I was the mayor of
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.160]   just a few days ago.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.080]   I'm both mayor and Duke of some places.
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.160]   So Zagat is now--
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.000]   - King, no.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   King, no.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.920]   - King, maybe they'll do that.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.840]   - So the king of the cottage.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.480]   - They also have something called food spotting,
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:20.400]   which is a social platform and mobile app
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.840]   that allows you to share pictures of the foods
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.040]   in your neighborhood.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:30.040]   So you might wanna check out Zagat, $10, a little pricey,
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.960]   but that covers a year's worth of reviews
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.400]   they call it Zagat to go.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.800]   And now with four square and food spotting.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.720]   - And it is a great tool to have.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:41.560]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:42.560]   - This is from Android Central.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.720]   The Froyo update is not gonna come out today
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:45.560]   on Incredible.
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.360]   That was just a bad rumor.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.320]   So there's the details.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.600]   I'm still waiting for that Droid X.
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:52.720]   I was told by the rising folks when I bought the Droid X
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.800]   that it would come out in August.
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:56.640]   So I'm hoping.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.880]   - Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.360]   Kevin Marks is at ribbit.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:00.720]   - Ribbit.com.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:04.160]   - I guess a division of British Telecom.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:05.000]   - Yes.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.840]   - And a great guy to have on any time we talk about,
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:10.400]   well, pretty much anything, an expert in so much.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.960]   Ribbit.com, his blog is a PAS.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.320]   - Just search for Kevin Marks.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.960]   - Yeah, it's a lot easier.
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.640]   - It's the easiest problem I'd love to make.
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.080]   - Although, it seemed like a good idea in 2001.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.240]   - It was such a good idea.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.920]   Now no one knows what the hell it means.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.960]   E-P-E-U-S.blogspot.com.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.720]   But it really is actually a great,
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.320]   well, wait a minute, you haven't posted it a couple of months.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.160]   What are you up to?
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.240]   - I'm not gonna hold it.
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.080]   I should write something.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:34.920]   - Get to work.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:35.760]   - Get to work.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.080]   - I should write something about the web not being dead.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:38.920]   (laughing)
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:39.760]   - I'm not dead yet.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.120]   - Good.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.080]   - Gina Trapani, is it smarterware.org,
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.680]   a great site for anybody who's interested in,
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:47.560]   well, everything.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:51.600]   I mean, she's great on productivity, education,
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:55.400]   government, great site.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.880]   Love it, smarterware.org.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:59.680]   And of course, as a developer, a great resource on this week
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.640]   in Google, thank you for being here.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:02.840]   - Thanks, great job today.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.520]   - Jeff Jarvis, the man about town.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.600]   He's interviewing everybody for his next book,
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.800]   Public Parts, but his current book is.
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.000]   I have it right here.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.160]   - What would Google do?
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:25.340]   - Bless you,
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:36.360]   (upbeat music)
