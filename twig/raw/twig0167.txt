[00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.400]   Hello.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.700]   In the reverse order, I buried the lead.
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.500]   New mommy, Gina Trapani.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.700]   So, so latest baby news.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.200]   She's great.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.100]   My mom is cuddling her right now.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.100]   She's awesome.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.300]   She's finding her voice.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.900]   She lets us know when she's hungry.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.600]   She was what?
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.500]   Five weeks premature, but five weeks early and she's three weeks old now.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.200]   Okay.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.800]   She's just under six pounds.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.600]   She's gaining weight.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.900]   She's eating like a champ, which is awesome.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.400]   Oh, that's good.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   Yes, she's really tiny and really fun.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.500]   Excellent.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.400]   Dr. Mom says the best bibs are made of washcloths with neck holes.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.600]   Oh, that's straight out of the shtettle.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.700]   You think cloth diapers as burp pads, but I know that's something all of our listeners wanted to know.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.300]   We got tired of cloth diapers really quickly because they don't really the kind of leak.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.600]   But, you know, I was trying to be ecological and then consumer reports said,
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.800]   well, it's kind of moot because you got a truck driving around blah, blah, blah.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:03.100]   So we used them for a month and kept them for burp rags and then went to paper.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.100]   Just a thought this weekend poop.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.900]   That's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.600]   He is also a proud papa like me and the city university of New York.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.000]   Perfect.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.900]   Do you have a chair?
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.800]   Can I say the Augusta professor of journalism?
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.100]   Oh, I got to get started.
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.400]   You have to you have to you have to endow the Leo Laport chair and journalists.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.800]   Oh, how much would that be?
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.100]   How many hundreds of dollars?
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.700]   Oh, it's a million and a half.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.700]   You know what, Jeff?
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.300]   If I ever have a spare million and a half, I'm going to endow that then I could say and with us now,
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.300]   the Leo Laport professor of journalism.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.500]   That would be funny.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.800]   I'd like that.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.000]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.600]   Good to have you.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   His book, Public Parts is out now and he's also the author of what would Google do and blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.300]   So Gina and Jeff conspired during the week.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.800]   Gina had a very good idea.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   She said, you know, of course we cover more than Google here, but we really probably Google is announcing new products every single week in great numbers.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.700]   And we aren't able really to cover in depth every single one of them.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:20.700]   So wouldn't it be a good idea to launch into the show each week with just kind of a rundown of new features that Google's offering?
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.100]   Yeah, I mean, actually, this is Leon, one of our listeners, Leon, his idea.
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.900]   He wrote in and said, hey, there are changes to Google Apps all the time.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.500]   You guys don't always get to them.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.500]   You know, what's up with that?
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.100]   Well, it's like, oh, that's a good question.
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.700]   We can't because there's literally half a dozen every week and most of them aren't that big a deal, but it's probably worth mentioning.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.900]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.700]   So we thought we put together a little segment where you run down what the new stuff is out there.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.100]   Now we need ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.800]   We need to crowdsource a bumper.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.500]   C T and T does this NSFW does many of our other shows.
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.700]   The non many of them, most of them non-linear shows get bumpers.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:02.700]   People don't give me so if anybody wants to give us, you know, like a great this week in Google stuff.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.100]   We could do that with timponies, please.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.700]   But it'd be nice to send them along.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.900]   Send them to Chad at twit.tv.
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.100]   So Twill has bumpers to.
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.600]   Huh?
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:25.500]   It has to have recorded music and timponies and timponies boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.900]   M M X X and our chair and says, what I'm confused.
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.600]   I don't I am to bumpers, lacking, lacking a.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.300]   And now new to Google it was what we call this.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.000]   Yeah, what should we call it?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.200]   What's new change log release notes change?
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.000]   Oh, I like that.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.300]   That's a programmer's point of what do you call a lightning round?
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.100]   Lightning round.
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.600]   We'll say the lightning round because I use that sometimes when we have so much news that we have to quickly go through stories.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.400]   So I like change log change log.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.900]   Yeah.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.700]   I like that.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.300]   That's a winner.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.200]   And now the Google change log featuring Gina trip and just just go ahead and list them and we'll we'll interject if we feel
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.700]   the need.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.300]   Yeah, interrupt me if you want quick got questions.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.500]   Couple of changes to Gmail in the past couple of weeks.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.400]   First one is you Gmail now indexes attachments.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.300]   So you can search inside attachments if you've got messages with a PDF PowerPoint file word document other kind of common file formats.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.600]   When you search for a keyword, it'll turn out messages with attachments that have those words.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.400]   And if you're not using this already, is my favorite Gmail shortcuts has colon attachment will narrow your search to messages.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.200]   Only messages that has have attachments.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:44.000]   So if you do has a colon attachment and then you say, you know, Leo, it'll show you all the messages with Leo and the word and all the messages that have Leo inside the attachment.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.800]   Attached the message.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.700]   Very cool.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.000]   Another Gmail.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   By the way, just I will interject.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.500]   I thought when I saw this, there'd be a human cry about privacy.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.000]   Like Google searching our attachments, not a word.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.200]   No, I think we're all used to it.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.800]   We're just it's like, okay.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.000]   So what else is new?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.900]   Well, you do it.
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.700]   Google's been looking at our email for years and targeting advertising.
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.400]   Yeah, but the text now they're looking into PDFs, doc files, PowerPoint presentations.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.300]   That's kind of like and what do we say?
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.200]   Thank you, Google.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.500]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.400]   And Gmail's a postcard.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.400]   You got to just consider that everyone can see see into it on its way, you know.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.000]   So there it's it's not like on demand.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.900]   They're actually indexing it all of it as it comes in.
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.500]   Yeah.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.000]   Yep.
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.800]   And this just rolled out, I think a week and a half ago, so it might need some time to catch up, but.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.000]   I told her first.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.400]   All right.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.300]   Gmail also added a hundred virtual keyboards to its input tool.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.900]   So if you if you write emails in lots of different languages, you go into settings, language, you can click on.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:52.700]   I think it's enable input tools and you'll get a button that lets you switch between different keyboards for different languages.
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.300]   Virtual keyboards, transliteration and IMEs.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.400]   Be careful.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.900]   Good multi-lingual.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.100]   If you change everything to Russian, you may regret it.
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:02.700]   Right.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.300]   Exactly.
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.000]   But once that's enabled, it's a one tick one click toggle.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.200]   If you if you toggle between different languages, it required different keyboards.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.900]   Google contacts got a cool new feature.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.600]   It now seems to be a card dev.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.900]   Card dev was new to me, but card dev is similar to Cal.
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.200]   That's an open it's an open source.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.000]   It's an open protocol for for sinking contacts.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.400]   And this is pretty cool because iOS sinks contacts through card dev.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:32.300]   So the way that you that the iOS sinks to iCloud and to Yahoo contacts, interestingly, Google now supports that.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.500]   So you can sync your Google contacts inside your iOS device easily.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:45.700]   YouTube just got added to Google takeout Google takeout from our friend Brian Fitzpatrick and the data liberation front.
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.200]   You go into Google takeout.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.800]   You can now download all YouTube videos you've ever posted to YouTube as it's just a giant zip file.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.000]   They're their MP4 files uncompressed.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.900]   So if you want to download your archive of YouTube files, if you had a hard drive crash or you just want to make sure you have backup of your data, you can do that now and Google takeout.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:10.100]   Google TV getting an update in the coming weeks Google play movies TV shows and music coming to Google TV.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:16.900]   So so TV shows movies music that you rent or purchase on any device you can now play on Google TV.
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:23.100]   And it's all it'll also be hooks into their movie and TV's app movie movies and TV app where they make recommendations.
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.300]   If you're watching something you can purchase it on Google Play.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:38.800]   I've been playing with Google Play a lot because I'm trying to make the entire switch over to my my Android devices, my tablet and I got to say the movies are just, you know, 15% tackier in Google Play.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.300]   Doesn't have a great selection.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.200]   They got to work on this.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.100]   Oh, it doesn't.
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.200]   You're trying to get it, you know, to as many devices as possible.
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.400]   And the other Google Play news is that Google Play will let you sample in app purchases before you buy.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.900]   So if you're a developer and you make an app that has in app purchases, you can set a free trial.
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.400]   You can say let users sample this for seven days.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.200]   I believe it's up to seven days in order to let your users try stuff out.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.400]   So a developer has to set that and that's new now.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.800]   So we probably won't see it rolled out to roll out to apps maybe in the next few weeks.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.400]   That's all I got.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.000]   Cool.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.400]   That was great, Gina.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   That's a lot.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.200]   Like real value, real information, real news.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:25.000]   So you'd use card dev on iOS instead of using exchange, but it only does contacts.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.100]   Right.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.300]   So you still need to use exchange for mail and calendar.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.400]   Right.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:30.800]   Okay.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.000]   Right.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.500]   And I'm not sure if there's advantages to using a cal dev.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.000]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.200]   You can use card dev.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.400]   There's a cal dev too.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.900]   Does it have a cal dev server?
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.700]   I think that's separate.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.500]   So I think you would set it up separately.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:49.700]   Me.
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.600]   What's actually Google Calendar does have cal dev.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.900]   Yeah, Google calendar does have that right.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:02.500]   So you that way right now in iOS, when you set up a card dev contact sync, they list iCloud and Yahoo has options.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.500]   So right now you have to tap on other to set up your Google account.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.100]   But I'm sure you have to dig through it.
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:14.000]   That Apple will say, you know, Google wonder if there's an advantage to using that set of exchange because right now you can
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.500]   use exchange and do all three with one account entry.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.600]   Right.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.000]   That's good.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.800]   That's a good question.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   Because right.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.000]   I have that I have that set up right now.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.400]   That's how we're doing it now.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.100]   You just use m.google.com as exchange server.
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:26.800]   Right.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:35.700]   I mean, that's one disadvantage of application specific passwords that have to generate to an application specific passwords.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.600]   Exchange and then car dev.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.100]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:38.100]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.100]   Good.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.500]   You know what?
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:47.000]   It just occurs to me as Jean does that that that it goes to Google's strength of services.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.500]   You know, I can't imagine us having a similar rundown of what's new at Twitter or Facebook.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.800]   You know, we'll just complain about those things.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.300]   These are, you know, little gifts from the Google.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.400]   I mean, every week when I pick up my tip, I always go through these little product updates and I kind of just kind of, you know, pick out the most
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.000]   push them aside.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.300]   Yeah.
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.000]   Or the other one, so I'm glad we'll have a chance to go through them.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.400]   So I don't know.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:15.000]   Maybe maybe we won't have as many every week, but this week was there was a lot, a lot of little feature updates.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.200]   So we'll get to the Google news and we have also picks and tips and Jeff has a number of the week.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.000]   That's all coming up on this week in Google.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.500]   Jeff and Gina and me, but first a word from Ting.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.400]   The folks at two cows have an interesting philosophy.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:35.200]   They they are looking at industries that don't work and they want to reinvent them and make them work.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.100]   Now they they already did that with domain name registration.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.200]   That's hover.com.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.300]   We talked about that before.
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:49.600]   Now they're doing it to the cell phone companies boy, if ever there were a business that could be reinvented and fixed, it's the cell phone.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.700]   I want you to visit twig.ting.com.
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.900]   I love this.
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.300]   You love your netcast.
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.900]   How about your phone company?
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.700]   Nobody loves their phone company.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.500]   Well, with Ting, it's a no BS mobile service.
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.600]   That's my my phrase not there is there an MVNO for sprint.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:13.600]   That means if sprint is a good provider in your area, you get good signal, then you should absolutely look at Ting for one thing.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.200]   There's no contract.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.300]   It's month to month.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.600]   There's no early termination fee.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.100]   So none of that extra, you know, upsell stuff.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.100]   They don't bundle or ride along.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.600]   You just basically if you go to Ting, look at the plans.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.800]   These are like serving suggestions.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   Pick the plans you want just to get an idea of what it might cost you.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.600]   So you pay for $6 per device per month.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.500]   So you can have 10 phones, five phones, one phone, six bucks per.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:46.000]   So let's say I've got a family of four four phones together.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:57.300]   The four of us will use a thousand minutes, thousand text messages and let's say two gigabytes total of that would be $89 for all four of us a month, $89.
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:02.300]   That's already, you know, a third of what I'm paying Verizon or or a or a sprint or AT&T.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.800]   But now here's the beauty part.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   You don't use all of that.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.900]   They rebated to you.
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.000]   You use more.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.800]   They charge you at the same scale.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.300]   There's no penalty.
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.200]   There's no overcharge penalty.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.300]   You get credits on service.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.100]   You don't use.
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:28.700]   You never pay more than you need for more than you use and they throw in voicemail, picture and video messaging, three way caller calling caller ID, tethering and hotspot free.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.100]   So there's no, you know, additional charge for hotspotting, no additional charge for tethering.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.700]   You're using the data plan that you choose.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:42.100]   And again, if you use more, they'll charge you more, but at the same rate.
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.900]   So there's no mysterious line items on your bill.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.900]   There are no hidden charges, recovery fees, no BS.
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:54.900]   That's what they say unlimited devices on one plan to in each device cost a flat six bucks.
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.500]   You share pooled minutes, messages and gigabytes.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.800]   You've got a great online control panel.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.400]   So you can see exactly what you're using.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.400]   No hold customer support eight AM to eight PM Eastern.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:10.400]   You a real person will pick up the phone and will work through your problem at eight five five.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.600]   Ting F T W.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.300]   Ting for the win.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:19.400]   They also have a lot of great support at help.ting.com, including very active customer forms.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:25.400]   In fact, all you have to do is search Twitter for the hashtag Ting and you'll see a bunch of very happy Ting customers.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.200]   So you do this all online, you'll purchase your device from Ting.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.600]   You'll get it in two to five business days.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.800]   You'll activate the device.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.700]   You have the option and by the way, they have a great selection of Android phones.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.300]   Let's go look at the device section.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.600]   You select the plan you want Ting will bill you at the beginning of your payment period,
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.400]   but you'll be charged or credited in the following pay period based on what actually happened.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.600]   They've got the galaxy S three.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.000]   That's my phone of choice soon getting newer phones.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.500]   They do have simple feature phones too.
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:16:01.800]   This is actually a good idea for somebody like a kid or a grandparent who just needs a simple phone for emergency purposes.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.400]   I'm going to show you I could say $50 on that device.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.600]   You also have data devices, which is nice and even femto cells.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:16.200]   So go to twig.ting.com right now and you're going to say $50 on your first device.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.800]   When you sign up, check out the savings calculator.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:26.400]   If you just want to see how much you will save with Ting twig.ting.com.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.800]   Let's let's reinvent.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.000]   Let's reinvent the mobile phone.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.900]   But boy, if there were ever business, it could be improved.
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.200]   Next Leo can fly Ting error, please.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:36.900]   Yes.
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.000]   To cows air.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.200]   Let's talk to Elliot.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:39.800]   Noss.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.500]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.200]   Absolutely.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.800]   If if two clouds could fly.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.600]   Two cows air.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.000]   You know, that actually would be a good name for an airline.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.700]   It would be the flying cow.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.800]   I'll take it to flying cow to Seattle tonight.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.800]   Ting.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.800]   There's a lot of business as I like to get Elliot Noss into.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   So here's the big story broke earlier today.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.100]   Microsoft's denying it, but it happened in the Czech Republic.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:19.900]   A Microsoft now Microsoft says that this is a Czech subsidiary of Microsoft.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:38.800]   But Peter Balbeck, who is a product manager at Microsoft Czech Republic, says that native apps for Microsoft office will be available for Android and iOS in March.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:48.300]   Now the Microsoft response to this was the information shared by our Czech subsidiary is not accurate.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.600]   We do not have anything further to share at this time.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.700]   So that could be April could be February.
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.300]   Right.
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.400]   I get a conditional cheer.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   Yeah, everything I know about Microsoft and everything we've talked about when this weekly is that absolutely Microsoft even said that we will have office on on on on on on Mac and Tash Android and Windows.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.300]   It's too big a market for them to ignore.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:19.500]   And the rumors for office for the iPad have been flying for months and it's pretty much accepted.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.100]   I'll ask on Windows weekly tomorrow, I'll ask Mary Jo Foley.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:27.100]   She's got very good sources, but I would guess this was an accidental leak of a true story.
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.000]   I can't wait because I've tried most of the alternatives.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.800]   What do you guys use for office docs on Android or on I the good news is on iOS.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.000]   There's some good choices.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.100]   The Apple stuff and I use those.
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.100]   But I don't I don't on Android.
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.300]   I haven't found anything good.
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.700]   There's Google Docs is it and even that's not very good.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.000]   What do you mean?
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.900]   I just I honestly have it.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:48.900]   I'm not writing a book anymore.
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.800]   My editor is not requiring that I use word.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.300]   I just I just don't use office docs as much anymore.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:59.000]   I stick to text files as much as possible, which I know is not not a choice that most people have.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.200]   Yeah, I mean, I would just I use Google Docs for most of my office stuff right now.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.500]   I don't find myself creating documents much on a phone or even a tablet.
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.300]   Yeah, I'm using the tablet and the keyboard now.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.700]   I'm traveling without a laptop now.
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.100]   Wow, good for you.
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.800]   Well, I think that's the reason I think there's more and more people doing that.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.900]   And that's the reason they need to do this.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:29.000]   And even if it's just to look at a spreadsheet or to deliver PowerPoint, there is, you know, you don't have to be creating stuff.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.200]   You could be consuming it too.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.200]   The problem is I use I guess it's called smart office to I think.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.400]   Yeah, which is OK.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.100]   It's fine.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:52.500]   But it has irritating things like maybe it's just my stupidity, but I was reading a a manuscript to a wonderful book coming out and you know, I get through to page 80 and then if it closed, I got to open up and I got to scroll through to page 80 again.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.100]   That kind of stuff.
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.100]   It's just it's just not ready for prime time.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.100]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:56.700]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.300]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:03.900]   It's like, you know, I don't use full on office tools anymore unless I have to make a really beautiful formatted document.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.000]   I'm doing that so little.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.800]   I mean, otherwise Google Docs just kind of works and it's easy and it's in every browser.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   I mean, not to be commercial for Google Docs, but I saw this and I was like, yeah, this makes a lot of sense for Microsoft.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.900]   This is a huge market for them.
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:21.400]   But you know, I have to suppress a very cliche, snarky joke about, you know, fitting the ribbon toolbar on the.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:27.700]   Like, am I really going to be doing like heavy, I don't know, document work on the iPad?
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.100]   I don't know.
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.400]   I mean, maybe with the keyboard.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:35.900]   I wonder what the business is since we're having, we're in a ripe speculation mode, which is what we do.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.600]   I wonder what the business model would be.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.100]   If it's if it's a purchase of the app or if it's trying to drive you to their cloud as a.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.300]   Sky drive, right?
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.200]   Yeah, you hooked in a skydrive or is that is that the office?
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.800]   I think that's the office thinking.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.500]   I think that's the one, right?
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:52.700]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:52.700]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.400]   Sky drive.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:53.700]   Yeah.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.700]   Well, and Microsoft's really moving to the cloud.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:01.700]   Their office 365 is actually a pretty good version of Microsoft office.
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.300]   It's going to be built into office 2013.
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.000]   I, you know, and they're doing tablets.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.800]   They're doing surface.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:14.400]   So, you know, they could, if they were competitive, I guess they could ignore iOS and Android.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.400]   Say, look, if you want a really good office solution, just use our stuff.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.600]   But I think they're going to do it.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.100]   And they've always worked across across the.
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.300]   It's a big market.
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.500]   They make a ton of money.
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.700]   I understood why they, they killed IE for Mac.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.100]   Uh, because it was horrendous.
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.000]   Well, that's true.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.900]   Maybe that's why they never, it was never a good app.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.400]   Truthfully, true.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.700]   I wonder what the pricing is going to be like for it.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:45.300]   You know, like, like, will it be you have to have a license to the desktop in order to have the mobile app?
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.000]   Or is it just going to be, you know, like a $15 mobile app?
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.400]   Is it going to be a 30 on mobile app?
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.300]   Is it five bucks?
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.400]   You know, curious.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.600]   It forces all that, doesn't it?
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.500]   Because it's not, you're just not buying the package anymore.
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.400]   It gives you access to your docs.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.700]   God, so God knows what little bit.
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:05.300]   The, um, Mary Jo Foley, our host of Windows Weekly tweeted earlier, according to Gardner in our chat room.
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:14.800]   I still think office is coming to iOS, Android and other non Microsoft platforms, but maybe, maybe not as a local client or maybe not in March.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:21.200]   So if it's not a local client, it could be a web based solution, but then it would be a lot like Google Docs, you know, with the same.
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.200]   Kind of problems.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.400]   And then you've got problems in terms of whether or not it's you could work offline.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.800]   Yeah, what happens when you get in an airplane?
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:34.400]   You know, which I think, I think, you know, you can't charge too much on tablets for apps, right?
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.000]   No.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.300]   I don't know.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.700]   You can't charge more than 50 bucks.
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.400]   You probably shouldn't charge more than 10 bucks.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.300]   That's what Apple charges for its office apps.
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.100]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:47.400]   But you could also use it as an entry drug, a gateway drug to the big office.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:52.400]   Not only an entry and gateway, you're right, but also a defense against the people who just say, Oh, what the heck?
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.400]   Let's just use Google Docs.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.900]   Well, and everything Microsoft's done right now is in response to Google Docs.
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.300]   It's pretty clear that they're threatened by it.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.300]   So yeah, I think that's why everybody agrees.
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.500]   Google is pushing for tablet optimized apps, which is nice.
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.500]   Last.
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.500]   Finally, you know, I think they're Nexus seven.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.800]   They haven't released numbers have they, but it's got to be a success.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.300]   It's got to be big.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.100]   It's only a success.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.600]   They, I've been looking.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.100]   I've been repeating again and again, it's supposed to come out with a new version today.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.900]   We'll finally give you landscape, including the home screen.
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.400]   New version of jelly bean.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.300]   Oh, yes.
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:26.800]   Yes.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.200]   It's going to push it up for the next seven to the day.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.400]   But that's a hard thing to do.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.500]   Honeycomb did that, right?
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:31.900]   Gina?
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:32.600]   And it was ugly.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.000]   It did.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:33.900]   It did.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:34.400]   It did.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.100]   Oh, was it ugly?
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.400]   Yeah, because it took a while.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:37.900]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:43.500]   It was almost like the icons were loose inside and they had to kind of slide over and read.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.500]   It just took a long.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:49.900]   It was, it was kind of ugly and I can see why they said, you know, let's get this right before we do that again.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:50.400]   Right.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.100]   I mean, the Nexus seven is small enough that you're holding it in portrait.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.200]   You sort of naturally hold it portrait mode, right?
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.600]   Like honeycomb came out on a bigger on the bigger tablets.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.800]   This story about Google encouraging developers to tabletize their apps.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:09.200]   Kana, I think goes hand in hand with the next one, which is that they are to co-brand 10 inch Nexus with Samsung, right?
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.800]   So this is a thing like I have a lot of developer guilt.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.500]   I have guilt because, well, I mean, Catholic, right?
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:25.800]   So I've got guilt, but I'm easily guilty, but I have a lot of guilt about I haven't tablet optimized to do text, which is my app yet mostly because, you know, there just wasn't a lot of there weren't a lot of people weren't a lot of users on a tablet.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.600]   And then when the Nexus seven came out, you know, the screen is small enough.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.900]   You know, my app is a to do list app.
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.300]   So it's just a list of you.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.200]   It looks OK enough.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.400]   You know, it doesn't look absolutely horrendous.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.700]   There isn't so much white space like to do text on the iPad looks obviously not optimized.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.900]   You know, so I have I felt like I've kind of squeaked by.
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.900]   I mean, I'm also not running a business.
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.100]   It's just a weekend project.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.000]   So I kind of been taking my time.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:25:01.200]   But once a 10 inch comes out, you know, that gets if it if a 10 inch Nexus comes out, that's as popular as an X is seven, I'm going to feel much more compelled to optimize my app for the tablet because the bigger screen just calls for it.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:08.300]   And you just don't want your hat to have your app have these big, you know, gaping wide white spaces and you're crying out for the sidebar and the split view.
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:14.300]   So Google's guilty me. I'm going to have to get down to it and make it make a tablet optimized.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.400]   Can you tell as a developer how many of your customers are using next sevens?
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.500]   Yes, I believe so.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.600]   I think in the developer console, you can.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.400]   Yeah, you can see a version of Android and and device as well.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.400]   Well, let's hear it.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.300]   Looking up right now.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.500]   I'm really curious.
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.200]   I'm all of that.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.800]   I mean, how many people are using gingerbread?
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.400]   How many people are using honeycomb jelly bean?
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.800]   How many people are using tablets versus phones?
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:45.300]   I would guess the vast majority are probably on ice cream sandwich on phones.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:50.400]   I would guess and your users are at vent are going to be more sophisticated Android users.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.600]   Yeah, yeah, I have my I've I definitely got the power user.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.000]   I bet the Nexus is the number one phone than the galaxy.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.500]   This is active installs on October 9th.
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.700]   So that was yesterday.
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.100]   That's interesting.
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.900]   9% that seems really high.
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.500]   9% Nexus 7.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.600]   X7.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.000]   Yeah, you better get going, Gina.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.500]   I guess like work to do.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:20.200]   9% yeah, I have a really kind of savvy, smart geeky.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.300]   Yeah, how many are Amazon platforms?
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:22.800]   Does it says?
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.700]   Exist.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.900]   Well, so I'm looking at the Google developer.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:27.500]   Play Store.
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.700]   Yeah, play store.
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.700]   So the play store doesn't tell me, you know, who's on the candle.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:30.900]   Right.
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:31.100]   Right.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:32.800]   Right.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.700]   Are you on the Amazon store?
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.100]   I am the Amazon store and judging from sales, not very many.
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.500]   Not very kindle.
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.500]   So we've got an inside source here, Jeff.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.100]   Not trigger.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:47.300]   But you know, my app, like I said, is super, it's super nerdy.
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.500]   It's super power user nerdy.
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.400]   I've got a lot of people using the galaxy Nexus here.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.000]   I mean, these are these are users with the most recent Android phones.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   And these are nerds and developers like me.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.100]   So I'm a little skewed.
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:00.900]   I don't think I'm very representative of regular Android users.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.900]   But yeah, I guess I get some work to do.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:16.700]   So when you do so, Android automatically kind of, you know, you could say fill the screen, but it doesn't, you're saying it doesn't look as good as if you kind of are intelligent about using this space.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.100]   Exactly.
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.300]   So Android, Android, everything is a relative layout.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.200]   It's like much like, you know, web page, right?
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.500]   So you make a page if you expand the width and the height of the screen, it just kind of fills it.
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:42.500]   And, but yeah, to tablet optimize, you would say beyond a certain point, you know, you can add more buttons on the top, you know, say that the action bar, you can show a split view layout where it's like, here's my list and maybe here are my, you know, categories on the other side.
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:50.300]   Do you query device or screen resolution and then change your output based on that?
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:58.300]   You actually define, you define your layouts and using XML, just sort of a markup language, but you, but, but, but Android kind of handles it all for you.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:05.300]   So it's not like the old JavaScript where you're like, if I'm using IE, you're not hard coding, like particular device names or anything like that.
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.300]   Android kind of handles that all for you.
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.300]   There's different resolutions.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.300]   There's the maximum resolution, medium, small, and then their screen size.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:20.300]   If you define your layouts and then Android kind of just fluidly figures out what layout should I use, given the orientation that the device is in and, and the screen size.
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:24.300]   But you do have to define the layouts given, given, you know, the different options.
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:30.300]   Okay, well, I have to change things, Gina, for the iPhone 5 with the extra row now.
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:38.300]   Yeah, well, for the iPhone 5, you know, you have to, I had to provide high resolution art for the retina display.
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:44.300]   And, and when you launch an iPhone app, the first image that you see is actually an image like an image.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.300]   Oh, it's a picture. It's a bit map.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.300]   Right. It's a bit map.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.300]   It's a bit map.
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.300]   It mentions exactly. So because iPhone 5 is taller, every app developer in order to optimize.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.300]   I've had to provide a new launch image that's.
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.300]   Jeez.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.300]   Yeah.
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:04.300]   You know, and, and if you're a game that has lots of assets and lots of backgrounds and things like that, you had to provide all that as well.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:11.300]   And you have to bundle both in the app, right? Yuki, the app doesn't download different versions for the different phones.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.300]   You got to have, it's all got to be in there.
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.300]   That's all got to be in there.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:18.300]   So games with a lot of graphics and textures are going to double the size of the game.
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.300]   Exactly. Exactly.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:26.300]   Yeah, you have to write the iPhone 5, the iPhone 4, retina, non retina iPad, iPad 2, retina.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.300]   I mean, there's several options.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.300]   Well, I guess we won't hear Apple use the word fragmentation again for a while.
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.300]   [laughter]
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.300]   It came around to bite him in the butt.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:44.300]   So now just as this is the rumor about this 10 inch tablet, this comes from NPD's analyst Richard Schim.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:52.300]   He says, "Get ready because it'll be a 2560 by 1600 display according to him.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:30:00.300]   That's a pixels per inch of 299. That's better than the retina iPad by about 10%.
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:04.300]   He says it'll be more expensive."
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:09.300]   Interesting that they're doing it with Samsung, not Asus, who did the Nexus 7 for them.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.300]   I think we're trying to spread the wealth.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.300]   Sure.
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.300]   We have your real story here is that LG is going to have a Nexus phone.
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.300]   I also think we hear a lot of reports about how they're going to make.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.300]   I think we talked about this before.
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:25.300]   Nexus, a certified Google use that will get advantages versus just plain and right now.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.300]   So that makes sense because they can control Nexus in a way that can absolutely be handled.
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:34.300]   It'd be great if they did and you knew you were going to get updates and that kind of stuff.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:40.300]   So are we surprised that Motorola doesn't, I mean they own Motorola.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:47.300]   I guess that's what they're trying to do is make sure that people understand we're not going to give Motorola any advantage effect.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:52.300]   Well it's worse because Motorola screwed up and I don't fully understand the story so I'm hoping one of you will explain it to me.
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:31:00.300]   But Motorola backed off on doing updates on some of its phones and really pissed off a lot of users.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:10.300]   It's so confusing because if you didn't know that Google owned Motorola, you would think, "Oh man, that's going to be the worst Android company."
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.300]   That's done.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:19.300]   I mean, Android user's outraged over Motorola's working promise.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.300]   Yeah, I see it.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:33.300]   So, you know, I never thought that Droid was really a good example of Android and I would have thought that the Nexus, the Nexus phone at least would be in Motorola.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:46.300]   The Photon 4G, which was a very high end Android phone because it had dual core, one of the first to have dual core a year ago,
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:50.300]   is not going to get updated.
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:56.300]   Last Friday the company said, "We are never going to update the Photon."
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.300]   Wow.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:05.300]   The Atrix, which was announced to CES, which is very high end, no update.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.300]   I don't know, are they gingerbread?
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.300]   I guess they are.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.300]   Yeah, they're stuck on gingerbread.
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.300]   That's horrible.
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:14.300]   And this is after Motorola joined the Open Handset Alliance.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.300]   Promised to that promise.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.300]   Yeah, and so there's three phones.
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.300]   There's the Photon.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.300]   Photon, the Atrix, let me find.
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.300]   And the Electrify, which no one has.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:27.300]   I don't know what has any of these, but that beside the point.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:31.300]   They're offering what, a coupon or something, right?
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:36.300]   I think what they should do is offer free rooting so you could put clockwork mod and CM10 on it.
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.300]   That's what I think they should offer.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.300]   Free root.
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.300]   I'm going to see your sign for rising stuff.
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.300]   Bring it in, we'll root it for you.
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:49.300]   I mean, isn't that what, if you're a sophisticated user, you go, whatever, I'll put CM10.
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.300]   But I did have CM10 running on my Galaxy S3, but Wi-Fi didn't.
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.300]   It's still kind of funky.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.300]   That's the problem when you put these mods on.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.300]   That's the problem.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.300]   Often one thing doesn't work as well because it's a driver issue.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.300]   It's like when Linux first came out.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.300]   You know, you say, "Oh, well, your webcam is not going to work."
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.300]   But everything else will work fine.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:12.300]   So I guess, you know, maybe there won't be drivers either.
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.300]   Did they?
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:18.300]   I think there's still, in some cases, Motorola is still locking the bootloader.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.300]   Is that right, Jason?
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.300]   Jason, how is that?
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.300]   One of our hosts on all about Android.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.300]   Does Motorola lock any of their bootloaders, Jason?
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.300]   Do you know off the top of your head?
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.300]   No, that's a good question.
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.300]   He says he doesn't know that he doesn't know.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.300]   Yeah.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.300]   No, those are officially locked.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.300]   I would guess that they probably are.
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:40.300]   Because you'd think with Google, it would, owning them, they would just say, "Well, you
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.300]   know, please, these are more rootable."
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:48.300]   You know, especially considering Motorola, you know, any of their unlocked bootloader
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:52.300]   devices that they've been doing lately have been like special developer editions.
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.300]   Right.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:57.300]   So they haven't necessarily been the most kind of open to unlocking the bootloader in the
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.300]   past anyways.
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.300]   I'd really be surprised if these were unlocked.
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:04.300]   Motorola posts, this is in August.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:09.300]   Motorola posts Android bootloader unlock page, but only for the photon.
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.300]   So all the rest of them are locked.
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:19.300]   That means you can't root them and you can't, well, you can, but it's harder.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:23.300]   I would never say can't do anything.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:31.300]   But they did give you four steps to unlock your device if you had a photon queue.
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.300]   I think that's for Ryzen.
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.300]   You've got to blame Verizon for that.
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:41.300]   Google, and, but what, so what you're really seeing is Google, unlike Microsoft being very
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:47.300]   careful not to piss off its OEMs, they're not exactly OEMs because it doesn't own Android,
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:51.300]   but not, well, for one of a better word.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:55.300]   And, you know, to keep the partners all happy, we're going to spread it out with the wealth
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:59.300]   and we're not going to make Motorola be any less rapacious than they were before we bought
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:00.300]   them.
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.300]   We're actually going to make Motorola worse.
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.300]   We're going to make them worse.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.300]   Just so you feel better.
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:10.300]   See, we, Motorola still sucks.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.300]   Just in case you were worried.
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.300]   It's proven off.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.300]   There's no favor.
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.300]   Doesn't matter.
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.300]   Wow.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:22.300]   LG is going to unveil.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.300]   It's according to CNET.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.300]   It's a Nexus, the new Nexus at the end of the month.
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.300]   It'll be the Optimus G.
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.300]   I haven't had an LG phone in a while.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.300]   Yeah, wow, me neither.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.300]   But I get excited about new Nexus releases.
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.300]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.300]   We're kind of do, aren't we?
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:46.300]   I mean, the Nexus was good, but it's no longer the top of the line.
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:52.300]   No, I'm a little jealous of your Galaxy 3, but the Nexus is still a good phone.
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.300]   Well, I'm getting the note.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.300]   I bought the note.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.300]   I bought it unlocked from Expansis, the European version.
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:03.300]   Don't please whatever you do, don't ever tell me how much 545 pounds you're going to be.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.300]   545 pounds is in real money.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.300]   Ooh.
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.300]   Ooh.
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.300]   I don't want to know.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.300]   Yikes.
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.300]   Ooh.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.300]   I did it for you.
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.300]   I'm googling the conversion.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:20.300]   It's only 60, it's only 16 gigs, but I just, I couldn't bring myself to spend more than
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.300]   that.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:26.300]   I just spoke with a whole bunch of Korean editors, yesterday editors and publishers yesterday
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.300]   here at QUTI.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.540]   I told them my one disappointment visited their country was I couldn't get a good price on
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.540]   the note.
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.540]   Yeah.
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:33.540]   Ooh.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.100]   It looks pretty nice.
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:40.980]   It looks like a Galaxy S3, but it's a little, it's actually a little, sinners in the old
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.540]   note and a little narrower, but a little taller, I think.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:44.540]   Right.
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:50.540]   If you were me and you carried a Nexus phone and a Nexus 7 tablet, you don't need it.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.540]   No, no, no, no, no, because you got it, you got it.
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:53.540]   You got the one of those.
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.540]   Well, what did the note replace both?
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:56.540]   Oh, what did it replace both?
[00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:57.540]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.540]   Yeah.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.940]   Would you just carry a note instead of carrying a tablet?
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:01.940]   Yeah.
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:02.940]   Sure.
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.500]   You know why I don't carry the Nexus 7 because it's Wi-Fi only.
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.700]   It's kind of inconvenient.
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.180]   So it's $872.33.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:12.100]   I didn't want to say it.
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.940]   Oh, Lord.
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.100]   Oh, Lord.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:22.900]   Well, I, but the good news is I'll have it by the next, next week, by next, by next.
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:28.460]   That's what a, the, um, iPhone 5 costs unlock.
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:29.460]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.620]   No, good point.
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.820]   I just feel, you know, I just feel like it's my duty.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:39.060]   Uh, and, uh, in order to get it quicker, I'm sorry, it's only 529 pounds in order to get
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.860]   it quicker, but then I bought a lot of other stuff.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:45.940]   I had to get the white one because the titanium's not in stock yet.
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:50.700]   So I wanted to, Gina, Gina, this is where you and I say, oh yes, boss, you have to do
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:51.700]   this and work great.
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.700]   You did.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:53.700]   I do.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:54.700]   You can feel better.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:55.700]   No, no, no, that's my job.
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.700]   Seriously.
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.700]   I think this was definitely your duty as a, as it was.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:58.700]   Yes, it was.
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:37:59.700]   Yes, it was.
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:00.700]   Yes.
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:03.940]   And I'll, uh, I'll show you, I'll show you next week.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:04.940]   Cool.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:05.940]   Bigger to see it.
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:06.940]   Yeah.
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.020]   Well, people, you know, it's out, it's out in people's hands.
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.220]   There's the Android authorities review.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.580]   And one of the things they're saying is that the battery life is really kind of remarkable
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.140]   like we're like, to draw it.
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:23.820]   No, that was, that was what I was going to wait for is the four G LTE version from Verizon.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:24.820]   And then I got mad at Verizon.
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:29.220]   It turns out I shouldn't have because AT&T is worse, but it was too late.
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.220]   I've already pushed the button.
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:35.620]   The thing I didn't know with my, with my Galaxy Nexus is the, it's the worldwide version.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.300]   You cannot buy accessories or anything for it.
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:42.660]   The battery of it versus the CDMA Verizon is a different shape.
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.660]   Right.
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.660]   Thus rechargers, plus everything else.
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.660]   Yes.
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.300]   Um, I could have told you that.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.300]   Oh, wow.
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.940]   That's an all different.
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:54.220]   It's all like as if they were just trying to screw with you.
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.220]   Yeah.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.300]   Wait, the charger connector is different?
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.300]   No.
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.180]   The battery size is different.
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.180]   The battery size is different.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.900]   So you have to get a different external charger.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:03.900]   Okay.
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.900]   Oh, I see.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:05.900]   Okay.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:06.940]   I do that for every phone I buy.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.540]   I, you just buy an external.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:12.620]   I buy two extra batteries and an external charger.
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:17.780]   I couldn't even buy an extra OEM battery for the Nexus phone.
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.740]   I had to buy an off brand and an off brand charger.
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.060]   Right.
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.220]   They're a lot cheaper.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.420]   Yeah, that was good.
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:29.620]   But you lose NFC because the NFC chips, Samsung is getting smart.
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:33.500]   The NFC chips in the battery.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:39.940]   So the Optimus G, but they say that other handset manufacturers may also do Nexus.
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:41.940]   Ooh, look at that back.
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:44.260]   That's what matrix.
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:48.340]   We really got a, so there's three levels of Android then, right?
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.340]   Four levels.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.340]   Okay.
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:52.620]   There's, there's the highest is Nexus.
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.620]   Nexus.
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:54.620]   And stuff like that.
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:57.900]   The next is, I guess, open handset, right?
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:58.900]   OHA.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.420]   The next is Amazon.
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.740]   We screwed with you.
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.740]   But, but we didn't pretend to be OHA.
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:04.740]   Right.
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.660]   And then the next is Chinese company.
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:07.660]   Chinese company.
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:08.660]   What's from Chinese companies?
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:09.660]   Yeah.
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:10.660]   Chinese company.
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.820]   Takes advantage of it.
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:18.500]   We've put some special software in here just for you.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:23.540]   That's tied to the story about Huawei and XTE, which are both Chinese companies with
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:27.620]   apparently rumored ties to the Chinese military.
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:33.300]   The Congress Committee on Monday said, "We're not going to let government employees buy
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.660]   these candidates just announced.
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.100]   We're not going to let government employees buy these phones."
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:43.580]   Because the real concern is that they might have some special spice stuff.
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.700]   Not just by the phones, but also Huawei.
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.700]   Any of the products.
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.540]   It's a lot of back-end stuff.
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:49.540]   Yeah.
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.180]   The fear is that it was going to be open doors into our phone system.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.180]   Right.
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:57.540]   And it was funny because it didn't sound like they were worried about cyber warfare or
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:58.540]   terrorism.
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:02.420]   They're worried about them stealing intellectual property from US companies listening in on
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:03.420]   the big meeting.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.900]   It's like, "Oh, Apple's going to do a mini iPad.
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.900]   Quick!
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:11.340]   Into the drawing board!"
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:14.940]   Chinese company Oppo.
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.180]   I have an Oppo Blu-ray player.
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.860]   It's quite good.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:19.860]   You would.
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:24.420]   No, you know what?
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:25.780]   It's a video file Blu-ray.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.860]   It's considered to be one of the best Blu-rays out there.
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.020]   I didn't know they were a Chinese company.
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:33.540]   I thought they were finished with a name like Oppo.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:39.180]   They are making the world's first 1080p smartphone, a five-inch screen.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.860]   Get ready for this.
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.020]   441 pixels per inch.
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:45.380]   30 seconds.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.940]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.620]   Oppo.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.620]   I like Oppo.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:54.820]   6.65 millimeters thick.
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.460]   Oh, that was their phone earlier.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.380]   That was the world's thinnest smartphone.
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.780]   How thick is the Oppo?
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:06.620]   The Oppo find, they call it the find.
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.340]   The find five.
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:12.780]   Five-inch 1080p screen.
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:18.460]   Beating Apple's iPhone quite handily, which the iPhone's written as 326 PPI.
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.060]   This will be 441.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.540]   The Lumia 331.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.540]   Lumia 920.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.980]   This will be 441.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:30.100]   But HTC is rumored to be doing a 1080p as well.
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.340]   Good Lord.
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.820]   These things are amazing.
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:35.300]   They are.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.380]   Now it's just a numbers.
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.780]   Now it's just people trying to, "Hey, we got more pixels.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.780]   I don't know if we need them."
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.100]   In fact, that's one of the wraps in the Galaxy Note 2.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.900]   It actually has a lower pixel density.
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:52.140]   It's 1280x720 instead of 1280x800.
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.580]   Did you get your...
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:57.820]   It's going to be a good holiday season.
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:58.820]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:42:59.820]   Daggit-wise.
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:04.180]   There's also a 4-inch Galaxy S3.
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.660]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:09.020]   So we talked about this on Mac Break Weekly yesterday.
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:13.780]   Samsung's Apple's philosophy is to make one perfect thing.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:14.780]   One size fits all.
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:15.780]   You can...
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:18.860]   You will love it or nothing.
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:22.500]   Any size you want as long as it's this.
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:27.980]   Samsung is doing kind of the opposite, which is to try to find...
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:31.380]   To make one for every possible user.
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:32.580]   So if you want a 4-inch, they got a 4-inch.
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:33.580]   You want a 5-1/2-inch.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.820]   They got a 5-1/2-inch.
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:36.820]   And everything in between.
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.740]   It seems to be working.
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:41.500]   My phone says it's too big.
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.500]   Which one do you...
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.500]   Oh, the Galaxy...
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:44.500]   You have an X-S.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.500]   Galaxy X-S.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.500]   It's a 4.3, I think.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.940]   It's not even that big.
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.380]   What is an iPhone now?
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.380]   4.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.500]   You're trying to speak.
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.860]   It's 4, but it's a 16 by 9/4.
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:01.860]   So it's 1136 by 640.
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:06.540]   It's a unique and size that no one else does.
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:07.540]   Right.
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.540]   Special snowflake.
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.820]   It's a very unique special.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:11.820]   Special snowflake.
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:15.340]   I want to put a little headband with a bow on it.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:23.660]   I just can't decide if it's a boy or a girl.
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.660]   You know what?
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.940]   My daughter said the best thing to me in the world yesterday.
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:30.380]   She said, "You ever hear of this comic strip called XKCD?"
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.380]   I said, "Oh, that's...
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.900]   See, I want to hear that from my kid, really."
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:35.900]   That's...
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:36.900]   That's...
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.140]   She went through Garfield, Bloom County.
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.980]   I was happy about Bloom County.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.500]   But when she said, she said, "Yeah, I found it.
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:47.180]   I've read every strip they ever published last night."
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:48.700]   Oh, that's good.
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:49.700]   That's good taste.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:50.700]   Is that good taste?
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:51.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:52.700]   I found Abby.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:53.700]   Yeah.
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:54.700]   XKCD.
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.700]   Yeah, I've heard of them.
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.180]   I should have told her about the oatmeal.
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.540]   Yeah, I should have told her about the oatmeal.
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:04.780]   By the way, that's that oatmeal campaign to get the Tesla houses working pretty well,
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:05.780]   huh?
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.780]   He apparently has bought it.
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.860]   He raised a significant amount more.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.660]   1.4, I think.
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.020]   Holy cow.
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.020]   Yeah.
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:18.220]   And the real estate agent for one side or the other says that, "Yeah, they have an agreement
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.220]   in terms."
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.940]   And so the Tesla Museum will come.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.460]   Well, it's pretty cool.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:25.140]   They own the land.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.660]   But I think it has more money than that.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.420]   Do they raise so much money that they're able to actually build a museum?
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.380]   Well, it's not a question to build.
[00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:38.340]   I think it's a question to get the rats out of what is there.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:42.500]   The land, laboratory, and foundation underneath the tower are still there.
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:43.500]   Yep.
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.300]   And so he bought the property.
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:49.900]   The property cost 1.6 million, but there was a matching grant.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.900]   So he only needed to raise $850,000.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:56.260]   And I think didn't he raise 1.4?
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:57.260]   Yeah.
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:01.060]   So there's a nice hefty little chunk for the museum.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.060]   Yeah.
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:04.060]   That's great.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:09.660]   There is no Tesla Museum in the United States, but now there is.
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.820]   And that was an indiegogo.
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:17.340]   Because he did that amazing Tesla comic, he had done like an homage to Tesla a few weeks
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:19.180]   ago and then this campaign.
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.020]   And I love that comic.
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.580]   And Edison didn't look too good at the end of the comic.
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:25.580]   No, he should.
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.580]   No, he should.
[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:27.580]   He killed an elephant.
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:32.180]   But yeah, it's incredible.
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:36.820]   It's just like, it's not just about, you know, it wasn't just nerd love for Tesla.
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:40.560]   I mean, it was like he sort of brought out the nerd love for Tesla and then said he
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.920]   could hear something that you can do.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.940]   It was incredibly successful.
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:51.100]   They received, they raised $1,370,511 on indiegogo.
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:56.760]   Let's build a goddamn Tesla museum.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.760]   Good for a good for the oatmeal.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.400]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.400]   Come back with more.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.400]   Gina Trapani is here.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.400]   Mama Gina.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.400]   Mama Gina.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.400]   Mama G.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:10.380]   Yeah, I think you have to teach you how to eat meatballs.
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:11.380]   Oh yeah.
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:13.200]   Oh, Nona's working on it.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.200]   Sunday gravy.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.840]   Yo, yeah.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.840]   This is the thing.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:17.840]   You got to decide what to go.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:21.040]   But I guess because there were previous grandchildren, you don't have to decide what to call her.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.040]   That's already given, right?
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.040]   Right.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.040]   What is she?
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.040]   Nona.
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.040]   No, no, no, no.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:29.040]   My grandma, I don't know why I was nanny.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.040]   Okay.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.040]   Maybe because I couldn't say no, no, I don't know.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.040]   Maybe.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.040]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.040]   I was the first grandchild.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.040]   So I got to choose.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.040]   I choose nanny.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:41.960]   Oh, I have this vision.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.800]   You have a little baby Leo with the same Leo head.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   Oh yeah.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   The head was always this big.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   It was like a little stock.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.280]   I sort of imagine that your bottle of shape like the microphone though, you know, like
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.280]   I can't.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.280]   I can't.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.280]   I always broadcasting.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.780]   Oh, you know what?
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:57.780]   There's a picture.
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:58.780]   I don't have it.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:03.520]   I wish I did of me probably at the age of three with a turntable and talking into a pot.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.520]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.520]   All right.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:11.280]   So I think that this, I think when you get into nature and nurture debate and you will
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:17.880]   see this Gina, there's definitely some nurture, but they come out ready to do something.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.880]   Ready to do something?
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:20.880]   They come out a certain way, right?
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.880]   Right.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:22.880]   Jeff, I'm not wrong on this.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.880]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.880]   You don't have a whole hell of a lot to do with it.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.520]   Hopefully my girl really like Legos and coding.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.520]   I don't know.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.520]   We'll see.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:31.520]   I hope so.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.520]   You got to go with the flow.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.520]   You got to go with the flow.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:36.760]   She might want to be a princess and I'd be okay with that too.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.880]   She will be whatever annoys you the most.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.440]   She will be whatever.
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.840]   So I think we know what she's going to be, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:43.840]   Oh, yes.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:44.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:45.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.840]   Barbie.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:48.840]   Let's go to the Maker Faire.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:49.840]   Drop the Barbie.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   Let's go to the Maker Faire.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:51.840]   Let's offer.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:57.080]   I don't want to go to the Maker Faire.
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.040]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.600]   Here's my best vision.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.280]   She wants to, little Edda wants to join in those pageants where you have to, you know,
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.520]   get first to a business.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.520]   Oh, no.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.520]   Right.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.520]   And then it's free.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:14.760]   It's, and Bobby, you can't, you can't, you can't keep me from my life's dreams.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.160]   This is my dream.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.320]   They do that to you.
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.400]   I got to tell you, I got to warn you.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:22.640]   I'm going to save her the time that I can dress her.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.760]   Oh, it is so much fun, isn't it?
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.080]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.400]   It's really a lot of fun.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.400]   I can't wait.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.280]   Whatever she wants to do, I will support her.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:35.840]   I will certainly encourage her with the things that I'm interested in, but if just pageants
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.400]   is what she wants, then we'll have a discussion.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.400]   Oh, okay.
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.400]   This is on tape, Edda.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.400]   Wow.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:42.400]   I know.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.480]   She's not supposed to watch the show until she's done.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.480]   That's what you say.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.480]   Whatever makes you happy, dear.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.480]   I just want you to be happy.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.480]   Isn't that what your mom told you?
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:52.480]   Absolutely.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.480]   Let me, let me note that today is my daughter, Julia's 16th birthday.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.480]   Oh, there's a good birthday.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.480]   Happy birthday.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.480]   That's a huge birthday.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   Happy birthday.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:05.480]   And of course, sweet 16 and never been kissed.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.280]   I really hope not.
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:10.280]   Okay.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.360]   One more thing, and this is not going to turn into the baby show.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.600]   I just want to say, but one more thing.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:19.680]   Abby's first kiss, Joe Montana's son, Nicholas.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.480]   Oh, that's good.
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:22.480]   I had dreams.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.280]   We were going to have a football dynasty.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.880]   I was ready and then they broke up like a month later.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.320]   So that's a good first kiss though.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.320]   That's a good story.
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.120]   It's a good first kiss.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.920]   Good for her.
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:40.520]   I don't think she was 16.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.120]   Our show brought to you today.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.120]   Father's heart broken.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.040]   But the show brought to you today by.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:49.600]   So I buried my, I buried my tears in my Mustang.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:50.960]   Like every good father.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:57.040]   Yeah, that 2010 Mustang GT 5.0, that, that, that, that helped a lot.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:01.320]   And if you're a Mustang or a Ford lover, you're a Ford family, Ford owner, you got to visit
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:05.320]   social.ford.com if you're an aspiring Ford owner too.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:08.960]   You can read about Ford articles on all sorts of subjects.
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:15.720]   Here's an homage to Carl Shelby who built those amazing Shelby GTs and Ford and Shelby
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:16.720]   Mustangs.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:22.240]   Here's an interesting conversation on how to get better fuel economy with your hybrid.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.800]   Great, great articles.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.800]   Social.ford.com.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:29.360]   I wrote one on, I interviewed one of Ford's top technologists.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.680]   I'm probably going to do the same at CES this year.
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:36.560]   And I wrote an article about their API and what their plans are for autonomous vehicles.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.840]   Like that's what stuff I'm always interested in.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:39.840]   Here's what you can do.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:43.580]   You visit the for social.ford.com, read those articles.
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.960]   You could share your story.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.640]   There's lots of stories about Ford owners.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.280]   It's just so cute.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.880]   I mean, people will really love their cars.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.360]   Ideas too.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:57.400]   And any, this is kind of a 21st century suggestion box.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.400]   Listen to this one.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:06.120]   William B says replace the windshield with a 4K LED backlit flat panel HD display.
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.360]   Night vision capability.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:12.160]   And then the vehicle exterior just kind of a sheet metal covering where the windshield
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.160]   would be.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.680]   You like that idea?
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.120]   Go there and vote.
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:22.680]   And whatever you do, make sure you grab your badge to show your Ford love, including
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:24.360]   the tech geek badge.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.520]   You're not just ahead of the curve.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:31.960]   You're the one leading at social.ford.com and find out about the new 2013 fusions just
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.840]   coming out right now, including the fusion energy plug in hybrid.
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:36.760]   That's the one I'm getting.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:41.880]   I might actually trade my Ford Mustang in for it.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:42.880]   Don't tell.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:43.880]   Which one?
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:44.880]   Which one?
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:45.880]   The plug.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.120]   Now that I have a house, I could plug it in.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.120]   Yay!
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.840]   I couldn't get it because I was in an apartment.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:54.520]   And there aren't like charging stations yet in the Petaluma.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.800]   But you go to the Oakland airport front row.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:59.000]   There's like 10 charging stations and there's never.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   Oh, it would be.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.800]   And so this is a fusion is it's a hybrid plug in hybrid.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:08.640]   So it's an electric you can use an electric or as a gas vehicle.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:09.840]   That's what I want.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:13.800]   My problem is what I have to have is a plug in hybrid four wheel drive.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.400]   I'm sure that's going to happen.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:19.480]   In fact, one of the things oh yeah, and I'll ask when I talk to Alan Malawi in January,
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:20.480]   one of the things I'll.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:24.960]   Well, one of the things he told me last year was that they delayed the electric vehicles
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:29.720]   because they want to make it so that their assembly lines all over the world can put
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.800]   in any drive train into any vehicle.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:36.480]   So any vehicle on the same line can be made diesel petrol.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.120]   He calls it petrol.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:42.520]   Electric or plug in or hybrid electric.
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:46.920]   And the reason being that they want to be able to realistically respond to demand.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:48.920]   Which makes perfect sense.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:51.680]   It's not just going to be like this special one car.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.120]   It's going to be the whole line.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:59.800]   So they'll have a you know, for I guarantee you before we'll drive social.4.com to find
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   out more.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.040]   I don't know who am I to guarantee you?
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:10.040]   I don't I don't I don't work for for it by senses Google bomb Google image search for
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:14.640]   completely wrong brings up Mitt Romney photos.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.840]   Mr. Romney.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:22.160]   Now, is this done in purpose or is this because that's what people are searching?
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.160]   Why?
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.400]   I'm sure it's a Google bomb.
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:25.400]   I'm sure.
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.200]   I don't you don't think you think it's created that way.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:31.040]   No, I think Google made a statement saying that this was this was part of the way they're
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.040]   algorithm.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.040]   It was it was organic search.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:36.640]   He said that he his statement and what he said was completely wrong.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:40.120]   He used the phrase completely wrong and there are all these news articles completely wrong
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.120]   in the in the headline.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.880]   So he did he bombed himself.
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.120]   He bombed himself.
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.760]   Yes, he bombed himself.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:51.480]   Yeah, Google spokesman confirms this is not an intentional Google bomb.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:52.920]   The search results are completely wrong.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:57.320]   Are the natural result of a flurry of recent news articles associating Romney with the phrase
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.320]   completely wrong.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:03.480]   So so now we have probably if you look up a bad debater, you'll see Obama.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:07.960]   Yeah, you got to be careful what you say now because the zeitgeist is reflected in Google
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:08.960]   search.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.960]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:11.960]   Isn't it?
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:12.960]   That is fun.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:20.880]   We were talking on security now about NFC and Google Wallet and we did a whole episode last
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.480]   week on security now, which if you're interested in NFC, you probably should listen to about
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.720]   security implications of near field communication.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:30.200]   It is in now in every new Android phone has it.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:34.400]   The iPhone is the glaring example of a phone that doesn't.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:39.040]   It's the it's kind of the last hold out on NFC and Google with Google, you know, Apple
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:42.520]   hasn't put credit cards into past book, but Google has put credit cards into Google
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:43.520]   Wallet.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:49.920]   I think Google is getting very close now to having a very credible tap to pay ecosystem,
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:50.920]   right?
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:54.360]   And now they're doing it for web content.
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.560]   Yeah, this is this is interesting.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.880]   I'm not sure how I feel about this.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.680]   How does it work?
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.320]   So you hook it up to your web page.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.240]   You say this is pay for content.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:09.000]   So when the user comes to your web page, they see like the first paragraph, they start
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.960]   to scroll down and then a little Google Wallet pop up comes up and says, Hey, the rest of
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.960]   this page is hidden until you buy it.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:19.920]   Like pay 99 cent the continue reading for 49 cents or 99 cents.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:20.920]   Is there a low?
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:22.960]   Oh, the range is 25 to 99 cents.
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:27.840]   So the low is to this was always the thought was if we could only get micro payments working,
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.840]   let me let me be cynical for a rare moment.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.360]   I'm never that much.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:33.360]   Mr. Pollyanna.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.800]   Yeah, this is this is sucking bot to publishers.
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:41.120]   This is sucking up to them and saying, no, no, no, we're not ruling your business models.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:47.480]   Look, we're enabling the long fabled rescue of your beautiful content micro payments.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.040]   It's never going to work.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:50.200]   Here's the one thing I do like.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:53.680]   There is a 30 minute refund window.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:58.440]   So if you read the contest, well, three minutes is enough for a most any article unless it's
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:04.120]   like a really long, you know, John Seabrook article.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:07.520]   And you know, and if you didn't like it, you thought that wasn't worth 49 cents.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.680]   You could get a refund.
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.640]   And once you pay for it, it's yours forever.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:16.480]   I think this is a good I don't think this is a bad idea.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.240]   Yeah, I just go ahead.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:19.240]   Feelings about it.
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.240]   I just mixed feelings about it.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:23.960]   I mean, I feel like if I started to read a really long feature article about something
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:27.800]   I was interested in and it was well written and I was super intrigued.
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:31.320]   You know, I would say, okay, you know, pay like something like like narratively, right?
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:32.320]   That's Jeff.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.320]   That was that project.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.520]   So I think started like something sort of long, long journalism.
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:39.360]   I'd be like, okay, I'll pay a buck to read the rest of this shirt.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.360]   That's happened to me.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:44.560]   I've hit pay walls before on different sites and thought, you know, whatever.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.880]   But at the same time, it's, you know, and this is great for something like think up,
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:51.760]   you know, where we, you know, I'd love to do sort of in-app purchases kind of in a web
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:52.760]   app.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:53.760]   There's possibility there for us.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:57.840]   At the same time, it feels a little bit like if I saw this, I'd be like, well, here's
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:58.840]   an example.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:57:59.840]   Close the tab.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:05.600]   But they actually have a link to a peach pit press, which publishes books.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:10.680]   This is part of their book on Photoshop Elements, chapter 11, Filters and Effects.
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:13.800]   So you go through it and there's quite a bit of free content.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.680]   I'm scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:22.680]   And to change a panel view, oh, wait a minute, continue reading for 99 cents.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.440]   And then look what they do.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.440]   It's redacted.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.440]   Yeah, it's redacted.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:29.800]   Like the rest of the content you can see sort of pixelated images.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.800]   Black down.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:33.840]   Like here's what you would be getting if you weren't such a cheapskate.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:39.160]   Or I'm going to do what I do next, which is go too far.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:42.560]   But the problem here is that is the people in the content business think all of their
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.560]   value is in the content.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:48.020]   And I argue that they're not even in the content business that that content's a tool
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:49.180]   to build relationships.
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:51.000]   There's other value to be had there.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.480]   But that's heresy in my world.
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:57.680]   In my world, no, we make good content and people should pay for that content.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:02.480]   So my fear about the Google wallet thing is that it's going to lead the mestray just
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:05.000]   as tablets led the mestray to think, oh, good.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.040]   Now we can make a magazine again.
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:10.640]   And they have to read in the order that we say and let these damn links.
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:12.480]   Well, let them be lettuce, Trey.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.520]   The quicker they let us stray and the quicker they realize the failure of that, the quicker
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:17.760]   they'll move on to something else.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.160]   Well, we do have this way.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.160]   They don't have to.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.200]   They don't have the fantasy that, gosh, if there were only some way we could immediately
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.560]   easily charge for it.
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.480]   I don't think we've mentioned this on the show, but two weeks ago, Murdoch, who had
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:32.040]   called, he and his minions had called Google parasites and all kinds of awful things.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:37.000]   And he pulled times of London content off of Google news.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.680]   And I believe Google search as well.
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:41.680]   And they came back on hands and he's an asked for it to go back.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:42.760]   We did mention that last week.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:43.760]   And I that's victory.
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.760]   You declared victory.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:46.760]   Okay.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:47.760]   Sorry.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.760]   I can't remember.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:49.760]   That's aged.
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:50.760]   You'll find this out.
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.760]   But that's why it's good for them to try this.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:57.240]   And the interim, the rengnam between these new media and people need to figure it out
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:58.240]   and let them figure it.
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:02.160]   If Google gives them a way to do it and it doesn't work, then they can say, hey, we
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.160]   tried it.
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.280]   I don't want them to fantasize that we could do it.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.040]   No, no, that's a point.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.720]   And for in this example, this peach pit, you know, an ebook kind of example is actually
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.720]   a pretty good example.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:17.240]   I mean, when I did the wavebook, you know, we did the, we did the site where all the
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.180]   whole book was basically available for free.
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:22.540]   That's just something that maybe I would have done said, hey, support the project.
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:23.540]   Give 99 cents.
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:29.440]   Yeah, I get a more, not all ads, not all content should be ad supported.
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:32.040]   Is that what you're advocating, Jeff free, free media?
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:37.100]   No, not should be just saying that that what people forget when it comes to charging people
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.780]   is that it also brings a marketing cost to bring the customer service cost.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.940]   It's not this, this Valhalla.
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:43.940]   Right.
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:49.140]   That says that, oh, if only it still spent this money because the fundamental economic
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:53.580]   economics have changed, we're in an abundance economy, not a scarcity economy anymore.
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:55.740]   And media people don't have pricing power.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:00.540]   Yeah, I don't want to see, you know, an ad for taco hut in my movies in the middle of
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:01.540]   a movie.
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:07.620]   I hope you've enjoyed the first half of the equivalent is you watch 10 minutes of twig
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:10.780]   and then it says, Oh, would you like to see the rest just?
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:12.980]   Yeah, that makes me bark a little bit.
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:13.980]   That makes me not happy.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:17.780]   Well, I've been on an airplane where you see the first five minutes of a movie and then
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:21.460]   the sign comes up and says, Hey, if you want to see the rest of the swipe your car, there's
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:22.940]   something there is something bad about that.
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:27.180]   It feels like it feels like they tricked you a little bit like teasing you.
[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:32.740]   Plus like a girl who wears a low cut shirt, you know, come on.
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:37.380]   No, I mean, I mean, is that an an apt, an apt, an apt, an apt.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.340]   I hear you.
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:44.420]   It's like when the crack dealer gives you your first pipe free.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:49.420]   How about that?
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:50.540]   I know I shouldn't have said it.
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:56.300]   But that's by the way, the only reason I said that is because I feel the same way in both
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:59.460]   circumstances.
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:00.460]   I'm pulling up my shirt.
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:02.500]   No, I mean, it's like, you know, a tee.
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:03.500]   It's a tease.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.860]   It's like, look what we got.
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:10.180]   Oh, but you can't have it unless you really happen is then you'll start to change the
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.180]   way you create the content.
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:16.740]   So let's say you had that 10 minute wall in twig at nine minutes, 30, we'd start doing
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.380]   the really good stuff.
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:19.380]   Yeah.
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:21.620]   As opposed to now, we don't.
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.100]   We just do a lot of crap up front.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.100]   Right.
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:27.700]   We talk about our kids and then we'd be like, okay, big, big Google news.
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.660]   Anybody like that?
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:30.660]   Here.
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.660]   You know what it is?
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:32.660]   It's this.
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:33.660]   It's the hand that give me it.
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:35.460]   I don't like that.
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:39.660]   For those of you watching, listening, not watching, I'm holding out my hand saying, give me money.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:40.660]   I don't like that.
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:41.660]   She got to pay.
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:43.340]   Yeah, I don't like that.
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:45.260]   It should be upfront or nothing.
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:49.380]   Either it's ad supported free media or we tell you upfront, Hey, this is 99 cents or
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:52.420]   you have to subscribe and then we'll give it to you.
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.420]   But that's just me.
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:54.420]   That's just fine.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.420]   I'm fine with it.
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:56.420]   It is.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.420]   I think that's fine.
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:58.580]   I think there are uses for it.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:00.100]   There'll be very good uses for it.
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:06.880]   My only fear is the delusion that it will bring to some old media companies, but as an
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.180]   alternative in a model, holy.
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:13.900]   I mean, Leo, do you feel the same way about like you're not purchases?
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:14.900]   Yes.
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.700]   So I'm playing this Simpsons game.
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:19.540]   Gosh darn it.
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:21.180]   I should never have gotten started.
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.820]   So I got rid of we rule, right?
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.580]   But the Simpsons game, it's got the Simpsons in it.
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:29.460]   And so I'm playing this game and you know, it's free, right?
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:34.780]   It's from electronic arts and you and you read and so Homer has destroyed Springfield
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.100]   and you're rebuilding it.
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:40.060]   It's just another it's farmville, but it's just with the Simpsons.
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:41.060]   So it's kind of funny.
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:45.620]   They get all the characters and they all talk and you and but to do anything really interesting,
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:50.420]   you know, I went to visit one of my friends cities and he's got all this stuff.
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:53.220]   He's got a burning tire yard.
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.420]   He's got a nuclear power plant about to explode.
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:58.260]   I'm so jealous because he bought donuts.
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.540]   There's a donut store, right?
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:06.860]   Now I try to play by the way, donuts are not cheap, a boatload, twenty four hundred donuts,
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:07.860]   a hundred bucks.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:08.860]   No.
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:10.180]   Well, you could spend that much.
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.180]   You don't have to.
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:16.340]   I mean, the lowest amount is you could spend two dollars, but you only get a dozen donuts.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:18.180]   So and everything.
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.860]   So the problem is this is a kind of an addictive compelling game.
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:27.380]   It's pretty fun, but really to get anywhere at any decent speed, you have to spend cash.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.900]   This is the fall of Western simple.
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:31.620]   I agree, which part?
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:34.180]   This is a really effective marketing technique.
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:35.700]   Do you want to buy those donuts?
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.220]   This spending a hundred dollars on fake donuts.
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:39.740]   That's what Zinga, that's what built Zinga.
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:40.740]   I know.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:41.740]   Exactly.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:45.060]   And I don't know why it's crashing because it's such a good model.
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:51.140]   It's got me suckered in and they add the social guilt component because your friends
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:52.180]   are playing with you.
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:53.180]   You can't withdraw.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:55.060]   I don't know how I got suckered in again.
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:58.620]   I was, you know, I was able to get out of We Rule, which was a very similar game on
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:02.580]   the iPad because it was right about when the Rapture was coming.
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:05.940]   So I just raptured everybody out of my farm and I wrote a big rapture.
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.500]   And that actually got me out of the game.
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.820]   So we'll have to engineer another end of.
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:14.020]   Oh, December 21st, I'm saved the Mayan calendar.
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:15.020]   There you go.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:16.660]   So I'll be out of this game in December.
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:17.660]   2012.
[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:19.620]   All right, let me buy some donuts.
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:23.700]   Now, you feel about a Leo?
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:24.700]   It totally works.
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:25.700]   It works.
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:26.700]   It works.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:36.220]   Just saying Google Chrome exploit fetches Pinkie Pie at $60,000 payday.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.820]   I always wanted to say that.
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:44.700]   Pinky Pie during the Ponyam competition in March.
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:52.380]   It was he pwned or she pwned this computer and displayed the pinkie pie image and using
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:59.420]   a Chrome exploit exploit and a fix was released within 12 hours of the exploit.
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:03.900]   And this is why Google gives Pinkie Pie $60,000.
[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:05.180]   She's a he.
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:06.180]   It's a he apparently.
[01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:08.780]   Yeah, and this is the second time.
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:09.980]   This is the second time.
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:10.980]   Yeah.
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:11.980]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:14.820]   So I think Jeff asked at one point, you know, could you make a living just just?
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:15.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:16.820]   Ask Dan Kaminsky.
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:17.820]   This is your 60 grand.
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:18.820]   That's pretty good.
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:19.820]   Yeah.
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.120]   This is salary.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:29.300]   So it was Tuesday, the hack in the box 2012 security conference in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:34.500]   was a second installment of Ponyam and Pinkie Pie again, exploiting two vulnerabilities
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:39.060]   in Chrome, the first against the scalable vector graphics functions in the WebKit browser
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:40.060]   engine.
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.780]   So it's not Google's fault.
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:45.380]   And then the second.
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:48.460]   Oh, interesting.
[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:51.600]   Pinkie Pie encountered a predicament.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.640]   It's so tempting to alliterate the whole article at this point.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:58.160]   I'm impressed that Dan Godin writing in ours technique.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:02.880]   I did not, although I would have tried all P's.
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:09.200]   Pinkie Pie's predicament is growing increasingly common among software exploiters, a security
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:15.280]   sandbox, quarantined the HTML and other kinds of browser content.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:24.360]   And Chrome had one, so all he could do was crash the machine, but that was enough.
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:27.300]   So this is so they fixed it.
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.600]   So to work around this limitation, actually gain control of the system because you got
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.760]   a opponent.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:37.120]   If you want to own it, Pinkie Pie targeted a second bug in Chrome's inter-process communication
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.560]   layer.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:47.160]   And because this is Chrome code, it wasn't sandboxed and he got the $60,000 top prize.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:53.320]   Google says we'd like to thank Pinkie Pie for his hard work in assembling another great
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.880]   podium submission.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:57.880]   That's so great.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.240]   What's your, you must have a hacker handle, Gina.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.720]   Oh, come on.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.440]   I tell you, but then I have to kill you.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.440]   Okay.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:05.920]   I could be Pinkie Pie.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.760]   Nobody you could be Pinkie Pie.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.400]   I already discussed my distaste for Pinkie Pie.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.400]   Edda is Pinkie Pie.
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.400]   Exactly.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.400]   Edda is Pinkie Pie.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:21.560]   Yeah, she came out with a get-a-count, a get-a-count.
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:28.440]   We mentioned a few months ago the Google artificial intelligence neural network that
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:30.560]   was able to recognize a cat face.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.560]   Remember that?
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.560]   That was this past summer.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.120]   They're actually going to use it.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:41.780]   It's not just kind of some weird trick.
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:45.320]   They're going to use these neural networks to improve speech recognition.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:50.000]   So that's kind of cool.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.740]   Technology, you have both an Android.
[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:55.840]   I guess it's only an Android, right?
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:56.840]   Google doesn't.
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.320]   Oh no, they do that on the desktop in the browser too.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:01.820]   That's right.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:02.820]   Mm-hmm.
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:09.700]   So I guess they're using YouTube videos to increase the network's ability to recognize
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:10.700]   faces.
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.540]   10 million images from YouTube videos.
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:14.540]   It's incredible.
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:20.820]   I mean, with Google Voice, with YouTube, with all the inputs that Google has, there's
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:27.100]   so much potential for this to turn into, for this network to learn things.
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:31.820]   And I feel like this is all connected to Google now and to Google Glass.
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.900]   I guess all kind of has to happen on the fly.
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:36.300]   I feel like this technology is all sort of connected.
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:41.780]   This is, they're trying to get this into the little computer on your eyes so that it'll
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:44.580]   recognize people, that it'll behave the right way.
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.300]   It'll give you the information that you want.
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:52.660]   Are we going to look back 50 years from now and say, "Wow, we didn't see this coming."
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:57.020]   But when we throw all this data, this is big data.
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:04.060]   Because we're uploading 24 hours of videos every minute to YouTube, Google can take 16,000
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:08.940]   processors, 1,000 computers, and have them chew on all these images on YouTube and get
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.380]   smart.
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:15.980]   This is the essence of Yuri Milner's investment strategy is that he believes that you take
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:19.940]   artificial intelligence on top of this kind of huge amount of data.
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:21.100]   And God knows what comes.
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:22.100]   Big wants to be.
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.100]   Yeah.
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.420]   I got to go to the Strata conference.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.540]   That's the big data conference that Riley does.
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:30.500]   The other thing I've been saying to news people we're working with right now is we get so
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.380]   enamored we're talking about big data.
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:35.940]   And I have lots of people in the media business who need to start with small data.
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.940]   Like, where does this person live?
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:39.780]   What do they care about?
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:43.780]   No, well, they don't get some big database that will tell us everything we didn't know.
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:44.780]   No, no, no.
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:46.980]   You got to start and you didn't build a little bit at a time.
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:49.500]   Just because there's big data doesn't mean there can't be little data.
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.020]   Yeah, I know.
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:53.380]   Big data start from little data.
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:54.380]   That's what I'm telling them.
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.380]   Yeah.
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:56.380]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:57.380]   What to do with the data?
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:58.380]   I mean, you can collect the data.
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.860]   You can have access to the data, but it's figuring out what to do with it.
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:03.020]   And so you should start with the small stuff.
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:04.420]   And just having data is expensive.
[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:06.460]   Well, look, we're talking to Ms. Big Data.
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:08.620]   I mean, isn't that what ThinkUp really is all about?
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:13.340]   Yeah, I mean, ThinkUp definitely is about capturing data and figuring out what, you know,
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:16.340]   what use one side so you can get from it.
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:18.380]   And we're still really kind of figuring that out.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.380]   But yes.
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:20.380]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:24.460]   And that's what business intelligence BI is all about is you got all the data.
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:26.220]   How do you make sense of it?
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.220]   Mm-hmm.
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:32.940]   And then deliver in a pre-chewed Charlie way to the executive who's a moron, something
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:34.780]   that they actually can use.
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:37.060]   Right, right.
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:38.540]   Pre-chewed data.
[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:39.540]   Pre-chewed.
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.980]   That's kind of gross.
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:42.980]   Fast-decaded.
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:48.340]   Well, no, I would only say we digested it and we came up with this.
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:52.220]   The problem is if chewing's better because if you digested, the end result is not kind
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.540]   of really what you want.
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:55.740]   Oh, too much poop in my life already.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:56.740]   That was bad.
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:00.740]   I'll tell you, put me off pumpkin pie for years.
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:01.740]   Oh.
[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:02.740]   Oh, man.
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:03.740]   This is bad.
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:04.740]   That was bad.
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:05.740]   That was bad.
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:06.740]   That was bad.
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:07.740]   That was bad.
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:08.740]   Oh.
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:17.700]   Uh, Facebook and Twitter may be asked by a great Britain to moderate their networks.
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:18.860]   You're just doing this to get me angry.
[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:19.860]   I am.
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.460]   I was just going to say, Jeff.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.620]   I put it in there for that purpose.
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:23.860]   So it's masochism.
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:32.060]   Yeah, there are a couple of cases that just occurred in the UK where people were jailed,
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:36.180]   fined for saying things that were offensive.
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:40.340]   And here we are right back into the discussion about speech again because if you start there
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:46.540]   with the idea that we're led by offense and it becomes that first government's job to
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:51.020]   then wash our mouths out with soap and to make us fearful of what we say.
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:55.500]   And then at the next step is that they say, well, this is too hard for us to do.
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:00.820]   We're going to make it your responsibility, Google and Facebook and Twitter, to monitor
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:04.100]   what the entire world says, then we're in a heck of a pickle.
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:08.380]   And this is why we have in the US, not only a First Amendment, but our version of an online
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:15.700]   section 230, which is what exempts a site from liability for things that others create
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:16.900]   on it.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:20.860]   But now this would turn around and it would make, you know, if Twitter is told that it
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:27.100]   could be sued for anything offensive said on it, then that's the end of its business.
[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:30.620]   So okay, well, that's two different things though.
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:33.300]   I mean, one thing is prosecuting people for things they say on Twitter.
[01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.700]   The other is prosecuting Twitter for things.
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:38.300]   That's where this is a one two step, right?
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:41.140]   Where we are right now is prosecuting people where they say on Twitter, which I think is
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:43.220]   bad enough and it's a huge problem.
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:46.180]   And it's a precedent that they're just not aware of what's happening.
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:49.860]   And judges aren't getting social media and aren't getting the idea that this is not publication,
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:51.100]   this is a conversation.
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:55.420]   This is the same as walking into your home and saying, ah, we just heard you say something
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:56.420]   offensive, right?
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:58.740]   And we're going to drag you off for it.
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:02.460]   Hello or well, where did you come from?
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:03.700]   So that's where it is now.
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:06.540]   But then the next step that's being discussed is well, government can't do that.
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:09.020]   So we're going to make Twitter do it.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:10.020]   Both are heinous.
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.980]   You know, I got a point out though.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:17.780]   I mean, as this happened in the UK, this guy, Azar Ahmed made a comment on Facebook after
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:21.900]   the death of British soldiers in Afghanistan, he said all soldiers should die and go to
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:22.900]   hell.
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:27.980]   If he if a guy named Azar Ahmed had said this in the United States, he'd be disappeared.
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:28.980]   He got in Britain.
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:31.980]   He got 240 hours of community service.
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:37.340]   But we in this country, to be serious about it, we would we are supposed to.
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:40.220]   I would stand up for his right to say that.
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:41.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:42.220]   And I do.
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:45.860]   But, but I think the NDAA allows him to disappear.
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:49.180]   And I suspect that would be, I think we don't hear about these stories.
[01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:50.620]   I think it's happening in the US.
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:55.340]   We just don't hear about it because they disappear.
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:56.340]   And I'm not being frivolous.
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:57.340]   I really don't think I know.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:01.220]   I think it's not, I think it's treated more seriously here.
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:05.420]   And I think that the, we know the NSA plans to monitor all electronic communications.
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:12.660]   They built that whopping great facility to do just that.
[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:15.460]   So it's not just the UK, I guess is my point.
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:18.060]   And we certainly need to be paying attention to this.
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:19.740]   It's depressing.
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:20.740]   It is depressing.
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:23.060]   But, and the other thing is, it said Facebook.
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.700]   Now Twitter is one thing because that's public.
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:26.500]   You're saying it out loud.
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:29.980]   But Facebook isn't he just saying it to his friends?
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:32.300]   Well it's some version of a public, right?
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:34.140]   It's some, some set of people.
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:35.140]   Yeah.
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:36.300]   Same with Google plus, right?
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:38.980]   I might say it to a group, but, but it that is.
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:40.580]   So how are they seeing it?
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:43.140]   Well, I mean, he could have some, you know, subscribers.
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:44.140]   He could have subscribers.
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:45.140]   It could be public, right?
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.140]   Twitter also, you know.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:47.140]   I'd like to know more about that actually.
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:52.260]   I'd like to know, for instance, if this was a public account, and a public posting or
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:53.260]   not.
[01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:54.260]   Right.
[01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:59.260]   And what's the difference between that and the end and Yahoo, I mean a user in China
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:03.060]   for saying something the Chinese government didn't like, right?
[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:07.500]   To make offensive the rule, well, it could be offensive to Chinese Orthodoxy.
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.220]   It could be offensive to some group in the UK.
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.900]   It could be offensive to the US government.
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.380]   I don't give a damn.
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:13.540]   It's just words.
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:14.540]   Yeah.
[01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:20.060]   And then this goes straight into the damn video.
[01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:24.860]   And into that idea that we have to recognize that we're going to get more and more speech.
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:27.820]   And if we can't figure out how to live with that, then we get a problem.
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:32.740]   You remember the couple who came to the United States, the British couple who came to the
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:39.540]   United States and they posted what they were going to dig up Marilyn Monroe or something
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:41.740]   like that.
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:44.700]   And then this kid, this kid, actually, this is pretty offensive, what he said.
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:49.900]   But he posted offensive comments on Facebook about a missing child.
[01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:53.980]   And he got 12 weeks of jail in the UK, which was terribly offensive.
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:56.980]   I will not question that, but does that worth jail?
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:57.980]   Is that what?
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.260]   How was society harmed by that?
[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:02.180]   Don't we all know he's a dork?
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:05.460]   Don't we all know he's ridiculous?
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:10.020]   He was originally arrested for his own safety about 50 people actually went to his house.
[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:13.420]   They were so upset.
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:16.860]   But wait a minute.
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:20.820]   I'll admit that I haven't, I didn't see the story and I'm trying to figure out what he,
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:23.740]   what exactly he said.
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:29.940]   These were actually charged him with child abduction because he was talking about a child
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:31.780]   abduction in an offensive way.
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:34.540]   That's going a little far.
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.540]   Yep.
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:40.740]   He said he did it in a bid to make people think his account been hacked.
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.620]   He'd been drinking at a friend's house.
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:43.620]   Oh, yay.
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:44.620]   He's an idiot.
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:45.620]   He's an idiot.
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:46.620]   Obviously he's an idiot.
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:47.620]   Yeah.
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:48.620]   We all know that.
[01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:53.660]   So we don't need the society to protect us from every idiot.
[01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:54.660]   Right.
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:55.660]   Yeah.
[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:59.700]   We're idiots because we can't tell who the idiots are.
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:00.700]   Yeah.
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:02.260]   Arruh.
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:05.020]   Let's take a break.
[01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:09.500]   I think, is there any other, just, there's so much more and I don't want to slight any
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.140]   story.
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:13.540]   Facebook is taste testing a want button.
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:14.540]   Oh boy.
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:17.660]   I want to do not like button.
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:18.900]   That would have solved that problem.
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:21.620]   Just everybody goes, do not like, do not like you.
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:22.620]   You're right.
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.340]   I am completely ambivalent about this piece of content.
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:26.340]   Yeah.
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:27.340]   I couldn't care less.
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:28.340]   Don't bother me anymore.
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:32.100]   I couldn't care less button.
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:35.780]   Did you, have you played the Facebook chairs commercial?
[01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:37.060]   Let's play it.
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:44.420]   The things that connect us, chairs, doorbells, bridges and airplanes according to Facebook.
[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:48.380]   So we're all sitting on our collective United States porches.
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:51.300]   They're all sitting on the chair.
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:54.220]   Chairs are made so that people can sit down and take a break.
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:55.220]   All over the world.
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:57.260]   Anyone can sit on a chair.
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:01.700]   And if the chair is large enough, they can sit down together.
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:05.940]   They can tell jokes or make up stories or just listen.
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:06.940]   What the hell?
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:07.940]   No.
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:10.220]   Chairs are for people.
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:12.940]   And that is why chairs are like Facebook.
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:13.940]   What?
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:14.940]   What?
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:18.980]   Doorbells, airplanes, bridges.
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.980]   These are things people use to get together so they can open up and connect.
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.660]   And they're like Facebook too?
[01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:25.660]   And music.
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.660]   And other things that people share.
[01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:28.660]   Yeah.
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:31.660]   Oh, this is weird.
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:32.660]   Facebook is love.
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:33.660]   It's just love.
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:34.660]   Basketball.
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:35.660]   A great nation.
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:37.660]   Are they going to show us on TV?
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:45.140]   A great nation is something people build so they can have a place where they belong.
[01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:46.620]   That's like Facebook.
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:47.620]   The universe.
[01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:48.620]   It's like Facebook.
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:49.620]   It's fast and dark.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:50.620]   Like Facebook.
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:53.140]   And makes us wonder if we are alone.
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:54.140]   Like Facebook.
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:55.140]   What the hell?
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:20:01.300]   So maybe the reason we make all of these things is to remind ourselves that we are
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:02.300]   not.
[01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:03.300]   Oh, no.
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:05.860]   There's, I don't know if you want to play it, Leo.
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:06.860]   There's a parody.
[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:07.860]   If you look it up.
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:08.860]   Oh, boy.
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:09.860]   Like a toilet.
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:10.860]   Oh, okay.
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:11.860]   All right.
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:16.020]   I don't know if there's actually quite a few parodies.
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:19.100]   This kind of this kind of begged beg to be paradise.
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:21.620]   In fact, it might be a parody of itself.
[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:22.620]   Exactly.
[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:24.260]   The parody is now redundant.
[01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:25.260]   Yeah.
[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:26.260]   That is that is just wild.
[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:27.260]   All right.
[01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:30.980]   I have to skip this Chicago fire ad.
[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:33.860]   Maybe the Facebook ad didn't have an ad on it.
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:38.020]   Now we're probably going to get pulled from Google because this is.
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:42.020]   Toilets are made so that people can sit down and take a shot.
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:43.020]   Sorry.
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:45.980]   Anyone can sit on a toilet.
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:48.860]   They're sitting on a toilet together.
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:52.660]   She's on it with him and they're laughing.
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:54.860]   Toilets are like Facebook.
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:21:01.580]   Okay.
[01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:03.300]   Doki.
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:05.820]   For breeze is like Facebook.
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:06.820]   Wow.
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:07.820]   Okay.
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:08.820]   Wow.

[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:10.820]   Sorry.
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:12.220]   I forgot that was an.
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:14.020]   Oh, come on.
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:15.020]   So great.
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:16.020]   So great.
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:18.140]   I think we've gone.
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:22.060]   This episode has just really gone from everything.
[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:23.500]   We've run the gamut.
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:24.500]   Yeah.
[01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:25.500]   We've been going back for some reason.
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.660]   From poop to low cut shirts.
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:28.660]   Yeah.
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:29.660]   That's our like Facebook.

[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:31.660]   Loca.
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:33.420]   Everybody seems to think that was a very offensive thing to say.
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:34.420]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:40.580]   I'm just I guess I'm a I'm a sexist pig, but I just to me.
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:44.420]   I didn't say a woman in a low cut shirt.
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:49.380]   It could be a guy with a little corneux chain around his neck.
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:51.740]   Somebody take the shovel away from the poor man.
[01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:52.740]   Yeah.
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:53.740]   Yeah.
[01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:54.740]   It's okay.
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:55.740]   It's okay, Leo.
[01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:56.740]   You're you're okay.
[01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:57.740]   You're okay.

[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:00.140]   I'm so sorry.
[01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:03.500]   I just want you to know it's because I'm like Facebook.
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.500]   It's because you're like Facebook.
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:08.500]   The old is like Facebook.
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:09.500]   Oh, okay.
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:10.500]   Jack room.
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.500]   Make a bet.
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:12.500]   I think there's a video there somewhere.
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:13.500]   We're going to take a break.
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.260]   When we come back, we will get our.
[01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:17.260]   Tip.
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:18.940]   If we haven't given away all our tips.
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:19.940]   I remember.
[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:20.940]   We got one more.
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:21.940]   We got one more.
[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:22.940]   We have our tip tool apology and number of the week.
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:23.940]   I apologize.
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:26.900]   You know, that's what I should do.
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:31.140]   Maybe every week this should be the place where I take some time to apologize for the
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:32.140]   way I am.
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:35.260]   The show brought to you by stamps.com.

[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:40.780]   They're making it possible for you never to go to the post office again.
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:41.780]   And guess what?
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:43.140]   The post office likes it.
[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:44.140]   They like it.

[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:49.900]   Sorry to say US postage.
[01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:50.900]   This is US only.
[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:54.620]   You got to ask your federal government for something like this.
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:56.140]   You should because it's great.
[01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:59.260]   You print official US postage with your computer, your printer.
[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:02.020]   You don't need a postage meter.

[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:12.580]   So just bear with me for a second.
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:17.180]   So you've written a document and you've bolded a bunch of headers or you've italicized and
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:19.700]   block quotes and throughout the entire thing.
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:22.300]   And then you decided, you know what, I want to change the way my headers look.
[01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:23.300]   I want to change the font.
[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:26.540]   I want to make it bold instead of italic or vice versa.
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:31.620]   You can select text and then from the context menu say select matching text.
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:35.540]   You can reformat all the text whose formatting matches.
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:40.940]   It's kind of deep and crazy, but it sounds, I mean it's really, really neat little trick
[01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:44.460]   when you've got long documents that are formatted and you've got headers and things that
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:45.460]   are different from it.
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:46.460]   It's kind of cool.
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:48.460]   That's Microsoft Office quality stuff.
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:49.460]   It is.
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:51.380]   That's Microsoft Office level feature right there.
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:54.220]   I always think about Google Docs as sort of the light version.
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:55.220]   That's pretty cool.
[01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:58.740]   So you can switch up your formatting throughout your document really quickly by just applying
[01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:04.500]   changes across, you know, selected text that all has the same format.
[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:05.500]   Very nice.
[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:06.620]   Very nice feature.
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:08.460]   Your number of the week, my friend.
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:12.180]   Well we, a couple of them, we did have 10 million tweets during the debate last week, most
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:16.300]   of which the girls like me say, oh no, but we'll go past that.
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:24.380]   And most of the tweets were aimed at Obama saying, wake up, wake up.
[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:25.380]   Look at us.
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.220]   Wake up.
[01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:31.420]   You know, somebody was telling me though that their tweets stream and I didn't see, I didn't
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:34.900]   watch the debate, but that they were watching the tweets and they were getting sponsored
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:39.860]   bit Romney posts saying, here's an extra link, here's some more information throughout the
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:43.500]   debate, which I thought was a very interesting way to use sponsored tweets.
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:50.020]   But I believe I heard that the PBS bought big bird sponsored tweets, but I'm not sure.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:52.020]   That would be a good idea.
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:54.020]   I'm pixelated.
[01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:55.020]   God knows why.
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:56.780]   Well, it's probably us.
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:00.580]   I'm downloading a lot of mail right now.
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:03.540]   So Gizmodo has a whole bunch of crazy Facebook stats.
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:10.220]   In addition to their huge number of members now, there are 1.13 trillion likes.
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:13.220]   100, this is what I like.
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:14.220]   All numbers.
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:16.700]   140.3 billion friend connections.
[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:20.260]   They're in lies the essence of Facebook.
[01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:23.740]   219 billion photos.
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:27.300]   I found it interesting that the median age, I thought Facebook had grown up and gotten
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:28.300]   all old.
[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:30.060]   The median age is still 22.
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:35.700]   And finally, of the 1 billion members, there are 600 million mobile users, which is very
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:36.700]   impressive.
[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:38.820]   I am shocked at the median age number.
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:39.820]   I was too.
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:42.220]   I don't know that I don't know how.
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:43.980]   I thought Facebook was like the iPhone.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:45.620]   It was from mom and dad now.
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:46.620]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:48.460]   Yeah, I'm surprised by that too.
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:51.060]   But who knows who's joining in India?
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:53.020]   It could be 14 year olds.
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:54.020]   I don't know.
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:55.620]   Right.
[01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:58.300]   It must be because I think in the you don't you get the sense in the you.
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:02.380]   I mean, everybody uses Facebook and kids in and grownups, but that means the median age
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:04.340]   would be older, I would think.
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:05.340]   Right.
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:08.620]   Especially since you can't join until you're 13.
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:09.620]   Right.
[01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:15.460]   But boy, it just feels like something that mostly is mostly used by adults to keep track
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:19.900]   of their high school sweetheart.
[01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:20.900]   There should be a phrase.
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:27.940]   Is there a phrase for nostalgic longing for your high school sweetheart?
[01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:31.460]   Like just me.
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:33.460]   That might be it.
[01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:36.180]   That might be the phrase.
[01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:38.100]   The Germans have a word for it, I'm sure.
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:39.100]   We just just, yeah.
[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:40.100]   Sure.
[01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:42.100]   There's something new with a prom night.
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:48.940]   Dr. Mom says it's called senility, Leo.
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:52.860]   But I do say, I really do think that that's a lot of what Facebook is used for.
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:54.340]   Say, where are they now?
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:56.940]   Oh, I really miss, you know, I really liked her.
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:29:01.060]   What I wonder would have happened if, you know, we've, I don't know.
[01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:04.540]   I must be the mean one because I'm like, Oh, look, that one got fat.
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:05.540]   Yeah.
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:06.540]   What's going on?
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:08.820]   There is somebody's web 46 75 point.
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:12.220]   Yeah, there's a great Louis C K episode about that.
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:18.180]   He actually finds his old Facebook flame and she did get, she did get fat.
[01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:21.580]   It's actually, it's actually really that is such a good show.
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:22.580]   It is.
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:23.580]   It is.
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:24.580]   I'm sad.
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:25.580]   It's on hiatus.
[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:26.580]   It's so honest.
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:31.820]   Well, I don't know if I said this in the show before I found two old flames and they're
[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:32.820]   both lesbians.
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:33.820]   Some might see.
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:36.020]   No, you never said that.
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:38.020]   Jeff, I knew I liked you.
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:39.020]   That's good.
[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:41.020]   He likes lesbians.
[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:42.020]   Yeah.
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:46.020]   You can take that one way or you can get the hard stroke way, whichever.
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:51.020]   Well, there's a third way you could take it that you scared them off men forever.
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:54.020]   That's the, that's the third one.
[01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:58.020]   You know, the way that I take it, I find that a lot of the friend, like male friends that
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:01.020]   I have have had this experience where like at all girlfriend or something.
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:06.340]   And it's, I take it as that you're, you're, you're caring feminist.
[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:07.980]   That's how I take it.
[01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:11.700]   That might, that, that my people are attracted to.
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:16.940]   Oh, we've got a name for the show, by the way, Jeff Don Cornelius suggests we call this
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:19.700]   show, Jeff Jarvis, lesbian whisper.
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:23.980]   I prefer honorary lesbian.
[01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:24.980]   Honor, lesbian.
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:28.860]   And you guys are giving me a hard time because I said low cut shirt.
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:29.860]   That's nothing.
[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:38.740]   So I was talking about rooting and hacking my Galaxy S3.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:39.740]   And I've mentioned this before.
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:42.700]   This has been a pick before, but I just got to mention it again because people will always
[01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:43.700]   say, well, how do you do it?
[01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:44.700]   How do you do it?
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:48.180]   You should rooting your phone is almost, unless you're kind of motor roll a phone, it's
[01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:50.780]   almost really trivially easy.
[01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:55.100]   But you should, you got to look up the instructions for your phone specifically.
[01:30:55.100 --> 01:31:01.340]   But that's the hardest part about putting a firmware, a different firmware on your phone,
[01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:03.460]   because once it's rooted, sky's the limit.
[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:06.260]   And there's a couple of programs you absolutely have to get.
[01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:11.500]   So I'm not going to tell you how to root it because unfortunately it is, it is kind of,
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:12.980]   you know, specific to your phone.
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:15.540]   So just XDA developers are somewhere looking up.
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:18.460]   But once you've got it rooted, there are two programs you're absolutely going to want.
[01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:21.580]   In fact, by themselves, there are the reasons to root your phone.
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:26.780]   One is titanium backup, which backs up not only every application on your phone, but
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:28.500]   all the settings.
[01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:32.460]   So if you need to blow the phone out or you lose your phone or whatever, titanium backup
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:36.060]   will actually upload it to Dropbox for you automatically.
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:40.260]   And once it does that, you know, you never have to worry because you can restore your
[01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:46.820]   phone and its apps and its settings, all those settings, all the Google secondary password
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:49.060]   BS is all restored, which is very nice.
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:52.900]   So this by itself is a reason to root titanium backup.
[01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:54.660]   I think it's free.
[01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:57.860]   And then if you want the pro version, it's a couple of bucks.
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:01.820]   And then the other program that if you want to go to the next level and start putting
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:06.580]   some of the other custom firmware on there is ROM manager from clockwork mod.
[01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:09.540]   And I, you know, it gets better and better all the time.
[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:12.780]   Premium version worth it and I pay for it is $5.99.
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:16.300]   And it lets you basically, well, I'll show you real quickly.
[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:19.460]   Once you've got, once you've rooted your phone, by the way, it stays rooted.
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:24.820]   So I just blasted this phone back to the original Galaxy S3 software.
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:30.980]   But if I want to, I can go right to, here it is, right to clockwork mod and it makes
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:31.980]   it so easy.
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:34.220]   Do you, have you used this genie to root your phone or to?
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:35.220]   I haven't.
[01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:36.220]   I haven't.
[01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:39.660]   I've been trying to stay on this non-routing just to kind of have the regular experience.
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:40.660]   Well, this is tempting.
[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:43.780]   Yeah, I don't want to do touch was if you got a Nexus, you're fine, but I know, but I
[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:44.940]   have the Galaxy S3.
[01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:50.780]   So you can, you can go to the, all the ROMs, including the cyanogen mod nightly.
[01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:54.420]   If you really want to live on the bleeding edge, these are literally updated almost every
[01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:55.420]   single day.
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:58.020]   So the most recent one is October 10th.
[01:32:58.020 --> 01:32:59.380]   And this is how easy it is.
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:02.340]   By the way, they always read the, oh, this looks good at 4.12.
[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:03.340]   Very not.
[01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:04.340]   All right.
[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:05.340]   Let's do it.
[01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:06.340]   So I press download.
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:07.340]   Do you want the Google apps checkbox?
[01:33:07.340 --> 01:33:08.340]   Yes.
[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:11.500]   It's now going to download the, the, the, the ROM.
[01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:15.820]   Well, if you don't get a download area error, it will.
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:20.220]   And then you just reboot and install it and it couldn't be easier.
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:25.300]   So once you have, once you have rooted your phone, there's two things you should have.
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:27.460]   One is titanium backup because it's the best backup.
[01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:30.140]   It has to be root because it can't back up all those settings and stuff unless it's
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:31.420]   an administrator.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:35.180]   And then if you really want to live on the, and the edge, play with ROM manager and you
[01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:36.900]   can, you can get the jelly bean.
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:38.700]   You can do anything.
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:43.340]   A couple of tools that are handy for anybody who wants to hack their Android phone.
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:48.500]   Gina Trapani is the author of ThinkUp at ThinkUp.com.
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:52.500]   She's a part of expert labs along with Neil Dache.
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:53.940]   Is he your boss or your partner?
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:54.940]   He's my partner.
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:56.540]   We're actually not expert labs anymore.
[01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:57.540]   We're just ThinkUp.
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:58.540]   We incorporated in more partners.
[01:33:58.540 --> 01:33:59.540]   Yeah.
[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:00.540]   So co-founders.
[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:01.540]   Thank you.
[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:02.540]   Thank you.
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:03.540]   Yeah.
[01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:04.540]   That's great.
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:05.540]   Thank you.
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:06.540]   And of course, her blog is smartawear.org.
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.180]   Do you have baby pictures up on your blog?
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:09.180]   I don't yet.
[01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:10.420]   I have, I've been slacking.
[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:14.420]   I have to do the edda blog post, but I've been putting baby pictures up on Flickr.
[01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:15.420]   Good.
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:18.740]   But you do have to do.text there.
[01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:23.300]   And that's a really great text-based to-do list that's available on Android and iOS.
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:24.300]   Yes.
[01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:25.300]   Soon tablet enabled.
[01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:26.300]   Yes.
[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:27.300]   Soon tablet enabled.
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:28.300]   Yeah.
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:30.500]   In between feedings.
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:35.500]   They want me to do the cyanogen live.
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:38.420]   So I will start it now and we'll continue to triangulation.
[01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:42.500]   By the way, our guest will be throwboy, the guy who makes these great icon pillows, including
[01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:43.500]   our Twit pillow.
[01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:44.500]   It's interesting story.
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:46.100]   We'll talk to throwboy in just a bit.
[01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:48.420]   Yeah, I'll keep the rooting.
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:52.500]   I'll keep the, not the rooting, the ramming going.
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:59.100]   We're so close to getting our elemental that will make our streaming betta.
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:01.700]   I want you to look at our new Twit one of a kind.
[01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:07.700]   This is going to be offered for two more days and that'll be it.
[01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:11.620]   Teespring is the company doing these and they make really nice ones out of American
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:13.260]   Apparently Fruit of the Loom.
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:21.620]   T-E-E Spring.com/Twit for the, all the shows, all the 2012 season of Twit is on here.
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:23.420]   And so you, they're all memorial.
[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:26.260]   That's on the back and on the front, just a very subtle Twit.tv.
[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:31.180]   We've got all kinds of sizes, men's, women's, programmers, the whole thing.
[01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:34.460]   We've already sold 2,200 T-shirts, which is great.
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:36.980]   I didn't think we'd break a thousand.
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:39.500]   So that's two more days though.
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:43.580]   And as soon as we hit that deadline, that's when they print them.
[01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:44.580]   They're silkscreened.
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:47.180]   They're beautiful, really nice T-shirts.
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:48.540]   And so we haven't seen them yet.
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:50.020]   We'll all see them at the same time.
[01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:51.020]   They'll start shipping.
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:53.020]   I'm getting my credit card out as we do.
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:54.020]   Yeah, it's 20 bucks.
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:55.020]   It's worth it.
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:56.020]   It's a good cause.
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:57.020]   It helps us.
[01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:59.300]   I think we're going to do special one of a kind items every month.
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:01.140]   Won't be a T-shirt next time.
[01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:03.420]   And I'll let you know what the money's going to go to.
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:06.420]   In this case, we've raised enough money, I believe, for the elemental.
[01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:07.660]   So I'm very excited about that.
[01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:08.660]   Very cool.
[01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:09.660]   I'm checking out with it though.
[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:11.980]   I think a Twit fleece would be nice.
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:13.500]   We are talking with Scottie Vest.
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.860]   Absolutely, a Twit fleece would be great.
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:18.940]   We're also talking about hats, mugs.
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:19.940]   Yep.
[01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.940]   Anything you want, you let us know.
[01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:24.380]   I think we need a low cut top.
[01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:26.380]   A special Twit, low cut top.
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:28.900]   I'm going to do that.
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:31.900]   A special cleavage edition.
[01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:33.900]   You're the Leo.
[01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:35.900]   Sorry, Leo.
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:38.900]   I had to catch you.
[01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:43.300]   Jeff Jarvis does his thing at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:44.940]   He's also a professor of journalism.
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:48.540]   If you're lucky enough to go to the City University of New York, take a class from
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:51.940]   a guy who knows a little bit about that stuff.
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:56.940]   And he joins us along with Gina every week to talk about Google on this week in Google.
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:37:01.140]   On Tuesday, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:05.540]   Right now, that's 2000 UTC, but we're going to have a time zone change pretty soon.
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:08.420]   Summer time's going to end pretty soon, so that'll change.
[01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:12.180]   But right now, you can watch it at 2000 UTC on Twit.tv.
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:15.820]   And if you don't get to watch live, no sweat, no fear, no problem.
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:21.980]   All you got to do is download audio or video after the fact that Twit.tv/twit.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:24.300]   Thanks for being here.
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:26.300]   And I will see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:36.300]   [MUSIC]
[01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:59.220]   (silence)
