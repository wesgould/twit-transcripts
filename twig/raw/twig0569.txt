[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   It's time for Twig and what a great show we've got, Aunt Pruitt, Stacey Higginbotham,
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.520]   Jeff Jarvis, all kinds of crazy stuff to talk about.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.920]   Who really perpetrated the Twitter hack last week?
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.240]   Will Mark Zuckerberg make a deal with Donald Trump?
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.360]   The QAnon accounts on Twitter and their ban will talk about cameras
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.640]   because Google's camera wizard's going to Adobe and finally, smoked K so.

[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   Stacey again.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.200]   What's here for Stacey on IOT.com.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   Hello, y'all.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   You've got a bookshelf.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   You've got books.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   I have a plant.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   You've got a plant there.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.120]   I think she needs a boost.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.120]   We really, we...
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.120]   We've got stuff we've...
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.280]   Yeah, that's Jeff Jarvis by the way, Professor of Journalism at the Craig...
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.760]   And interior decorator.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.560]   Yeah, School of Journalism at the Townite Center.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.680]   He's the city of Risenier.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.680]   He's of course...
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.680]   What a kangaroo.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.920]   A stuffed kangaroo would fit nicely there.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.760]   We were looking at some tat-
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.760]   I didn't agree.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.760]   ...to be very me.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.880]   Although most of it was weird, Carsten sent along a rat with butterfly wings.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.000]   I didn't think that would really suit.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.720]   I thought the Bob Ross rat was excellent.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.640]   And then I sent a creature from my nightmares who does rival.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.600]   Which rivals spot for like striking terror into my heart?
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.760]   It was a frog taxidermy to frog with the teeth of a shark.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760]   And it...
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.760]   Yeah, pretty scary.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.760]   Was fantastic.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.760]   Where is it?
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.600]   Oh yeah, how about this?
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.920]   Would that be good?
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.320]   This is the most life-like dead animals anywhere, according to...
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.640]   Oh, I taxidermy.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.200]   Or poor Stacy, we ended last week's show for folks.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.200]   This is kind of her ratty.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.280]   I'll use it poor Stacy for needing to...
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.880]   ...to spruce things up for right by Skype room.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.960]   You know, we could just with a little Photoshop, frankly, just put that in.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.960]   We couldn't, yeah.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.960]   That's true.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.040]   I could have a different taxidermy animal each week.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.520]   All of this ends to change his mood color.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.120]   Oh, get chucked mounted.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.560]   This is ohhitaxidermy.com.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.080]   That's an-proit from Hands-On Photography, Hands-On Wellness.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.720]   And the reason that everybody's trying to look better is because look how good ant looks.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.960]   Look, look at that shark.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.480]   Just look at that shark.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.840]   Oh, thank you perfectly.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.840]   That's so cool.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.560]   The person didn't.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.560]   He don't need no taxidermy.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.120]   He don't need no stuffed animals.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.120]   I'm just thinking...
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.120]   I'm gonna change this.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.120]   I'm gonna change this.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.120]   I'm just thinking.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.120]   How about this Stacy?
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.120]   We could put this...
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.960]   I'm just thinking over Stacy's shoulder there.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.960]   Oh, perfect.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   Perfect.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   Oh, I love trash pandas.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.960]   Yes.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.600]   It's kind of a reclining trash panda.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.040]   He's got his chin on the tree stump.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.760]   He's just kind of reflecting.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.400]   He's looking at it.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   Oh, yes.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.400]   Yeah, I've never heard that phrase.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.400]   I don't know.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.400]   A trash panda?
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.400]   No, never.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.120]   AKA a raccoon.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.840]   But he's a flying trash panda because there's no leg on the ground.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.480]   No, he's in the air.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.120]   He is definitely in the air.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.120]   That would be pretty good.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.520]   That would be a very tricky trash panda.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.680]   How about a badger?
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.680]   You want a badger?
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.680]   No.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.240]   I mean, that's a good reporter emblem.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.240]   I will be honest.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.240]   Yes, you are as true.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.200]   A tenacious as a badger.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.920]   I'm really liking the raccoon.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.920]   I think so.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.480]   I don't think you want a lion.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.720]   No, I was looking at an alligator.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.360]   There's some caemans that were kind of upright.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.520]   And I was like, oh, that gives me both height and it's kind of a skinny spot.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.680]   So you don't have a lot of animal room.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.840]   These people also offer to yourself bird matting kit if you want to.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.840]   Does there have prices?
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.480]   Does there have prices on the trash panda?
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.480]   Let's see here.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.480]   Price.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.480]   Let's hope.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.480]   This is posted in 2016.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.640]   I'm going to zoom in on this here.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.960]   The envelope badger is 550 to 900.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.960]   Oh, shoulder mount versus full mount.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.320]   You want a full mount, I think.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.240]   If you wanted to showcase the entire.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.960]   The entire aminal.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.520]   That all sounds quite competitive on the pricing.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.520]   I think it's very good.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.880]   I mean, that's a lot of work to make those.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.880]   The bus cocks.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.120]   A damn, the bus cocks.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.440]   I want a whole bus cocks.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.800]   Javelina with an open mouth, a big horn, a wolf, bobcat bison caribou.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.680]   You just have a cow.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.000]   I feel like I must-- oh, I'm not going to have a rundown of it.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.720]   No wonder I'm feeling so lost.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.840]   Not that we're talking about Google yet, but--
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.200]   I'm not even close.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   We're not.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   We're not.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   I was googling to get to these animals.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.440]   Honestly, maybe it's just me.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.520]   I don't think-- I can't get excited about anything on this thing.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.520]   We were--
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.680]   It was actually-- I was excited last week, because right in the middle
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.720]   of the show, the big Twitter hack happens.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.960]   Boy, yeah, that was news.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.120]   And by the way, I was off for 24 hours.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.080]   Because--
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.440]   Who is still off?
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.680]   Who?
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.960]   Lori Gilles, iMore.com, is still off.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.960]   So is Cracbury.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.960]   Because-- and this is a classic story.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.920]   They were very early.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.800]   Their IT department immediately saw the first finance hack.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.320]   And Crac, that it was going to go--
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.520]   I guess they saw a couple of people.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.920]   And they somehow understood that it must be blue checks.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.360]   So they immediately changed all their passwords.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.080]   I just was the worst thing they could do.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.160]   While we were on the show last week--
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.560]   I'm fortunate.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.520]   I changed the password.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.600]   And so when everybody else came back, I was back.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.000]   I had to go to an executive.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.440]   It was a job this was not, but it was very nice.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.880]   I don't want to say who it was, because everybody
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.640]   would go to him and they'd think they have a Twitter problem.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.440]   But he was very nice.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.400]   And he got me up.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.440]   But I had to go through a couple steps to get back up,
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.840]   because obviously it turned a flag.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.360]   It's not because you're a QAnon conspiracy theorist.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.040]   Well, let's talk about that.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.040]   I want to--
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.320]   All right, let me finish the video.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:44.840]   He's driving away.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.440]   By the way, Gilenn Maxwell--
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.240]   see, her father-- I met her.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.560]   Her father had very close Russian connections.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.480]   It was presumed to be a Russian spy.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.400]   So I don't know if you could blame a conspiracy theorist.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:56.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.680]   You pronounce G-H-I-S-L-I-N-E--
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.280]   Glenn.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.760]   --as Glenn?
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.600]   Glenn, Glenn.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   Glenn.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.800]   I heard it from her father.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.240]   It's like Chavon.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.040]   It's like one of those weird Irish--
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.840]   --long.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:18.320]   And then Barr's father, of course, hired Epstein's
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.800]   to teach at the college.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.680]   And Maxwell has ties to the Israeli and Russian mobs
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.960]   to her father.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.440]   And yeah, I could do conspiracy theorists.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.520]   There's a lot of threads on that one, boy.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.520]   Oh, are there--
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.320]   They're pulling because the whole sweatler--
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.760]   sweater will fall apart.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.640]   But just to co-full circle on the Twitter attack,
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.360]   the New York Times did some, I think,
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.400]   intrepid reporting unless it proves that at some point
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   that they were taken for a ride.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.240]   But they, I think, did a pretty good job of verifying
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.600]   that they were getting from people actually at the scene,
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.960]   the story of what happened.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.480]   And they did this very quickly.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.320]   This was only a couple of days later.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:09.040]   And they were able to finger a user named Kirk,
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.840]   a user named Kirk, who claimed at the time
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.400]   that he worked at the Twitter, which would sort of make sense.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.720]   Except that it turned out he didn't work for Twitter.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.520]   He, in fact, did have access, though,
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.040]   to something that only Twitter employees should have access
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.000]   to the God account, the God dashboard that
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.440]   lets you do anything.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.520]   But the most, I think, dramatic part of this story--
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.840]   and again, they're getting this from people
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.960]   who are connected to the hack.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.200]   They match their social media and cryptocurrency accounts
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.080]   to accounts that were involved.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.240]   The people that they were talking to also presented screenshots
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.720]   and other corroborating evidence, logs and discord,
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.200]   so and so forth.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.880]   So there's some reason to believe this story.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.760]   But boy, this is-- if you're Twitter,
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.680]   and they've not admitted to this or said anything about it,
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.000]   this is the thing that is the most damning for Twitter.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.720]   It turns out, no, Kirk didn't, in fact, work at Twitter.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.680]   But he did get access to the God mode,
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:16.840]   because apparently, Twitter had put the credentials
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.480]   for the administrator console, imping them, in fact,
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.040]   in their internal Slack messaging channel.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.920]   Oh, that's smart.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.600]   That's not Wino.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.400]   Not Wino.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   And that's true.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.880]   That's Stacy's perfect expert.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.400]   And that's all that had to be hacked, really, was that Slack,
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.040]   and that gave him access to all those accounts.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.880]   Still, I think this kind of the unknown, which was--
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.640]   is Kirk really Vladimir, and were the spammy,
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.120]   and probably not very lucrative, messages,
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.720]   just a misdirection while he did other things,
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.680]   because he certainly could have done other things.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.760]   Twitter says, only the DMs of eight accounts were downloaded,
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.720]   and all eight were unverified.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.560]   But they won't say what they--
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.560]   Oh, well.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.080]   --were--
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:09.560]   No, please.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.440]   --if it's not blue-checked, who cares about that.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.000]   Yeah, we don't care about that.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.800]   When all this stuff--
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.480]   Not the peons.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.240]   When all this stuff was going down,
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.160]   I had reached out to our friend Dan Patterson,
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.240]   because he covers a lot of the security stuff.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.240]   And the first thing he said to me,
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.840]   he's like, this can't be the end game.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.440]   This is more than likely misdirection just to--
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.520]   That's certainly tempting, isn't it?
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.360]   That's something tempting.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.080]   Dan will be on Twitter on Sunday, by the way.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.840]   So we'll all ask him.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.400]   Oh, he will.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:38.900]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.400]   Sweet.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:39.900]   He didn't tell me.
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.840]   And I just talked to him a few minutes ago.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.480]   He's hiding things from Aunt.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.480]   Well, he figured you would know, because you're there.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.720]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.680]   Dan, of course, works for CBS.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.180]   He's great.
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.280]   CBS News.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:53.780]   Yes.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.040]   Go ahead, Stacy.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.520]   Oh, no.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.240]   I was going to say, if you have to think suspiciously,
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.600]   like, OK, this could have been something, you know,
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.840]   the 12-dimensional chess, whatever,
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.080]   how many dimensions of chess you want?
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.680]   As many as you want, basically.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.040]   But I've also kind of like--
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.080]   after reading the New York Times story, I was like,
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.760]   oh, these are a bunch of stupid kids.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.280]   They're kids.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.120]   Just having fun.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.440]   And they may have just stolen their friends' accounts
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.480]   credentials just to see if they were talking about them.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.560]   And that's not implausible.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.800]   It would be stupid for you to plan for that.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.000]   Right.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.080]   So if it--
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.800]   Kirk, if that's who we're talking about--
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.720]   didn't get a lot of money.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.120]   If you watch the account, you can't really judge,
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.360]   because hackers typically will put money into and out
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.000]   of accounts in such a way that you can't really
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.920]   be sure how much money they're making.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.800]   But we do have one source, Binance, which
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.520]   is a Bitcoin exchange.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.200]   Binance said, as soon as we saw that address, we blocked it.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.440]   And we were able to block more than a quarter million dollar
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.680]   transactions.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.960]   So a lot of people wanted to put money in.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.640]   Idiots.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.640]   Idiots.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:13.440]   You know, so it wasn't a super lucrative hack.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:20.640]   It's like you have the keys to Disneyland.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:26.320]   And all you decide to do is ride the train around in a circle.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.200]   It seems like they could have done more.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.440]   Well, if there were--
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.360]   I feel like if you were a state actor that
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.000]   had the ability to have those credentials and that access,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.240]   you wouldn't blow it.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.040]   You would do anything.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:40.720]   It's stupid.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.600]   You would do anything.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.400]   You wouldn't do what you did, right?
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.840]   So that's why I'm like, maybe it's misdirection,
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.800]   but it kind of looks like just a bunch of--
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.120]   Unless you're a state actor that's
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.840]   had access for a long, long, long, long time,
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.160]   and now you just want to blow it up,
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.640]   but even that doesn't make sense.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.120]   You do not.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.600]   And why would you blow it up now?
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.760]   Right in the election.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.640]   Right.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.520]   Right.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.320]   Yeah, you know.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:02.760]   Election.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.760]   I think maybe the surface reading is just the right reading.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.840]   So how did they get--
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.760]   So they say it was social.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.320]   Did they pay off somebody inside Twitter?
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.840]   Is there any thought of that still?
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.560]   That's not clear.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.320]   But it could be-- all Kirk really needed
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.480]   was the access to the Slack channel.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.320]   So it could be--
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.480]   He got some Twitter guy drunk.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.720]   And he didn't think-- the Twitter guy didn't think
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.080]   he was giving him anything particularly.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.960]   He said, yeah, you can come in our Slack.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.840]   Hang out with us maybe.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.680]   That's not like saying, hey, dude, I'll give you 100 bucks
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.880]   if you give me God mode.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.760]   That's a little lower level, but it turns out
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.280]   it was giving him God mode.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.600]   So I don't know.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.960]   Twitter says it's an active investigation,
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.400]   so they wouldn't comment to the times.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.120]   And we haven't heard much since.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.400]   I was worried about the social engineering
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:00.160]   at a company like this that supposedly should be sort of--
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.240]   in tune with no one that they could be socially
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.080]   engineered at any point in time just because of wording work.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.560]   Well, you would think that it was a lot of training.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.200]   Has it had been socially engineered in the past?
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.480]   Two times.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.520]   One, a contractor on leaving in 2017,
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.800]   deleting Trump's account.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.240]   That was fixed quickly.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.640]   Oh, yeah, I remember that.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.200]   Dorsy was hacked quite notably.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.560]   SimSwap so long ago.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.360]   But he was SimSwap, which was interesting because it's
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.800]   a SimSwap gang.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.200]   Another SimSwap were the same.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.080]   I don't know that started this.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.400]   They do the SimSwap with an eye to getting the OG Twitter
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.360]   handles like @Y or @6.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.720]   Makes me glad I didn't take @Leo way back when, which I could
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.000]   have.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.200]   It was available, but I was at Leo.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.720]   Because those, they go after those quite actively.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.840]   You don't want a short Twitter handle.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.880]   Like @PoreAtMat.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.040]   Yeah, @PoreAtMat.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.880]   And he doesn't even have two T's on his, right?
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.040]   So it's really short.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.720]   It was like, I think that makes it even better.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.520]   I do have a beef with one of the stories that went out that
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.640]   said Twitter was better now that they verified accounts.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.000]   Could he tweet?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.640]   Yeah, that was a little snarky.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.960]   You're right.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.480]   You're right.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.720]   It was just a different for Star.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.320]   I say that.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.520]   I understood it.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.920]   Because it was back to the people.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.120]   I honestly think Twitter was better
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.920]   before the celebrities and the big brands arrived.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.960]   Twitter was really cool when it was--
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.320]   That's when you were the biggest celebrity.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.720]   When I was number one.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.000]   OK.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.400]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.360]   I'm looking at three verifies right now on the panel.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.720]   I want to see what you are all are saying on Twitter.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.920]   I know that you can use it as a marketing platform
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.040]   and things of that nature.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.000]   But most of the time, I'm looking for you three
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.480]   for information for just general conversation.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.720]   Because in my eyes, you are regular people that just
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.360]   happen to have a blue check.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.600]   So for them to just throw that blanket statement out there
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.120]   is like, oh, the blue checks are gone.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.720]   So Twitter is much better.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.640]   That's cool.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.920]   Because there are plenty of good blue checks out there
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.520]   providing good content.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.680]   I agree.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.520]   Like my dreams.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.040]   It's the nicest person on the internet.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.840]   Isn't he way too nice?
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.760]   I don't know about all that.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.240]   Way too nice.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.120]   I've been angry the last couple of days, so maybe not.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.400]   Really?
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:33.920]   No.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.920]   Oh, and you should have a wig.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.320]   It'll make you feel better.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.040]   Well, I got the mannequin for a wig.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.240]   I'm just saying, you know, when life brings you down,
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:46.880]   you got a fluff up.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.680]   Grab a wig.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.360]   Are you fluffing up right now, Stacey?
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:52.920]   This is me.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.600]   I'm trying to be fluffy and happy.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.440]   I love it.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.480]   I love it.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.600]   She's just glowing.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:58.960]   More smiles.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.240]   You just need a trash panda behind you.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.000]   Then you'll be really happy.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.440]   Oh, man.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.240]   I just right over her left shoulder there.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.000]   That'd be so cool.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.720]   That'd be perfect.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.200]   Perfect.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:08.880]   Perfect there.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.800]   Just go right ready to claw.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.640]   Right.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.200]   I like that we all think that my taxidervied animals
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.320]   should have some sort of aggressive anti-happiness going on.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.240]   I think he uses a threat.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.000]   It's to me.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.400]   The real-ness behavior is screaming.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.520]   Oh, geez.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.320]   It is the closest to me, isn't it?
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:36.000]   Oh, I don't get my-- oh, launch trash panda button.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.240]   That's what I need.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.040]   And it'll just come out over the shoulder.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:39.560]   I'll just--
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.000]   I'll claw cubs out behind the screen.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.840]   It's good to give Karsten things to do.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.200]   Get him--
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.040]   Yes.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:45.600]   Get a trash.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.360]   He's on it now.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.360]   So let's talk about this QA thing.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.720]   Twitter banned 7,000 QAnon accounts.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:00.160]   This was-- I mean, Twitter's known about these forever.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.640]   They're going to classify QAnon, the conspiracy
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.560]   theory, as coordinated harmful activity because of a rise
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.880]   in harassment targeting high profile critics of the president.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.720]   Which is big definition of bad for quite a while, too.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:23.160]   But also 150,000 accounts will be affected.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.720]   Who knew there were that many QAnon accounts?
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.000]   It will stop recommending accounts and content
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.920]   related to QAnon.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.280]   But it's been doing that.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.280]   OK.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.200]   Maybe that's a good idea, Twitter.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.520]   And it will take steps to limit circulation of content
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.080]   in features like trends and search.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.920]   150,000 QAnon accounts are included in this.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.160]   But the thing is, folks, we can play whack-a-mole forever.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.520]   They're not going to go away.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.280]   What we have to do is learn as a society to ignore them.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.200]   Honestly, there's the tension.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.640]   You have to be quite a mush mind to fall into the QAnon.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.400]   Oh, there's a picture of a mush mind right there.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:05.840]   Who was--
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.800]   There are lots of mush minds.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.640]   And I would say, Jeff, no, you can't ignore them.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.280]   Some of these people are actively scary and hostile
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.840]   and represent in the physical world.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.560]   And as a woman, I would say to you,
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.080]   no, ignoring them is a bad strategy.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.320]   No, what I'm saying, Stacey--
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:21.820]   You're right.
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.120]   You're right.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.000]   You're absolutely right.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:23.600]   Absolutely.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:28.720]   What I'm saying is, though, that it's
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.680]   the revision of the old New York cartoon.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.120]   I can't come to bed.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.960]   There is a nut on the internet.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.440]   And so, yes, you should get rid of them as best you can.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.360]   But we shouldn't declare the internet broken.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.360]   And throw up our hands that it's awful when one creeps on.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.120]   We'll get rid of them.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.640]   We'll get rid of them.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.280]   But when we give them attention, that's what they most want.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.080]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.960]   What I'm saying is, get rid of them quietly.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.080]   I just read that Chrissy Teigen has
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.040]   been a constant target of harassment by QAnon in recent weeks.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.800]   And they've targeted some of her friends, some of whom
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.240]   are private figures, posting violent threats
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.960]   on their Instagram accounts.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.320]   OK, now you've gone too far.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.800]   That's practically-- that's as bad as threatening it,
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.160]   Pruitt.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.600]   If you're threatening Chrissy Teigen, why?
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.080]   Why?
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.120]   Probably some crack by idea.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.240]   If you try to break into their mind,
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.280]   that's one of them what they want is to be in your head.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.880]   So just get rid of them.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.160]   And when I say ignore them, Stacy,
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.760]   just don't give them attention.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.840]   That's what I want.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.840]   Yeah, and that's the hard part, because human nature
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.920]   is to respond when someone speaks to you, whether it's a,
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.800]   hello, or whether it's your jackass.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.120]   You're going to respond to either one of those statements.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.520]   And a lot of times with the people on the internet,
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.040]   it's hard to sort of put that filter up and say, yep,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.600]   this is just another keyboard, tough guy,
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:55.080]   coming at me with some rubbish.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.560]   Although, sort of supporting your point,
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.200]   I guess one of the reasons they're
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.000]   targeting Chrissy Teigen is because she regularly
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.200]   goes on Twitter and bashes them.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.200]   She doesn't, well, she bashes them for being jerks to her.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.800]   And they're trying to police her because she's, I mean,
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.480]   I maintain that they're trying to police her
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.840]   because she's a famous woman.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.000]   And if you see the attacks that women on Twitter
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.480]   get when they have a large audience, it is.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.480]   Oh, it's terrible.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.000]   It's terrible.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Oh, yeah, it's awful.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:32.280]   So, you know, it's kind of like, I, nope, that's politics.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.400]   I'm not bringing it up.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.720]   But see, I'm with you, Ann.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.880]   You just have to not respond and you have to tell yourself,
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.080]   like, there's plenty of times people are saying stuff
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.000]   to me on the internet.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.680]   And I'm like--
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.560]   --hew it on is a very--
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:50.400]   it's funny because it's so outrageous that, you know,
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.560]   but it's also seductive in a weird way
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:57.440]   because as you get sucked down that rabbit hole,
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.320]   you get all the support from other people saying,
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.960]   yeah, now you're seeing.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.000]   Now you're getting it.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.360]   Now you're getting it.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.040]   And you get this feeling of being--
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.320]   Just like any cult.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.640]   Yeah, it's really culty, isn't it?
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:11.000]   And you feel like, oh, wow.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.760]   The scales have fallen from my eyes.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.880]   I'm finally seeing what's really going on.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.840]   And so I understand why people get sucked into it.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:25.080]   But I mean, there's--
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.920]   How much is it Twitter's job to fight this?
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.160]   I mean, that seems like an impossible task, not just
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.440]   queuing on, but conspiracy theories in general.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.760]   Well, it certainly openly says that they want to have this
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.840]   as a safe space for everybody to enjoy the platform.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.040]   I mean, if you go into report a particular Twitter account
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.920]   or what have you, they have all of these different reasons
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.120]   why are you trying to report it?
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.200]   Because they totally don't agree to people being
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:58.120]   harassing or just insensitive or spammy.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.040]   But they don't really block that stuff, right?
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:01.520]   Right?
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.680]   I mean, they're not pretty--
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.920]   Yeah, I think that--
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.400]   I mean, think about it this way.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.600]   So if social media is at party, Twitter is like,
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:08.960]   you know what?
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.120]   You've got to leave the party.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.400]   You're being a giant dick to people.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   Do they do that?
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.420]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.320]   Bingo.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.520]   Bingo.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.520]   Yes.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.560]   And Stacey, I was thinking about this today, too.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.320]   It's so now Facebook is doing what to do with queuing on.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.240]   That should be the standard.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.160]   If you invited this dork into your party
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.440]   and everybody got pissed at you for it,
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.040]   then everybody come back to your parties again.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.520]   That's exactly what's happening.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.440]   So don't invite the dork and get rid of the dork from the party.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.040]   Don't invite the dork.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.240]   Well, it's less like don't invite the dork.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.760]   It's like, hey.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.280]   When the dork shows himself, manage the dork.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.600]   Or when-- let's not call him a dork,
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.600]   because I think there's lots of places for dorks
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.680]   on the internet.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.480]   I have no problem with dorks.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.320]   I was trying-- well, I couldn't.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.240]   I was going to use a slightly different sounding thing
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.600]   than I was trying to be polite.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.800]   So if you're being uncivil and rude on a perpetual basis,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.480]   and especially harassing, I think that it's like a conference.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.800]   Like most conferences are getting more aggressive
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.360]   about their civility policies where they're like, hey,
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.000]   don't be a jerk to people.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.160]   If you are, we're going to ask you to leave.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.160]   And if you don't leave, we're going to have security kick out.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.320]   Is it clear where the line should be drawn?
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:20.680]   Some people--
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.640]   I don't think it is.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.160]   No.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:22.680]   No.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:27.880]   I mean, that's part of why being human is really fun and tough.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.480]   I mean, when you get a bunch of people together,
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.680]   we've all had encounters where sometimes I've said stuff
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.720]   and made people feel bad.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.360]   And then I'm like, oh, no.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.600]   Or someone said something to me.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.920]   And I'm like, oh, that makes me feel really icky and uncomfortable.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.640]   Is it icky enough to ask them to leave?
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.600]   I don't know.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.680]   I mean, this is why--
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.280]   You just learned something you didn't know.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.400]   I remember the day when I used the phrase--
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.680]   and I have not used it since, but I'm
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.560]   going to use it for example right now--
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.240]   to open your kimono, to reveal something.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.000]   And someone was said to me, no, Jeff,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   realize what you're saying.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.080]   And I thought, oh, right.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.680]   And so that's how we change norms.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.640]   That's what we do.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.920]   We used to call women girls.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.280]   We don't do that now.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.680]   And so what's fascinating to me is when I said last week,
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.480]   too, is that the discussion around content moderation that
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.200]   was occurring within Facebook and Twitter
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.960]   is now occurring across the culture
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.040]   thanks to the whole Harper's letter and cancel culture.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.880]   It's a process of exactly what Stacy is saying.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.400]   We're negotiating.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.080]   We're adding things to list the bother people.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.640]   They have the power now to say so.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.840]   And we're learning.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.920]   Or we're fighting.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.000]   I kind of regret the loss of such salty sayings
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.280]   as don't open the kimono though.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.680]   I kind of want Stacy.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.280]   Stacy, get your claw out for it.
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.480]   Come on, Stacy.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.000]   That's a kind of vivid--
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.560]   that I understand, but it's such a vivid analogy.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.320]   I like it.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.000]   It's like the camel's nose under the tent,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.840]   except camels don't have a voice in this conversation.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.960]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.480]   For a long time.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.120]   Yeah, OK.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.240]   There's lots of phrases.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.880]   I mean, that's kind of the same argument
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.000]   we see about people who are like, oh, I'm not racist,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.720]   but I like those Confederate statues.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.960]   They've been up for a long time.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.360]   They don't bother anybody.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.880]   I mean, it's not your--
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.240]   Well, in the tech sector, that battle now is over Blacklist,
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.080]   Whitelist, Master Slave.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.520]   And sometimes it goes a little far.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.400]   For instance, I mean, what do you think of this, Stacy?
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.880]   And then I'll ask you, it was probably more appropriate.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:32.760]   But GitHub, when you commit something to GitHub,
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.680]   it's the master.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.400]   And then others can pull the master.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.040]   You can commit to the master.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.240]   And in that case, the master is--
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.240]   there's no concomitant slave.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.120]   The master isn't a slave master.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.200]   The master is like a school master.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.520]   The master is a master of a ship.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.520]   How about that?
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:53.360]   That's a better one.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.360]   It's the original, actually.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.960]   It's like the master of a ship.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.400]   And GitHub is going to deprecate that.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.880]   Apple is also getting rid of it.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.800]   So this is where the conversation becomes importantly.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.760]   And I would never have thought of this.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.520]   And then if someone brought this up and said,
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.640]   this is really uncomfortable.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.800]   And here's why.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.320]   It's my job to listen and say, oh, crap, that's right.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.320]   Right.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320]   Right.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:22.840]   And maybe I think a lot of the outrage here also is, in part,
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.880]   because we haven't ever listened to people.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.280]   If you never listen to someone, their grievances
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.280]   build and build.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.360]   It's true.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.520]   It's not like these--
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.720]   If there weren't systemic racism,
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.120]   it might not be such a bad thing to have the master branch.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.280]   But because there is--
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.040]   Well, there's that history at all.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.040]   Does it bother you, Aunt?
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.040]   Or let's put it this way, because maybe it does today.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.040]   But a year ago, if I'd said, well,
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.560]   when you commit something to get,
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.560]   you're committing to the master branch.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.080]   OK.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.200]   Didn't-- wouldn't have bothered me a year ago.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.160]   But that's also because I think about things
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.600]   like my grandfather being a mechanic
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.840]   and teaching me how to work on breaks.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.960]   There's a break master cylinder.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.440]   There's a slave cylinder.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.440]   So and just thought about it that way,
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.400]   because one controls sort of the other.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.600]   It's just the terminology that was used.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.000]   But I'm a little more sensitive to that now,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.360]   because of things that are just being brought to my eyes
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.120]   a little bit more nowadays.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.360]   So I would prefer to go with something
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.080]   as the main versus the secondary.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.600]   Because that's all it is.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.880]   Master and slave I completely agree with.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.360]   That's now.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.160]   It's blatant.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.160]   But what about--
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.160]   But on the other hand, the fact that you guys--
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:41.640]   Wait, hold on.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.440]   Let it in.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.360]   But he was a master mechanic.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.560]   But on the other hand, there are master mechanics.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.000]   There are master photographers.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.360]   There are master musicians.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.600]   And I get that.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.720]   That's a whole different aspect.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:00.080]   They're not imposing their will on somebody else.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.720]   You can be a master musician and not necessarily
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.720]   have a slave musician in your chamber, anything.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.640]   It's just a master musician.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.640]   So I get that.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.960]   But when you start talking about having two separate parties
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.360]   and one controls the other, there's a better way to put it.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:16.880]   I agree.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.120]   And you can just say main and secondary or right.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.760]   Main and whatever, something like that.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.560]   And to negotiate that change is not
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.560]   impinging on anyone's freedom of expression.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.480]   It's just a-- as not political correctness.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.320]   It's just sensitivity.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.000]   Sensitivity.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.920]   It's not being a dick.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.480]   There you go.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.160]   Well, you said it.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   I couldn't.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.800]   We actually-- because we have-- at least I
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.280]   have a teenager, teenage boy, and he has a lot of teenage friends.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.880]   Lisa does DVD lessons.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.960]   Don't be a dick lessons all the time with them.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.960]   And--
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.520]   She's discussed that over lunch one day.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:56.960]   It's pretty fun.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.280]   Isn't it great?
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.520]   It's so great.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.120]   It's just fantastic.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.240]   And she'll say DVD.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.200]   And it's really--
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.080]   Can Lisa do that for the whole internet?
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:07.840]   Oh, God, I wish she would.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.360]   Lisa, thank you.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.160]   I wish she would.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.400]   She would like to.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.400]   Maybe not.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.520]   That's a daunting prescription.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.080]   I'm not sure I'd want to be responsible.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.800]   There's just too many of them.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.160]   Not easy to ask.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.960]   I mean, I certainly want to be--
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.160]   I want to be sensitive if it hurts somebody's feelings.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.080]   I don't want to say it.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.840]   That's whatever, for whatever reason, even if I could say,
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.320]   well, you know, it goes back to the 14th century,
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.040]   when you're in it.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.040]   That's stupid.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.000]   If it hurts your feelings, it hurts your feelings.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.880]   And I won't say it.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.160]   That's fine.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:41.800]   It's not like we have a dearth of good phrases and terms.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.640]   And open your kimono is sexist?
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.120]   Is that--
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:45.720]   Yes.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.440]   OK.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.600]   Yeah, because you're saying to reveal something
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.160]   is for a woman to reveal her body to you, I see.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.760]   Technically, a geisha or a mother wearing.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.400]   There's both sexist and racist overtones in that way.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.880]   So if I said--
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.320]   Yes.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.280]   If I said that's opening the hatch in the long johns,
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.880]   would that be OK?
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.240]   I just--
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.960]   visual, I don't want to reveal.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.480]   Hold on.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.480]   We fast forward.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.400]   I just don't love that.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.560]   I'm just looking.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.280]   That's like-- well, Leo took down his tiny white face mask.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:18.800]   I just--
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.360]   I just-- it's just not pleasant.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:22.720]   OK.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.920]   And I admit, I'm an old guy and our time is gone.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.280]   But we learn things.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.360]   And I'm learning.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.840]   But I love language.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:36.640]   And sometimes I love a trenchant phrase or a salty thing
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.920]   that conjures up an image.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.400]   I mean, I'm never going to say the kimono thing again.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.600]   I promise.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.520]   Unless I slip.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.400]   But if I slip, I'll say--
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.480]   Had you heard that before?
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.760]   That it was--
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.920]   No.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.560]   Maybe I have--
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.640]   The one should not.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.200]   Yeah, I try not to use that.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.280]   It's the same thing as like gypped.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.800]   I try not to-- there's a lot of things--
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.960]   That's what I had to learn.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.440]   Yeah, we have to learn not to use them.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.400]   Because maybe we didn't thinking about it.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:05.680]   But--
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.680]   I never, ever would have seen the derivation of that once
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.440]   pointed out.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.680]   Oh.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.640]   Yeah, same here.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.040]   I was like, oh, I had no--
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:14.520]   Oh.
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.680]   Yeah, oops.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:16.880]   We've all--
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.080]   Fine.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.120]   And we learn.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.080]   We have all had it.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.880]   And like you say, we learned from it.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.160]   Some of us moved on.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:23.760]   True.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.400]   I was like, I didn't regret losing the word.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.080]   I was just like, oh, crikey.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:29.640]   And--
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.640]   What about Huck Finn?
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:37.640]   What about Huck Finn, Leo?
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.280]   So Mark-- I don't think Mark Twain was a racist.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:40.680]   I don't know.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.760]   I mean, he grew up in an era of racism.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.720]   He grew up in the era and wrote a representation
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.200]   of what the era was.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.800]   There's no different--
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.880]   and I know I'm going to get roasted for this statement.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:58.040]   But that's no different from our famous hip-hop artists
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:02.840]   in the streets of South Central LA, just right in the story,
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.720]   based on exactly what they lived and saw.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.520]   Absolutely.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.440]   I agree with you.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.640]   So--
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.240]   And so he used--
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:10.200]   I learned about Mark Twain.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.080]   --the N word quite liberally.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:14.120]   In fact, it's the name of one of the characters in Huck Finn.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.120]   And a lot of high schools grapple with that.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.720]   I would think it's a teaching moment that you don't cut it out.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.960]   But you say, well, let's talk about what that is.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.160]   Let's talk about it.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:24.160]   And why not?
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.080]   Let's explain why this was said this way.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.400]   We wouldn't say that today.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:31.000]   And maybe not have a student read out loud from that portion.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:33.680]   But I still would be--
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.680]   By the way, I wouldn't want you--
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.760]   Get this back to Geekdom.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.920]   Did you know I found this out recently.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:43.640]   Mark Twain almost went bankrupt, investing
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:46.360]   in a competitor for the LinoType.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.840]   I did know that.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.640]   You did know that.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.120]   I did know that.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.280]   What is a LinoType?
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.080]   Is it a typewriter?
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.480]   Oh.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.160]   Oh, Stacy.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.680]   Please, Stacy, I'm so--
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.680]   Here it comes.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:57.680]   Oh.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.120]   Hold on.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.200]   Let me Google it.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:34:59.760]   I know a type.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.440]   It's my favorite--
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.720]   it's the end of the goodness.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.080]   Oh, Stacy's my favorite thing on Earth.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.560]   Oh, it's not OK.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.320]   I know what it is now.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.000]   OK.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Yeah, come on.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:13.480]   Here, you want to see--
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.680]   courtesy fast company.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:20.880]   List of phrases not to use in business.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.560]   Open the kimono is number one.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.520]   Oh, wow.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.840]   Shop chop.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.320]   No can do.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:30.920]   Oh.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.440]   Yeah, OK.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:31.920]   I got it.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.280]   I got it.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.960]   Coming from an era where it was a racist
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:39.000]   kind of Chinese making fun of the way Chinese spoke.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.360]   Same thing with longtime no see.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.200]   Pigeon English from Native American origins.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.800]   Long time no see.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.960]   Oh, oh, I didn't know that one.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.680]   Yep.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:54.400]   Drink the Kool-Aid because of Jim Jones.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:58.160]   I mean, I have he lost a friend in Jones Town
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.920]   from the examiner.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.600]   Yes.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.160]   That one is long bothered me.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.040]   So when you hear people say that it bothers you,
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.160]   it brings up bad memories.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.200]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.320]   I'll have to stop saying that.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.000]   And by the way, it was flavorade, not Kool-Aid,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.800]   because they were cheap bastards.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.600]   And in fact, when you're saying drink the Kool-Aid,
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.960]   you are actually explicitly invoking--
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:17.480]   Yes.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.920]   --that instance.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:19.480]   I mean, it's--
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.040]   Yes.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.040]   It's what you would say about a cult member.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.880]   They drank the Kool-Aid.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.280]   So--
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.440]   I edited the stories of the examiner that led to the trip.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:28.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.480]   Two Jones Town that led to.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:38.680]   And my-- we lost our photographer, Greg, down there.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.800]   And Tim Reiderman was shot down there.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.400]   And I remember taking Jim Willsie, the editor
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.480]   of the paper at the time, or the managed editor,
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.200]   to have to go down and cover Jones Town,
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.160]   to go down and cover this.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.120]   So it was, yeah, these are--
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.080]   And then a week later, we all worked around the clock.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.800]   And a week later, I lost my friend's
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.280]   Moscone in milk.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.880]   Oh my god, that was a bad--
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.280]   That time.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.480]   That time stands out.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.000]   That's cool.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   And I get it.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.640]   So I never-- I've never scolded everybody for saying it.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.400]   I wouldn't do that, because it's very personal to me.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:15.000]   And most people just wouldn't see that as offensive.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.080]   So I kind of get--
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:16.480]   I had no idea.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:16.960]   --people say it.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.960]   I don't have to be with it.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.440]   But I just-- but I personally--
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.680]   yeah, it brings back things.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.480]   It's a little bit of a PTSD there.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.560]   Well, I had no idea.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.880]   And it's explicitly what you're invoking.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.480]   So I will try not to--
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.000]   it's hard to remember all these.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.640]   OK, this one, Grandfather Clause is agist.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.440]   No, I don't know.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.280]   Actually, no.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.960]   Here it is.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:43.120]   It's came from Reconstruction in the American South
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.720]   to allow potential white voters to circumvent literacy tests,
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.240]   poll taxes, and other tactics used
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.360]   to keep southern blacks from voting.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.440]   No idea.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:54.960]   No idea.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.960]   Zero-class.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:56.960]   It's the white.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:57.960]   It's used in a lot of contracts today.
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.200]   These were grandfathered in.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:01.880]   Wow.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.000]   Because they were old.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:03.840]   They were grandpas.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.880]   And they didn't know how to read.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.480]   But that's OK because they were white.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.200]   Unbelievable.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.520]   That's interesting.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.640]   You know, see, it just shows.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.880]   There's a lot of this.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.120]   Again, and that's in a lot of contracts today.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.440]   A lot of contracts.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.680]   Sure.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.920]   I've used all these phrases many times.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.520]   I'm going to have to stop.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.320]   I will try not to.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.200]   But you know, I also--
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.160]   and I've been schooled not to--
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.400]   occasionally will do my impressions of various accents
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:35.120]   and like the Indian accent for the tech support guy.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.440]   And I've been told, and I don't do it anymore.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.960]   But I kind of miss it.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.560]   You're such a duke.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.360]   I like your-- is it OK for you to keep your Scottish accent
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.720]   and your French accent?
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.000]   I don't know.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.120]   What's the difference?
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.200]   I don't know.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.640]   If somebody tells me you can't do it--
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.320]   Between a Scottish accent and a French accent?
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:53.760]   No, no, no.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.000]   What's it ever seen doing?
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.640]   Appu from the Simpsons and/or doing the Scottish guy
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.040]   talking about how great golf is.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:03.720]   What's the difference?
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.040]   I don't know.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.680]   She's eating surrender monkeys.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.800]   I remember that.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.800]   It's important.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.440]   Oh, yes.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:14.560]   It's important to remember that even though we're
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:19.480]   limiting our options, the language is infinitely rich.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.400]   And honestly, as a writer, aren't you
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.560]   always looking to avoid the cliche anyway?
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.560]   So let's find out--
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.200]   So here's a fascinating story.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.640]   Here's a really fascinating story.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.400]   There's a lot today.
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.000]   Before we got on, Rutgers University and their English
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.360]   department as part of their adjustments
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:38.560]   is going to stop emphasizing standard English grammar.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:43.000]   And the guy who organized the Harper's letter
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.640]   went bat-- sorry, bat poop over it.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.560]   You know, signed it?
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.600]   Oddly enough, John McWhorter.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.800]   Well, that's what I was just saying.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.120]   So I said-- my tweet said, hm, you
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.120]   might want to ask your fellow cider there, McWhorter,
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.440]   who constantly talks about how language is flexible
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.920]   and we have to respect all these versions of languages
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.680]   and not get our knickers and knots.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.360]   Can I say that?
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.440]   Knickers, knickers.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.880]   So we all wear knickers?
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.800]   Is a knickers email, aren't you, Carmen?
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.840]   OK, so I have actually used the phrase
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.560]   "painies in a twist" on live television.
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.480]   I'm not using that one.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.680]   Well, it's OK.
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.400]   It was a moment that I wish I could undo.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.320]   But--
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.080]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:25.880]   Didn't come out.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.960]   That second, do you wish you hadn't said it?
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.360]   You could actually see--
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.160]   I think I said "painies in a bunch."
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.760]   I said something about AT&T, not get your panties in a--
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.920]   and I just stopped.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.960]   I was like, oh, there's nowhere to go here.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.600]   But--
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.120]   Yep.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.000]   Yep, it sounds--
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.760]   Moving right forward.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.760]   Just keep going past it.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.800]   I actually-- and I will recommend it to anybody.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.600]   You've recommended-- what is it?
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.800]   Our fabulous bastard tongue, magnificent bastard tongue,
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.360]   which is McWhorter's book about English.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.840]   But I read his book, and I thought
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.360]   it was really good on black English.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.200]   And I can't remember the name of it,
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.400]   but it was really, really eye-opening.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.840]   And his contention is it's not ungrammatical.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.520]   A lot of people, ignorant people, think it's ungrammatical.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.520]   It's far from ungrammatical.
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.120]   We've talked about this before.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.360]   It's actually, in some ways, more
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.240]   complexly grammatical than standard English.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.200]   So it's a wonderful book.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.120]   I really enjoyed it.
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:33.800]   But he was on TV this morning.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.960]   We're getting way off here.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.240]   But it was on TV this morning.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.160]   I think it was this morning.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:44.720]   Morning Joe going against the book, "White Fragility."
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.640]   Yeah, because-- well, for one thing,
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.640]   I thought it was problematic that it's written by a white woman.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.240]   Right?
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.480]   That's one thing.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:58.040]   And then the other argument that he was making is we,
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.720]   he was saying of himself as an African-American man,
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.640]   are ourselves so fragile.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.040]   And I can't judge this.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:06.960]   I cannot judge this.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.920]   There's an argument that's going on that needs to go on.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.520]   And I'm going to watch it and learn as it goes.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.240]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.680]   Sometimes it's better just to say we don't know.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:21.640]   Watch the dialogue if it is indeed a dialogue and not
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:22.440]   a monologue.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:22.960]   Yes.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:23.760]   Well, sir.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:27.600]   This is-- it's ants of wisdom, the fount of wisdom.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.440]   This is the book-- it's unaudible.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:34.960]   I loved this book, "Talking Back, Talking Black."
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.160]   It's only four hours, but really a great book, wonderful book.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.440]   He's really--
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.640]   The quarters he delivers this stuff to some sort.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.080]   I love John the Quarter.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.120]   We really have enjoyed his stuff.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:51.360]   They're actually on audible is his great course
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.760]   on language families of the world.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.080]   It's also just really--
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.760]   I disagree with him in the Harper's letter,
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.320]   but that's OK.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.120]   We can disagree with him.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.760]   Yeah, I thought it was interesting he signed that.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.640]   But a number of people have since--
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.680]   two people, at least have since said,
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.960]   I wasn't paying attention.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.680]   It seems like a good idea.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:10.240]   But I didn't really fully-- once again, we all learn.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:10.880]   You learn.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.380]   Yeah.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:14.040]   That's the thing you hope you learn.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:18.320]   We didn't understand the fully-- the nuances.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.320]   So the--
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.520]   Let's take a break.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.720]   There's a-- I got to take a break,
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.560]   because we got a lot to do.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.560]   Thank you, Spines.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.200]   Thank you, Spines.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.240]   Yes, we thank our sponsor.
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.200]   And I apologize for people who tuned in hoping
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.720]   that we would tell you what the latest thing from Google is.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.320]   There's got a lot from Google this week, folks.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.720]   We'll get to that.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.760]   We can talk about that.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.560]   In Amazon did their Madam A live event.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:37.920]   Perfect.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.920]   Let's do that next.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.720]   And we're going to talk about queso people.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.240]   Queso.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:42.920]   We are?
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.440]   Really?
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.440]   It's going to come up.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.440]   What happened?
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.440]   Queso's going to come up.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.440]   Well, you'll find out--
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.640]   This week in queso is my next show, Twick.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.640]   I would love to do that show.
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:57.240]   And all we do, the whole show is go, hmm.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:00.040]   Yes, I'm on.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.040]   Oh.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.640]   And then you go to Chipotle and you say, hmm.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.640]   Mmm.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.640]   Mmm.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:06.640]   Mmm.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.960]   Hey, our show today brought to you
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.200]   by a great company that does a product you probably
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.840]   could use right now called Monday.com.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:19.280]   It's a team management platform that lets teams plan, manage,
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.400]   and track work in a centralized place.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:24.080]   Anybody who's worked in a large team--
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.480]   actually doesn't have to be a big team.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:26.960]   It could be a science project team,
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.120]   but anybody who's worked on a team of any kind
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.760]   knows that you end up using a lot of different tools.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.680]   What I love about Monday.com is it
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:41.760]   lets you pull in all of the things you use and put it
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.960]   in a way that everybody is always up to date.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.040]   There is a single source of truth.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.400]   You can instantly kind of understand what's going on
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:50.960]   because it's very visual.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:51.920]   I love how visual it is.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.480]   You can do Gantt charts, timelines, canbands,
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.960]   spreadsheet tables.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.400]   You might think, oh, but I don't want
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.840]   to spend a lot of time organizing it.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.960]   And what I love about this is it just self-organizes.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.920]   You bring in your work, whether it's from--
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:10.080]   for instance, for us, we use it with Google Drive and Slack.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.680]   And it doesn't mean you stop using those.
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.600]   It means it pulls into Monday.com.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.720]   It pulls into all the work.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.720]   You're keeping it all in one place
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.360]   so that you can keep track of your business
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.040]   and what you're doing and coordinate better
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.280]   and centralized communications.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.520]   It actually does the thing-- the one thing
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.360]   I want every business tool to do, it eliminates meetings.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.720]   A lot of times the meetings are just
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.840]   to figure out, well, who's doing why, when, where,
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.480]   how, all of that's in Monday.com.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:41.120]   So you can actually eliminate a lot of those check-in meetings.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:44.000]   And by the way, it's really great to start up.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.600]   We're starting to set up for podcasting.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.920]   But I'll just give you an example.
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:53.720]   Here's a high-level design project overview on Monday.com.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.400]   Switch over to my screen, if you would.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.520]   There you go.
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.360]   And you see it's very visual.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.920]   It can look like-- kind of like tables.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:05.680]   We use this for podcasting, for brainstorming,
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.600]   for keeping track of guests.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.080]   It's really a fantastic-- you could
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:13.840]   see it could tie writing with MailChimp.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.880]   You can have affiliate lists.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:22.440]   This is just a great way to get work done better, faster,
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.800]   easier.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.640]   Monday.com.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.600]   I'm just so impressed with it.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.840]   You can get a free trial right now
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:32.680]   if you go to Monday.com/twit, Monday.com/twit.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:38.720]   I think sometimes my brain, the way it works,
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.560]   it feels disorganized.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.520]   But when you dump it all out into Monday.com,
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:46.320]   you can kind of see, oh, no, there is actually--
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.400]   there's some organization there, which is great.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.680]   It works with Zoom.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.600]   So you can have your meetings.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.480]   You can have a button that says, let's start the meeting
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.120]   right now, right in Monday.com.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.680]   Email works, calendars, spreadsheets.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.680]   Every place you've got information.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.480]   And you know what's great?
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.720]   Monday.com scales with you beautifully.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.520]   So if it's a team of 5,000 or 5,000,
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.280]   Monday.com can handle it.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:11.120]   And I was really pleased, because when we started setting up
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:16.120]   our podcast board at Monday.com, we had a great conversation.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.480]   Reggie joined us.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.120]   He showed us-- Reggie's actually done a lot of work
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.920]   I see since we talked.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.760]   He showed us the ins and outs.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.560]   They're very good about onboarding.
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.040]   They have videos and more.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:32.800]   And of course, you're a specialist to help you get going.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.720]   Look at all the things it integrates with.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.440]   Change the way you work online.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:40.160]   You need a single shared space, a single source of information
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:40.600]   that's there.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.360]   It's easy to use.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.600]   It's attractive.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:43.880]   It draws people in.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.720]   That's Monday.com.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.600]   It's going to take care of what slows you down, free up time
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.480]   to focus on the work that drives you.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.400]   And I found it's a great way to get insights by putting what
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.360]   you know and what you're thinking about in there.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:59.800]   Suddenly, kind of self-organizes and you go aha.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.560]   Get that aha feeling.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.320]   Start your free 14-day trial right now.

[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.120]   We started using it-- oh, I had it
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.360]   might have been a year ago.
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:18.040]   And it's really been a great journey, a really useful tool
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.600]   that I think everybody should know about.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:23.200]   Monday.com/twit.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.040]   Thank you for the support of this week and whatever
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.560]   the heck is going on today.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.400]   Well, since Stacey asked about it.
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.560]   Since Stacey asked and brought it up--
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.840]   Yes.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.280]   --is it your line of what type?
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.120]   It's your line of what type.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:39.000]   The best line of type, the most amazing video you've ever
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:39.880]   want to watch.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:40.840]   It is so charming.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.520]   It's the last day of the line of type
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.600]   and hot lead at the New York Times.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.120]   It is spectacular.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:48.000]   Etayon Shirdlu.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:48.640]   Etudelu.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:52.200]   I know that because that is in order the most common letters
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.920]   of the alphabet.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.160]   Well, there's that, but it's also the letters right up and down
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.280]   on the line of type that they would like.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.800]   Why do you think it is?
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:48:59.520]   OK, OK.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:00.560]   That's part of it.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:05.240]   Because instead of Quirty, they designed it to be--
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.760]   you know, it was actually up and down.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.200]   Oh, y'all.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.160]   1978--
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.640]   The Council on International Non-Theopical Events
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.840]   has awarded this film a golden eagle
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.520]   in token of its excellence and has selected it
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.240]   to represent the United States of America
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:23.000]   in international motion picture events abroad.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.440]   What the hell?
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.600]   That's the strangest award I've ever heard of.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.000]   Farewell.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.640]   This is some pretty cool looking tek-dow.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.200]   Mix track, take one.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.200]   Mix track, take one.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:41.480]   You hear that magnet, Blacker?
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:44.440]   That's the greatest root bowl for tissue.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:47.040]   That's the sound you grew up with.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.040]   Yes.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.880]   Avon O.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:50.800]   And Andy's.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:53.880]   And I'm told there's a smell too, right?
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:54.800]   What's the hot lead?
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.720]   The smell of metal.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:00.240]   They eat T-A-I-O-N.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.480]   The most common letters.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.080]   Now, by the way, that's not a typewriter.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:06.440]   When he hits that, is it hot lead is being--
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.080]   Oh, no.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:07.280]   No.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:12.840]   What happens is out of the top, each letter is in a magazine.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.040]   And when he hits one of those letters,
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:18.440]   the mold with that letter comes down and goes--
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:21.600]   And then all the letters line up.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.400]   And then they get touched by the top of the table.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.000]   And now he's got a--
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.720]   Turn down, turn down the line of time so we can hear Jeff.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:33.880]   And it's being molded into a line O type.
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:35.040]   Oh, you're kidding.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.560]   That's not where the name comes from.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:37.080]   Yes it is.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:37.920]   It's a line O type.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:38.920]   We are fresh.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:39.920]   We're putting press time for the first--
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:43.640]   So it's putting in molds, and then they do pour lead into it.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.280]   They pour lead into the whole line as a mold.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.440]   At the end.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.520]   And then that way they've got the setup.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.600]   And then that becomes the press.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.440]   Here's what's fascinating.
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:53.960]   You know how a line gets justified so that the right
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.840]   and the left are the same with every line?
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.520]   The space is a wedge-shaped thing.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.560]   And when the line is filled with molds,
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.600]   the wedge just pushes it up.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:07.720]   So it spaces out between words enough to fill out the line.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.360]   This is awesome.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:12.080]   Do they like, remelt the lead after each--
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.000]   Yes.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:13.480]   Yes.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:14.000]   OK.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.120]   Once you're done with it, then they--
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.640]   They take it and be built all and throw it back.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:19.880]   That's the New York Times motto.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.400]   We shall waste no lead before it's time.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.240]   And you have to read--
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.600]   what I worked the composer for, which I did,
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.480]   you get very good at reading upside down and backwards.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.120]   Oh, you actually worked one of these?
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.120]   I didn't work the line.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:32.640]   I don't know.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.440]   I would have gotten a shot by the union.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.640]   I was on the other side.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.360]   I was the editor on the other side saying,
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.320]   put this here, put them there.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:39.800]   Oh, you were seeing the result though,
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.320]   that they were doing.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.000]   How do they do pictures?
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.440]   How are the pictures done?
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.640]   Well, the pictures are done by various means of engraving,
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:50.600]   where it's basically a photo, a chemical process.
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.440]   Did they save the plates?
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.000]   No, those got gone too.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.640]   But I've got some here.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:57.280]   That's--
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:57.840]   That's weird.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:59.600]   This is-- I want one in the basement.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.000]   Can we get a line of text?
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:01.840]   Well, hold on.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.840]   Hold on.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:03.800]   Well, I'll show you.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.080]   I have a coffee table made of two press plates.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:06.880]   Wow.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.440]   That, what you see happening right now, right,
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.760]   is what the line puzzles did, who years and years and years--
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.760]   That's the only way of doing it.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:19.360]   From 1450 until 1880, that's how every line of type
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.640]   and every book you see and every newspaper you see was set.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.160]   Letter by letter, one by one.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.360]   This is what you see in there is a photo sheet.
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.800]   The line of text automates this.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.320]   This is a picture of a century after the line of text.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.440]   The Ludlow machine, you put it by hand,
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.240]   and then it comes out and you'll see it come out
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:37.880]   in a second as a molded headline.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:40.040]   By tomorrow, like a day.
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:43.680]   This Ludlow 2 will be a museum piece.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.600]   I love this, but I got to tell you--
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.520]   The best room you're grateful for my life.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.960]   He's not each one of those things.
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.960]   Thank god for computers.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:56.040]   She's-- you all people really had to work hard.
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:00.200]   Did you have dishwashers and refrigerators, grandpa?
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.200]   No, no, no.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.320]   Look, it was out of that window.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.520]   That's the future.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:07.000]   That's the photo composing room.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.800]   This guarded line of the machine.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.680]   Now lined up for shipment.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:15.120]   They have been the old reliables here for decades.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.840]   Tonight, 60 of the once-100 in Mory Lannister.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:21.680]   The largest battery of any newspaper in the world
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.920]   are on their final stint.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:23.920]   It is accident.
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:24.880]   It's not that much.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:25.880]   It's a great tradition time.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:26.640]   They make up men's--
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.560]   You see that thing that slopes in the top?
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.680]   That's the magazine that holds all the matrices,
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.400]   the moves.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:34.880]   If you wanted to change the font,
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.160]   you had to change that whole huge thing.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.440]   I'm going to watch this movie.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.040]   We're not doing it.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.240]   It's Stacy's board-a-tier.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:42.120]   Stacy, she said--
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:42.960]   I'm not board-a-tier.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:44.160]   I think it's interesting.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.320]   Ah, you were pretty interesting.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:47.400]   Now, put out the paper, move out of the way here.
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.320]   Can you see my coffee table there?
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.200]   Those are--
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.520]   That is a press plate.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.000]   OK.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:54.360]   That--
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.360]   Nice.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:59.040]   60 pounds of lead from the Chicago Tribune.
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:53:59.640]   Nice.
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:00.320]   Wow.
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.360]   60 pounds of lead.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.160]   60 pounds of lead.
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.040]   I worked with the Tribune.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:08.320]   This is a logo.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:10.120]   What's a logo, grandpa?
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.920]   Well, it's just a logo for-- what was it?
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.760]   What was it?
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.560]   Best of today and tomorrow, because I
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:17.640]   worked for a paper called Chicago Today.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:18.200]   Oh.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.280]   So this was a great--
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.200]   So that's permanent.
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.920]   They would save that one.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.600]   They would save this as a way you throw it all the time.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:25.320]   Yes.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:28.400]   So if people want to watch the whole thing, it's on Vimeo.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.720]   Let's talk it.
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.760]   There's-- actually, we're getting this from an article
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.080]   in the publication.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.080]   This is colossal.com.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.680]   But you could also go directly to Vimeo
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:42.440]   and search for Farewell, ETA-O-I-N-S-H-R-D-O-U.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.160]   Or just Google last day of line of type of New York Times.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:45.680]   You'll find it.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:46.720]   OK, cool.
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:47.640]   That's awesome.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.240]   Really neat.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.400]   It's really, really charming and wonderful.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.040]   And then sad and all that too.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:53.480]   But yes, that's my heart.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.320]   Is that machine?
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:58.480]   Well, one more thing that the computer technology completely
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:01.040]   replaced.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:03.640]   And I was there then.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.320]   Because the union-- I didn't know it.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.480]   The whole way I got the computers,
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:08.960]   the entire way I got computers is,
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.320]   I was on the midnight shift waiting
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.240]   for somebody to die a violent death
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.360]   so I could write about it.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:15.040]   And they had these new machines next to us.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:15.920]   And I was the kid.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.760]   I'm playing with it.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:17.760]   Everybody else was scared of it.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:21.280]   They walked around it like there were apes around 2001
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.880]   at the obelisk.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.160]   I actually got to play with this thing.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:27.000]   So when I get the day shift, I'm the guy who
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.160]   knows what a cursor is.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:34.720]   And I train the newsroom in the concept of the cursor.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:36.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:38.840]   Which is not an easy concept, folks.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:40.600]   It actually is not an easy concept.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.320]   And so I didn't realize it.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:43.000]   I was an idiot.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.240]   I was young and stupid.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.960]   It was a scab system to put pressure
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.960]   on the International Typographical Union
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.160]   to allow computers in.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.840]   So when and if they went on strike, we could still publish.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.040]   I didn't know that.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:57.440]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.000]   Without the strike news, that's how I got into blogging
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.520]   is all these old people at the magazines
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:08.000]   that I worked at in the late-- let's see, it was 2000.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:14.720]   And when I was interning at Business Week in 1997--
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.840]   and yeah, they were just like, what?
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.000]   No, internet?
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.720]   30 years from now, somebody's going to be in the podcast.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.320]   Yeah, no, I'm already in.
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.480]   And I'm back guessing, you know, that's how I got here.
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.880]   Because I knew how to use TikTok and Leo didn't.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:32.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:38.200]   That's how I-- what do you think the technology, Jeff and I,
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:42.360]   will be too old to grok that this kid will just say,
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.200]   yeah, it's time to move over.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:48.200]   So you know, that printing was invented first, right?
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:51.320]   First in China and in Korea, but then Gutenberg popularized it
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:54.320]   and made it work, 1450.
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:58.440]   Wasn't until around 1600 that essays, modern novels,
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:00.080]   and newspapers were invented.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:00.520]   Right.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.880]   It took a long time.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:02.960]   That long.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:07.720]   So imagine how long it's going to take for this internet thing
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:12.200]   before we see truly creative minds say, oh, it could do this?
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:15.840]   I've used that concept for a long time in my talks,
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.040]   saying, you know, when they first make a printing press,
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.960]   all that it was reprint Bibles.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.520]   They saw it as a way to get--
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:26.480]   to take the job away for the illuminators and the mascribes
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.080]   in the monasteries so they could print Bibles.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:29.600]   Oh, great.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.000]   And it took a long time to figure out
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.680]   there was other things you could do.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.840]   And I agree, we're kind of at that stage in the internet,
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:37.920]   where initially it was brochures and magazines.
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:41.080]   And if you were a TV person, you made your internet site
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:41.800]   look like TV.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.840]   If you're a radio person, you did podcasts.
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:45.080]   I don't know what it's going to be.
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:46.240]   What's the next--
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.600]   is there was a wonderful thread
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:51.280]   that I've forgotten named Adam Lenson, L-E-N-S-O-N.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.480]   They really inspired me because he said he's a theater producer.
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:56.600]   And everybody else is dying to get back in the theater.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.400]   And he understands that because he does theater.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.720]   But he said, I found an audience of 50,000 people
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.440]   who watched these musical things that I created.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:04.920]   My lord, I couldn't do that otherwise.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:07.960]   And the way that we can collaborate around the world,
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.040]   I mean, all these people.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.880]   It was this enthusiasm I missed for the internet.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:15.360]   And it happened because of coronavirus.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.720]   Nobody was going to do it.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:17.800]   But now it's there.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:19.200]   And he's seeing the benefit in it.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.800]   Others are complaining.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.040]   But he sees the value.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.840]   And I just love that spirit.
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:27.760]   I do sincerely think COVID is going to change a lot of things.
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:28.760]   Oh, boy.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:34.480]   So you remember the Google I/O?
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.920]   It was the one thing that was really good about Google I/O.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:38.920]   There was none this year.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:39.720]   Three phones?
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:40.480]   Last year.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.480]   No.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.120]   Do you remember last year?
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:43.760]   The food.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:46.680]   It's a boring kind of talk about--
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:48.960]   I think maybe it was the Pixel 4 launch.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:49.800]   Was that an I/O?
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.080]   I can't remember.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:54.600]   Kind of a dull, not such an interesting presentation.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:57.400]   And then all of a sudden, this guy comes on
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:02.040]   who is the wizard of computational photography, like--
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.120]   Oh, last year, sir.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:07.400]   This guy, we even said it at the time.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:13.360]   This was boring except for Mark Lavoy, former Stanford professor.
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:17.840]   He came to Google and really is the genius
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:20.000]   of computational photography.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.720]   We reported a few months ago that he had left Google.
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:25.920]   Now we know where his next act will be.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:27.760]   He's going to Adobe.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.840]   And what's really interesting about this is he's not going to Adobe
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:33.240]   to make hardware.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.360]   He's going to Adobe to make software.
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:42.600]   Adobe wants to make camera software, computational photography,
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:46.840]   a universal camera app for us.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:48.600]   You're probably up on this, because I
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:50.840]   know you're all up on Adobe.
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:52.280]   Yeah, this is--
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.680]   I think this is big news considering I don't particularly
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:59.480]   care for the camera that's built inside of Lightroom mobile
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.000]   at this time, nor the Photoshop camera app.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.320]   I was going to ask if you'd use the PSC.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.680]   You have used that.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.720]   Yeah, it's not necessarily my thing.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.840]   I think that's something geared more
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:13.160]   towards the TikTok folks and the younger crowd,
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:17.080]   because it adds a lot of extra effects to things
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:20.960]   that I don't think make you images look any better.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.840]   I'll give you an example.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:26.320]   Yeah, I mean, this is just--
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.680]   This is done with a Photoshop camera.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:34.120]   This was actually a really boring photo I took at a lavender
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.280]   garden.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.760]   It was just a terrible photo.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.960]   But by putting in the Alps and giant popsicles,
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.760]   I think it's bringing it to life, don't you think?
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.000]   I'm sure.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.240]   I think the Alps really make it sure.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.280]   Sure boss.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:49.800]   Sure.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.680]   But what's interesting is it knew where the horizon was.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.600]   It knew where to put the Alps.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.120]   You can size and move the--
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:56.680]   It's AI.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.440]   It's pretty smart.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.360]   If I show you the original of that picture, you'll say, oh,
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.080]   yeah, you're right.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.640]   Here's the original.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.360]   This is such a boring picture.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.080]   And in fact, that's why I picked it to run it
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.240]   through the Photoshop camera.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.160]   I wish you'd fixed that horizon line.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:11.880]   You'd crank it.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.280]   Oh, man.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.120]   It just--
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.120]   Driving me nuts.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.320]   Oh, it does, doesn't it?
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.440]   Well, I could fix that.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.080]   We have the technology.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:20.800]   Just do a little--
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:21.280]   OK, please.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.560]   Just do a little horizon line fixing here.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.240]   I'll sleep a little better tonight.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:32.760]   No, I'm glad to see Adobe making this investment, if you will.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.800]   Because again, the Photoshop camera app
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.680]   is cool for a certain crowd.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.200]   There you go.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.240]   How do you like it?
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.800]   I fixed it.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.800]   Not just it.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.240]   Now you know why Ant does hands-on photography and not me.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:46.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.800]   I thought the popsicles were good.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.800]   I don't know.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.480]   I just thought, you know.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:53.800]   I mean--
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.240]   And then it has the Lightroom camera app
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.200]   that allows you to shoot raw and long exposures
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.000]   with your phone.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   And I've never used that either.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:02.520]   So you have a tripod.
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.800]   And it would work really good some of the time.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.520]   So kudos.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.280]   This is a heck of a move, because we saw what
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.480]   it did with the Pixel 4.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:14.480]   And the Pixel 4 computational photography
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.320]   is really, really, really good.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:16.520]   That was really good.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.720]   Just makes it easy.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.280]   So Martin Lavoy, congratulations.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.600]   Left Google in March after six years.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:28.400]   He had actually done the camera in the Glass Explorer
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:34.520]   edition as a visiting faculty member at Google X.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:34.680]   He was a Stanford--
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.480]   I like him anyway.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:35.920]   --for that.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.880]   He is really--
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.880]   I get the sarcasm, but no, he's really--
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.840]   it was genuinely interesting.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:45.960]   So he is now going to Adobe.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.160]   And so expect some interesting software.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.480]   His demo was awesome.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.320]   It's worth rewatching.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.440]   I've never watched it.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.600]   He showed no sound.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.080]   That good.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:59.120]   Or the night sight and the astrophotography
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.000]   and all the stuff.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.880]   It's interesting, because I would have assumed
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.760]   that an intimate knowledge of the hardware
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.240]   is required to do good computational photography,
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.160]   but maybe not.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.160]   Maybe it doesn't matter what camera you're using.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:19.920]   I think when I think about the astro stuff,
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.240]   it's not necessarily thinking about the hardware.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:25.680]   It's thinking about geolocation and other variables
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.000]   outside of the camera where the AI is thinking about, OK,
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.720]   how can I really make this work?
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.640]   OK, and now I could shove this into the hardware,
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:34.840]   and boom, we got it.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.520]   Looks good.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:42.040]   What is-- so Canon just announced its new mirrorless line,
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.600]   the R5 and the R6.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.080]   And finally going-- this is Canon and Nikon
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:53.600]   of the old line, big DSLRs with moving mirrors in them.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.720]   And they were starting to get their lunch eaten, I think,
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.440]   a little bit by Sony, and its mirrorless line.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.240]   So Canon-- and I always thought,
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.040]   Canon and Nikon will be slow on this,
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:07.000]   because they don't want to cannibalize their very lucrative
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.400]   mirror camera business.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.880]   And they were initially a little slow,
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:17.400]   but this R5 looks to be probably the best camera Canon makes,
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.400]   right?
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.800]   It certainly competes with the 5D.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.760]   I don't know if it competes with the 1D.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:29.280]   That one is right below the 1DX, if you ask me.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.680]   Because the 1DX is just able to do some things a little more
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.840]   in its stream locations and in its stream situations.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:41.200]   But this is the size of a rock, a quail,
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:45.000]   and the 1DX is a tank.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.920]   I mean, there really is a big difference in size, yeah.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.440]   But it has the great weather ceiling.
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.200]   And this R5 is pretty high.
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.880]   But personally, I'd like to have the R6.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.000]   I was pretty close to pulling the trigger on an R6.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.120]   It's a little less expensive.
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.560]   The R5 is $3900.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.040]   What's the R6?
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.280]   $1000 less?
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.640]   The R6 is just $1000, I agree.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:10.160]   So my reason I brought that up is what's missing in this
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.240]   is that computational photography.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.760]   This is all about the physical hardware,
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.720]   and the sensor, and the processor,
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:21.520]   and the in-body image stabilization.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.520]   And they're not putting, I mean, there is a computer in it,
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:28.200]   but it seems like they're not really advancing that.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.520]   Why not?
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.760]   The only advancing that you'll see in it
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.920]   is how it tries to process the JPEGs
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.720]   and make them look prettier.
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:39.400]   You know, changing the color temperature and saturation.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.160]   That's about it.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:44.040]   You are getting, and I don't know how good cannons
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.040]   will be compared to the Sony's.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:50.320]   The Sony's are really good at face tracking and eye tracking,
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.400]   which is really amazing.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.880]   And they can even do animal eye tracking.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:54.720]   Right.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.240]   Which makes a big difference.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.360]   Last year's, late last year's firmware update
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:05.000]   from Canon to the EOS R, updated their autofocus,
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.440]   and made it a lot more reliable and faster.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.640]   And of course, they have iterated on that
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.000]   and put it into the new R5 and R6.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.440]   And according to reports, it's really, really good
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.240]   and a lot faster than before.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.560]   And the locks dead on today.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:22.240]   I've watched a couple videos for some people on YouTube
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.360]   trying to test it out.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.760]   And it was pretty good.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.760]   It was right there.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.600]   It was a great Sony.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:29.240]   - And my A7R for it's just remarkable.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:33.080]   - So, but nevertheless, the whole idea of the software
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:37.000]   and the Pixel 4 is that you have essentially
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.320]   a tiny sensor, kind of a junky sensor,
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.160]   relatives to something like this.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.960]   That's a full frame sensor.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:47.000]   This is, I don't know, how many, hundreds of times bigger.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.280]   And because of computational photography,
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:51.200]   you get remarkable images.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.880]   What would it be like if they apply that same capabilities
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.720]   to an incredible sensor like this?
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.000]   - Probably more expensive.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.880]   (both laughing)
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.720]   - Much more data is there in that sensor.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.440]   I mean, how much harder is it to do?
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.720]   - I'd have to do all that to Putin.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.920]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.600]   You'd be a lot more processing.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.040]   But really, what this, I mean, in order to do that,
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.600]   when the Pixel, they take nine images, right?
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:15.440]   - Right.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.280]   - And really quickly.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:18.520]   - They gather a lot of data intentionally.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.880]   - It's 12 megapixel cameras.
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:21.280]   So they're getting out of there.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.120]   - Here's the question for you.
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.280]   - 108 megapixels.
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.120]   - Yeah.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.600]   - Was it possible, because these were smaller sensors
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:29.960]   and smaller cameras, was it more likely
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.640]   for the innovation to happen here than on expensive cameras?
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.400]   It's kind of kind of intuitive.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.240]   For that reason?
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:36.560]   - No, you had to think about it.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.400]   - You're right.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.240]   - The cost, though.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.680]   You gotta think about cost.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:40.680]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.840]   - All of the hardware to handle all of that process
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:47.560]   and power, but again, because you got this big 35 millimeter
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:50.560]   sensor pulling all of this extra light in to process.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.160]   That's a lot of data.
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:56.640]   That R5 can shoot up to 8K resolution.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:59.120]   That's a lot of data to process.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:07:59.960]   - Right.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:00.800]   - Of course, we're getting close.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:05.800]   I mean, this is, this phone is a thousand dollar phone.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.520]   It's only a quarter of the cost of the R5.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:12.360]   So, you know, that's an interesting question.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:16.080]   Certainly the processors in here are faster than the process
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.000]   in modern cameras, but.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.280]   - We talked about this on my Instagram today.
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.440]   I try to do it.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.240]   If y'all ain't following me on Instagram,
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.080]   why not?
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.920]   Follow me over there.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:30.280]   I just did a live stream just to chit chat
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.880]   with my people that follow me.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:33.160]   And we talked about this today,
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:36.320]   because Samsung, Apple and Google,
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:41.040]   they're making photography friendly for everybody
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.400]   and allowing you to just literally pick your phone up
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.720]   and hit the button one time.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.200]   And you got a pretty good shot.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.120]   Someone mentioned in the comments, they said,
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.760]   you know, I went from smartphone photography
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:54.920]   to buying a DSLR and shooting,
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:58.240]   and I was way better on my smartphone for a while.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.240]   You know, because it's so much easier.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.080]   - Yeah.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.240]   Yeah.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.480]   - That makes a lot of sense.
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:06.280]   Well, I just, I was wondering.
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.120]   So we'll see.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.520]   I mean, why didn't Mark Levoig go to Nikon or Canon?
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.480]   Maybe they could have used him better,
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:14.760]   but certainly Adobe is trying to find ways
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:17.600]   to stay relevant in a world where there's a lot more
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.240]   competition for the creative cloud than ever before.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.080]   - Oh yeah.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:21.920]   Oh yeah.
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.720]   - Let's take a little break, come back with more
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:24.600]   Aunt Pruitt's here.
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.520]   He's, as you can tell, our photographer,
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.440]   hands-on photography, hands-on wellness as well,
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.040]   'cause he's also fit.
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:31.880]   I hate him.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.120]   (both laughing)
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:34.960]   - He's young.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:35.800]   I don't like that at all.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.400]   - I am the, I'll go ahead and tell you,
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:40.040]   I am the most unhealthy, healthy person
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:41.640]   you know, Mr. Report.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.240]   You should see Marvikyu.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.680]   - Oh yeah, Mr. Marvikyu.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.560]   - Oh, the Marvikyu.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.000]   Ice cream every day, pie every day.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.560]   But you can do it 'cause you,
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.200]   all that hard work gives you that freedom.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.680]   - If I lift every day, could I eat pie every day?
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:57.440]   'Cause I would do that.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.320]   I will neither confirm or deny.
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.360]   (both laughing)
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.560]   Jarvis is also here from CUNY
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.760]   and of course Buzzmachine.com
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:08.120]   and the wonderful Stacey Higginbotham.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.320]   Do you have another event coming up Stacey?
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:11.320]   I think you do, don't you?
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.160]   - It does indeed.
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.000]   - Next Tuesday.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.160]   - Ooh, is it too late to sign up?
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:20.000]   - No, you can go to Stacey on IOT.com/connected
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.880]   and you can sign up for everything is connected
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.600]   and it is both panels and round tables
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.880]   where you can participate and share your thoughts
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.120]   and advice with others.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.320]   You need to get the Lego guys to sing
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.800]   everything is connected.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.640]   Connected.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.480]   (both laughing)
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.360]   - I think that was Tegan and Sarah.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.640]   - Was that Tegan and Sarah?
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.480]   - Oh.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.320]   - Where everything is awesome?
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.160]   - Yeah.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.160]   - Oh.
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.920]   - Anyway.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.280]   - Why do y'all know that?
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.240]   (both laughing)
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.600]   - I have a kid whose favorite movie was The Lego Movie.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:49.720]   - Was it a good movie out here?
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:50.560]   I haven't seen it yet.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.720]   - It is, it's a great movie.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:52.560]   - Yeah.
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.640]   - I don't see animated movies much anymore.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.640]   I can't understand.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.880]   Oh yeah, I don't have kids.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.080]   - Our show day brought to you by Zendesk.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.120]   Look, service is everything.
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.080]   We say it again and again.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.400]   No matter what business you're in,
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.120]   if you have customers, then it's important
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:13.080]   your relationships with your customers be impeccable.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.360]   And that's what Zendesk does.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.960]   It's a service for CRM company
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:18.320]   that builds software design
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.560]   to improve customer relationships
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.000]   and no better time to do it than right now.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.200]   We were talking earlier, there are some companies
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.080]   who will thrive in this environment
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.760]   and some that will fail.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:29.880]   I could tell you one thing,
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.920]   the companies that do well in this environment
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:35.320]   will do well because they build the relationship,
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.380]   the rapport with their customers.
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:41.480]   Zendesk is here to help you do exactly that.
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:44.360]   Right now, just in the nick of time,
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.560]   they're offering a six month,
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.840]   absolutely free remote support bundle.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:52.560]   It comes with all the tools your team needs to stay agile
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.400]   to keep connected with your customers.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.800]   In any way your customers want email, phone, chat,
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:00.400]   community form, help center, social media.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:05.040]   And yes, you can have all of that in hours, not weeks.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.320]   You can get up and running in hours, not weeks.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.120]   Zendesk was built on the most simple
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.320]   but yet most powerful idea of all.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.080]   Make customer service software that's easy to use
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.200]   and accessible to everyone
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.640]   with a single dynamic help desk interface.
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.160]   That means it's easy to implement,
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.600]   easy to learn and yet it's flexible.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.680]   It is future proof.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.720]   It can change as your needs change.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:30.920]   Works right out of the box
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.640]   and then as you get more comfortable with it,
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.040]   you can configure it.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.720]   They've got apps, they've got integrations
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.240]   with everything you're using right now.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.680]   That's why it's very popular with companies
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.720]   from any size, from startups to the biggest enterprises.
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.840]   That's because Zendesk scales with growth
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:50.920]   to ensure that powerful, innovative customer experiences
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.120]   are within reach for every company, no matter the size,
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.000]   no matter the industry, no matter what your ambition is.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.200]   I can tell you one thing your ambition ought to be
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.480]   to connect with your customers
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:02.240]   and that's what Zendesk is all about.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.720]   Ask Ben Chapman, he's the director.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:07.400]   What a title he has, director of client facing experience
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:10.320]   and analytics at Homebridge.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.400]   Chapman says, "Having all the customer data
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:15.280]   in a single place helps us to achieve a high
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.760]   and consistent level of customer satisfaction.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:20.320]   We can collaborate better
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.840]   and we have the visibility to see and report on everything.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.320]   Zendesk also improves security
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.880]   by allowing us to control access to sensitive content."
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.480]   That's really important too.
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.800]   Your customers are trusting you,
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:33.400]   you better be trustworthy Zendesk helps.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:34.720]   See all the companies they work with,
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:37.840]   the biggest in the business, the biggest.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.440]   Zendesk works with nearly everything everywhere,

[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:47.280]   hundreds of industries over 30 languages.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:50.800]   They know though that every customer is unique
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.680]   and every business is unique.
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.400]   That's why their products are flexible enough
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.600]   to pave the path that's best for you.

[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.480]   And honestly, I think the opportunity is
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.080]   so ripe right now,
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.200]   how you handle your customers.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.280]   They will remember this forever.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:25.680]   This is the chance for any brand to make or break it.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.360]   And we've seen a number of brands break it.
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.960]   So don't be that brand.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.120]   This is a chance.
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.200]   It really is zendesk.com/twit.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.760]   We thank you so much for their support.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:41.800]   Wanna talk about Facebook?
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.240]   What's going on with Facebook?
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.760]   Mark Zuckerberg says, "I don't have a deal.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.680]   What are you talking about?
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.960]   I don't have a deal with Trump.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.520]   No deal of any kind."
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.920]   That's ridiculous.
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.680]   Right.
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.120]   There's a deal and there's a deal.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:00.560]   And we know that probably there's a tacit,
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.040]   unspoken quid pro quo, right?
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:08.880]   It's interesting that for all of the heat conservatives
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:12.400]   and Trump especially are leveling it, say Twitter,
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.320]   it's not quite as negative about it.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:17.840]   Because Facebook is new as much too.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.440]   I mean, it's like, does Trump have a deal with Glenn Maxwell?
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:23.880]   To whom he sends his regards?
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:24.920]   Yeah. It's his former video.
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.440]   I wish you well, Glenn.
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:31.200]   That's, well, okay.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:33.840]   This is now we're getting political again, but.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:36.320]   They've always said, I mean, that's how mob bosses work too.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.640]   You're not explicit.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.320]   It's understood.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.160]   Understand.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:42.240]   That means that the threat is understood.
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.680]   It's understood.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.400]   It's a carrot and a stick.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.600]   There might be a carrot.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.640]   FTC.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.120]   (gasps)
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.120]   Yol.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:53.960]   What?
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:54.800]   Tesla's next to you.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.640]   That's our.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.680]   Gonna be built in Austin, Texas.
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:58.440]   Isn't that exciting?
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.280]   You wanna move back?
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.240]   Sorry.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.360]   No, no I do not.
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:04.200]   That's our breaking news sound people are gonna hang.
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.040]   That's the break.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.560]   Some people have a, have an old clattery teletype
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.720]   'cause the old days people like me.
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.000]   No, we have Stacy's.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.320]   (gasps)
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.240]   Dacking, breaking.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:17.160]   Tesla moving to Texas.
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:18.720]   Well, no, they're just opening a factor.
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.680]   No, it's just another factor.
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:23.160]   Well, you know, I,
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:27.760]   Yolanda's not, is not fond of Alameda County right now.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.080]   I can see him. Right, well, he may not be fond of Austin.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:32.760]   Being,
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:35.920]   but we'll see.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:39.360]   Five thousand jobs in Travis County.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.200]   That's pretty good.
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.640]   Yeah. That's great.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:44.280]   Would you buy another Tesla Stissie?
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.720]   I would lease another Tesla.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:48.520]   I'm not gonna let Elon's weirdness get in my way
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.080]   of it being an exo car. I was asking.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.480]   I like getting in my way.
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.400]   I did.
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:56.920]   I did 'cause if you just didn't like the car,
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:57.760]   it wasn't him.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:58.760]   You just didn't like the car.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:00.280]   I love my Model X.
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:01.160]   Lisa didn't.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.720]   That's really, that's what I added.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:03.640]   Oh, well then, you're like that.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:06.040]   Mommy and Abby ain't nobody.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.240]   It was a combination of factors, but that was one of them.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.280]   It was my car.
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.240]   She didn't have to like it.
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:13.480]   I said, if you don't like it, don't drive it.
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.000]   She, 'cause she said the car would attack her.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:20.200]   But I always felt a little nervous running autopilot
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.040]   and so forth.
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:24.520]   And I just, you know what the final straw was for me,
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.800]   and maybe they fixed this by now,
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:28.680]   was the long lead time on repair parts.
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:30.840]   Oh, I'd heard stories of people.
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.440]   No, I think that's actually worse.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.600]   Oh.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.920]   I don't.
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:35.760]   I'd heard stories about people
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.880]   who's windshield got broken and they couldn't drive the car
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.840]   'cause for months, 'cause they didn't have replacements.
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.760]   So that's not good.
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.320]   Anyway, I'm getting, either getting,
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.840]   now, okay, they're throwing some monkey wrenches my way.
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:50.440]   I really was excited about the Ford Mustang Monkey.
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:51.280]   Right.
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:55.960]   And now this new Volvo Polestar II sounds pretty sweet too.
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:57.400]   So I don't know.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.840]   I don't know.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.440]   But you're still planning on the Mustang.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.320]   Something electric by the end of the year.
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:03.160]   One way or the other.
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.240]   In the year.
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.080]   It's gonna be electric.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.880]   A little tune in in December to see what happens.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.520]   Yes, it's exciting.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.400]   When's your lease run out on your model?
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.880]   Yeah, I might've lost.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.640]   Oh, so I actually purchased mine.
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:14.560]   Oh, see?
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.400]   So why would you run?
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.120]   See, we never used a lease cars.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.160]   Well, the technology,
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.880]   and I tried to convince my husband
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:21.600]   that a lease would be better in this case,
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.000]   but he is a diehard.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.280]   We buy it, we own it till it,
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.200]   we would own our cars for 11 or 12 years.
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:29.480]   And then.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:30.880]   That's what I would do too.
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:33.160]   I always bought my cars,
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:36.040]   but Lisa convinced me that there's tax benefits
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.840]   to leasing it as a company car.
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.320]   Oh, well, we hadn't explored that.
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.760]   It was more just with technology
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:46.120]   buying a car doesn't make a lot of sense anymore.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.640]   Well, that was the other concern,
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.680]   especially in the early days of the Tesla.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.960]   This was the first Model X is,
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:53.840]   what about battery life?
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.680]   What's that gonna be like?
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:57.040]   Is it worth, you know, can you try?
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:58.320]   But I think now I would say
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.840]   that that car would go forever.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.160]   That car would go forever.
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.760]   As someone driving the 2013 model?
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.240]   No, no.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.480]   Your battery life isn't going down, is it?
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.000]   No, my battery life is fine.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.680]   That's not what's breaking down,
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:14.920]   but things like, I mean, it's a 3G car.
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:16.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:17.480]   So.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.400]   Yeah, did Techno, see that's the problem.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.880]   So we interviewed,
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:25.360]   oh, I can't remember his name,
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.920]   who wrote the book about Elon Musk, about Tesla.
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.320]   And he said, the real thing is,
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.480]   it's not a car company, it's a software company.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.560]   And so the development cycles,
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.480]   the technology cycles are much more
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.360]   the life cycle of software
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.560]   than they are of a car.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.800]   'Cause a car is, you know, it's a 10 year,
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.320]   takes five years to design,
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.160]   it's on the market for a decade,
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.320]   you own it for a decade, software,
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.400]   it's upgrade every five minutes.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.720]   And that's much more what the Tesla's like.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:53.760]   And since technology rushes along faster than cars do,
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.520]   I think it's an issue.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:56.360]   It's kind of.
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:02.240]   Does HD, or HD, no, does HD editor have a Subaru WRX from 2001?
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.640]   That's awesome.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:05.480]   You do.
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.040]   That is an amazing car.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.360]   My dad bought it,
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.280]   my brother stole it from him,
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.640]   and now people still offer to buy it off of them.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:13.480]   Really?
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:14.320]   Okay, that's all.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.800]   HD editor in our chat room,
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.640]   my SuB is 2001.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.800]   My, it's funny.
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:20.640]   It's so good.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:25.720]   Hey, they used to run the rally car races with those cars.
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:28.720]   My ex-wife and my son both own SuB's.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:30.120]   They love their Subaru's.
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.400]   Being in the Pacific Northwest,
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.760]   that is my next car.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.600]   Isn't it?
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.320]   If you do that, you have to get a dog.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:37.920]   I think that's the deal though, right?
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:38.760]   I have a dog.
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:39.760]   Oh, perfect.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.560]   You don't see the dog anymore.
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.960]   She's a dog there?
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.800]   She's not in the office right now,
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.200]   but she was earlier and then she's nine.
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:50.520]   Okay.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:51.800]   Okay.
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:52.720]   Just run.
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.240]   If you want to get her stuffed.
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.800]   Wait.
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:57.800]   Hey, oh.
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:02.440]   We'll keep that in mind.
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:05.920]   I don't think we want to commemorate my dog this way, right?
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.400]   Just right there.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:10.360]   She would be cute and adorable.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.880]   We'd start her curled up in a ball
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.760]   and we could put a little spark in speaker in there.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.760]   No, she should have her ears perked up.
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:17.920]   Yeah, perfect.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.600]   Not rushing you along by any means.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.240]   I'm just saying.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:25.840]   I'll have her stuffed and sent you the bill.
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.240]   Cars to get on that.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:30.400]   Let me help the dog.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.960]   I'm offended.
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.920]   We'd wait till she died, Jeff.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:36.760]   Well, Lord, they're already planning to stuff.
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:37.760]   Whoa, how's her?
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:40.040]   They're going to put me right over in this corner here.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.800]   I'll be standing with my arms folded,
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.920]   looking over all the shows.
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:49.680]   The FTC's,
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:50.640]   according to sources,
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.040]   the FTC's antitrust probe of Facebook
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.640]   is going to at least go to next year.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:59.720]   And part of it will be the
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:05.840]   Giffy and the Giffy acquisition.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:06.680]   I don't know how to say it.
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:09.480]   The Yiffy acquisition.
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:11.480]   Is that a gifty?
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:12.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.680]   Well, no, I know what it is, but I don't want, I don't.
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.400]   I don't want to offend people like saying Giffy
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.960]   and then they say it's Giffy or say Giffy
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:18.960]   and then they say it's Giffy.
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:19.800]   It's Giffy.
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:20.640]   It's Giffy.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.480]   It's Giffy.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:22.480]   Just accept it.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.600]   Just see.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:25.440]   Also.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.920]   Do you have a opinion on this?
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:30.320]   I say it the same way the man had invented it.
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.080]   So he says, no, he's wrong.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.080]   He had a chance.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.520]   No, I'm just over it.
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:37.600]   No, no, I don't want to leave you to have the tie breaking.
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.080]   He does not have to be really tied.
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.680]   No, because it's too it'd be too.
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:44.200]   That's why I say Yiffy.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.760]   That's neither Giffy.
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:47.960]   It's like heroes.
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.640]   It's like heroes, not gyros.
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:50.400]   You're a hero.
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:50.880]   You're a hero.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:51.880]   Yiffy.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.640]   I pronounce it.
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:54.840]   And Yiffy.
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.640]   The memory hogs is what they're called.
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:57.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.640]   All right.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:00.640]   All right.
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:01.640]   All right.
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.640]   What we're talking about antitrust on Facebook.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:05.640]   And that's how exciting it was.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:06.640]   Nobody cares.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.640]   So how about Eric Schmidt starting at university?
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.640]   But no, he's not starting.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:14.640]   He's asking for federal funds for a university, which I'm like.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.640]   But even so.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:18.640]   He wants to start the Digital Service Academy.
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:24.640]   We compete with Stanford and MIT to train artificial intelligence coders.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:33.280]   It's actually a federal commission led by ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, plus former Deputy
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.920]   Secretary of Defense Robert O. Work.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:39.360]   So this is, you know, this is a government thing.
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:44.040]   It would be the US Digital Service, which by the way, our good friend Matt Cutts is the
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:45.040]   administrator of.
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:51.440]   It would be the US Digital Service Academy, an accredited degree awarding university that
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:57.680]   trains students to digital skills like cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:58.680]   I think that's great.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:23:59.680]   Great year.
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:00.680]   It's like Google.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:06.840]   So Google last week announced a hundred thousand scholarships to train people for certificates
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:10.400]   and data analytics, project management, UX.
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:14.480]   So as somewhat of teachers at university, should I be nervous?
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:15.480]   No.
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:16.480]   Why?
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.200]   Because they're competing with us.
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:19.200]   No.
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:20.200]   Well, okay.
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:22.080]   That's a capitalistic way of looking at it.
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.080]   Think about it this way.
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:24.560]   Well, I am that.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:31.520]   If you want to keep the United States on the cutting edge, we've always said this.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:32.520]   Education is critical.
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:35.720]   And we've got to do that.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:36.720]   Okay.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.720]   And there'll be protectionist.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:39.720]   CUNY is very good.
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.400]   I admit I'm being protectionist right now.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:44.400]   CUNY is very good, but we could have more.
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:49.400]   And especially, I would say especially, if these are government funded with the goal
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:51.840]   of adding diversity to the workplace.
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:54.000]   Which was the Google certainly is.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000]   Need.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000]   Base it on need.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.120]   Encourage black, young men and women.
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.560]   Encourage women in general.
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:09.800]   I think it would be a really great idea because I think it's there's in my mind, that's the
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:14.920]   kinds of things governments should do is really foster education because it helps the economy
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:15.920]   in the long run.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:19.360]   I can tell you we need money right now.
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.360]   We're suffering.
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:25.560]   Well, and yeah, I think it's competitive to people like you though.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.680]   It feels like it's not a four year school.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:33.480]   That's because I teach something useless and there really isn't a crisis of journalism
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:35.480]   in the United States.
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.120]   We're not.
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:39.120]   I think it's okay there.
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:42.880]   Are there a lot of H1B journalists being brought in?
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:45.920]   I actually have several friends in the journalism world.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:51.080]   I have four of probably the hundred people I've worked with.
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.360]   So I guess it's not a huge percentage.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.920]   But who were here on H1B?
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:58.080]   And these is interesting.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.080]   Interesting.
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.080]   Interesting.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.960]   I always want to say HB ones, but no.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:05.480]   I saw the the stats for H1B's.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:10.680]   It's a huge percentage like almost half of them go to go to Google and Facebook.
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:11.680]   Google.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:12.680]   Yeah.
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:21.600]   That's the there's history last week about the Indian cast coming to Google was fascinating
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.520]   that there's discrimination within Google.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:28.600]   One cast to another and the Americans don't really have a sense of what's going on.
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.320]   Oh, yeah, this was crazy.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.040]   This actually happened when I was a college.
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:45.960]   And we had a one I grew up in Houston, huge Indian American, Indian, Native immigrant community.
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:53.240]   And so this was actually something that happened like in my high school a little bit.
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:56.960]   But in college, it was a big deal in the dorm I lived in.
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:01.760]   And it was like totally under anybody's radar who wasn't Indian.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:07.760]   So California, state of California, this month, suits Cisco alleging discrimination based
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:13.720]   on India's caste system and engineer face discrimination because he was in the Dalit
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.120]   class, Dalit class.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.920]   Was it maybe it wasn't Google or Cisco?
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:17.920]   Maybe I screwed that up.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:23.880]   Dalits are you may remember then more as the term untouchables, which is not, I guess,
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:27.160]   no longer is the cast system still around?
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.960]   I didn't even know.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:29.960]   Yeah.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:32.160]   This is the demonstration of it.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.680]   People still try to draw it out of you.
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:35.480]   They try to ask things and said the story.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:41.200]   And people like I have a friend who was in the Brahmin, the priestly cast, and he would
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:42.680]   let you know.
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.840]   And we would tease him about it because we thought it was absolutely hilarious, but
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:51.640]   it was actually very important to him.
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:57.360]   So two men who were Cisco supervisors and higher cast are named in the suit for discriminating
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:02.520]   and against and harassing the lower cast employee.
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:06.480]   The lower cast employee received less pay and fewer opportunities.
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:12.160]   He opposed unlawful practices contrary to the traditional order, but between the Dalit
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:17.120]   and higher cast, the defendants retaliated against him.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.400]   Wow, that's an interesting cultural challenge.
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.400]   By the way, I apologize.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:23.200]   It wasn't Google or Cisco.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.200]   That's an interesting challenge.
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:27.640]   Big data, that's good stuff.
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:34.560]   Yeah, if you hang out with people who are Indian for long enough, these things, you find them
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.240]   out little aside and things.
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:42.760]   I will never, you can never underestimate the human ability to discriminate on the stupidest
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:45.280]   of premises.
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:47.480]   It's amazing.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:53.200]   It just feels like it's built in somehow and with some weird way into our...
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.200]   You said what I was thinking.
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:56.960]   It's just like dumbest stuff.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.440]   It's just another thing.
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.440]   Just another thing.
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:00.440]   And they're all fictions.
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.320]   They're all fictions.
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:05.840]   The Irish hated the Italians.
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.680]   The Jews hated the Irish.
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.880]   I mean, it's just nonstop.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.880]   Just ridiculous.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:18.320]   I think I'll just grow up to be a dog instead of a human.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.320]   Yeah.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:24.880]   I think it's on, but dogs have strong feelings about other dogs if you encounter their dogs
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:26.400]   that are very snob.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.800]   Well, everybody hates toxins.
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:30.040]   I mean, that's just normal.
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.400]   No, Chihuahuas.
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.440]   Chihuahuas are just...
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:36.440]   No, we don't hate Chihuahuas.
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:38.440]   We love them.
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:41.680]   There's that text from Michael Sargent.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:47.520]   Well, meanwhile, speaking of ridiculous things, Amazon...
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:55.920]   Or, I mean, the EU is going after a series and company for antitrust.
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:57.920]   Why?
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:01.760]   The fact that they've gone after so many means that there's a lot, means that there's not
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:02.760]   antitrust.
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:03.760]   No antitrust, right?
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:04.760]   Right.
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:05.760]   Right.
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:06.760]   Three.
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:07.840]   They're not just going after...
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:09.840]   So let us be clear.
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:10.840]   Okay.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:11.840]   Funesist.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:16.280]   Accuracy is not good for ratings.
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:18.120]   Okay, go ahead.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:22.000]   So they're going after the digital assistance.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.680]   There are three.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:27.760]   There are also lots of companies that want to get into this, including big ones like Samsung
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:29.680]   who weren't able to.
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:30.680]   And the question...
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:31.680]   They tried because they...
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:32.680]   They tried.
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:33.680]   They sucked.
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:34.680]   Yeah, top of the keys.
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:35.680]   Now, hold on.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.680]   Hold on.
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:37.680]   Hold on.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.680]   Okay.
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:39.680]   Okay.
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:43.840]   The EU, one, looks at competition a little bit differently from the US.
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:44.840]   We have to remember that.
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:49.880]   They look at not just, are you hurting the consumer, but they also look at ease of entry
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:53.120]   from other people into the market.
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:31:00.000]   And there, they do have kind of a case because you have market or network effects for the
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.920]   number of devices or the developer ecosystem for these things.
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:12.400]   And their questions are actually more around, like, does the data aggregation that these
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:18.320]   companies get by virtue of being number one precluded others from winning in this market
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:21.200]   or ever coming to fight in this market?
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:25.440]   And I think that's actually a really interesting and relevant question that we should be asking.
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:26.440]   I agree.
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:27.440]   So...
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:28.440]   I agree.
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:29.440]   EU, though, really is willing...
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:34.160]   The EU really is willing to weigh in to what here in the United States, we'd say, well,
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:36.160]   let the markets decide.
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:41.400]   Well, the market is not doing the best job at a lot of things.
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:42.600]   And I'm just going to leave it there.
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:47.320]   Why would you admit that the market's not doing a bad job of picking winners in voice
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:50.640]   assistance, but you're right, the market is not doing a good job.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.920]   In fact, it fosters data acquisition.
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:56.720]   We don't have any viable...
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:57.880]   Well...
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:01.200]   We don't have competitive viable options that protect our privacy.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:07.440]   We are not actually having a good discussion about things like interoperability between
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:11.640]   these platforms until those platforms actually came to the table on their own because they
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:14.040]   were like, "Oh, we're not selling enough to people."
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:17.680]   So yes, in that way, the market was like, "Oh, maybe interoperability matters."
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:20.840]   But I would argue that...
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:22.720]   You know, uh-oh.
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:28.040]   There's never in the US been legislated interoperability between Mac and Windows.
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:29.040]   I know.
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:33.240]   But is interoperability a part of this whole chip alliance?
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:36.960]   Yes, and that's what I'm talking about.
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:37.960]   Yeah.
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:41.240]   They came up with that last December because they were disappointed that the market was
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:43.600]   not adopting smart home stuff.
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.680]   They were like, "Oh my gosh, people..."
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:46.680]   The market at work.
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:49.520]   Well, and that's what I said, that's the market at work.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:50.520]   Okay.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:57.440]   The terms of that market are being dictated by the leaders as opposed to incumbents and
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.400]   new people with ideas.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:03.720]   So you could argue that once you're at the top, you're just dictating the terms of the
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:04.920]   market to everyone.
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:08.520]   I would love to see somebody come up with some sort of privacy protecting...
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:09.520]   Well...
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:10.520]   Additional assistance.
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:13.800]   That's the idea of Siri and Apple.
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:18.160]   It's inherently difficult to do because the more I know about you, the better my assistant
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:20.500]   will be, your assistant will be.
[01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:27.280]   But I think Apple has seen the market value of becoming the privacy leader.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:28.280]   Right?
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:29.280]   It was accidental.
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:34.440]   It was completely accidental because they couldn't do the ad business.
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:37.440]   But they made lemonade out of that lemon.
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:40.440]   But that's not a scribe to take the virtue.
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.880]   And you're still locking people into this...
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:47.200]   You're still locking people into the high priced Apple ecosystem that has historically
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:50.980]   been not friendly to any outsiders.
[01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:55.940]   And if you were a developer working within the Apple ecosystem, you actually had to deal
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:58.100]   with some onerous terms.
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:00.540]   They've started to walk some of them back.
[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:01.900]   You do have to give up your...
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:03.900]   If you're in the app store, if you're 30%.
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:10.940]   Well, but again, I think the market is weighing in on that as well.
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:22.120]   I think around things like privacy, data retention, penalties for not leaks, hacks, and sharing
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:23.120]   people's dangers.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:25.680]   Thank you.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:28.720]   I think that the government has a role to play there.
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:33.920]   And I think they've abdicated that role for a decade or more.
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:35.080]   I have been so...
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:39.000]   Look, I am not the anti-government, no government, low government guy.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000]   I never have been.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.180]   And even more now, we're seeing the value of a coherent government in some situations.
[01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.740]   That's very clear.
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:55.940]   But I have to say the government's intervention in technology has historically not been well...
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:57.140]   It's been heavy handed.
[01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:58.140]   It's been...
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:34:59.140]   No nuts.
[01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:00.140]   It's been wrong.
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:03.580]   And that's the US.
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:04.900]   Late inevitably.
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:10.520]   But look what the government's trying to do is ban encryption right now.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:13.000]   I don't want the government to get...
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:19.900]   I agree, a sane, rational government as an expression of the will of the people would
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:22.040]   say something about privacy.
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:23.040]   But I don't think...
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.040]   I think that...
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:25.040]   I don't know.
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:29.920]   It's not that we should try and talk them into it, but it seems futile.
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:34.980]   And it's just because government also is such a mismatch between the pace of innovation
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:38.360]   and technology and the pace of legislation and government.
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:39.360]   You know what?
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.960]   We say this, but we could move faster.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:42.960]   And we could be better.
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:43.960]   We shouldn't.
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:44.960]   We shouldn't.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:47.600]   I mean, there's good reason for government to be slow.
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.920]   There is good reason for government to be slow.
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:52.000]   Right now, I think we're a little too slow.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.960]   I also think that we're...
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:59.480]   We just shrug our shoulders and we're like...
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.280]   It's kind of like systemic racism in the sense like we're like, "Who can slow?"
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:03.800]   No, we should do something about it.
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:04.960]   I agree.
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:08.080]   But we have to start not by saying, "You know, there ought to be a government law."
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:13.800]   What we have to start by doing is getting money out of politics so that these incumbents
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:15.840]   cannot influence the law.
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:17.560]   You can't mumble that.
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:18.560]   Yeah.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:23.520]   The systemic problem goes so low that we got to fix that before you can say, "Well, I
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.480]   think government could solve these privacy issues."
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:29.040]   Yeah, they could in a perfect world, as I said, if a government reflected the will of
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.040]   the people.
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:32.440]   I don't agree that we need to wait for the world to be perfect.
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:39.000]   You can actually see pushback from citizens groups and privacy groups pushing back against
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000]   industry.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.560]   And yes, we're going to get compromises and not everyone's going to be happy.
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:44.760]   But it's a start.
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:49.160]   And from there, you can look at court cases, you can come back and have...
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:54.640]   You can appoint people to regulatory commissions that oversee this to actually take action.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:58.960]   You know, there's a lot of flexibility that will come in once we have a law.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:00.680]   Even if that law isn't perfect.
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:02.560]   Well, that's a good point.
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:08.280]   In the California Privacy Act, which is now rolling out, started July 1st, we're starting
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.840]   to see some, I think, beneficial effects from it.
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:14.520]   It started January, actually.
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:18.160]   They decided to start enforcing it on...
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:22.480]   The DA said he would start enforcing it as of July 1st.
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:25.000]   I know this is a tiny quibble, but it's worth...
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.760]   Well, nobody paid attention to it until this month, and then all of a sudden...
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:31.600]   I'm noticing some effects.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.360]   You paid attention to it.
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:34.880]   And as a California, I paid attention.
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:39.160]   Actually, the guy who came up with it, I think you told me this, the guy who came up with
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:43.920]   it and was defeated by the legislature that said, "Oh, God, no, we can't let you do this,"
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:45.560]   is back.
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:50.280]   He had made a deal, "Okay, I'll take my initiative off the ballot since you're going to do it."
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:51.600]   Legislature did their thing.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:55.440]   And I guess he's not happy because it's back on the ballot in November.
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:59.160]   And it's a much more draconian privacy.
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:01.800]   I should look into it so I know how to vote.
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:04.080]   I just ask you, "Would you do that for me, Stacey?"
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:05.360]   I'm going to look at that.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:11.240]   I have to look at it anyway.
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:17.120]   Let me see if we can look it up.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:18.600]   It's coming in November.
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:19.600]   Prop 20...
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.040]   I know what you're talking about.
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:22.440]   I just haven't seen the...
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:25.520]   It'll be one of our fabulous propositions.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:26.680]   Is this the one?
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:34.040]   California Personal Information Law and Agency Initiative, Prop 24.
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:37.880]   Expand the state's consumer data privacy laws, including provisions to allow consumers to
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:42.400]   direct businesses not to share their personal information.
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:47.840]   Removes the time period in which businesses can fix violations before being penalized and
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:48.840]   create...
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:50.400]   In other words, do it right now and creates the privacy.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:51.400]   Reminds.
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:57.720]   Well, creates the privacy protection agency to enforce the state's consumer privacy laws.
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:58.720]   Right.
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:38:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:02.120]   So it's even more extreme.
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:03.120]   It's just...
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:09.160]   We don't like the big companies and we're going to find another way to go after them.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.000]   What does it really add in protection?
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.720]   It's not there.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.960]   This is Alastair McTaggart.
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:18.200]   Now, can I use a Scottish accent for him?
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:19.200]   No.
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:21.200]   Alastair McTaggart, San Francisco...
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:23.000]   What if he's not Scottish?
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]   With a name like Alastair McTaggart.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000]   I know.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000]   Alastair McTaggart.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:33.440]   Is a San Francisco-based real estate developer who filed this ballot initiative back in 2018.
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:39.440]   It was withdrawn after the California State Legislature passed it.
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.600]   I enjoy hearing Leo.
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.520]   I enjoy that accent.
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:44.800]   So it's a problem.
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:47.800]   It feeds to me.
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:57.360]   He said, "The CCPA of 2018 is a great baseline, but I think their additional rights Californians
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:58.360]   deserve."
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:39:59.560]   You're too good at this.
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.560]   You guys are shit.
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.560]   There is.
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.560]   Yeah.
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:05.240]   The only thing I want to make sure is they can't undo the act.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:08.280]   There's basically unlimited resources on one side of the fight.
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:10.760]   If you don't do anything, they'll win eventually.
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:11.760]   So you know what?
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:12.760]   I don't...
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:14.960]   It sounds like his heart's in the right place.
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:19.400]   You could correct inaccurate personal information on requests you can obtain permission.
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:23.960]   You have to obtain permission from a parent or guardian before obtaining information about
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:25.120]   kids younger than 13.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:26.200]   We've always had that.
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:28.160]   And those are in GDPR.
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.160]   Yeah.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:33.520]   Obtain permission before collecting data from consumers who are younger than 16, so they're
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.440]   going to expand that.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:39.360]   Provide consumers with an opt-out option for having their sensitive personal information.
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:42.960]   Does defined-in-law users are disclosed for advertising or marketing?
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:45.000]   Fair enough.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:51.600]   And businesses may not share a consumer's personal information if the consumer so requests it.
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:57.400]   That seems like that's already in the CCPA.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:58.920]   I thought so.
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:40:59.920]   Yeah.
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:00.920]   Hmm.
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:03.760]   Some of those things, the CCPA is not all of that.
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:04.760]   There is now...
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:06.040]   There would be if this passes.
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:08.080]   And by the way, I expect it will.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:13.280]   A California Privacy Protection Agency.
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:14.640]   And oh, here's the thing.
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:19.640]   It removes the ability of businesses to fix violations before being penalized.
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:20.800]   So there's no warning.
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:23.800]   So that I think is ridiculous.
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:26.840]   It's like you're going to penalize.
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:27.840]   You did it.
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:28.840]   We're trying to penalize you.
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:31.960]   We're trying to see you slip up and penalize you.
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:34.680]   What's the point of the law, the point is to get the right behavior.
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:37.600]   So if you get the right behavior, that should be a success.
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:38.920]   Petalties are at the point.
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:42.760]   But that's the way we tend to look at it in America in so many ways.
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:48.440]   And of course, as California goes somewhat, goes the world because we're a big economy
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:52.240]   and companies want to get into California.
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.240]   So...
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:54.800]   Alistair, I'm with you.
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:57.880]   I'm with you, Ladi.
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:02.840]   He says, especially post-COVID people are going to be more sensitive to privacy concerns.
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:10.240]   I feel strongly and polling shows Californians want more control over their information.
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:12.240]   The story's going on twice as long as it otherwise is.
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:14.440]   I know, just because of the ex and all right, I'll stop.
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:15.840]   We can talk about case of...
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:18.040]   I'll stay there waiting there for us.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:24.400]   I have a great story that's built for Stacey Higginbotham, made for Stacey.
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:25.400]   And I'm going to do that next.
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:26.400]   I'm mistaken.
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:27.400]   I know what it is.
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.360]   But first, I want to talk about Roman.
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:32.560]   Now look, I know you, Jeff.
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:36.640]   And I understand how important this is.
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:37.640]   Guys...
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:39.440]   I have discussed it on this very show.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.440]   Absolutely.
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:42.320]   And it's not just ED.
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:47.080]   Guys are not good about going to the doctor now, good about getting health care.
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:51.480]   I bet you, Anne, I bet you, Queen Pruitt, kind of is pushing you out the door saying,
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:53.160]   "Would you go to the doctor?"
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:58.360]   But I know, Anne, as a kid, that you were brought up, I bet you anything.
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:00.360]   There's no crying in baseball.
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:03.360]   Rub it, don't show any pain.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:04.840]   Put some dirt on it, right?
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:05.840]   I plead a fifth.
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:08.280]   Yeah, no, I bet.
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:11.000]   That's why we guys, we're supposed to be stoic.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.480]   But that's not necessarily the best for our health.
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.480]   So true.
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:15.480]   Yeah.
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:16.880]   So we put up with it.
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:19.560]   And that's what's so cool about Roman.
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:23.920]   They spent the last few years building this digital platform.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:28.360]   Literally, a health clinic for men online that can connect you with a doctor licensed
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:29.360]   in your state.
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.760]   It's a digital doctor, and it's real medical care.
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:33.720]   I want to really emphasize that.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:35.800]   This is not a prescription mill.
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:36.800]   This is not overseas.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.040]   You're going to get genuine medication.
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:43.720]   You're going to get genuine care from a real doctor.
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:48.880]   And I have to tell you, when it comes to sexual health, this can be very embarrassing.
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:53.480]   Anybody who's dealt with erectile dysfunction knows it's hard to talk about it in person,
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:54.480]   right?
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:56.000]   But this is a great way to do it.
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.320]   It's a simple, convenient solution to get the treatment you deserve and need without
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:02.040]   leaving your home.
[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:03.040]   Thanks to Roman.
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:08.360]   And it's not just sexual health, hair and skin, dandruff and eczema, daily health, prostate
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:09.520]   health, bone health.
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:13.960]   I've been taking, you know, as you get older, testosterone drops, I've been taking there.
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:17.800]   And these are over the counter testosterone supplements, herbs and things, and they're
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:18.800]   great.
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:19.800]   I love it.
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:21.320]   They have medicine too.
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:26.600]   And that's what's great for a variety of masculine conditions.
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:30.440]   No need to shame, be shameful, no need to suffer.

[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:34.040]   And we thank Roman so much for supporting our show.
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:38.080]   So SoftBank, it's been a lot of money.
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:39.080]   This is the story for SACC.
[01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:42.720]   This is the one I wanted when I saw this and put it, I said, I want to hear what Stacey
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:44.400]   has to say about this.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:49.360]   They spent a lot of money, $32 billion to buy Arm, not so long ago, a couple of years
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:50.360]   ago, 2016.
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:51.360]   Four years ago.
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.360]   Yeah.
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:53.360]   2016.
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:57.080]   And they had this little thing called, we work.
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:03.480]   It didn't work and they lost a lot of money and they're trying, they're thinking IPO, they're
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:07.200]   thinking sale, but this is the really interesting story.
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:12.320]   And you know, I don't know how much this rumor is real.
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.320]   I don't know what the regulatory issue is.
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:15.320]   They hired a bank.
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:19.000]   No, I know that that's what SoftBank is doing with Arm.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:26.840]   But the rumor is, Nvidia is actively seeking to acquire Arm.
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:32.520]   So this is interesting because Nvidia does have an Arm license and Nvidia is-
[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:35.200]   They got the money.
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:36.920]   So they have the money.
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:42.240]   They don't have an application processor business, which is Arm's big business right
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:43.240]   now.
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:46.800]   Arm's chip designs, it doesn't actually make chips.
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:49.080]   It only designs them and license them out to other chip.
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:52.520]   Which by the way is Nvidia's business as well, isn't it?
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:55.560]   No, Nvidia actually- Okay.
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.120]   They're a fabulous semiconductor.
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:46:58.680]   Fabulous, I mean.
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:00.800]   When you're fabulous, you design your own chip.
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:02.960]   So Nvidia does design its own GPUs.
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:05.600]   It has its own architectures for those.
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:08.800]   And then it contracts out to have the manufacturer.
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:11.400]   Arm actually does not design a chip.
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:16.040]   They design the architecture and they license that out to companies who design the actual
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:17.040]   chip.
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:21.280]   And then those- So that's what Arm does.
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:24.560]   The Arm's architecture has competed forever.
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.800]   Okay, maybe since the early 90s, late 90s, sometime in the 90s.
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:31.520]   That's forever.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:32.520]   They were designed.
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:33.520]   Yeah.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:36.920]   Stacey was about a year old then, yeah, to her.
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:37.920]   It's forever.
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:41.320]   To me, it's yesterday, but go ahead.
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:46.400]   And they were actually designed, Apple actually was- Apple and Acorn were one of the founding
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:52.640]   creators and funders of the original Arm architecture was designed to be lower power
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:54.880]   and for general purpose compute.
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:59.800]   Intel on the other hand was like, "We will be GPUs and we will suck all the power and
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:02.320]   we will be powering your PCs."
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:03.320]   And that worked for a while.
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:05.720]   And then Arm came up when smartphones became big.
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:09.440]   They had the low power for any battery power devices.
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:14.160]   But they also made microcontrollers, which are in the Internet of Things.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:16.320]   And so that's why SoftBank bought them.
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:23.040]   SoftBank bought them because they saw that power consumption- Power was not the big issue.
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.760]   Power consumption was.
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:27.320]   And Arm has a lock on that.
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:28.320]   Intel's trying.
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:29.320]   They're not going anywhere.
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:31.400]   And there's also the rise of graphics chips.
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:41.360]   So if you look at NVIDIA, they have the hottest silicon for super high-end AI type computing.
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:44.440]   Graphics processors, they can just run a bunch of those.
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:46.160]   They're inside supercomputers, blah, blah, blah.
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:48.640]   So they've got the power unlock.
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:51.880]   Arm has the power savings unlock.
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:58.160]   So getting NVIDIA and Arm together is kind of like leaving Intel kind of in this middle
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:04.000]   gray area where I don't know whether that's going to be awesome or not.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.040]   So it makes sense.
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:13.920]   It would not cause the scrutiny, like an Intel ARM Collab would, because the two architectures
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:16.320]   would be very anti-competitive, I would assume.
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:22.720]   It also would possibly cause less consternation in the industry because ARM licenses their
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:30.720]   chips to Apple, Amazon, Google, Intel probably has a license, I don't know.
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:33.880]   Qualcomm, NXP, everybody in the chip industry.
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:39.320]   So if one other company bought, you know, ARM, they'd be like super competitive.
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:41.080]   You'd be like, "Ah, I don't want that."
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:45.880]   So NVIDIA is kind of interesting because they don't have a lot of head-to-head competition
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:48.640]   in the graphics space except for Intel.
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:55.440]   One of the reasons, and by the way, this story is from Bloomberg, Mark Gurman among others.
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:59.520]   And of course, we know him well from his Apple reporting for Bloomberg.
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:06.040]   One of the reasons this is credible is A, SoftBank did used to own a fairly big chunk
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:09.600]   of $4 billion stake in ARM.
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:12.040]   I'm not ARM in NVIDIA, I'm sorry.
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:14.120]   So they do have a relationship with NVIDIA.
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:17.600]   They no longer hold any NVIDIA stock, apparently.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:25.200]   So the reason ARM sold to NVIDIA back in 2016, I'm sorry, the reason ARM sold to SoftBank
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:31.080]   back in 2016 is because SoftBank wasn't considered in the space.
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:33.920]   It wasn't a competitor.
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:39.960]   So it was a logical sale because there was no regulatory issue with SoftBank owning them.
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:44.660]   I think there'd be more regulatory issue, at least NVIDIA is in the same business as
[01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:46.220]   ARM.
[01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:48.540]   But you're right, it's not any competitor.
[01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:53.660]   It's the most neutral of the people who have ARM licensees.
[01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:54.660]   Yeah.
[01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:56.300]   But I still don't think really.
[01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:58.520]   So, apparently SoftBank did also approach Apple.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:01.500]   That's maybe where Mark Gurman came in on this story.
[01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:03.180]   But Apple, I don't think, was interested.
[01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:05.100]   Apple does not typically do this.
[01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:07.140]   Like they do make money or lose money on this deal.
[01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:08.140]   Oh, they'll make money.
[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:10.740]   They bought it for $32 billion.
[01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:14.060]   It's probably gonna go for $100 billion, I would guess.
[01:51:14.060 --> 01:51:15.060]   Oh, wow.
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:16.060]   You really?
[01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:18.140]   Maybe not 100.
[01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:22.420]   There's a lot of upside to ARM now that Apple's gonna be--
[01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:23.420]   So, well, okay.
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:24.620]   That makes license-y, right?
[01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:28.220]   Well, Apple has been a licensee for a long time.
[01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:32.980]   I mean, the iPhone has an ARM-based application processor in it and has forever.
[01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:37.220]   And then they took an architecture license to build their own bionic or whatever they're
[01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:39.540]   calling their chips.
[01:51:39.540 --> 01:51:43.940]   So putting it in the MacBook, that's just kind of like, we knew that was gonna happen
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:44.940]   eventually, right?
[01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:45.940]   I don't know.
[01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:46.940]   I think it's--
[01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:47.940]   When I was saying--
[01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:48.940]   It's why I would say it is a big deal.
[01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:49.940]   You're right.
[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:50.940]   Obviously, Apple's not new to ARM.
[01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:52.660]   As you said, they found them.
[01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:56.820]   But it's a big deal because it's now gonna be in desktop computing.
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:59.780]   Also, we see other moves to putting it in servers.
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:02.900]   Intel is showing some real weakness.
[01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:05.620]   And I think that ARM has a big upside--
[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:08.700]   Well, maybe not 100 billion, but I think ARM has a big upside.
[01:52:08.700 --> 01:52:09.700]   Okay.
[01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:12.140]   ARM has been playing for servers and they're finally just starting.
[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:14.180]   They've been playing that game since 2010.
[01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:15.180]   Right.
[01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:16.180]   Okay.
[01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:19.940]   So it's 10 years in the making for them to actually get anywhere.
[01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:20.940]   And they're just starting.
[01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:23.020]   They're just starting to get the software inside.
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:29.200]   The challenge for ARM is actually gonna be risk five is a new architecture that is an
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:32.620]   open source architecture that's coming out.
[01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:37.340]   And we're seeing companies come back to ARM and say, "Hey, you know those licensing fees?
[01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:40.860]   I think they're a little high and we're evaluating doing a risk five processor."
[01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:43.340]   That ARM has been raising its licensing fees, have you?
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:44.340]   I know.
[01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:46.180]   And that's the squeeze for cash.
[01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:50.020]   So I really think it's--
[01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:51.620]   I also think there's a synergy.
[01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:56.620]   The market will see a real synergy with Nvidia because Nvidia doesn't have a--
[01:52:56.620 --> 01:52:59.100]   So you just unironically use the word synergy?
[01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:03.460]   I think this is one of the few places where it's safe to use.
[01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:05.260]   Let's open the kimono and take a look.
[01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:06.260]   Ooh.
[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:07.260]   Oh, my God.
[01:53:07.260 --> 01:53:10.740]   ARM actually has a graphics processor.
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:12.460]   They have the malle graphics processor.
[01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:13.620]   But they don't have a CPU.
[01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:16.140]   They don't have a general purpose processor.
[01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:17.140]   So ARM does--
[01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:19.100]   That's the abdation processor for cash.
[01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:20.100]   Nvidia doesn't.
[01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:21.100]   Nvidia doesn't.
[01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:22.100]   I'm sorry.
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:23.100]   Nvidia does not.
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:24.100]   But they have the one.
[01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:25.100]   So that's the synergy.
[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:30.620]   I think Nvidia-- and well, Nvidia's big business lately has been AI, which is a separate thing
[01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:32.220]   from what ARM's doing.
[01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:33.220]   I think--
[01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:34.220]   Right, Nvidia has the power.
[01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:35.220]   That's right.
[01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:36.220]   ARM has the power savings.
[01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:38.220]   There's the synergy, exactly.
[01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:41.260]   And I think it's conceivable that Nvidia would like to--
[01:53:41.260 --> 01:53:44.540]   Look, we've got a wounded player here.
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:47.580]   We've got Intel limping around.
[01:53:47.580 --> 01:53:53.300]   I think Nvidia sees this as a big opportunity to really jump way ahead.
[01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:56.020]   So I think you're going to have a high premium on this.
[01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:57.020]   But that's just me.
[01:53:57.020 --> 01:54:00.980]   I'm not exactly-- what happens to all the licensing that ARM has done?
[01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:03.180]   Does Nvidia try to shut that off or no?
[01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:04.180]   No, no, no, no.
[01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:05.180]   No, no, no.
[01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:06.180]   That's the money.
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:07.180]   That's the money.
[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:08.180]   Yeah, that's the money.
[01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:09.180]   You're right, OK.
[01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:11.180]   Yeah, they wouldn't be-- and truthfully, maybe it isn't as
[01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:13.740]   valuable because they wouldn't be getting any intellectual property.
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:15.540]   They don't already license.
[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:16.380]   I have access to.
[01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:18.100]   Right.
[01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:21.260]   They just become the collector of the license fees.
[01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:22.460]   But I think that there--
[01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:25.140]   I think it's worth more than $32 billion.
[01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:27.780]   I think it might be $2, if not $3,000.
[01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:31.180]   Yeah, $2,000 is about what I was thinking.
[01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:32.740]   Well, it's still a pretty hefty payday.
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:34.380]   Yeah, nice payday.
[01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:35.700]   They've earned it.
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:38.340]   They need it.
[01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:40.900]   How much did they lose on WeWork, you know?
[01:54:40.900 --> 01:54:43.900]   Oh, I passed by a lot of services.
[01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:45.940]   Oh, um, recently.
[01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:47.540]   How much did they write off?
[01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:50.460]   $6.5 billion loss.
[01:54:50.460 --> 01:54:52.420]   Phew.
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:55.460]   Right, so, you know, $60 million profit on--
[01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:57.300]   I'm going to make up for that.
[01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:58.380]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:55:03.500]   A $17.7 billion loss when you combine Uber.
[01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:05.260]   Oh, that's right.
[01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:06.260]   They are tied.
[01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:07.260]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:10.860]   Now, this is $100 billion fund, division fund.
[01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:14.620]   And they lost 17%, almost 18% of their value
[01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:17.660]   on two of their investments.
[01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:19.900]   So, yikes.
[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:23.500]   That's a record, 1.36 annual operating loss.
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:27.980]   And then here's a great picture of Amaseyoshi's son.
[01:55:27.980 --> 01:55:30.940]   With the graph, you never want to see.
[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:33.580]   It's like the politicians rule, never wear a hat.
[01:55:33.580 --> 01:55:34.100]   Yeah.
[01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:37.140]   Never stand in front of anything going down the arrow.
[01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:39.580]   Yeah.
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:41.460]   Now, truthfully, this slide is unfair,
[01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:43.620]   because you can see that there's more to it.
[01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:45.060]   There's a minus sign.
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:45.660]   Still.
[01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:47.100]   And there's an equal sign.
[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:48.460]   Moss, don't stand there.
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:49.820]   Don't stand there, boss.
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:51.100]   They should have.
[01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:53.100]   Sun-Son, please.
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:54.100]   Please.
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:55.580]   So, yeah.
[01:55:55.580 --> 01:55:57.220]   Interesting.
[01:55:57.220 --> 01:56:00.420]   Interesting.
[01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:01.900]   Do you think there'd be regulatory issues
[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:03.860]   with an invidi-acquisition of arm?
[01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:09.660]   I don't know.
[01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:11.780]   It depends on how they look at the chip market.
[01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:12.140]   Right.
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:12.980]   I'm guessing--
[01:56:12.980 --> 01:56:14.820]   It's still pretty competitive.
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:16.260]   Yeah, I don't think so.
[01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:20.420]   I mean, the issue really is, how will arms customers--
[01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:22.060]   how many of them will look at invidi-acquisition
[01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:27.420]   and feel threatened and then turn to their own processor?
[01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:31.060]   Well, and it may be those customers who yell on screen
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:34.900]   saying, we don't want invidi-acquisition.
[01:56:34.900 --> 01:56:38.900]   We don't think invidi is a good steward for these licenses.
[01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:41.820]   Did you know that Kosovo--
[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:43.460]   this must be your story?
[01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:43.980]   It is.
[01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:44.940]   I just found it fascinating.
[01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:47.580]   It was from Ben Evans' newsletter.
[01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:49.900]   Yeah.
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:52.260]   We actually-- I thought we had talked about this before.
[01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:52.820]   Oh, we didn't know.
[01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:53.660]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:55.180]   Maybe not.
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:57.220]   Tell me if you remember this.
[01:56:57.220 --> 01:57:01.180]   That a couple of years ago, electric clocks in Europe
[01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:04.500]   began falling behind.
[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:10.980]   They lost three minutes in January, three minutes in February.
[01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:13.380]   In March, the Brussels-based European Network
[01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:16.780]   of Transmission System Operators of Electricity
[01:57:16.780 --> 01:57:19.180]   issued an apology.
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:23.780]   The reason is these clocks are tied to the cycle, the 60
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:27.340]   hertz cycle, or maybe in Europe it's 50 hertz.
[01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:28.740]   I don't know what the cycle is.
[01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:30.140]   In the US it's 60 hertz.
[01:57:30.140 --> 01:57:35.140]   And so electric clocks in countries count on that regular
[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:39.660]   cycle to time themselves.
[01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:42.820]   Oven timers, alarm clocks, losing time
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:49.540]   because power is-- the grid is ratcheting their frequencies
[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:51.780]   up, actually down.
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:55.740]   And then they fractured them up to speed up the continental--
[01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:59.940]   the continent's clocks to fix it.
[01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:01.940]   They found out-- I think we had that story,
[01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:03.620]   but now we know why.
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:08.860]   The power fluctuations are being caused by Kosovo.
[01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:10.420]   East-- North Kosovo.
[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:11.780]   Is there a South Kosovo?
[01:58:11.780 --> 01:58:13.900]   OK, North Kosovo.
[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:17.540]   Since 2015, its major city, Mitrovica,
[01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:21.060]   have been under the control of Spurskalista, Amafia,
[01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:25.060]   masquerading as a political party.
[01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:26.540]   We know what that's like.
[01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:28.060]   I never heard of that before.
[01:58:28.060 --> 01:58:30.500]   Around the time Serbskal came to power,
[01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:35.300]   North Kosovo's electricity consumption surged,
[01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:38.820]   the region now requires 20% more power than it did five years ago.
[01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:39.260]   Why?
[01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:45.100]   Well, Bitcoin, Bitcoin and Ethereum rigs,
[01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:48.380]   Bitcoin miners had taken over the region
[01:58:48.380 --> 01:58:51.140]   from shabby apartment blocks of Mitrovica
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:57.260]   to the sellers of mountain villages, cryptocurrency mining.
[01:58:57.260 --> 01:58:59.260]   Because the power was free.
[01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:01.100]   Because they weren't charging for power.
[01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:03.860]   I love the-- is that your thunder there?
[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:04.340]   Yes, it is.
[01:59:04.340 --> 01:59:07.260]   You've got electricity coming out of the air, dude.
[01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:08.020]   Wow.
[01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:09.740]   Again, another storm.
[01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:12.100]   I know, I've done it again.
[01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:14.900]   Why is the electricity free in Kosovo?
[01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:17.540]   Because the party-- it's almost like kind of a Venezuela.
[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:21.900]   The party wanted to stay in charge of everything.
[01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:23.140]   The mob.
[01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:25.940]   And so they just made a whole bunch of stuff free.
[01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:26.700]   Oh, interesting.
[01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:27.700]   See, sometimes one.
[01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:29.380]   And so--
[01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:34.660]   Well, that's what-- who was it in Medellin?
[01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:37.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:37.780]   What's his name?
[01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:40.020]   Yeah, he would give people money to say, oh, this OK.
[01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:40.700]   I've got money.
[01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:41.420]   And there was a--
[01:59:41.420 --> 01:59:42.020]   I don't know what's next.
[01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:42.420]   --front cartel there.
[01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:45.060]   Yeah, actually, I think his name.
[01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:46.900]   Not El Chobbo, the guy I go for.
[01:59:46.900 --> 01:59:47.980]   Yeah, the guy I go for here.
[01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:48.900]   Narko, that's it.
[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:49.420]   Narko.
[01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:50.380]   Well, that's the name.
[01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:51.180]   Pablo Escobar?
[01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:51.660]   Ethkobar.
[01:59:51.660 --> 01:59:52.580]   Thank you, Pablo Escobar.
[01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:54.180]   Ethkobar.
[01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:55.020]   We watched--
[01:59:55.020 --> 01:59:58.100]   Lisa is such a fan of Narko shows
[01:59:58.100 --> 02:00:01.100]   that we have watched every version of the Pablo Escobar
[02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:01.620]   story.
[02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:02.380]   I know.
[02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:02.940]   I don't know why.
[02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:03.420]   Andrew, too.
[02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:05.620]   Pablo, you have a guy.
[02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:05.940]   Really?
[02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:08.220]   What is it about that fascination that's interesting?
[02:00:08.220 --> 02:00:09.740]   I don't know.
[02:00:09.740 --> 02:00:15.660]   He's fascinated by Mexican drug lords and Cold War CIA spies.
[02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:17.900]   I am a fan of that, actually.
[02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:19.180]   That goes to Jallakirre.
[02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:22.300]   Yeah, not in his--
[02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:23.820]   Anyway, so the party's in charge.
[02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:25.420]   So there's free power there.
[02:00:25.420 --> 02:00:28.820]   So the crypto people realize, what can you do with free power?
[02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:29.820]   Mine.
[02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:30.820]   Bitcoin.
[02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:31.820]   Cyber.
[02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:32.820]   It's Bitcoin.
[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:36.420]   So--
[02:00:36.420 --> 02:00:38.820]   It's Bitcoin going anywhere.
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:40.340]   Only up, buddy.
[02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:41.220]   Buy now.
[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:44.620]   In fact, I have a wallet you could buy for--
[02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:45.660]   It's a good price.
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:46.940]   I'll give you a fair price.
[02:00:46.940 --> 02:00:49.380]   If you put his thumbs and screws,
[02:00:49.380 --> 02:00:51.180]   he still won't remember what the password is.
[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:53.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:57.540]   Actually, technically, Florence Iano is a technical--
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:00:58.340]   He owns it.
[02:00:58.340 --> 02:00:58.980]   That's right.
[02:00:58.980 --> 02:01:01.780]   Could you be hypnotized to find out the password?
[02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:03.460]   I'm open to anything.
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:04.900]   I don't think I can be hypnotized.
[02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:06.060]   I've tried.
[02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:08.260]   I actually went to a hypnotherapist for weight loss
[02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:09.140]   for a long time.
[02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:12.420]   Paid the guy a lot of money for like 10 sessions.
[02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:14.180]   Never really went under, I don't think.
[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:18.620]   So--
[02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:19.620]   OK.
[02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:21.180]   Hey, what about things?
[02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:22.180]   Are we at things yet?
[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:23.380]   No, we haven't had the change law.
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:24.380]   No.
[02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:26.260]   Change log, oh crap.
[02:01:26.260 --> 02:01:30.660]   Let's do the Google change log.
[02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:32.220]   The Google change log.
[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:37.860]   Google's going to use authenticated logos
[02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:40.540]   to reduce phishing in spam.
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:41.300]   Google area went--
[02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:42.300]   I found this interesting.
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:43.580]   OK, now we're going to stop.
[02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:44.460]   What?
[02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:45.860]   Mobile space.
[02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:48.860]   So now you're going to verify the logo.
[02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:51.900]   That's the Google change log.
[02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:53.540]   No, no, go ahead.
[02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:55.060]   Don't forget, we got queso coming, folks.
[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:55.940]   We got queso coming.
[02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:57.740]   I know, we're not done yet.
[02:01:57.740 --> 02:01:59.260]   No, no, we got queso.
[02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:01.820]   I just found it interesting that there's now logo space,
[02:02:01.820 --> 02:02:05.500]   that you're going to have a place where logos become verified
[02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:07.540]   and-- OK, never mind.
[02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:08.660]   The next story.
[02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:11.780]   You know, there are places--
[02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:14.260]   I keep getting--
[02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:18.260]   like banks do this, where they say, OK, this is your image.
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:19.900]   If you try to log on to this bank
[02:02:19.900 --> 02:02:21.620]   and you don't see this image--
[02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:23.340]   it's not your bank.
[02:02:23.340 --> 02:02:24.060]   That's right.
[02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:25.940]   Is that-- does that do anything?
[02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:26.700]   First of all--
[02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:29.980]   Not unless there's an intermediary that confirms the image.
[02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:34.420]   Yeah, I don't-- well, you got to remember your image is a spoon.
[02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:35.780]   Oh, it's a spider right now.
[02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:37.820]   You got to remember that.
[02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:39.140]   And then you're supposed to note,
[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:42.620]   the next time you go to the bank, if you don't see the spoon,
[02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:43.820]   oh, it's not your bank.
[02:02:43.820 --> 02:02:45.380]   Does that work?
[02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:46.100]   No.
[02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:47.540]   I can never remember my image.
[02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:48.420]   I like it.
[02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:50.020]   I like it.
[02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:51.340]   Do you remember your images?
[02:02:51.340 --> 02:02:53.020]   Do you have a notebook full of the images
[02:02:53.020 --> 02:02:54.660]   that you're supposed to look for?
[02:02:54.660 --> 02:02:56.500]   Not every site does that.
[02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:58.140]   But I like the idea of just trying
[02:02:58.140 --> 02:03:01.740]   to make you think twice about hitting log in
[02:03:01.740 --> 02:03:03.180]   after you typed in your credentials
[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:06.100]   into some mysterious field, especially
[02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:07.700]   with all of the fish and crack.
[02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:08.940]   I think this is kind of like that.
[02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:11.540]   Google is going to use--
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:15.980]   and trust data card and digisert to CAs
[02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:21.900]   to verify these images.
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:26.540]   It's called BIMI, this technology, BIMI.
[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:30.940]   Brand indicators for measures identification.
[02:03:30.940 --> 02:03:32.540]   It will make recipients more confident
[02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:35.540]   about the source of the email.
[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:36.700]   I think it's the same idea.
[02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:37.700]   Like you see an image?
[02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:38.180]   Yeah.
[02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:38.780]   Yeah.
[02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:39.740]   Oh, that must be--
[02:03:39.740 --> 02:03:40.220]   But it's just logo.
[02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:42.860]   The logo is verified.
[02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:43.980]   Is it the logo--
[02:03:43.980 --> 02:03:44.460]   Yeah.
[02:03:44.460 --> 02:03:45.940]   What's the scene and logo there?
[02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:46.100]   Yeah.
[02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:47.380]   Like nobody could steal that?
[02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:50.060]   I don't get it.
[02:03:50.060 --> 02:03:50.380]   Yeah.
[02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:51.380]   Is it individualized where there is a bit?
[02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:54.660]   Or is it individualized with a sender?
[02:03:54.660 --> 02:03:55.780]   It's individualized.
[02:03:55.780 --> 02:03:56.500]   I think you're right.
[02:03:56.500 --> 02:03:59.220]   I think there must be some underlying code.
[02:03:59.220 --> 02:04:00.140]   That Google is valid.
[02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:01.060]   People recognize.
[02:04:01.060 --> 02:04:01.500]   Yeah.
[02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:02.540]   Yes.
[02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:03.700]   There's more than just that image,
[02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:06.420]   because I could easily copy and paste this image.
[02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:08.860]   Look, I got it right there.
[02:04:08.860 --> 02:04:09.900]   So it must be more than that.
[02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:10.900]   But that's interesting.
[02:04:10.900 --> 02:04:11.380]   Yeah, you're right.
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:12.100]   That's interesting.
[02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:12.940]   That was moderately interesting.
[02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:15.180]   I put in three things in the change-load today.
[02:04:15.180 --> 02:04:15.980]   So now you're mad at me.
[02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:16.820]   I put things in the change-load.
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:17.260]   Not adding you at all.
[02:04:17.260 --> 02:04:18.860]   Google area 120.
[02:04:18.860 --> 02:04:19.380]   Trying to help.
[02:04:19.380 --> 02:04:22.660]   This is a new way to shop online.
[02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:25.660]   It's not only is it fun, it's entertaining.
[02:04:25.660 --> 02:04:29.260]   It's called Shop Loop.
[02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:30.420]   Let's watch.
[02:04:30.420 --> 02:04:33.100]   It's TikTok for Shop Loop.
[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:34.900]   You type shoploop.app.
[02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:37.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:42.780]   There's a face cream.
[02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:44.620]   So it's TikTok.
[02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:47.380]   And then it's like, are these ads?
[02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:48.700]   Yeah.
[02:04:48.700 --> 02:04:52.140]   But they're like influencers saying, oh, right.
[02:04:52.140 --> 02:04:54.260]   Put this on.
[02:04:54.260 --> 02:04:57.140]   Seems to be very focused on makeup.
[02:04:57.140 --> 02:05:00.180]   I will volunteer to do this with Bluetooth earbuds.
[02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:04.500]   Or what's that?
[02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:05.660]   Well, face masks.
[02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:06.860]   Or face-- oh, yeah.
[02:05:06.860 --> 02:05:08.300]   I could write.
[02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:10.060]   Shoploop.
[02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:10.580]   OK.
[02:05:10.580 --> 02:05:11.100]   That's interesting.
[02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:13.380]   A lot of me think it's the last.
[02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:14.220]   I find it annoying.
[02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:17.220]   But then I'm not the audience for this.
[02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:19.340]   A video shopping platform.
[02:05:19.340 --> 02:05:20.820]   Amazon's kind of doing this too.
[02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:22.140]   You can do as an influencer.
[02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:25.300]   You can do a shopping stream on Amazon.
[02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:27.300]   They have home shopping streams now.
[02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:28.500]   Yeah.
[02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:31.820]   So I think this is Google's response.
[02:05:31.820 --> 02:05:34.860]   Google Maps offers end-to-end navigation
[02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:38.100]   with built-in bike share locations.
[02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:40.060]   Now New Yorkers are going to love this because of City Bike.
[02:05:40.060 --> 02:05:42.660]   But a lot of cities now have built-in.
[02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:44.740]   I want to go from here to there.
[02:05:44.740 --> 02:05:45.060]   OK.
[02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:47.100]   Walk from here to there, then get the bike,
[02:05:47.100 --> 02:05:49.540]   and then take it to there where you put the bike away.
[02:05:49.540 --> 02:05:50.940]   And then walk again.
[02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:52.100]   Perfect.
[02:05:52.100 --> 02:05:52.380]   Yeah.
[02:05:52.380 --> 02:05:53.980]   Because you have to know where to get the bike
[02:05:53.980 --> 02:05:55.820]   and where to leave the bike.
[02:05:55.820 --> 02:05:58.740]   And that's a really good-- so it'll be in Chicago, New York,
[02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:03.060]   San Francisco, Washington, DC, London, Mexico City, Montreal,
[02:06:03.060 --> 02:06:05.660]   Rio, San Paolo, and Taipei.
[02:06:05.660 --> 02:06:07.220]   That's cool.
[02:06:07.220 --> 02:06:08.580]   That's really cool.
[02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:09.100]   All right, cool.
[02:06:09.100 --> 02:06:10.420]   Charlotte.
[02:06:10.420 --> 02:06:13.500]   No, Charlotte.
[02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:15.700]   Are you disappointed?
[02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:18.660]   I'm a little surprised that Charlotte is a City Bike City.
[02:06:18.660 --> 02:06:19.260]   Oh, it is.
[02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:19.740]   Oh, OK.
[02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:21.700]   Well, maybe they'll expand that.
[02:06:21.700 --> 02:06:22.220]   Yeah.
[02:06:22.220 --> 02:06:24.380]   You could a lot of use to those bikes there, at least they're
[02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:24.700]   used to.
[02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:28.020]   New tools on search on your mobile device
[02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:30.380]   can help you find a mortgage.
[02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:34.660]   If you type in mortgage, you will get more information
[02:06:34.660 --> 02:06:36.220]   about mortgages.
[02:06:36.220 --> 02:06:38.820]   You will get a whole--
[02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:40.100]   see the tabs up at the top--
[02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:41.740]   rates, refinance, process.
[02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:44.140]   Yes, you could have used news, relief.
[02:06:44.140 --> 02:06:44.900]   This is nice.
[02:06:44.900 --> 02:06:48.500]   This is financial information from a trusted source.
[02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:49.180]   Google.
[02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:50.660]   They even have a mortgage calculator.
[02:06:50.660 --> 02:06:52.540]   Look at that.
[02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:52.900]   Built in.
[02:06:52.900 --> 02:06:55.900]   Now I do like that sort of trimming the fat
[02:06:55.900 --> 02:06:57.940]   for all of the information that's out there,
[02:06:57.940 --> 02:07:01.100]   because it could be quite overwhelming for someone
[02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:03.060]   trying to get into this for the first time.
[02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:05.060]   So I wonder if they'll be doing more of this.
[02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:08.300]   But as you do the search, you'll get the search results.
[02:07:08.300 --> 02:07:09.700]   At the bottom of the page, you'll
[02:07:09.700 --> 02:07:12.900]   get a more information, kind of like a knowledge graph,
[02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:16.620]   with tools that you can use to get more information about
[02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:17.660]   mortgage.
[02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:18.340]   That's interesting.
[02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:19.340]   That's a good idea.
[02:07:19.340 --> 02:07:21.500]   Yeah.
[02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:25.940]   Would you like to become part of a global documentary produced
[02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:29.300]   by Ridley Scott?
[02:07:29.300 --> 02:07:29.700]   Life in the day.
[02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:31.140]   Should I be the monster?
[02:07:31.140 --> 02:07:34.780]   This is actually not a new idea.
[02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:38.180]   You know, we all know a day in the life, right?
[02:07:38.180 --> 02:07:40.780]   That's a great photo series.
[02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:43.700]   My friend-- oh, it's a wonderful photographer.
[02:07:43.700 --> 02:07:46.340]   Just down the road a piece in the sauce.
[02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:47.700]   Did.
[02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:50.340]   There was a whole bunch of day in the life books.
[02:07:50.340 --> 02:07:52.420]   Now, and I think they've even done this on YouTube
[02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:54.380]   before, I feel like.
[02:07:54.380 --> 02:07:59.660]   So on July 25, three days from the day we're taping,
[02:07:59.660 --> 02:08:00.340]   this is--
[02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:00.780]   Rick Smolin.
[02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:01.340]   Rick Smolin.
[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:02.220]   That's who I was thinking of.
[02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:02.620]   Yeah, thank you.
[02:08:02.620 --> 02:08:03.540]   My friend, too.
[02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:05.140]   Oh, Rick's great, isn't he?
[02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:05.900]   He's wonderful.
[02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:06.700]   Just a sweetheart.
[02:08:06.700 --> 02:08:09.580]   Yeah, really love Rick.
[02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:11.340]   So this is his idea.
[02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:15.060]   And the day in the life books were great.
[02:08:15.060 --> 02:08:16.660]   But this is now with video.
[02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:19.980]   So coming Saturday, film your day,
[02:08:19.980 --> 02:08:23.580]   you could be part of a global documentary.
[02:08:23.580 --> 02:08:25.500]   All of us at home.
[02:08:25.500 --> 02:08:27.380]   Yeah, it's not going to be that interesting.
[02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:28.380]   No.
[02:08:28.380 --> 02:08:30.060]   Yeah, it depends on the home.
[02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:30.900]   It depends on the home.
[02:08:30.900 --> 02:08:32.460]   And so, yeah, this is interesting.
[02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:35.820]   So they're going to get a ton of footage, which
[02:08:35.820 --> 02:08:39.780]   is going to be challenging.
[02:08:39.780 --> 02:08:42.060]   But it will be a time capsule of the worst year
[02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:45.660]   in the world ever in history.
[02:08:45.660 --> 02:08:49.500]   There's filming requirements and how you could take part.
[02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:52.740]   You'll need to comply with-- there's appearance releases.
[02:08:52.740 --> 02:08:53.260]   A red pen.
[02:08:53.260 --> 02:08:54.420]   --got to put out forms.
[02:08:54.420 --> 02:08:55.260]   Yep.
[02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:56.860]   No, you don't need a red.
[02:08:56.860 --> 02:08:57.380]   Yeah, you do.
[02:08:57.380 --> 02:08:58.140]   You need a red.
[02:08:58.140 --> 02:08:59.700]   You need a red?
[02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:00.180]   It says--
[02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:00.700]   No kidding.
[02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:02.540]   You got to get permission in filming a look.
[02:09:02.540 --> 02:09:05.580]   Some locations don't film trademarks or protected works.
[02:09:05.580 --> 02:09:07.620]   Do not use music.
[02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:08.380]   Of course.
[02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:08.820]   Do not use--
[02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:10.380]   Because YouTube will take down the Google thing.
[02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:11.140]   That's right.
[02:09:11.140 --> 02:09:12.780]   Know how personal information will be collected,
[02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:14.140]   used and shared.
[02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:17.300]   So just learn about data protection.
[02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:18.060]   Be careful.
[02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:21.500]   And don't break the law, Ant.
[02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:23.140]   People that are used to submitting
[02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:24.020]   stock photography--
[02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:24.580]   That's pretty typical.
[02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:25.380]   --video.
[02:09:25.380 --> 02:09:26.980]   This would be a bird used today.
[02:09:26.980 --> 02:09:27.480]   Yeah.
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:28.300]   Because it's the same type of--
[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:30.660]   Would you be interested in doing this?
[02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:33.300]   If I had a fascinating life, sure.
[02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:35.300]   But we all know my life's pretty boring.
[02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:41.140]   Don't you think that people jazz it up for stuff like this?
[02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:42.740]   Yeah, most people do.
[02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:47.180]   And go take a naked picnic and grab your smartphone or--
[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:48.700]   Isn't that different from the folks
[02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:50.860]   on Instagram living their best life?
[02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:51.420]   Their best life.
[02:09:51.420 --> 02:09:52.820]   Their best life.
[02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:54.540]   It says you might record a typical day
[02:09:54.540 --> 02:09:56.340]   going to work connecting with family, being with friends,
[02:09:56.340 --> 02:09:58.740]   or maybe something special is happening Saturday.
[02:09:58.740 --> 02:10:00.620]   Your wedding day, or you have important news,
[02:10:00.620 --> 02:10:02.460]   or you're having a baby.
[02:10:02.460 --> 02:10:04.300]   You could show us lockdown in your city.
[02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:06.020]   This is kind of cool.
[02:10:06.020 --> 02:10:08.900]   How much footage are they going to get?
[02:10:08.900 --> 02:10:10.980]   Well, the AI will sift through it.
[02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:12.580]   Nobody can deal.
[02:10:12.580 --> 02:10:13.420]   If your footage is used--
[02:10:13.420 --> 02:10:14.700]   I know, on one basis.
[02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:16.460]   If your footage is used in the final film,
[02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:19.940]   we'll contact you later in the year.
[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:22.340]   Will you go to t-shirt?
[02:10:22.340 --> 02:10:24.900]   No, you'll just know that you were in--
[02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:27.020]   A life and a day.
[02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:28.020]   Not to be confused.
[02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:30.260]   Just a collection of vlogs.
[02:10:30.260 --> 02:10:31.580]   Collection of vlogs.
[02:10:31.580 --> 02:10:34.540]   With good editing, it could be pretty amazing, right?
[02:10:34.540 --> 02:10:35.340]   You want to--
[02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:36.980]   Stacey, are you losing steam?
[02:10:36.980 --> 02:10:41.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:42.860]   She's resting her head--
[02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:44.260]   Erin, Erin, Erin.
[02:10:44.260 --> 02:10:46.140]   I am losing steam.
[02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:49.180]   I'm also not super interested in video documenting something.
[02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:51.740]   I got something just for you.
[02:10:51.740 --> 02:10:52.300]   OK.
[02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:54.700]   That's the Google change log.
[02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:56.700]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:10:57.580 --> 02:10:58.500]   OK, so it's calling.
[02:10:58.500 --> 02:10:59.700]   I spelled the case off.
[02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:02.660]   OK, so it's taking over TikTok.
[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:03.180]   Grilled.
[02:11:03.180 --> 02:11:04.180]   I want your expert--
[02:11:04.180 --> 02:11:05.260]   I want your expert--
[02:11:05.260 --> 02:11:06.420]   judgments of this.
[02:11:06.420 --> 02:11:08.020]   Do not start another change log.
[02:11:08.020 --> 02:11:10.860]   I can't-- Stacey, you'll lose it.
[02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:13.580]   So this is what we were talking about.
[02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:14.220]   Yes.
[02:11:14.220 --> 02:11:19.420]   Is the video from the meat church.
[02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:20.620]   So watch the--
[02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:22.540]   You got to listen to what they're doing here.
[02:11:22.540 --> 02:11:24.780]   OK, put my sound on here.
[02:11:24.780 --> 02:11:26.900]   20 ounces of fresh chorizo sausage,
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:29.140]   took it out of its casings, and I fried it in a skillet
[02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:30.700]   until it was nice and crispy.
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:33.340]   And then in a can, I added an eight ounce block of both pepper,
[02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:35.420]   jack, and cheddar, three chopped jalapenos,
[02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:38.980]   one diced red onion, the chorizo, one whole block of velvita,
[02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:40.540]   two cups of shredded Monterey Jack,
[02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:42.180]   two cups of shredded for cheese Mexican,
[02:11:42.180 --> 02:11:44.940]   and one 10 ounce can of Serrano Rotel.
[02:11:44.940 --> 02:11:47.780]   You got to have Rotel peppers, right, Stacey?
[02:11:47.780 --> 02:11:49.580]   Rotel makes the case, so--
[02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:51.020]   Rotel makes the case, so--
[02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:51.940]   You're going there.
[02:11:51.940 --> 02:11:54.500]   I think this gets the Stacey seal
[02:11:54.500 --> 02:11:57.220]   of approval so far anyway.
[02:11:57.220 --> 02:11:57.980]   Drained.
[02:11:57.980 --> 02:11:59.660]   And then I put it on my webber kettle
[02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:01.860]   with some bikanya that we were cooking that night.
[02:12:01.860 --> 02:12:02.860]   And I'm doing mine in the street.
[02:12:02.860 --> 02:12:04.820]   And I covered it so that the smoke would melt the cheese.
[02:12:04.820 --> 02:12:06.300]   And once the cheese started to melt,
[02:12:06.300 --> 02:12:08.900]   I stirred it all together until it was completely combined,
[02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:12.340]   and I cooked it covered until it was nice and smooth like this.
[02:12:12.340 --> 02:12:14.100]   And it turned out so amazing.
[02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:18.060]   It would be the perfect appetizer for barbecue's.
[02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:19.060]   Wow.
[02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:23.660]   Oh, so pretty so would be tremendously too much for barbecue's.
[02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:27.460]   But queso in chips in general just delicious.
[02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:28.660]   We know that.
[02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:30.340]   What about queso made on the barbecue?
[02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:31.620]   That's what's taken over TikTok.
[02:12:31.620 --> 02:12:32.460]   Oh, yeah.
[02:12:32.460 --> 02:12:33.460]   I'm excited about that.
[02:12:33.460 --> 02:12:34.260]   Like this is the thing.
[02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:35.300]   Oh, OK.
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:37.060]   Yeah, maybe that's because of that meat church video.
[02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:38.980]   It certainly got my attention.
[02:12:38.980 --> 02:12:39.980]   Lori Gill has made it.
[02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:42.220]   She said it wasn't that smoky, so--
[02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:44.420]   It's all over my head.
[02:12:44.420 --> 02:12:45.620]   You got a smoker, Aunt.
[02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:47.180]   You could do it.
[02:12:47.180 --> 02:12:48.460]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:49.820]   I don't have a smoker yet.
[02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:52.060]   But this video was all over my head.
[02:12:52.060 --> 02:12:55.660]   I'm thinking, what's new about that?
[02:12:55.660 --> 02:12:57.420]   So Mike Masnick, our good friend,
[02:12:57.420 --> 02:13:01.740]   says it's hysteria, all of this anti-TikTok sentiment.
[02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:06.860]   There is a move by some of the TikTok investors in the US
[02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:10.940]   to bring it to the US, to buy it away from the Chinese,
[02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:13.340]   from ByteDance, the Chinese owners.
[02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:16.260]   What do you think?
[02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:19.980]   I really do enjoy that people are trying to be creative.
[02:13:19.980 --> 02:13:20.460]   Very creative.
[02:13:20.460 --> 02:13:21.380]   With TikTok.
[02:13:21.380 --> 02:13:23.180]   It's TikTok's time, man.
[02:13:23.180 --> 02:13:27.100]   But the song covers is what throws me off.
[02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:29.620]   I like when I see the things outside of people
[02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:32.860]   just lip syncing a song.
[02:13:32.860 --> 02:13:34.340]   Just give me something else.
[02:13:34.340 --> 02:13:37.580]   You know how I know TikTok's big Instagram is kidding too.
[02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:40.180]   Instagram's copying it as well.
[02:13:40.180 --> 02:13:42.980]   They're going to do reels at a lunch in August.
[02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:44.940]   So TikTok, they bought musically.
[02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:46.060]   And that's what musically was.
[02:13:46.060 --> 02:13:50.860]   It was a bunch of 12-year-old kids, girls, in some boys,
[02:13:50.860 --> 02:13:52.700]   lip syncing it in their hair brush.
[02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:54.060]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[02:13:54.060 --> 02:13:55.620]   And so that's why it's so big.
[02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:59.220]   I mean, historically, the platform was people being silly
[02:13:59.220 --> 02:14:00.100]   lip syncing songs.
[02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:01.340]   I loved it.
[02:14:01.340 --> 02:14:03.740]   Nothing wrong with that.
[02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:04.740]   So, yeah.
[02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:05.580]   We just have to rest today.
[02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:07.500]   I mean, if they come by it honest is the point, I guess.
[02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:09.100]   Yeah, they come by it honest.
[02:14:09.100 --> 02:14:13.540]   We should rest it away from them and make it America.
[02:14:13.540 --> 02:14:16.780]   Now, that, I think, is stupid, but that's all right.
[02:14:16.780 --> 02:14:17.980]   That's my specialty.
[02:14:18.980 --> 02:14:26.180]   Um, wow, there is a lot of extra stuff here.
[02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:27.100]   What's the deal with this?
[02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:29.740]   A limited edition pairing featuring a box?
[02:14:29.740 --> 02:14:30.740]   Like that one.
[02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:31.740]   Not mine.
[02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:32.740]   Not mine.
[02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:33.820]   It must be a Carsten.
[02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:35.020]   Cheddar cheese crackers.
[02:14:35.020 --> 02:14:35.940]   Has to be a Carsten.
[02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:36.780]   Yeah.
[02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:38.540]   OK, thank you, Carsten.
[02:14:38.540 --> 02:14:40.980]   Oh, I have the cans of house wine.
[02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:45.100]   We use them as our little when I need--
[02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:46.580]   So I don't know the bottle of wine.
[02:14:46.580 --> 02:14:47.260]   Oh, OK.
[02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:48.260]   No, no, no.
[02:14:48.260 --> 02:14:50.820]   This is my cooking tip.
[02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:53.020]   Because sometimes I don't want to be drinking, because you
[02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:55.540]   know how I was like, oh, I'm so down because of the pandemic.
[02:14:55.540 --> 02:14:59.420]   I'm going to stop drinking as much so I'm happier.
[02:14:59.420 --> 02:15:01.540]   If you do the can of wine, you don't feel bad about throwing
[02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:04.660]   it away when you're done cooking with--
[02:15:04.660 --> 02:15:06.580]   Oh, you use it for cooking, not drinking.
[02:15:06.580 --> 02:15:07.100]   Yeah.
[02:15:07.100 --> 02:15:07.380]   Yeah.
[02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:09.580]   I mean, sometimes I'll drink it, like I'll drink it.
[02:15:09.580 --> 02:15:11.780]   Because you know, you can always mix white wine with the
[02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:13.500]   fizzy water, and then you've got a spritzer, and it's
[02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:14.540]   perfectly fine.
[02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:16.700]   This is from the--
[02:15:16.700 --> 02:15:20.100]   I think it's a phenomenal website called Laughing Squid.
[02:15:20.100 --> 02:15:24.020]   Where else would you find a cute compilation of cats with
[02:15:24.020 --> 02:15:25.940]   lettuce on their heads?
[02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:31.500]   And there's 15 minutes of this, by the way.
[02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:34.260]   Cats with lettuce on their heads.
[02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:36.620]   How do they get the cats to sit still with lettuce on their heads?
[02:15:36.620 --> 02:15:41.460]   Apparently, lettuce has a soothing effect.
[02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:43.020]   They're very sleepy.
[02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:44.180]   Oh, I've had enough.
[02:15:44.180 --> 02:15:45.500]   I'm leaving.
[02:15:45.500 --> 02:15:47.620]   Well, if you're leaving, I guess I'll go too.
[02:15:47.620 --> 02:15:49.060]   But wait, there's a lettuce on there.
[02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:50.380]   Spotlight is mine now.
[02:15:50.380 --> 02:15:52.460]   I love it.
[02:15:52.460 --> 02:15:55.300]   Where'd you go?
[02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:57.500]   And here's something useful--
[02:15:57.500 --> 02:16:02.740]   how to make a face shield from a crispy cream donut box.
[02:16:02.740 --> 02:16:03.860]   Highly intuitive.
[02:16:03.860 --> 02:16:07.660]   I don't get the clear plastic on my crispy cream boxes.
[02:16:07.660 --> 02:16:08.460]   They're all paper.
[02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:09.980]   Oh.
[02:16:09.980 --> 02:16:10.980]   Oh.
[02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:12.780]   You'll be knocking into some walls, won't you?
[02:16:12.780 --> 02:16:14.620]   You're being robbed here.
[02:16:14.620 --> 02:16:15.620]   Look at that.
[02:16:15.620 --> 02:16:16.620]   So easy.
[02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:17.620]   It works so well.
[02:16:17.620 --> 02:16:21.820]   And everybody says, "My, you smell delicious."
[02:16:21.820 --> 02:16:23.020]   Your face will be sticky.
[02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:24.660]   Scott Beals Laughing Squid.
[02:16:24.660 --> 02:16:26.620]   Thank you, Scott, for some humor now.
[02:16:26.620 --> 02:16:29.420]   Let's get to our picks of the week.
[02:16:29.420 --> 02:16:31.020]   Stacey, you start.
[02:16:31.020 --> 02:16:32.020]   OK.
[02:16:32.020 --> 02:16:37.220]   Because you're going for neo-wise, I can tell.
[02:16:37.220 --> 02:16:40.540]   This is a camera mount for a telescope.
[02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:46.780]   So as part of my new house, we have bald eagles nest, like 100 feet away.
[02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:47.780]   Oh, nice.
[02:16:47.780 --> 02:16:48.780]   Oh, wow.
[02:16:48.780 --> 02:16:52.580]   And I have an old mead telescope from when I was a kid.
[02:16:52.580 --> 02:16:54.140]   So we hooked that up.
[02:16:54.140 --> 02:16:56.060]   We started-- I was like, oh, I wish I could take pictures.
[02:16:56.060 --> 02:16:59.140]   So I could show people the bald eagle because it had a baby.
[02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:01.820]   So there's a juvenile bald eagle and the two parents.
[02:17:01.820 --> 02:17:02.820]   And it's very cute.
[02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:03.820]   There used to be two juveniles.
[02:17:03.820 --> 02:17:07.900]   You should put your watch cam in the nest there and just--
[02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:08.900]   So you're all--
[02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:10.820]   So yeah.
[02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:17.260]   I was like, how can I take pictures and lo and behold, mead actually makes one of these.
[02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:18.580]   But it's not as good as this one.
[02:17:18.580 --> 02:17:21.980]   And this is only 19 bucks, which I'm sure Mead's is a little more expensive.
[02:17:21.980 --> 02:17:25.380]   No, no, the Mead's was actually 1999 on B&H.
[02:17:25.380 --> 02:17:26.900]   So who knew?
[02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:27.900]   OK.
[02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:28.420]   Yeah.
[02:17:28.420 --> 02:17:31.820]   So if you had-- and this apparently works, people are using it with binoculars.
[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:34.980]   I'm a little unclear on that, but sure.
[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:36.620]   So yeah, this was my thing.
[02:17:36.620 --> 02:17:41.940]   The key on this is it's got a special mount that allows you to move, slide the camera
[02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:45.820]   around so the camera is right on the oculus.
[02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:46.820]   Yeah.
[02:17:46.820 --> 02:17:49.660]   The ocular of the device.
[02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:50.660]   Yeah.
[02:17:50.660 --> 02:17:51.660]   But yeah, it's really--
[02:17:51.660 --> 02:17:52.660]   Never.
[02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:57.780]   I mean, and I would also say if you have a young child and you want to get them excited
[02:17:57.780 --> 02:18:01.620]   about this kind of thing, it's also a nice way because kids really have a hard time coming
[02:18:01.620 --> 02:18:02.620]   up with telescopes.
[02:18:02.620 --> 02:18:03.620]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:04.620]   Yeah.
[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:05.620]   So--
[02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:05.620]   Nice.
[02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:06.620]   That's my-- it's not connected.
[02:18:06.620 --> 02:18:07.620]   It's a great--
[02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:08.620]   No, that's a great pick.
[02:18:08.620 --> 02:18:09.620]   It's connected.
[02:18:09.620 --> 02:18:11.380]   It's my phone.
[02:18:11.380 --> 02:18:13.300]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:18:13.300 --> 02:18:15.340]   Mr. Ant Pruitt.
[02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:20.660]   Man, I had a hard time with my pick the week.
[02:18:20.660 --> 02:18:22.940]   So that's why you have three of them?
[02:18:22.940 --> 02:18:23.940]   Yeah.
[02:18:23.940 --> 02:18:27.540]   Oh, I will mention John McWhorter again.
[02:18:27.540 --> 02:18:29.180]   I listened to his podcast.
[02:18:29.180 --> 02:18:32.180]   It's called "Lixicon Valley."
[02:18:32.180 --> 02:18:33.180]   I don't know if it all--
[02:18:33.180 --> 02:18:34.180]   Oh, it's a podcast.
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:35.180]   I love that.
[02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:36.180]   You know we had a podcast.
[02:18:36.180 --> 02:18:37.180]   Nice.
[02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:38.180]   It's so good.
[02:18:38.180 --> 02:18:39.180]   I love that guy.
[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:40.180]   I'm describing her right now.
[02:18:40.180 --> 02:18:42.420]   I didn't know that was the guy you're talking about.
[02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:43.420]   Oh, yeah.
[02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:44.420]   I just think that's the question.
[02:18:44.420 --> 02:18:46.420]   Where are you, you made it?
[02:18:46.420 --> 02:18:47.420]   Oh, he's--
[02:18:47.420 --> 02:18:48.420]   Thank you, Ant.
[02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:49.420]   --you and good.
[02:18:49.420 --> 02:18:56.060]   And it's just-- I listen to that because I learned a lot from it too, especially with
[02:18:56.060 --> 02:19:00.980]   the black English and things like that and how it relates and just-- oh, it's brilliant.
[02:19:00.980 --> 02:19:05.340]   That was the main pick that I wanted to make sure I threw out there.
[02:19:05.340 --> 02:19:09.180]   Say the other one, he's the name of the show again so I can put it in my pocket.
[02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:10.180]   "Lixicon Valley."
[02:19:10.180 --> 02:19:11.180]   "Lixicon Valley."
[02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:12.180]   "Lixicon Valley."
[02:19:12.180 --> 02:19:13.180]   "Lixicon Valley."
[02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:14.180]   "Lixicon Valley."
[02:19:14.180 --> 02:19:15.180]   "Lixicon Valley."
[02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:16.180]   Nice.
[02:19:16.180 --> 02:19:17.580]   I love John McWhorter.
[02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:19.580]   Yeah, he seems so good.
[02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:20.580]   Good.
[02:19:20.580 --> 02:19:21.580]   And I love--
[02:19:21.580 --> 02:19:25.060]   But my other one is a Twitter pick.
[02:19:25.060 --> 02:19:27.260]   I'm going to go with Trumpetine.
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:33.380]   And it's from a voiceover artist, I know a name, Mr. Andy Harris.
[02:19:33.380 --> 02:19:38.060]   And he's just been having some fun with Donald Trump's tweets and reading them as Emperor
[02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:40.140]   Palpatine from Star Wars.
[02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:44.980]   And the particular one that I shared this time, he brought his son in with him.
[02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:47.460]   His son is four years old, I think.
[02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:51.420]   And if you listen to the audio, he's really good at these voiceovers.
[02:19:51.420 --> 02:19:55.860]   And he's even gotten an endorsement from Mr. Mark Hamill on a couple of these things because
[02:19:55.860 --> 02:19:57.020]   he's done them so well.
[02:19:57.020 --> 02:19:58.020]   Let's listen out.
[02:19:58.020 --> 02:20:04.980]   "When he led the answers from a teleprompter, that means he was given the questions just
[02:20:04.980 --> 02:20:10.300]   like crooked Hillary, never have seen this before."
[02:20:10.300 --> 02:20:17.900]   He's whispered to the four-year-old.
[02:20:17.900 --> 02:20:19.460]   "He's safe."
[02:20:19.460 --> 02:20:20.460]   "In Joe Biden's neck."
[02:20:20.460 --> 02:20:27.460]   "That's past the test day east, he should give it to Jay."
[02:20:27.460 --> 02:20:30.460]   "He know it's his best time in bedtime."
[02:20:30.460 --> 02:20:31.460]   "Aww."
[02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:43.460]   "Oh, I'm afraid the best day will be great operational with best time in his days."
[02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:48.700]   Emperor Palpatrump, or President Trumpetine, he can't make up his name.
[02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:49.700]   They make up his mind.
[02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:53.340]   It's Andy Harris, the Andy Harris on Twitter.
[02:20:53.340 --> 02:20:55.380]   He is so funny.
[02:20:55.380 --> 02:20:56.740]   He's really good at this voiceover.
[02:20:56.740 --> 02:20:57.740]   So I love him.
[02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:00.020]   That's just a few of the things he's done.
[02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:02.140]   Jeff, number please.
[02:21:02.140 --> 02:21:08.540]   Well, we could mention this one really quickly, that Amazon is now the number one advertiser.
[02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:10.540]   Who would have thought?
[02:21:10.540 --> 02:21:11.540]   Advertiser.
[02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:13.540]   Advertiser says Axios.
[02:21:13.540 --> 02:21:14.540]   $7 million.
[02:21:14.540 --> 02:21:15.540]   $7 million.
[02:21:15.540 --> 02:21:16.540]   What?
[02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:20.980]   I don't see any Amazon ads.
[02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:22.980]   Where would you see Amazon ads?
[02:21:22.980 --> 02:21:23.980]   That's what I'm saying.
[02:21:23.980 --> 02:21:24.980]   They have few commercials.
[02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:25.980]   Huh.
[02:21:25.980 --> 02:21:26.980]   $7 million.
[02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:29.780]   They're bigger than Proctor and Gamble.
[02:21:29.780 --> 02:21:30.780]   Wow.
[02:21:30.780 --> 02:21:31.780]   Yeah.
[02:21:31.780 --> 02:21:33.780]   Oh, I'm counting number two.
[02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:34.780]   AT&T number three.
[02:21:34.780 --> 02:21:36.860]   Oh, we got to mention an AT&T story.
[02:21:36.860 --> 02:21:39.380]   My wife isn't really mad.
[02:21:39.380 --> 02:21:40.380]   Proctor and Gamble are number four.
[02:21:40.380 --> 02:21:41.380]   Walt Disney number five.
[02:21:41.380 --> 02:21:43.100]   Alphabet, Google number six.
[02:21:43.100 --> 02:21:44.100]   Verizon number.
[02:21:44.100 --> 02:21:45.100]   What do I see?
[02:21:45.100 --> 02:21:46.100]   Google advertising.
[02:21:46.100 --> 02:21:47.100]   Oh, my gosh.
[02:21:47.100 --> 02:21:49.140]   I see a lot of Google TV ads.
[02:21:49.140 --> 02:21:51.940]   But Amazon, they used to advertise a lot on football.
[02:21:51.940 --> 02:21:53.540]   But Amazon number one.
[02:21:53.540 --> 02:21:54.540]   Wow.
[02:21:54.540 --> 02:21:55.540]   $7 million.
[02:21:55.540 --> 02:21:56.540]   Maybe on TikTok.
[02:21:56.540 --> 02:21:58.580]   Some type of ads on TikTok, right?
[02:21:58.580 --> 02:21:59.580]   Huh.
[02:21:59.580 --> 02:22:00.580]   No?
[02:22:00.580 --> 02:22:03.180]   Because don't they have a big relationship?
[02:22:03.180 --> 02:22:04.180]   I don't know.
[02:22:04.180 --> 02:22:09.540]   Speaking of AT&T real quickly, my wife is enraged because she has a steam powered phone
[02:22:09.540 --> 02:22:13.420]   still and she's loyal to it because the Apple refuses to make a tiny phone again and she's
[02:22:13.420 --> 02:22:16.580]   enraged and she wants a small phone and become a big phone.
[02:22:16.580 --> 02:22:17.940]   So she's holding on to it.
[02:22:17.940 --> 02:22:22.500]   And then yesterday I got an email from AT&T saying, you have to give up your phone.
[02:22:22.500 --> 02:22:23.500]   Wait, what?
[02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:25.940]   You don't have to give up your phone?
[02:22:25.940 --> 02:22:26.940]   What?
[02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:28.580]   That's what AT&T said in the email.
[02:22:28.580 --> 02:22:32.300]   I have the email and it sure made it seem like I sent it to her and boy did she get
[02:22:32.300 --> 02:22:33.300]   mad.
[02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:38.860]   And that, yeah, you're going to have to give me your phone that it just won't work soon.
[02:22:38.860 --> 02:22:40.940]   And then it turns out it's at least a year and a half.
[02:22:40.940 --> 02:22:45.500]   And it's really for 3G phones, but when they try to convince people with phones, it would
[02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:47.700]   still work on the network to upgrade the phones.
[02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:49.260]   Is this a scam?
[02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:50.260]   Shameful.
[02:22:50.260 --> 02:22:51.260]   AT&T.
[02:22:51.260 --> 02:22:52.260]   Shameable.
[02:22:52.260 --> 02:23:01.100]   Are our masks of the week, Carson's Masked of the Week this week on Etsy, the LED fashion
[02:23:01.100 --> 02:23:06.580]   dust mask made from breathable fiber optic fabric with 12 colors in one.
[02:23:06.580 --> 02:23:10.060]   It is very affordable, only $2,199.
[02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:13.540]   And you can cycle through the colors as you walk.
[02:23:13.540 --> 02:23:15.540]   It's like Ants background.
[02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:18.620]   It's the mood they flash.
[02:23:18.620 --> 02:23:20.140]   They flash today.
[02:23:20.140 --> 02:23:21.620]   This is pretty cool.
[02:23:21.620 --> 02:23:24.260]   If my mask is green, don't come near me.
[02:23:24.260 --> 02:23:26.100]   I'm pissed.
[02:23:26.100 --> 02:23:32.140]   This is actually, you know, I am encouraged by this because I think masks are going to
[02:23:32.140 --> 02:23:33.420]   become a fashion statement.
[02:23:33.420 --> 02:23:35.060]   They're going to become fun.
[02:23:35.060 --> 02:23:38.660]   I saw a company this week that had matching masks and bow ties.
[02:23:38.660 --> 02:23:39.660]   Perfect.
[02:23:39.660 --> 02:23:41.420]   Carson should be getting some of those.
[02:23:41.420 --> 02:23:42.900]   Oh, God, I should have said that to Carson.
[02:23:42.900 --> 02:23:43.900]   Jesus, how can I not?
[02:23:43.900 --> 02:23:44.900]   How can I miss that?
[02:23:44.900 --> 02:23:46.060]   Oh, my God, that's a Carson.
[02:23:46.060 --> 02:23:51.380]   Here are, according to USA Today, the 10 most popular face masks on Amazon.
[02:23:51.380 --> 02:23:53.180]   I wonder if Amazon.
[02:23:53.180 --> 02:23:54.180]   Well, I found it.
[02:23:54.180 --> 02:23:56.020]   I found it, Carson.
[02:23:56.020 --> 02:23:58.220]   Floral masks with bendable nose pieces.
[02:23:58.220 --> 02:23:59.620]   Ooh, I like that one.
[02:23:59.620 --> 02:24:00.620]   Yeah.
[02:24:00.620 --> 02:24:03.180]   Lots of people like the Gator because you can pull it up.
[02:24:03.180 --> 02:24:04.180]   You have a Gator.
[02:24:04.180 --> 02:24:05.180]   I have several Gators.
[02:24:05.180 --> 02:24:06.180]   Yep.
[02:24:06.180 --> 02:24:07.180]   Simple black masks.
[02:24:07.180 --> 02:24:12.100]   All you need is a presidential seal and you'll be right there in the oval.
[02:24:12.100 --> 02:24:16.660]   I don't know if I like these masks because it's got discharge valves for easy breathing,
[02:24:16.660 --> 02:24:18.100]   which means you're not predicting.
[02:24:18.100 --> 02:24:20.060]   No, that's not you're not supposed to do that.
[02:24:20.060 --> 02:24:21.060]   Anybody.
[02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:22.060]   Yeah, that's not the one.
[02:24:22.060 --> 02:24:23.060]   That's bad.
[02:24:23.060 --> 02:24:24.860]   Do not wear that mask.
[02:24:24.860 --> 02:24:28.220]   Oh, a little love heart mask.
[02:24:28.220 --> 02:24:30.980]   Gray mask with adjustable loops.
[02:24:30.980 --> 02:24:31.980]   Pleated flare.
[02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:33.900]   I like making my own mask, but these are quite nice.
[02:24:33.900 --> 02:24:34.900]   If you can't make your own.
[02:24:34.900 --> 02:24:37.100]   I found the mask and bow ties for Carson.
[02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:38.100]   That's on the one.
[02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:39.100]   Oh, good.
[02:24:39.100 --> 02:24:40.100]   Well, we'll save it for next week.
[02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:41.100]   How about that?
[02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:42.100]   Oh.
[02:24:42.100 --> 02:24:43.100]   All right.
[02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:44.100]   Okay.
[02:24:44.100 --> 02:24:45.100]   All right.
[02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:46.100]   Jeff feels miffed.
[02:24:46.100 --> 02:24:50.940]   Well, I know he's doing that to be nice to you, Stacey, because you're.
[02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:51.940]   I know.
[02:24:51.940 --> 02:24:56.580]   It's all because I have I fall asleep on my microphone and I'm like, what can I order
[02:24:56.580 --> 02:24:57.580]   for dinner tonight?
[02:24:57.580 --> 02:24:58.580]   I'm getting hungry.
[02:24:58.580 --> 02:25:00.220]   Ooh, not cooking tonight.
[02:25:00.220 --> 02:25:02.180]   We're going to we're going to go out, huh?
[02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:03.180]   Eat out.
[02:25:03.180 --> 02:25:04.180]   Take out, huh?
[02:25:04.180 --> 02:25:06.180]   Take out on the island.
[02:25:06.180 --> 02:25:11.980]   No, there's only like 20 restaurants in like 11 of them are Italian.
[02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:13.540]   That's like living in New Jersey.
[02:25:13.540 --> 02:25:15.900]   It really like it's Texas.
[02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:18.380]   You know, there were like a lot of the text.
[02:25:18.380 --> 02:25:19.380]   A lot of the text.
[02:25:19.380 --> 02:25:20.380]   Half of half of them were text max.
[02:25:20.380 --> 02:25:23.300]   So this is like here, half of them are Italian.
[02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:26.820]   What are you most miseating from leaving Texas?
[02:25:26.820 --> 02:25:28.300]   Oh, my gosh.
[02:25:28.300 --> 02:25:29.300]   Inchiladas.
[02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:30.300]   So much.
[02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:31.300]   Just enjoyed enchiladas.
[02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:32.300]   Oh, yeah.
[02:25:32.300 --> 02:25:34.100]   Well, you can make those.
[02:25:34.100 --> 02:25:36.660]   Those are hard to make, are they?
[02:25:36.660 --> 02:25:37.660]   I miss Mole.
[02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:39.660]   So Mole is hard to make.
[02:25:39.660 --> 02:25:40.660]   That is I miss it.
[02:25:40.660 --> 02:25:43.140]   A good Mole is a real art form.
[02:25:43.140 --> 02:25:44.780]   They don't share the.
[02:25:44.780 --> 02:25:46.340]   They don't share the.
[02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:47.340]   Here is.
[02:25:47.340 --> 02:25:48.820]   You can imagine a Seattle Mole would be very good.
[02:25:48.820 --> 02:25:52.740]   No, the former art director of Nine Inch Nails.
[02:25:52.740 --> 02:25:59.300]   Masks, movie monster masks to really scare the pants off the people.
[02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:02.300]   Oh, that's really terrifying.
[02:26:02.300 --> 02:26:03.300]   Yikes.
[02:26:03.300 --> 02:26:04.300]   Weirdos.
[02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:05.860]   Scary masks.
[02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:06.860]   Scary, scary.
[02:26:06.860 --> 02:26:10.540]   I'm sorry if I'm giving you bad dreams.
[02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:11.860]   Don't look at that.
[02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:14.300]   Look, don't look.
[02:26:14.300 --> 02:26:16.900]   Don't look such a weirdo.
[02:26:16.900 --> 02:26:20.020]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for Stacy to have some queso.
[02:26:20.020 --> 02:26:26.260]   So we've got to say so long we do Twitter every Wednesday 130 Pacific for 30 Eastern
[02:26:26.260 --> 02:26:27.260]   2030 UTC.
[02:26:27.260 --> 02:26:32.060]   You can watch us live or listen live through live streams at Twitter.tv/live.
[02:26:32.060 --> 02:26:35.420]   If you're doing that, the chat room is great.
[02:26:35.420 --> 02:26:36.420]   IRC.twit.tv.
[02:26:36.420 --> 02:26:37.900]   They're joking along with the rest of us.
[02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:39.820]   Lots of great stuff in there.
[02:26:39.820 --> 02:26:44.860]   You can also get on to man versions of the show at our website, twit.tv/twig on YouTube.
[02:26:44.860 --> 02:26:45.860]   There's video there.
[02:26:45.860 --> 02:26:48.460]   In fact, there's a whole twig channel on YouTube.
[02:26:48.460 --> 02:26:52.500]   And the best thing to do would be subscribe that way you get it automatically on your phone
[02:26:52.500 --> 02:26:55.660]   every time it's available.
[02:26:55.660 --> 02:26:56.660]   It's there.
[02:26:56.660 --> 02:26:58.060]   Always subscribe if you can.
[02:26:58.060 --> 02:26:59.060]   We appreciate it.
[02:26:59.060 --> 02:27:00.060]   Thank you for watching.
[02:27:00.060 --> 02:27:01.060]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:27:01.060 --> 02:27:03.060]   Megan Bathum, don't forget Stacy on IoT.
[02:27:03.060 --> 02:27:04.780]   Tuesday's the event.
[02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:05.980]   So go there right now.
[02:27:05.980 --> 02:27:07.660]   Sign up for the connected event.
[02:27:07.660 --> 02:27:08.660]   Great event.
[02:27:08.660 --> 02:27:09.660]   It really sounds good.
[02:27:09.660 --> 02:27:10.980]   It's going to be fun.
[02:27:10.980 --> 02:27:12.580]   They're better and better and better.
[02:27:12.580 --> 02:27:14.900]   What wig will you be wearing on that one?
[02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:16.900]   Oh, I might have my natural hair.
[02:27:16.900 --> 02:27:18.740]   Although maybe I'll use this one.
[02:27:18.740 --> 02:27:19.740]   That's pretty good.
[02:27:19.740 --> 02:27:22.180]   I need to do wig, but you have to do one person to get them.
[02:27:22.180 --> 02:27:23.180]   And that's not happening.
[02:27:23.180 --> 02:27:24.180]   Oh, yeah.
[02:27:24.180 --> 02:27:25.180]   Get them fitted.
[02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:26.180]   Got to get them fitted.
[02:27:26.180 --> 02:27:27.180]   Oh, really?
[02:27:27.180 --> 02:27:29.740]   Well, you have to make sure they fit your face first.
[02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:32.420]   And then you have to-- they have little straps on the back.
[02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:33.420]   Mine are super fancy.
[02:27:33.420 --> 02:27:35.780]   That's probably what's wrong with the wig buying I've been doing.
[02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:37.780]   I don't have any.
[02:27:37.780 --> 02:27:40.460]   I just look like the three stitches.
[02:27:40.460 --> 02:27:41.460]   That's it.
[02:27:41.460 --> 02:27:43.580]   Pruitt, catch them on Hands-On Photography and Hands-On Wellness.
[02:27:43.580 --> 02:27:45.580]   And of course, back here every Wednesday.
[02:27:45.580 --> 02:27:46.580]   Yeah.
[02:27:46.580 --> 02:27:49.260]   Stacy and this cat right here, Jeff Jarvis, professor.
[02:27:49.260 --> 02:27:51.580]   I lost your credit roll.
[02:27:51.580 --> 02:27:53.140]   No, it's OK.
[02:27:53.140 --> 02:27:56.420]   Yeah, you can't lose that thing because there's no way you can memorize it.
[02:27:56.420 --> 02:27:58.420]   How can I lose it?
[02:27:58.420 --> 02:28:01.580]   We need to get him a lineotype set kind of thing.
[02:28:01.580 --> 02:28:03.580]   Yeah, I didn't even show you this.
[02:28:03.580 --> 02:28:04.580]   I didn't even show you this.
[02:28:04.580 --> 02:28:09.060]   This is-- at least I'm very proud of it because my wife got this for me.
[02:28:09.060 --> 02:28:10.060]   Look at that.
[02:28:10.060 --> 02:28:12.060]   Oh, it even says line of thing.
[02:28:12.060 --> 02:28:13.060]   Oh, very nice thing.
[02:28:13.060 --> 02:28:14.060]   Yeah.
[02:28:14.060 --> 02:28:15.060]   I love that machine.
[02:28:15.060 --> 02:28:17.300]   How many shots do you have on your desk?
[02:28:17.300 --> 02:28:18.300]   He's missing.
[02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:19.740]   You know, he's all about journalism.
[02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:20.860]   If you ever get to see--
[02:28:20.860 --> 02:28:23.140]   I've got the typo meter up there.
[02:28:23.140 --> 02:28:24.140]   Wow.
[02:28:24.140 --> 02:28:26.540]   I've got a little tiny Gutenberg press over there.
[02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:27.540]   Wow.
[02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:28.540]   Let's see it.
[02:28:28.540 --> 02:28:33.220]   OK, everybody, guess what Jeff does for a living?
[02:28:33.220 --> 02:28:34.340]   A typo meter.
[02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:35.340]   Exactly right.
[02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:36.980]   He's a hand model.
[02:28:36.980 --> 02:28:37.980]   Place chess.
[02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:38.980]   Yeah.
[02:28:38.980 --> 02:28:40.140]   Jeff Jarvis.
[02:28:40.140 --> 02:28:42.660]   This is the history of--
[02:28:42.660 --> 02:28:43.660]   Type.
[02:28:43.660 --> 02:28:47.620]   --in a foldable ruler, for some reason.
[02:28:47.620 --> 02:28:48.620]   Yeah.
[02:28:48.620 --> 02:28:49.620]   For some reason, no one knows.
[02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:50.620]   I'll teach you this.
[02:28:50.620 --> 02:28:51.620]   That's really weird.
[02:28:51.620 --> 02:28:52.620]   Pretty geeky.
[02:28:52.620 --> 02:28:53.620]   Is that cool?
[02:28:53.620 --> 02:28:54.620]   No one knows what that is.
[02:28:54.620 --> 02:28:57.500]   You know, if you ever get to go to the townite center for entrepreneurial journalism,
[02:28:57.500 --> 02:29:00.060]   it's Stacy at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of--
[02:29:00.060 --> 02:29:03.980]   oops-- at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the University of New York.
[02:29:03.980 --> 02:29:07.620]   In the lobby, they have the best manual typewriter collection ever.
[02:29:07.620 --> 02:29:08.620]   It's awesome.
[02:29:08.620 --> 02:29:09.620]   We do.
[02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:10.620]   We do, in fact.
[02:29:10.620 --> 02:29:11.620]   Yes, we do.
[02:29:11.620 --> 02:29:12.620]   That's awesome.
[02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:13.620]   It's really cool.
[02:29:13.620 --> 02:29:15.220]   My favorite one is a typewriter called the Binger.
[02:29:15.220 --> 02:29:18.340]   I see you have a machine that goes Binger.
[02:29:18.340 --> 02:29:20.380]   Leonard Taap, professor for journalistic innovation.
[02:29:20.380 --> 02:29:24.100]   Ladies and gentlemen, the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University
[02:29:24.100 --> 02:29:25.100]   of New York.
[02:29:25.100 --> 02:29:26.100]   Mr. Jeff Free.
[02:29:26.100 --> 02:29:27.940]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:29:27.940 --> 02:29:30.740]   We appreciate you putting up with us for God.
[02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:32.380]   2 and 1/2 hours.
[02:29:32.380 --> 02:29:37.980]   We'll come back and do it again next week.
[02:29:37.980 --> 02:29:38.980]   What do you say?
[02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:39.980]   All right, and we--
[02:29:39.980 --> 02:29:40.980]   Believe it or not.
[02:29:40.980 --> 02:29:41.980]   All right.
[02:29:41.980 --> 02:29:42.980]   See you.
[02:29:42.980 --> 02:29:43.980]   Bye-bye.
[02:29:43.980 --> 02:29:45.980]   Hi, I'm Jason Howell, host of All About Android.
[02:29:45.980 --> 02:29:51.460]   Each week I'm joined by my co-hosts Ron Richards and Florence Ion, as well as a whole rotating
[02:29:51.460 --> 02:29:57.060]   cast of guests, journalists in the Android space, experts, developers, and even people
[02:29:57.060 --> 02:30:00.780]   working on Android behind the scenes at Google.
[02:30:00.780 --> 02:30:04.180]   We talk about everything that has to do with Android, and you don't want to miss a single
[02:30:04.180 --> 02:30:07.100]   episode so you know what is going on behind the scenes.
[02:30:07.100 --> 02:30:09.500]   That's twit.tv/AA.
