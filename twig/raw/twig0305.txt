[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.180]   Welcome great to be back good to see you. I always say can we get Danny on we get Danny on I like Dan
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.840]   There's nobody even him so how long have you been doing search engine land?
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.720]   Searching jin land have been doing since
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.240]   2000 end of 2006 and then I had done the search engine watch site since like
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.640]   1996 so you're coming out the anniversary is coming up 10 and 10 and 20 next year
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.240]   Wow, that's a lot 96. They're hardly were any websites in 96. I'll to this man. I'll to this
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.720]   That's a great there's a great thing. I put on Instagram. It did really well was um if you ever watch VEEP
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.040]   There's the the cheapest staff in there and they find something on Google. He's like, oh man
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.400]   I hate the internet. I liked it better when it's just all to Vista
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.260]   I love VEEP. Oh, yeah, get me started on VEEP
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.240]   I'm sad. No game. What am I gonna do Sunday nights? No game of Thrones no Silicon Valley no VEEP
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.960]   Don't watch sense eight. It's terrible. Is it it? It's really yeah? I've come to the conclusion that it's terrible
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   I liked it at first and then I
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.800]   Minor spoiler. It's kind of like lost. Oh, that's not what I need
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.680]   It's kind of weird and you're kind of like whoo that's weird and then it but it I just think they're not going
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.680]   I think it's gonna end up being a dream the whole somebody said Game of Thrones
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.120]   Everybody's gonna die and end up on the island and lost and then go on with lost. That would be great. Yeah big reveal
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.120]   It's the same show it's the same show
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.240]   Catch up on Orphan Black love or from black although somebody told me the new season is not as good
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.680]   It's been different. I'm enjoying it. Yeah
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.440]   The just the the acting of the lead
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.040]   Character is so good
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.760]   That it's like it makes up for any faults it might might have she is so good. She really is good every imaginable character
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.400]   She really is good. How are we talking about TV? I don't know that happened
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.880]   But as geeks we like watch TV because we got under the dome coming back so they're all no
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.920]   Under the dome is great
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.680]   I know where's the Google show but you have to watch under the dome because you have never seen Microsoft product placement like you will
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.680]   See in that show
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.560]   They they set off bombs with their windows phone
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.080]   Microsoft surface is everywhere
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.560]   I'm gonna interested to see if they managed to get the surface pro 3 and through the dome finally because they're still on old
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.320]   Surface 2's that's so funny
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.320]   But it's funny because I like the ads too because you get all that stuff and then even Google occasionally will buy an ad and
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.480]   Sometimes you get some counter programming
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:44.600]   Yeah, does Google do product placement? I don't think I've ever seen an andra like intentional product. I don't think so look at my fine Android phone
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.160]   They should
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.760]   No, they shouldn't I can't recall a lot of that now
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.240]   It doesn't come to mind. It's kind of like with Apple to where suppose they don't do product place
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.680]   They say they won't pay for it. It's available for people. Yeah, they're partners do we don't pay for it
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.960]   Well, yeah Apple says they just give me a hundred Mac books that's paying for one Apple product
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.960]   There's a lot of money, but but yeah Samsung does it a bunch of companies that no key used to do it
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.360]   Yeah, no key remember in the first Star Trek reboot
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:25.080]   Google did have one notable product placement and that would be the movie the internship
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:33.160]   But other than that, I don't know. Yeah, I haven't seen that movie by the way, so it's hilarious. It's it's worth seeing
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.680]   I don't know if a hilarious is the word I'd use you liked it. I liked it. I'm a soccer player scene
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.720]   Yeah, I liked it. It's kind of which it's exactly what you'd expect to get from it
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.800]   It's you've seen that kind of movie before with Vince Vaughn or whatever. Yeah Vince hangover in Google exactly
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.840]   Yeah, what is interesting though is I've never seen and this will get back to Google
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.360]   But it'll all shut up, but they have never spent as much money on
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.560]   commercials especially for search as I have seen them do over this past year and
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.000]   And a lot of that really feels like it is that run up to we don't know what's gonna happen with Apple
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.600]   we really want to make sure you're using the Google search app because
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.680]   We want to keep it locked in well
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.240]   Let's talk about that because it's pretty obvious now that Apple is
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.600]   Running as fast as it can away from Google was it you who wrote that article? It was me who wrote that article
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.800]   What's so since synopsize you say the end is near there are two factors that are causing us to
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.920]   The world to change in such a way that people like me who loves running Google stuff on Apple hardware
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.640]   Are numbered so basically what's what's happening is number one?
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:46.160]   We are becoming increasingly reliant and falling increasingly in love with our virtual assistants Google now and
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.320]   Siri, okay
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.400]   Increasingly those are becoming more powerful by using more products from the company that makes it so for example with Google now
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.080]   They just launched now on tap which is only for Android so suddenly
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.560]   It already required Google Calendar Gmail
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:10.120]   Other there's a difference I think Google would have it available on Apple. It's just the way Apple constructs
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:17.660]   iOS you can't do that kind of thing, but I think Google would love I mean it's clear unlike Windows phone Google wants to be
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.200]   Unappled they realize they need us. That's true. Although if you read that great book
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:30.200]   About Google dogfight. Yeah, they talk about how there was a debate Andy Rubin did not want
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:37.920]   To make it was very upset when he heard they were making apps for Apple. He said no no you should only make apps for Android
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.960]   But in fact some of the best Apple apps were Google apps and some of the most
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.920]   lucrative advertising opportunities are on iOS devices right because those are the people who spend more on
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:55.080]   Average the other factor of course is that and I address that very point of the column is that Apple is deliberately trying to replace Google
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.700]   If you look at the new spotlight features this stuff is designed for you
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.240]   Just never have to use Google just run your search and spotlight uses Bing if it has to do a web search
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.480]   Absolutely the real question is at what point does Safari stop defaulting to Google? Is that the kind of the last?
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.080]   Place app I think it's a certainty that that's gonna happen at some point, right?
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:20.000]   You know and so but is that what you see that's to me that's that puts the lie to what Apple says which is we put users first
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.840]   really
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.620]   Users want Google don't they they don't want Bing?
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:32.680]   I don't hear anybody clamoring. Oh, please make the default search be Bing Apple just doesn't trust anyone and they think that in the future
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.640]   They're if they don't control every ask, you know
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.840]   They're digging up their own iron ore to make their you know devices and stuff
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.480]   They don't trust anybody and they they constantly eliminate partners
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:48.280]   I think the most extreme example though of Apple trying to replace Google is now they have Street View cars driving around
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.840]   Taking pictures in the UK and in 13
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.660]   But Apple Maps is another example of where they didn't do the best thing for the consumer which would be elite
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.480]   You know not do their own
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.720]   Weak version of maps but let consumers continue to use Google Maps would say like yeah, of course
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.200]   They haven't blocked Google zaps
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.280]   I mean that would be the final draconian step is to say no you can't use Google zaps
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:16.680]   I mean part of it is Apple just doesn't like the whole API concept in order for them to sort of like get away from Google
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:24.400]   Altogether, they've got these hooks from from from from Siri directly into Apple Maps from the Apple Watch into Apple Maps
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.480]   And so on in order for that to be an open API that other companies could use
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.880]   That would run counter to what Apple likes to do
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.880]   They want it they want all that to happen behind the scenes invisibly and that's how they define the user experience
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.240]   We control everything we make sure everything works perfectly and flawlessly without it
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.880]   You having to configure anything and that means we have to build everything from scratch and they somewhat misrepresent the case saying
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.480]   Well, what we're doing this to protect your privacy
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:56.880]   Yeah, protect your privacy from Google, but yeah Apple sells ads Apple in order to do news has to collect information about what you're reading
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.560]   despite what they say
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.000]   But you make that at the end the kind of the ultimate point which is
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.200]   We're all gonna have to choose. Yeah, there will be the left hand pass in the right hand path
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.760]   There will be if you want Google you're gonna have to go Android if you want Apple
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:16.880]   You're gonna have to go iPhone as a somebody who used an Android device for a long time then switched to iPhone when the iPhone 6 came out
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:23.120]   I was struggling with the concept of using Google now on iPhone already and it's open the app
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:29.040]   But it's not quite there and and and now with the major changes that both Apple has done
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:36.000]   With its with its with its preemptive search and all that kind of stuff and the things that Google has done with now on tap
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.400]   I'm gonna get if I try to use Google now on iPhone
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:48.240]   It's gonna be such an inferior experience compared to Siri on iPhone or compared to Google now on Android that I'm not gonna make that choice
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.840]   I'm gonna choose one phone or the other and I'm gonna go with the
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.560]   Virtual assistant that's made by the same people who made the operate operating. So okay, so using an iPhone now
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:04.080]   You're gonna go you're gonna stick with the iPhone. No, I may go all the way. I may go all the way Google. I love Google now
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:10.560]   Danny do you feel like Google now is living up to its potential though feels like it could do so much more doesn't it?
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.680]   You know, I think it's far ahead of any of the competitors
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.040]   I think there is more it can do and and I think that they will continue to do it
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.520]   Are they are they worried about going too far the crossing the creepy line?
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:28.120]   Well, I think that's part of it when I've talked with them one of the things that they've also said is that it's not so much that they
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.760]   Want to go far is that it's easy to
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:37.040]   It's easy to try to do things that people don't actually want or use and now I can't think of good examples of that
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.440]   But you know that they can they can try to there's all sorts of things people think their assistant should do
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.120]   And then there are some of the things that they wouldn't actually use that much
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.840]   There are some things that they might think well, that's a bit too eerie and then they're sort of the just right area
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:55.080]   And that's what they're trying to get to and you know, I think they've been very good on doing the just right stuff
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.480]   But you know sometimes you can see it go a little out of control like
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:05.560]   You know one of the powerful things is that it's understanding things you search for so it will suggest articles that you've looked for
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.560]   But then sometimes I can feel a bit overwhelmed like wow, I don't need all these articles
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.120]   You're giving me like wait wait wait too many that sort of thing
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.800]   But other things it does it does really well
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.600]   So, you know, I think they're on the right path
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.040]   And I think you know for me
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:26.000]   This has been one of the most exciting things actually is watching this development of predictive search and and even with the stuff that Apple rolled out last week
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.600]   It it doesn't really come close to touching what Google now does because they don't have the search history and they don't have the the access into your
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:40.120]   Email and that's the trade-off you're getting you know if you want an assistant whether it's a
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.240]   Human assistant or a virtual assistant that is effective
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.040]   They're going to be more effective the more they know about you
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:53.200]   So it's a matter of which you trust and at some point maybe Apple will try to go through and do more of the okay
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:59.760]   We will go ahead and start reading your email and all this other stuff and hope the fact that they're not trying to necessarily target ads specifically around it
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.600]   May may help people
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.800]   Make that kind of a choice
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:09.360]   But there's still a lot of learning that they need to do and and they just don't have that kind of learning that that Google's established so far
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.680]   We often argue on other shows in this show too
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:20.480]   About privacy about Google about whether Google knows too much whether people should worry nobody debates
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.640]   I think the the right of anybody to say I want to be more private
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.760]   Yeah
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:31.760]   But some of us say I don't push that too far because I would you know if you're concerned
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.520]   You have the right to be private
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.840]   Don't tell me I have to be private. I'd like to give Google those signals because I like what I get from Google
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.040]   And if I'm that valuable right and I if I do that that's to my detriment
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:48.360]   But you I don't I'm afraid of is that techno phobes or people were worried about protecting their privacy will shut down a lot of great stuff
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:54.000]   Because they think well nobody should be allowed to do that one of the problems is that the public isn't isn't equipped
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:03.480]   Technologically or intellectually to really fully grapple with what's happening with their data in the world in general
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:09.560]   It's very complicated part of the reason is that that information is not public or available to anyone
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.920]   Because the you know these are trade secrets to a very large extent
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.920]   But there's another element to this that I think is is a good
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.120]   Thing to introduce into the conversation
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.440]   Which is that you know Danny was talking about the advertising that Google's been doing you know
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.360]   It's an old cliche that you are the product if it's
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:32.040]   Advertisers supported and I don't really that's not really accurate. I kind of really believe that's fully active. No, I've said it
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:40.200]   In a column long ago, but it is true that one of the things that they are doing to make a better product is to make a better
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.280]   User in other words companies like Facebook and Google
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:48.720]   Succeed to the extent that they can convince the public to go along with and accept and enjoy
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.000]   The changes that they're affecting in people's lives in terms of privacy and other things
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.240]   So the the quicker Google or Facebook or some other company can get you to accept
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:05.040]   the data harvesting that they're doing the more successful they're going to be
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.440]   financially
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:13.240]   And and Apple has its own way of doing things Apple has done things in the past that are just
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.360]   Blately designed to train users
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:21.960]   Like lab rats. I mean for example one of my favorite examples is when the iPhone came out the radical thing about it
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.240]   Which everybody whined about was the lack of a keyboard? Oh, I can't type on this on-screen keyboard. This is terrible
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.280]   I'm never gonna accept this and Apple and Apple not only refused to make a physical keyboard to go with it
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.320]   They refused to let anyone else do it either
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:40.400]   They they forced us three years in the wilderness or something like that with zero keyboard except the on-screen keyboard
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.560]   When we all accepted it, then they said, okay other keyboards can can come out that support this
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.240]   They trained us to use on-screen keyboards. Nobody else could have done it. They did it
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:55.800]   They made a better user and that's one of the reasons why they're a leader in in multi multi touch interfaces
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.440]   Because they made right users become more adaptable to the things that they're doing
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.320]   What do you think Danny
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.000]   Well, I agree on that
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.480]   I think that's a great observation on the whole the keyboard thing is one of the advantages that Apple has and that they control the entire
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.400]   Thing because it's a closed system. So we have both you're gonna do what you want
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.960]   You're right and you know at the same time you had Android and if you did want the keyboard and you didn't want to change over
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.720]   You could you could go with it from there. I think that is the downside though. Sometimes people
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.720]   Don't want to be trained to do something different and they're happy with what they're doing
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.720]   So it's it's nice that you have those alternatives
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:38.520]   And I think that goes to the whole idea of well, will we be choosing you know based off of
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.680]   What I can get from apples crowd and what they do for their assistant versus google
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.800]   I guess I'm more optimistic
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:51.640]   Or that I don't know that people are necessarily choosing their phones for the data that's behind them
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.880]   I think people are still stuck in the mindset of
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:59.400]   I'm buying the iPhone because it has some apps I like or I'm used to the interface
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:04.760]   Or I just like Apple products and it syncs with a few things there or I'm buying Apple for this other reason
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.760]   That's not to take away that some people are really deeply embedded in the ecosystems
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:14.360]   But I just don't know that people right now are going to consciously think why I would want to get
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.960]   um
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:20.520]   Android because google now is so much better on that. I think that's a real minority of the people that are there
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.600]   Maybe it'll change
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:27.480]   What I what I think is going to happen and this is peace. I've been noodling for some time is sort of like
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.480]   you know, it's talking about the google search phone and and that
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.120]   What you're seeing happen?
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:41.400]   Especially on android but even with google's products on any of the devices is that they are leveraging their search to turn these into search phones
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:48.040]   Not smartphones that they have the ability to let you search and locate information in a way that you know takes the
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:53.080]   Virtual search box that we're used to on google itself and puts it into your hand
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:58.280]   And and allows you to go around and one of the interesting things they demonstrated last week was this idea that
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.600]   You know if you're standing in front of it
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.320]   They did this in Paris and I tried it out myself where I was you know
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.840]   You stand in front of the Eiffel tower and you just tell your phone how tall is it?
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:14.040]   And you can do this on iPhone or work. Yeah, and it and it came back and said it's you know 178 meters
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.920]   You say how tall is it and if you're in proximity to
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.320]   Eiffel tower it says oh that what if you say how big is it
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:26.280]   Do you do some of that stuff as well so we had um
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:35.160]   I didn't know it did that Jason hell is going. Yeah. Yeah. No, we talked about it a little bit on last week show right the location the proximity
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.120]   Sensor. Yeah, no where you are
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:45.160]   Be a GPS and it can add context results. Yeah, like what's the phone number of this place and it would pull back the phone number of
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:52.520]   Twib oh, that's right. We did talk about that and Apple can try to do some of that stuff as well, but I think that
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:57.880]   You know it really it's really powerful in the sense that you think oh that makes sense
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.040]   And it seems very natural and yet that would be an incredibly hard thing for a surgeon
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.520]   You to have done until we tied it to a mobile device
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:10.440]   And until you can tie it into a whole database of information and that's what Google has
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:15.240]   They've got their knowledge graph their knowledge vault. They've got all this search data that they picked up
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.560]   And so when we talk about what Apple may do
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.200]   Um, you know two years ago
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:25.720]   I wrote about how they wouldn't go thermal nuclear on google what they would do is they build out something maybe like the series
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.200]   Search engine and over time you would see that disappear
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:34.920]   And I think and I think that Jason nailed it very well and calicones in his piece where he said it's spotlight and that
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.360]   You know and they didn't call it the series search engine, but that's what spotlight has happened
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.680]   It has turned into this replacement and I think that you will see them
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.120]   You know if they just you know the the google deal should have been up by now
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.400]   So as best we can tell because they said they're still talking
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.960]   It's probably been extended for a few months
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.680]   But yeah, I think that they could turn
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:00.440]   Google off and a lot of people wouldn't notice because a lot of the general searching you do tends to be
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.200]   You know
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.560]   Well, it's not that much. It doesn't say here's a google search result
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.680]   No, it doesn't and that's that's so you don't even know
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:13.640]   You get away from users thinking you dropped google because you didn't drop google you added spotlight
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.160]   Right and you've been adding spotlight over the past couple years
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.200]   You know you or past two years you've built out the spotlight search engine
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:26.920]   So what if apple does it and they announced new spotlight search and safari is powered by spotlight search or has spotlight search
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.160]   Night they may even be calling it that already
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.960]   You don't think they've switched off google
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.240]   You don't think i'm not getting google and the being results when you get into the web search results are probably good enough for a lot of things
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.240]   That's just tricking people basically. That's like don't but it's kind of the apple way
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.840]   I mean the you know google google's approach to search is
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.680]   Search this is search. We are doing search
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:53.400]   Are you feeling lucky and then apple's way is like you can find things right?
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.080]   It's like not even they're not even
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.280]   Any's how people think of search. That's what people want search to be right. They don't
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:05.560]   What will happen is apple will successfully get you off of using google search and safari over to spotlight search
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:11.960]   But all they've done is made you start using a google clone from 2008. Yeah over on google
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:16.440]   They're doing google 2015 which has the direct answers which has the predictive searches
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:22.600]   It has all this other stuff that's going on with it from there that ties you in and that is the harder thing for them to try to replicate
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.040]   And that maybe would be the thing that caused the people to come into it
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.160]   If not switching off from their android device
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.720]   Just switching over to the google search app because maybe they get used to having all this stuff at hand
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.400]   And it's it's nice for them if you played with the sound hounds new search
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.040]   Natural language search is called hound
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:44.680]   I haven't they said they were going to send me an invitation. I never got it. You've heard about it though
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.680]   You've seen the demos right?
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.120]   vaguely
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:54.200]   I it sounds somewhat familiar, but there's so many different people. I know and I first poo pooed it
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.320]   Oh good. Here's my invite
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.520]   Don't show my activation code. Nope
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.120]   Um
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.120]   Yeah, I was gonna send you an invite actually
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:09.400]   Have you have one? Have you played with it? I haven't I the few times that I have I didn't have very good results
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.360]   Oh
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:15.640]   So I just haven't right I found the time to go back and really silly things to try to
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.160]   Be google at their own game, right? That's a tall order
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.440]   Um, and yet I'd seen some stuff that people talking about it. Maybe that's just good marketing
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:30.200]   I think I think what people have have said about it is that it makes for a good demo like when you watch the videos
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.760]   But then when you really try and kind of go off
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.520]   Go off on your own and come up with you know try and stump it
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.240]   It's pretty easy to say how's kind of like spotlight that way
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.080]   And I think that that actually is what people want people don't want to do search
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.280]   They just want the answers to things that they're looking for available when they need them, right? Right?
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.880]   So
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.960]   I'm looking over the tech crunch thing that they did on sound town. Yeah, and they're like saying
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:59.480]   Hey, look you can do a bunch of searches and rapid succession. Let me tell you the director of conversational search from google
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.080]   Did this right? I mean it's not we're not talking
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:08.520]   I've got a startup or I've got a thing that maybe I can use if I get the invite and we'll see how it happens
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.360]   He's out there
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:17.240]   They're live in front of an audience and probably went through 40 different queries and would do things like, you know
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.080]   Who is LeBron James? What team does he play for?
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.040]   What was his score, you know
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:28.440]   Not even full sentences, but understanding the previous question that you had said
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.040]   You know in the way that I guess hound can do that sort of thing as well
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.840]   And and it was working near flawlessly
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.200]   Um, you know and and then coupled with that
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.240]   I mean, he just he went through the stuff that a couple years ago
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.920]   You would have thought was amazing that it could just give you answers like that with him just speaking
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.360]   But then you know he would do things like and this goes back to the location thing
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.800]   We was like, you know
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:55.560]   Call the conference center. I'm in and it knew the conference center used in found the phone number dialed it up and you know
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.960]   It was like whoa, you know, so it's
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.560]   Yeah, I guess you think it come along but google's already got it
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.240]   I
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:08.760]   And google has it so much that we either don't realize that it's there or we just take it for granted
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.520]   You know, so how it has the same problem that google does on apple
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:16.200]   You have to launch the hand app for it to right and then say okay hound
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:22.920]   How many calories are in three eggs 200 grams of spinach and a pound of hamburger
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:32.360]   Three medium rahole eggs 200 that's pretty fast. That's good. That's really good. I asked it
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:38.120]   A compound search which was how many calories are in three rahole eggs
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.000]   200 grams of spinach and a pound of hamburger
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.120]   But see that it did that within less than three three eggs
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.280]   So try that with google. Should we try that with google?
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.760]   Yeah, i'll do the same
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:55.080]   I can't i can't remember all the different things you said. Okay, let's let's see here. I'll do this
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.120]   With google, let's go to google. Oops
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:03.000]   So one of the things first of all the search you just did and the result was
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.080]   A glimpse of the future. We're not going to be pondering over results
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.800]   We're going to just get the answer and that's a very nice answer too because they give me all the nutrition
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.800]   facts
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:19.480]   Although, okay google wait a minute. I got to enable it. Hold on. Oh, and I shouldn't say it because everybody. I'm sorry everybody
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:27.640]   How many calories are in three whole eggs a pound of hamburger and 200 grams of broccoli
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:39.400]   It's already slower didn't give me a very good result and it didn't do it very fast. No
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:45.000]   Um, so there's one thing it does better not that i'm going to launch hound to do that
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.040]   Um, but it also does so it does compound searching which is kind of interesting you can
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:55.800]   Say give me all here. Let's try it. Okay, hound give me all the bed and breakfast in san francisco
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.800]   With our that our four stars are more and less than 200 bucks a night
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:05.080]   I got a little extra garbage in there. Whoops and it's still going
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:10.120]   Something about carcass on and and and that has a little bit of extra garbage. Yeah
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:17.160]   Give me all the bed and breakfast in san francisco that our three stars are better and less than 200 bucks a night
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:22.040]   It doesn't like 200 bucks. Oh my god. Oh shoot
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.320]   Stop talking
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.240]   Let's see. Let's see if it gets makes any sense out of that compa
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:37.880]   Showing search results for all the bed and breakfasts in san francisco that our three stars are better and less that 200 bucks a night and like 200 bucks
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:45.080]   It actually had least kind of it made an effort. Yeah, by the way, it also has an ad. Yeah
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.800]   So what are the results like though?
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:55.400]   Uh, yeah, mostly it's just search it's well. I think it's good that it wasn't thrown by your colloquialism for whatever i was saying there
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:02.040]   That's crazy. I mean if you go back to the results, so yeah, I'd interpret what you search for but it didn't actually give you the answer
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.680]   Yeah, no, it didn't give me the answer as I expected it
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.240]   to
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.080]   Just checking through. I don't know. It's an interesting idea anyway
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.320]   Um
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.760]   That's hound and it's from the sound hound folks, which is kind of interesting
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:23.080]   I guess my my surprise is I wouldn't expect anybody to attempt to enter this space. You've already got yeah, you know, cortana
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:29.000]   Google and syria. Yeah, but that's amise and by the way amazon, which does a pretty decent job with that
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.760]   That's right, but that is fast and so is echo by the way. Yeah, it goes really fast. Yeah
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.480]   Come to think of it. Google's a laggard. What are they what's going on with it?
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.120]   Google think they can compete. Yeah, let's take a break when we come back
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:45.320]   You probably covered this at all about android last night 600,000 sam sung phones vulnerable
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:51.640]   No, we didn't to a keyboard make it into the show last night. Oh, well, we'll talk about it overlooked keyboard flaw
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.440]   That swift key says it's not our fault
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:58.600]   Our show today brought to you by legal zoom.com
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:03.240]   There's so many people why uh so many reasons why smart business people trust legal zoom including me
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.440]   Uh, we used them to form an LLC 10 years ago
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:11.160]   You can do the same incorporate form a nonprofit register your trademark
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.720]   Apply for a patent
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.000]   More than a million people over the last 10 years have used legal zoom
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.960]   To kind of make their dreams come true
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:24.600]   It's also your first stop when you need advice from attorney now. See this is why it gets a look up
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.280]   They're not a law firm
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.160]   And there are no attorneys, you know to answer your calls at legal zoom
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.040]   But they have built a network of independent attorneys in most states to provide legal advice
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:40.520]   And other useful services to help you run your business. That's the pre negotiated legal zoom legal plan, which is great
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:49.000]   Whether you need a contract reviewed or invited and whether you should incorporate or form an LLC or as I wondered what state my LLC should be in
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.240]   legal zoom.com
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:56.200]   complete transparency upfront pricing customer reviews and a 100 percent
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.360]   Guarantee on your satisfaction. What state did you choose by the way?
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.880]   I chose Delaware, but that's because this was before legal zoom had they
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:09.320]   Eternithin and I would have loved that because I would have because they're pros and cons on California versus Delaware
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.520]   I just I don't know. I randomly chose Delaware Delaware's cheaper
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:17.640]   Uh and apparently less than covering and covering uh and the main reason I did
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:23.960]   It's in science that is even stupid. Uh, I think it was Kevin probably who told me venture capitalists prefer Delaware
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:29.400]   Um because uh, I guess because of the less owners legal requests, huh? Um
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.360]   But there are advantages to California for instance
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.720]   We pay extra business tax because we have to pay Delaware as well as California business tax
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:43.240]   Um, see these are the kinds of things legal zoom can help you with and it's great and wills

[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.960]   Samsung I have a Samsung galaxy s6 one of the vulnerable phones
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.960]   Uh
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.840]   A statement by a company called now secure
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.400]   In the wall street journal says even though we told samsung
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.520]   Uh in 2012
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:21.560]   This bug persists. I'm sorry. I'm sorry in November 2014. Um, this bug
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:26.760]   Persists that that is with the samsung keyboard now the samsung keyboard
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:33.480]   Is swift key but it is not swift keys fault fact swift key says if you install the swift key keyboard and use that
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.160]   From the app store. It is not you will not have this flaw
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.000]   Um
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.760]   last week, uh, two researchers from now secure to see
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:47.720]   If samsung said okay, okay wait three months and we'll fix it three months are up
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:57.720]   They bought two galaxy s6s found that both were still vulnerable to the security hole which involves how the phone accepts data when updating keyboard software
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.720]   particularly the themes
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.120]   So the themes can come from a uh
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.440]   They're on they come from a non secure server and that server can be spoofed
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.000]   So you can install a theme
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.920]   On your keyboard and it may in fact put a keystroke logger on there
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.400]   Tech around shot a few sources that said that it was entirely samsung's
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:23.000]   Implementation screw up that caused it well the cheap the chief source of that would probably be swift key
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.920]   Which is anxious to let you know that this is not a vulnerability that belongs to a swift key
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:34.040]   Yeah, we said they wrote we supply samsung with the core technology that powers the word predictions in their keyboard
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.520]   It appears that this the way this technology is integrated on samsung devices
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:45.800]   Introduce the security vulnerability. We're doing everything we can to support a long time partner and their efforts to resolve the samsung says
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:52.840]   Uh, nox their security platform has the capability to update the security policy of the phones over the air
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:32:00.040]   And I think invisibly yeah to invalidate any vulnerabilities. Uh, he said they say these security policy updates will roll out in a few days
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:05.080]   So you're looking on the screen those of you watching at the proof of concept
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.160]   Uh from the security researchers now secure who does
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.600]   That's their video, right? Yeah
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.320]   See what happens here. I
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.840]   Look at this. I have set up an incredible demonstration
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.320]   It was so easy for you to
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.760]   No, this is their video. Absolutely
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:29.720]   For clarity swift key wants to assure everyone this issue does not affect
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.760]   Swift keys consumer keyboard applications on google play or the apple store for that matter
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.240]   And we're absolutely committed blah blah blah
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.200]   So, uh, this is a samsung problem
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:50.120]   But something I guess you should be aware about so, uh, uh, nest had an event on the yesterday around the 15th or the 16th
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.760]   Or is it today today today? Um, yeah, it was during TNT during TNT
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.680]   They announced a new smoke detector. They pulled the old one off the market
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:04.760]   Because apparently if you wait a few waved at it too vigorously it's a okay. I guess you don't want to know for example
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:09.080]   If there's a fire, I don't want to know you don't want to know no problem. I won't bother you again
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.720]   Uh, so the second generation uh smoke detector also called the nest protect
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.360]   Detect smoke
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.240]   Two in fact split spectrum sensors
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:25.160]   It says uh, it's can read shorter wavelengths because birder modern materials burn faster
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:31.880]   Bligh it, uh, it also lets you science silence the smoke alarm, but not by waving your arms. Yeah, you have to use your app
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:38.760]   Better charge your phone. It's also 11% smaller. This is the thinnest
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.400]   smoke detector we've ever made
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:47.080]   Uh, there's a new smoke chamber to keep dust and insects out of it. Okay didn't know that was a problem
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:53.640]   99 bucks though right now how much is a first alert like the cheapo smoke detector is like 15 dollars. Yeah, yeah
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.240]   Can't wave at him. I'll pay anything so that at two o'clock in the morning
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.560]   And I'll have to go trying to figure out which one that is
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.280]   I hate that I hate that
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.440]   The new protects
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.320]   Oh, like we because you know, I said they're doing our house
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:12.520]   So it was like clear everything out of that house and I have any box of smoke detectors
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:17.480]   And carbon dioxide detect monoxide detectors and I I looked at this
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:23.240]   Box right because there's like one by every bedroom and everything like that and I thought god if I had to replace all that with nest
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:28.040]   That's a huge investment. Uh, and then when it dies, but you know
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.720]   That's true, but it's convenient. You know if you see something happening at home does your
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:41.160]   Smoke detector constantly test itself. I love this. I love this. It actually makes an audible alert at night
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.200]   And then it listens it listens do I hear it? I mean it
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:50.040]   It doesn't constantly detect itself, right? But I could hang two of them up next to each other for $20
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:57.400]   Double the protection. Yeah, I seriously it's like I don't have just one smoke detector in the house right? I have five of them
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:02.520]   I had at least five so you know for the carbon monoxide testing
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:07.080]   I mean I'm absolutely paranoid about that because you hear these horror stories of people who just don't realize it happens
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:11.560]   Okay, but where you yeah, you should have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors absolutely
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:17.000]   Yeah, but will your carbon monoxide protector talk to the nest thermostat and say turn the heat off right?
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.400]   There's a fire. There's no need for additional heat
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:26.200]   That's right
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:30.840]   Maybe you should turn the heat down it was marketing tunes or whatever. It's like I keep getting
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.800]   I keep getting ads from google about fire in my house. I think there's trying to
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.080]   We notice you don't have a smoke detector
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:45.480]   No, if if the carbon monoxide detector goes off usually carbon monoxide is a is a cracked exchange
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.640]   Plate in the heater or something like that. This is so they turn off the heater
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.600]   Uh, and also alert you on your phone
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.920]   Um, there's a new safety temperature feature if your home gets too hot or too cold
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:03.880]   Uh, you'll get a notification. Jesus is it's hot in here. Yeah, you must be very uncomfortable
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:10.520]   You must be freezing right now, but that's actually good for pets. Yeah, it's too after pets or if it's too cold in the pipes
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.800]   My burst
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:17.720]   Um, and there's a new uh drop cam. That's right. I'm actually more interested in frankly in the new drop cam
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:21.160]   Well, the drop cam actually has a feature that they didn't announce but it was in the
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.480]   Uh, fine print and the press release and so on and that is that they are going to be
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.280]   Working with a few select content creators to do live streaming to youtube
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.760]   From this what's called a nest cam they dropped they dropped the drop in the drop
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:41.240]   It's a nest cam nest cam and so some people can be using it for sort of like streaming video streaming video
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.280]   Watch me watch me
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.080]   Yeah, this is a recode discovered this that uh, and it's using it's using brio
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:55.720]   Yeah, um nest revealed it is leaning on google the device company partnering with two google divisions
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:01.000]   Uh a promotional program for its therm it's thermostat for customers of google fiber
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.160]   Well, that leaves me out austin kansas city and provo good news
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.400]   You get a 50 bucks big deal
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:13.800]   Uh, and by the way fiber will expand to 18 additional metropolitan areas in january, but it's not a business
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   We're just you know, we're just fooling around
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.760]   So the nest can you have to because i'm looking at on on now you have to
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:25.800]   Subscribe it with it to have it keep the video like what?
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:29.000]   Yeah, that's always if you don't buy it
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.400]   Drop cam has always been like that, uh, if you want
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.280]   But because you can always check the drop cam live
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:40.680]   Even if you don't subscribe, but what the subscription does is give you a dvr an off site cloud dvr
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.560]   So you can go back in time. We were doing that. We had the dropcams
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.520]   Uh, watch the studio while we were building it
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:53.320]   And that's how we got the famous buttcrack video. I don't need but do they not so if you don't have the subscription though
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:57.960]   You don't get like you get the live video and that's it. Yeah, right. Yeah
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.040]   Wow
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.320]   Well
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:05.640]   What do you want for nothing rubber biscuit? It's like a $200 camera
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.360]   I want i'll tell you what I want to email
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:18.040]   The nest cam is pretty good 1080p are we gonna we don't put we don't use dropcams anymore, but um
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:23.880]   Uh, I like now they say select youtube partners. So not just anybody can do this right
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.160]   Oh, sorry i got a big takeover here
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.240]   Um, I got a like I don't know I think they're very attractive
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.160]   Uh 200 bucks is not horrible
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:39.640]   Uh, it's a basically a drop cam pro 1080p video
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:44.920]   130 degree field of view infrared night vision it has a microphone
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:50.520]   Um, and it also has a speaker right john you could talk to it, but you sound like
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:59.080]   It's like ordering a burger
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:03.960]   So, I mean actually the cloud storage is pretty expensive 10 day video history
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:09.320]   So it goes back 10 days. Yeah, it's a hundred dollars a year a 30 day video history as $300 a year
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:14.440]   Assel pricey that's a lot of I think of our ring doorbell, which is 30 bucks a year. Yeah
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:21.880]   But uh, the difference is to drop cam saving everything all the time the ring only saves when there's motion, right?
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:25.400]   Yeah, so the drive so it's saving a lot of there's a lot of video. It's saving
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:30.920]   Right, but I I feel like this is an opportunity for somebody else to come along and say we're gonna give you a better deal on the
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.400]   Yeah on the storage
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.720]   Uh
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:41.400]   All right, Google. I mean imagine Google they have all that storage and they seem like they own nest right
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.360]   But they but they're not giving it away
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.840]   Well, but you know what I mean it is kind of weird right you would think that if you have a google account
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:53.960]   This isn't this is actually a case where you would think it would be nice if nest and google talk to each other
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:57.880]   Yeah, you know, I suppose a hundred dollars a year or 10 days, but it's not bad
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.360]   But 10 days is enough by the way, you don't need
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:04.920]   Yeah, but if you get you know, I'm I was looking at some of these other home security things like matee and tear
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:09.480]   Whatever they drop everything everywhere and they have monthly subscriptions and you might actually get more
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:14.280]   More things, but anyway, I don't know. I know what you mean though. I I got three quarters of the terabyte sitting there
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:21.240]   Unused right? Well, we use local storage for our cameras. We use Synology as a security camera solution and it records
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:24.280]   By the way, you've got a search for this for me. It's really funny
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.600]   um search for market
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.080]   Tunis so it's market the word market
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:33.560]   And then oh oh n is t and then nest
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:40.120]   Oh, oh n is t and now one word. Okay. Well, you might find it anyway soon nest
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:45.560]   I don't know how to use google danny. So thank you for put put that market to this together. There we go
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.600]   The internet of things cartoon yeah, yeah tom fish burn
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:56.600]   I think my nest smoke alarm is going off google adwords. Just pitched me a fire extinguisher and an offer for temporary housing
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:02.200]   That's ultimately why we want to share this information with google right there. That's a convenience
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.320]   That's a convenience
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.320]   Uh
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.080]   Okay, okay
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:14.760]   Let's see one plus is slowly leaking out details of the next version of their phone the one plus
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:21.560]   Two they're they're really up to their same old marketing tricks. Aren't they Jason how the one plus two
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:25.800]   I think they believe that it works for them and it must it does
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.320]   I mean it it does when you take a look at kind of what a
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:34.360]   Unknown previously unknown hardware manufacturer was able to do with the one plus one
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.760]   They had their hiccups along the way
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:42.120]   But uh, they still generated a lot of excitement for the device even with all of those marketing blenders
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:46.760]   Not much of a surprise they're saying it'll run the newest qualcomm snap drag in the uh 810
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:51.640]   Although sam sung as chewed the 810 for the x and o saying it's too hot
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:56.040]   And by the way, I got to tell you as an owner of galaxy s6 as much as I love this phone
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.800]   It has two processors. It swaps back and forth
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.720]   It gets pretty dang hot
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:06.280]   Yeah, it does so much so that when I watch the gear v with the watch virtual reality in the gear vr
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:10.120]   After about 15 minutes the gear vr says we're stopping now because you're too hot
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.520]   So
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.160]   Wow
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.200]   Wow
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:18.200]   One plus plans to use both thermal gel and graphite to diffuse heat
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.640]   From the snap drag in 810. So it's like they kind of know
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:26.360]   It is uh is very hot the way uh htc solved that they
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:31.720]   They basically throttled the speed way down making a very slow sluggish phone
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:36.440]   Which really begs the question why put a super fast processor and if you can't use the speed, right
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:41.720]   Um, that's all we know though. That's all they're saying. There's no official release date
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:46.200]   And uh, what they're going to do is release specs a little bit at a time
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:50.280]   Just to guarantee that they'll stay in the news cycle and we'll talk about them each
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.040]   So I want to tell you right now. That's the last you're going to hear about that phone
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.560]   Until we know everything there is to know i'm not falling for it
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:03.960]   Jason will you make that pledge on all about and right to not to talk about one plus two until there's an actual device
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.000]   Yeah
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.600]   I'm not gonna fall. They want it's not a bad that's not a bad pledge. However, I reserve the right. Oh man
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:18.360]   Because sometime, you know, they might announce something revolutionary right, uh, in which case
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.400]   Yeah, but if it's just little bits of details here and there. I think that's not a bad pledge at all
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.880]   Well, I just don't want to fall for it. Yeah, that was true sucker totally
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.800]   Each week will release another part and you'll do another story
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:36.040]   Yeah, not that it matters because everybody else is nobody else's take it take that pledge
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:41.480]   Just so many companies doing that kind of thing these days just amazon is amazing. There's just always trickling out little
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.680]   It's not hard to game this crap system
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.880]   That we call the tech blogosphere. Yes
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.880]   Everybody's desperate to find clicks not that you're a part of that danny Sullivan
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.760]   Not that you would ever fall for that stuff
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.760]   now
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.520]   I'm not gonna fall for any of this. You're you know what?
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:58.840]   I
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.800]   There's one of the things I appreciate about you maybe because you've been doing this for so long
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.120]   But the search engine land does not do link bait really
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:09.560]   Uh, no, I don't think so. I mean, you don't fall for that. You know, we
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:15.400]   Well, there is the story of the Egyptian repairman who outranked google, but that wasn't us. Yeah
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.840]   a search engine watch. Oh, that's a different one. Yeah, that's the copycat
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:25.240]   And in fact, that's just a copy of the original article that was put up there
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.800]   It was an interesting see the guy he wrote it. He had nor
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:33.560]   We actually looked at the article when that first appeared where I think he put it out on his personal page or on link
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.360]   Yeah
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:37.400]   And then we actually we're trying to find out what happened
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.520]   Um, and we could never get a straight answer from google on it
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:45.400]   And then by the time they finally got back to us. It was kind of over and done with so it was weird
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.800]   A joke or it's serious
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:52.200]   No, I think there was some kind of a weird glitch that happened where he was number one for google on google
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:58.600]   But but no one knows why it happened and there was speculation. Well, maybe it's the google plus link and it wasn't the google plus link
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.920]   We don't know why it happened. He's an Egyptian, uh, hvac technician
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:08.040]   And in fact, uh, the guy wrote the blog post called him up
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:14.520]   Yeah, and uh said uh, hi, uh, this is I had nor we I work in the field of digital marketing. I noticed
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.800]   You're ranking number one on google. Did you know this?
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:22.920]   And uh, the fella said yeah, a lot of people called me and told me that google made a website about me
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:27.720]   No, no, no, I I mean, I mean google search when people search for the word google
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.520]   You come up first. Did you know that?
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:35.560]   No, no, I just find people calling me and telling me they saw my google
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:39.320]   So you never did anything to promote your page what page
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:48.040]   Your your your page on google plus no, I just published it using my email back in 2009
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:52.360]   That's why I get a lot of people visiting my profile because I have an old email there
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.400]   Actually, I think it takes more than that
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.720]   Uh
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.720]   apparently
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:06.440]   They so they never found out why or how this guy got to be number one on google search for the word google
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:14.440]   Only happened in egypt if yes, it was a you know incognito pages and everything it wasn't based on I mean what that tells you is that
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:19.960]   Google doesn't pay very close attention to some countries if they weren't paying attention with what's happening in
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:25.400]   In the egypt research results. Uh, no one on google is searching for google apparently, but you know
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:30.280]   That's what's going on there. Anyway, google fixed the issue
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:34.360]   And that mr. saber no longer ranks number one
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.360]   When you search for google in fact
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:42.360]   They took the website field out
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:48.600]   See, I think that might have had something to do with it his his website google plus thing. Yeah, was google.com.eg
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:56.760]   Yeah, and it shouldn't I mean it shouldn't have right should know better the the links well, but the links are no follow and so it shouldn't have had
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.800]   Uh
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.760]   An impact on that right it's not supposed to pass credit
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.920]   But there might have been just some bug where it did pick it up and because it's from a google domain
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:10.680]   Because otherwise anybody could just add google to their google plus profile and we'd all be ranking for google and that clearly doesn't happen
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:17.480]   Right. Um, so you know, it's it maybe that fed into some other bug that that made it happen
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.760]   but
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.720]   That that person has nothing to teach you in terms of ranking well
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:28.600]   I managed to get the same kind of bug to happen but saber noticed that his search results were going down
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.520]   So he put google.com.eg back on his profile
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:35.480]   And he was back number one
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.800]   Wow, so
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.400]   Happening again. Yeah, well apparently this is a follow up over the weekend
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:45.400]   I noticed mr. Sabers back at the top when such searching for google's brand name keywords
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:49.800]   I checked his google plus profile found that a google.com.eg URL is back
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:56.520]   In the website field. I called him he confirmed he noticed that google changed his website URL so he put it back
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.680]   And
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:08.120]   He is the king of seo ladies and gentlemen if you've got any seo questions call the hvac technician and kiro
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:11.160]   Just search for google and you'll find him
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:15.720]   That's pretty funny
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.880]   But a bug right
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:21.960]   Believe me. I know about website bugs. I know all about website bugs
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.560]   Chrome bookmark manager. What happened there? That didn't work out so well for
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:32.920]   For google we actually talked about it. I think when they released the new bookmark manager. They've gone back
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:36.680]   to the previous version
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.680]   Um apparently
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:44.760]   Not not as responsive or maybe people just said we don't like this
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:49.160]   Is that what I have now if I said it was confusing. Yeah
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:52.360]   Showing thumbnails and so forth. Yeah
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:57.960]   So another another one of those things that google would do that apple would never do well may try stuff
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.080]   Yeah, try stuff. It's a be uh tests
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.360]   See if I do this if I go to my bookmark manager
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.240]   Do I get the no, isn't that the new one?
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:10.440]   You can also uh
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.440]   Keep the new one
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.240]   By installing a specific bookmark manager extension
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:20.920]   Okay, that's probably the right way to do it. Maybe I did that. I don't know. I'm I think I'm getting the new one. Isn't that it?
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.800]   I think so. Yeah, yeah
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:30.040]   Uh who knows what extensions you might have who knows what's going on possible to predict certainly I don't
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:33.160]   All right, we're gonna move along here
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:37.960]   And talk a little bit about google's new site to help you choose your phone
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:42.120]   Surprise surprise they choose all the most expensive. That's right
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.640]   Their best partner
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:49.000]   I got my 511 update on my s6 by the way
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:53.000]   I have a T-Mobile like Alex s6 and it does seem to have
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.200]   Fixed a few things
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.640]   Um
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:59.480]   Maybe that memory leak that was the question
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.240]   We'll talk about the new twitch killer from google
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:08.200]   And a lot more oh and that change at the top and uh twitter
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:12.760]   But our show first before we do that is brought to you by our friends at squarespace

[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:51.160]   Blackberry might put android and it's a new device. Yeah weird
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:55.880]   I don't know if that's the way to win. I don't know what you do if you're blackberry at this point
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:53:03.720]   How about sidewalk labs google made a big deal announcing this this is uh, it's kind of like a pro bono thing. Have you yeah?
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:11.400]   It's they're investing in it and basically they they want to fix cities using the miracle miracle of technology one of the things that they want to do
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:20.440]   Uh, which really jumped out at me was that they want to make cities more affordable. Uh, and of course they're just as they've done in san francisco
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:25.880]   But I think that's clearly this seems to me to be a way to
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.560]   sort of
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:29.080]   dissipate the
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:34.280]   The focus on google as a cause for rising prices and make cities like new york and san francisco
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:37.400]   Not our fault. We've got a we've got a site devoted to it exactly
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:45.320]   Um, so this is a really interesting initiative. They're basically just investing a lot and this is uh sidewalk labs is a new york based venture
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:50.840]   Uh, and it's headed by dr. Dr. off who is the former deputy mayor of economic development
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:54.040]   for city of new york
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:54:01.240]   And this is the technology is going to fall they've already decided what the categories are and the categories are really really interesting one is
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:06.520]   Insulation they're going to figure out how to insulate buildings better to save a ton of energy
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:10.520]   They want to make cities have lots of electric car charging
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:15.880]   Opportunities they want green roofs like facebook, you know with a park on the top with that's a good idea
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.560]   they want to
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.560]   Have better use of data for
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:24.040]   Dealing with traffic and how people are moving around the city they want incentive sustainability
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:29.800]   Uh, they want to have lots of services city services in the cloud, but here's the one that really blew my mind
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:38.360]   They want to focus on the the mic the gut microbes in people who live in cities and figure how cities can be teaming with bacteria and microbes
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:40.920]   So that people have healthy guts
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.320]   How amazing is that?
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.000]   Really cool
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.840]   If you like bacteria this website is about the scantest thing i've ever seen
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:54.360]   There's basically a picture. I just keeps reading it as sidewalk abs
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:55:03.560]   Can't see the l i would like sidewalk abs i could use some sidewalk abs basically. There's a press release
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:07.320]   A couple of email addresses that's it. It's a one pager
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.480]   Or is it a larry pager i feel like i could do this
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:19.480]   I could announce uh podcast labs yes, yes an attempt to create eco safe podcasts
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.360]   And i could put a side up and
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:29.320]   It doesn't okay. Well this then you know 10 or 20 or a hundred million dollars of your money and oh
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.960]   Well, that's what larry said it wasn't that expensive
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.760]   For him that's 10 or 20
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.320]   That's cigarette money for larry
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:43.320]   Uh, this is the google equivalent of a politician saying well we need a committee to look at that. It's a committee
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:46.360]   You know i'm all for it i'm all for it
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.520]   Improve city life just give everybody a segue
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:55.880]   That's what i say, you know what remember when the segue came out bill gates and others said i think steve jobs
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.160]   So this is going to
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:03.960]   Redefine how cities are built they will redesign cities just for the segue i wish they would yeah, can they get on that?
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.920]   Now that i have a segue
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:08.680]   Well, i mean, you know
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:16.200]   Be realistic they're struggling enough redesigning cities for bicycles which are right hundred years old right took a little while
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:20.840]   But but i mean it's it's happening and people are starting to make some of those changes
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:26.920]   So, you know it really is dramatic how cities did get redesigned for for automobiles and cars
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:30.840]   So but but maybe some of these things will speed some of this stuff along
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:36.120]   Or we got that hyperloop test track that's being built. So that'll be fine. It's not just one. There's several
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:39.000]   calicanis has one he's doing
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.880]   There's one in the desert somewhere
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.240]   calicanis wants to focus on using the hyperloop to deliver
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:52.360]   Cargo under the sea to replace mmm super those big super car
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:57.720]   Containerships yeah, and just kind of pneumatically thrusts products under the sea
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:05.240]   Yes, it's so cheap. They're cheap, but they use a huge amount of oil a lot of the oil being used
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:09.480]   Right now is car is container ships go back to sale
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:14.360]   The problem of the hyperloop is that and especially the problem with the hyperloop in california
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:19.800]   Is that i'm sure you can solve all of the technical problems you what you can't do is get the land use
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:26.200]   That you can't have any turns or corners. So they that's why they do it on the ocean. Well, you know it's like who owns that
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:33.160]   All that plastic it's all straight. Yeah, but just aim straight for japan, but that's not the plan
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:35.800]   That's not that's calicanis. That's calicanis
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:39.800]   But but the but the one that's actually underway the the the elan musk version
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:43.560]   Well, he said he wants to do it elated. Oh, there's no way it's gonna happen
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.160]   There's no way you can get the right to do it
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:49.640]   They'll get it all except for like one tracked right now i have to launch this thing through the air to land and
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.280]   Hole on the other side. I don't know how they're gonna do it
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:55.960]   Is this
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:00.840]   Is this kade metz article in wired in april fools joke a little late
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:05.400]   Revealed the secret gear connecting goongles online empire
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:11.400]   Did you read this danny? No, I didn't the pluto switch. Yeah the pluto good old pluto switch
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:20.920]   What what they're saying is that google makes its own networking switches? Yeah, and the one was accidentally shipped to the wrong place
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:26.120]   And that's how they just send they posted pictures and stuff and then people have been analyzing. What is this?
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:30.920]   What does it work? What does make sense that google would make its own? Yeah switch. I mean, that's a sorry google
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:34.840]   I mean, sorry that google woke up when I said so did mine. So my
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.840]   Yeah, it's little these guys are touchy. We're gonna have to do something about this
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:42.440]   We couldn't buy the hardware
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:47.480]   We needed to build a network of the size and speed we needed to build said a google spokesmen
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:51.320]   It didn't exist so we built our own the pluto switch
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:56.200]   I guess it's not really a switch a good story. I like it
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:04.520]   It's yeah, it's good does google open source like faces facebook open source facebook
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:06.760]   It's hardware. Yeah, here's how we do it facebook hard
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.200]   Open source. It's entire thing that it's going on for four years
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:14.120]   And they got intel bought into it. They've got all kinds of industry buy-in
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:22.200]   They're really changing how data centers operate because of course facebook doesn't that's not really their business their businesses taking your personal information and selling ads
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.600]   Well
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:28.520]   Here is a goople google goople here's a google jupiter superblock
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:35.720]   Google is revealing a little bit more about how its servers talk to each other
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:40.120]   It's the Jupiter networking set up the fifth generation of the company's efforts
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:46.280]   It offers 100 times the capacity of its first in-house data center network one petabyte
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:49.400]   per second
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:56.360]   Of something called bisection bandwidth. That's the bandwidth between two different parts of the network a petabyte per second
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.320]   That's enough for a hundred thousand servers
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:05.400]   To talk at 10 gigabytes per second each. Wow. That's like unbelievable. Yeah
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:11.080]   So this is apparently part of uh, this is another this is part of the pluto switch
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:18.200]   Apparently this initiative began 11 years ago. Uh, google engineers started building their own gear. I like it
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.000]   using a close
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.600]   network a multi stage circuit switching network
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.800]   not sure if you remember leo i
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:32.200]   A guest he's been here a couple of times richard hay from from google
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.400]   Uh, he's visited actually pretty recently. He was here
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:40.520]   He actually worked on this project for the last no kidding. Yeah, this that's how I saw the article initially on google plus
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:44.360]   He's like final real you finally no no that's somebody else. Yeah. No, he was here
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:50.360]   I don't know a couple of months ago. He's always wearing people coming in and they they're like big shots and they don't even announce themselves
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.640]   He's been working on this for years and he's like finally I could show off what i've been talking about Jupiter
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.280]   That's kind of neat. Yeah all this stuff. I want a home pluto switch
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.520]   Just a petabyte per second. We need a petabyte here
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:11.640]   What did you now I kind of skimmed over that but I should probably reiterate that that according to google
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:16.200]   They're gonna put google fiber in what do they say a hundred more cities? Yeah
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.160]   I think that's right
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.160]   A petaloma should be in there, right?
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.360]   And I'd love some google get give me some google fiber
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:31.160]   And a petabyte and a petabyte of or pet a bit or whatever it is
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.520]   What's the difference when it gets to peta doesn't matter if it's a bit or a bite
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:37.400]   It's peta. That's what matters
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.480]   So google says we're gonna build a twitch
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:48.280]   Remember the twitch the gaming service twitch.tv that was created by justin.tv and was wildly successful
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:55.080]   Was purchased by amazon apparently a bit of a bidding war between google and amazon and others. I imagine
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:00.040]   google lost but no problem they're gonna build their own and friday youtube
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:08.600]   Demonstrated at the youtube space in manhattan their youtube gaming service which will launch this summer
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.640]   And these are pictures
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:15.960]   From arse technica ronam audio went to take a look
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:19.800]   At the service this is i want to do this
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:24.760]   You know, this is pretty awesome and jason. I don't know i'm way to tell you take a drink before I
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:31.320]   Throw to you, but like do you know if if this is something if you can stream from mobile from the mobile device?
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.200]   It's a really good question. I actually don't know that for sure
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:39.800]   Um because if you can there will be an app obviously, but I don't know if there's direct streaming nobody's doing it
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:43.480]   Let's play videos with mobile devices. I mean, that would be cool. No, nobody's doing that
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:49.640]   Yeah, nice my son wanted one of you. I mean you want a real challenge you
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:55.400]   He wanted this expensive thing for his nintendo ds to stream off of that and I was like
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:59.800]   Is he 12 on that is he 12 14 close enough?
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.560]   That's the thing everybody I talked to 12 year olds all the time the one
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:07.320]   Used to be when I was a kid they all wanted to be you know, michael jordan
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.160]   They all wanted to be you know
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:15.720]   The quarterback the sports star now they all want to do let's play videos with minecraft like every 12 year old you meet
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:19.720]   Yeah, I've got my youtube channel i'm putting minecraft videos up there
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:25.320]   Well, it makes sense. I think he's in the other room on twitch right now. Yeah, of course he is
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.960]   It used to be I'd be like you guys have to be quiet
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:32.040]   I'm gonna be doing a podcast and now it's like you gotta be quiet. I'm live streaming the game
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:37.800]   I'm broadcasting that retirement age approaches so
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:45.160]   You know chad johnson who does our who did used to do our own gcraft show used to produce this show good friend
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.560]   Move to l.a. To pursue stardom and he has been doing a lot of let's play
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:54.440]   On youtube he makes good money. He says the most lucrative thing he does
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.440]   He's doing well on patreon in places
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:01.160]   But he said what you do the trick unless play videos on twitch is to interact with the chatroom
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:05.960]   Which is very much the trick with periscope and miercat right? It's all about talking to the fans
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:11.640]   Yep, and he has some deep pocketed fans who just laid all money into his pockets. Yeah
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:17.720]   You know that missed the boat here somehow. I used to publish a newsletter and I it was a it was
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.720]   casually
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:25.240]   Uh, you know voluntarily tip jar type of yeah, and there was one guy who would send me like a hundred bucks
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:28.440]   A month or something. I really liked it. Yeah
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:34.920]   And and I think if you have enough fans you can always find somebody with more money than sense. I need a sugar mama
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:38.600]   Any volunteers?
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:44.440]   I was thinking I think I want to I want to try this like at home. I get home
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.560]   Instead of ham radio
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.520]   knitting
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.440]   I want a hobby. I'll just sit down in front of the xbox and I'll play fallout four
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:57.400]   And stream it and stream it because you're not streaming
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:04.280]   Enough I want to go home and stream it. I see youtube certainly has the back end. They have the record for the most
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:10.600]   Stream views at a single time eight million people watched Felix bomb gartner jump out of a
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:16.600]   Now I I believe that couldn't be possible because you know watching silicon valleys finale this week
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:22.360]   Even the best best technology you have out there catches
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.920]   Middle out even if you have seen
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:29.720]   Even if you have middle out and the middle out is working in a way that people can't even anticipate
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:37.000]   You're gonna like set something on fire if you get to around 400,000 people unless people instantly pull on special gloves and code
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.200]   I love it. It was good. She was good though. I always wanted to write a thing like
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:46.040]   Why nothing on silicon valley makes no sense, but it doesn't matter anyway. Yeah
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:53.000]   It's close. It's kind of that weird thing and this is television. This is television a nutshell. It feels real
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.400]   But it's not yeah
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:01.640]   What I loved about that episode is this guy was dying. That was the content right and they said yeah, that was great luck. Yeah
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:08.840]   Nobody cared at all not his life. That was all like wow. That's really good latency. It's so it's like amazing speaking of
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:14.040]   Casualties dick costalow is stepping down as CEO of twitter end of the month
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.840]   Wall Street had been slowly chopping off limbs at twitter killing people
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:25.160]   Working their way up to the ceo. They finally got to a dick and they're cutting off dick. Well, I mean they're you know, he's over
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:28.600]   I actually his first name is embattled. I think you're
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:34.360]   Embattled the embattled dick. You know what everybody that I talked to twitter loves him
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:38.680]   Yeah, he's very popular within the company, but he's offered his resignation several times
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:42.680]   So he said, you know, I think I should step down they said no and then he said I think I should step down
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:46.760]   They said no and this time they said okay. Yep. Try that. We've tried everything else
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:52.360]   Stock market soared on the news and then plummeted the next day. Yeah, right back to where they were
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:57.720]   They are so fickle on Wall Street. I feel kind of bad for dick, but on the other hand
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:02.280]   I don't really feel that bad
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:05.080]   Jack Dorsey is current interim CEO. He's back
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.720]   He probably will end up being the ceo
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.240]   This is twitter has been such a soap opera if you ever read nik builten's book
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:17.480]   Yeah, uh on twitter read that and this is just the obvious continuation of just the company that
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:23.880]   That one everything but couldn't manage to make it their fatal flaw
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:27.480]   Is that they aren't facebook or something?
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:31.240]   You know because it's like they and what do you do if you become more like facebook
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:37.320]   As they have tried to do you alienate the people who love the old twitter and if you remain the old twitter
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:42.360]   Then you don't get new users and so they can't win because they're not facebook facebook is just
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.600]   Killing everybody
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:49.000]   They have 1.4 billion users for facebook they have now 800 million
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.320]   I think is the latest number for facebook messenger 700 800. I think it's 700 300 million for instagram 300 million for instagram
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:08:02.360]   twitter 800 million for what's app what's app? I mean, it's just ridiculous how many users they have and so
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:06.600]   twitter comes along with it's 300 million or whatever it is active users and it's just
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:11.080]   How do you compete with a monopoly on everybody, you know
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:14.200]   What would you do to turn around twitter danny?
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:18.600]   Ah, I don't know. I wish I knew
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.880]   um
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:28.360]   I feel at times they could use a better product vision. I mean one of the things
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:34.440]   You know they talk about where the future communication platforms and communications are thinking or whatever but by and large
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.120]   It's just still looks like, you know, you you get your tweets
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:42.120]   And I think there's a great business there and I think that that twitter has
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:48.600]   Established such a stronghold in a lot of people's lives and a lot of media companies that you watch where you know
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.720]   You kind of wonder how you could have a tv show these days without having twitter being alongside of it
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:58.280]   So the ideas I think some people sparked that they could do more around live events and so on
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.440]   You know potentially and potentially there's a lot more monetization that you can do with it from there
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:09.880]   Um, maybe reopening some things up with their apis where people could tap into it in the way that people got burned on it before
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:13.960]   Where they said basically, you know, we're we're not going to let everybody do everything but um
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:20.600]   You know, that's a tough one. I honestly I would try to sell the company to google
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:25.880]   If it were me, I think that google's google's future is part of something bigger
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:30.520]   Um, I think that on their own they're kind of squeezed in among different things
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.240]   But I think as part of you know potentially an apple, but really more like a google
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.240]   um
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:43.240]   They might have a better a better home a better fit with other kinds of products or or just where maybe the pressure of them
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:48.760]   Having to try to be more than what they're good at doing. It's kind of like saying well, what would you do? It's youtube, right? I mean
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:56.760]   You know youtube is profitable, right or yeah, but it took a really long time and they still come under pressure
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:01.720]   If you're not making as much money or you could be doing more now you got facebook coming at them and you know
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:09.080]   Well, how come facebook's you know stuff isn't doing as well with it? But as a as as I as something that's within google
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:13.160]   You know, it has less pressure than maybe if it was sitting out there on its own
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.880]   So I I think there's a lot of good stuff with twitter
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:21.560]   I I just suspect it's just maybe too hard for it to be successful on its own as a public company
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:28.200]   You know, that's the thing who were a private company and it was making money and you know, the investors were happy with it
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:31.480]   But now you go public and then everybody wants the bigger returns
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:34.280]   Right and I and I think mike said it well that you know
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:39.720]   They're going to get compared to facebook regardless of whether or not. That's the right thing to compare them to
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:47.400]   I think they made one smart recent move which is that they released the 140 character limitation on direct messages
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.400]   So if you send a DM to somebody you it can be a you know, it can be up. Why is that smart?
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.360]   It just feels like email because well because simply because there's no reason to limit
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.000]   That 240 characters the reason
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.360]   Their secret sauce is the limit for public messages
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.320]   So you can have a stream as we both have sitting here going
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:10.200]   And it's not going to be like google plus where you get these massive messages that you have to slog through
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:16.120]   They're nice light little things that you get breezed by and they're easy to take whereas with direct messages that's
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.320]   You know that you can actually communicate significantly
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:25.480]   And it's not going to invade anybody's mental space in a an obnoxious and unwanted way you can control it
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:28.040]   It's from people you know and I think really that's a secret
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.680]   The bottom line is that strangers don't scale
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:35.080]   The only thing that is going to get you those big face and book numbers is
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.040]   When everybody's interacting with people they already know
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:45.320]   So twitter is mostly a play to get content from people you don't know google plus is almost entirely a place to get
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:50.120]   content from strangers facebook wins and whatsapp wins and
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.000]   friends because it's people you know
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.800]   And that's what scales for some reason so they need to make twitter something that's great
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:03.240]   For communicating with people you already know and not just a place to follow danny selvin and you know
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.200]   The the jeff javises of the world
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:10.520]   You know who benefits quite a bit from twitter are the live tv shows like
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:15.480]   american idol and they really use it as you said every tv show has a twitter
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.480]   hashtag and yeah
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:21.400]   And they really use it. I wonder there it's in there interest to keep twitter alive
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:25.880]   Well, you you think so right and and that's part of what I look at it and I think well
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:29.160]   There's you know, there's no way you can lose twitter because they're just so um
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:35.000]   They're just so they're so tied into this stuff and you can't imagine it and then you can go back to think
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.160]   Uh, but remember when all the tv shows had a llq words, right? I mean, it's not the same thing but
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:47.160]   On the one hand it is a strength that is so used and you can look at some of these shows where when they're
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:53.880]   Broadcasting the cast members are on there and in fact you there's been a number of articles where that's just kind of required of what you need to do
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:59.400]   Especially when you've got a generation of millennials and sub millennials and whatever that you know
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:05.320]   Expect to be doing two screen side by side. Um, you know, and maybe there's better things they can do
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:11.080]   I mean, I still haven't seen a good application where I can watch a tv show and I can have the tweets alongside
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:18.360]   Right, you know, maybe I need a twitter tv. I don't know. Maybe that's my computer. Right? Anyway, you know, what's a tv? What's the apple tv? It's my computer. Anyway
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.280]   Um
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:26.040]   But yeah, you would think that they'd have a big stake in it and potentially you would think that maybe that's somebody who should buy it as well
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:29.320]   It's like a media company, but then it suddenly becomes very niche, right?
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:32.920]   Because what do you do if a a big uh, television network buys it?
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.600]   Does all the all the other networks don't want to use it or come up with their own and
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:39.800]   Uh, but yeah, I think that there's there's stuff that can be done
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.200]   That'd be one of the things that google could do if they acquired it they could build it into chrome
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.200]   They could build it into android tv
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:51.240]   You know, they could you know, not that everybody has those products, but they could do that and that would be really compelling
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:58.760]   I agree with you. I think that uh tweeting while watching uh event television is one of the greatest things that twitter can offer to the world
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:02.200]   Google should buy them they should absolutely should
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:05.080]   Yeah, maybe they will now though, you know, I
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.840]   They you know put in the offer whatever feels like google would buy them then they would slowly disappear
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:13.640]   As google has done with so many
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:15.160]   Other
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:20.520]   Potentially or potentially to survive like youtube. I mean youtube is a great example of something that's kind of stood out there and and google
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:26.680]   Could try to pull the same kind of nest type of thing they've done before said we're acquiring twitter and we're not going to
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:31.720]   You know mess with what they're gonna do but we are gonna have some synergies between them and the
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:39.640]   That you know the google twitter deal was sort of a i don't know i can pronounce it right, but they were approach monde or whatever where you know
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:48.600]   Google was really burned in their view by twitter and it's not clear who burnt who or whatever happened in the end of it but
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:55.160]   google wired the entire real-time search service to twitter's data in an
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:58.360]   Imprecedented way to rely on a third party and
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:05.000]   I can't remember going and I still have a t-shirt from it or whatever going out to the event that they did where they launched google real-time search
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.880]   And it was at the san josea computer museum and you know
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:14.120]   They it's like a big huge thing and then to literally have that fire hose pole plug pulled
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:20.680]   It they had to you know, they had to close a product google had to shut down an entire product that they had built
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:24.840]   Around twitter's information and you know there's a lot of bad blood with that
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:29.640]   There's a lot of we're never going to do it again. So the fact that they actually decided to partner again with twitter
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:35.640]   Like wow, okay, you know, so maybe maybe that'll be the start of something bigger
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:41.320]   Maybe the whole ceo stuff will you know change it around and make it something more receptive to it
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.720]   Um, I don't know
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:47.960]   I wonder if this redesign of google trends ties in because this is all about real-time
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:54.040]   Trends, which is of course in a way what twitter is all about isn't it? Yeah, it certainly can be mined for that
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:59.320]   Yeah, in fact, they're putting data sets on github, which I think is very geeky and very cool if you're a data scientist
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:01.000]   um
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:07.480]   The difficulty with trends is like who goes there like if you're a journalist you go there because you want to think okay
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.840]   This is what's hot and going with it
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:16.440]   But I don't think typical people go to google trends to see what's hot and happening in the way that they might hit the the twitter discover tag
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:20.520]   Tab or the way that it's integrated with facebook, right?
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:27.560]   And and when you search on google, it's not like they say here's the trendy stuff that happens in the way that say yahoo and sometimes
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.560]   um
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:36.120]   Bingda, so I think google is looking at wow, there's great interest in trends people are wanting to see what's happening
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:39.000]   They they you know potentially this is a
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.040]   We've got rich data around it
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.240]   um
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.240]   But no one knows
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:48.680]   Right and no one nobody sort of seeks it out. So you know
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:53.000]   And they can tweet it or whatever and you know they could share it I guess on google plus
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:58.920]   But maybe it was um, you know something else that they could do this is something because google's full of data scientists
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:04.360]   This is something that they like but do it do a search like go on topics and search for nest
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:10.920]   Right, okay, and then hit search and then now you can go over after searches
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:17.400]   Hit the dropdown from 2004 to present your second dropdown switch it over to past four hours
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:21.560]   This is the new part, right? You could never do this before looking at an hourly base. Sorry
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.880]   My hands in there
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.720]   Sorry
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.600]   So badly they touch it now go back a bit more go back
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:34.760]   Go back up and switch it back to the past day. All right, okay, so now you'll see
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:39.400]   This spike the spike in interest starting around
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:44.280]   Trump you can see sort of the same sort of thing you see this big huge spike that comes up with it there and then it
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.440]   It drops down. I like that don't
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:52.040]   So this is the thing in some ways people really value about twitter, right is but to do this
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:53.560]   And don't touch here
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:55.720]   You see to find this you're having to go do that, right?
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.120]   And yes, you could go search for or
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:04.200]   Trans will surface of stuff up there if you remember that you should go to google trends as part of your daily cruise or whatever
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:12.440]   But what people do the most at google every day is use google boy look april 2011 something happened with Donald tranks here
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.480]   And then december 2011 November 2012
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.200]   January 2015 and of course
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:21.480]   May 2015 you had a good run there for a while. Yeah, and then nothing
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:23.800]   Nothing in june
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.600]   And then of course regional interest is mostly us in alaska
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:34.840]   For that's donald trumps hair you see the 2011 now we know donald trumps hair hair secrets. Yes, that's what it was all about
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:39.560]   Yes in time magazine the secret to donald trumps. Is that oh you found it the story
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:42.280]   Yeah, there's a bunch of them all about it
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:44.280]   cheese louise
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.440]   Amazing, isn't it?
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.920]   I love it that google shares this kind of stuff, but you're right
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:51.480]   I know what do you do this is a classic google thing though?
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:56.280]   They build these awesome things and then they just fail to communicate nobody knows it exists
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:59.160]   And they just watch it show you do
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.480]   Yeah, but it's like you know for the general public
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:08.680]   I mean this is again, you know to contrast them with apple apple will hold the world's attention and take them through things like this apple
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:12.200]   Own this the apple fanboys would be using it 10 times a day
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:18.600]   And it's like they just they have to figure out they have all these great data scientists, but what they really need is
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:24.600]   More marketing people are something. I don't know what the there's interest in the swift programming language
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:27.400]   Let me give you an example of this sir go to um
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:33.000]   Go to the google home page. Okay. All right, and what do you see on the google home page?
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.360]   And i'm not already going to the google home page, but it's a good point of the attitudes that they have they don't show that at all
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:44.200]   Right. Well, you can have a thing that says trending, you know now go to yahoo's home page. Oh god
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:48.440]   I know but go to yahoo's home page. All right, look in the right corner. Yeah
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:52.760]   Trending now trending now now go to bings home page. Yeah
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:56.840]   And at bings home page you see what google potentially could do and they don't do
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:03.240]   Right. These are the trends down here. They've got different trending things which would be awesome and they're putting it there with it from that
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.000]   um, and so
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.240]   You know if why doesn't google do that because no one's thinking about it's different teams
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:15.960]   You've got a team that's doing trends you've got a team that's doing search and no one's thought that we should put the trending stuff into search and also
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:20.280]   You know to some degree that the team that does search is going to be very protective
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:25.000]   It's like we don't want things on the search page unless you know they make a lot of sense to be there
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.720]   Right, so just putting trending stuff up there on the search page
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:30.440]   They might not think that they need to do it, but potentially you could
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:35.160]   You know why not if you're searching not have a little thing saying other things that are trending or
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:41.240]   Ideally if you've done a search for one thing you might suggest related trending topics that are going on there as well
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:46.120]   You could do that sort of thing was this gonna be the place that they would put that google plus
[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:49.320]   Because they do have a trending thing here
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:55.400]   Yeah, but that's not this trending on google plus right but yes, you could put it into google plus as well, but I
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.720]   I
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.720]   You know it's it's tough
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:04.200]   It goes back to I think one of google's challenges. It's just not
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:10.360]   Having a strong sense of what goes on in terms of social they don't have a strong social product
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:13.880]   You know, I think they've got google plus and everything and I know but
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:22.520]   It's not the volume and it's not to the degree that people would say turn to facebook or twitter and you know for whatever reason
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:31.080]   If something trends on twitter people talk about it. It's not uncommon for me to see tweets from even just you know ordinary users
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:36.840]   Whatever it was like wow, this is trending right so so people are finding that the trending stuff is happening on twitter
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:40.200]   People are finding that trending stuff seems to happen on facebook
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:46.360]   Although I don't tear people remark about it so much and I think facebook has been kind of belatedly trying to to do that
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.440]   so I I get a sense that
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:54.360]   People have gotten used to kind of turning to facebook to twitter to understand. Oh wow. What's a hot topic?
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:57.560]   What are people talking about because it's a conversational place
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:02.280]   What are people talking about on twitter? I'll hit trends. I'll see like wow. This is really going on
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:07.160]   Facebook has tried to catch into bat by having their own little trending box even though
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:12.440]   I find facebook to be less conversational. There's more sharing. It's going on there and then google plus
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:15.160]   you know, it's more
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:19.640]   Seems group oriented sometime and it's not you know, just maybe it's just not a fit there for this
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:25.320]   What are people talking about it? Whatever twitter and then yeah, and then but then if you go to google search
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:29.400]   It's not what people are talking about but what people are interested in
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:33.160]   That's a very powerful thing. That's the whole point of why people are searching
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:37.720]   But they just you know the best home for probably is in google in google search
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:41.880]   They just don't they just for whatever reason i've not thought about implementing it there
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:47.240]   Yeah, I mean the thing is that uh, you know completely agree with you. I mean twitter feels like
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:54.120]   Uh, it's it's a great finger on the pulse kind of a sight. It feels like it's the global conversation happening that you're witnessing
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:58.840]   It's not really the case because it's dependent entirely upon who you follow and so on
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:04.360]   But it feels like like this is what everybody's talking about and the psychology of it is very different if you go to
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:10.440]   Facebook, I don't know if you feel this way if you go to facebook you feel like you want to go back and see what you missed even though you missed
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:14.360]   You know 88 of it or whatever that they filtered out of your newsfeed
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:19.240]   But on twitter like you know you go there and you just tune into what's going on right now
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:23.000]   You don't feel any pressure to go back and see what you missed four hours ago or whatever
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:27.480]   And and so that you know and I think that's entirely the result of two factors
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:30.520]   One is that it's got a 140 character limitation
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:36.360]   So you people are forced to be concise and then you have all these short things going by and that's something that people can handle
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.840]   And the second thing is third party
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:42.760]   Integration so you know for example, you know a lot of people are using these things
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:48.360]   I'm using tweet bot for example, which is a stream that I don't have to touch for it to move it streams by
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:52.600]   And that's really important I think and that's something that google plus used to have
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:54.680]   That's something that facebook sorta kind of has
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:57.480]   but for twitter and
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.560]   in an apps like tweet bot
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:04.440]   It can just sit there and you can watch the stream go by and that is a powerful
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:09.320]   zeitgeist kind of trend watching kind of a feel
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:12.760]   Uh that I think google needs to figure out how to implement somewhere
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:17.000]   Well and one thing that you need to be fascinating that that google did and
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:22.840]   Like it's old now. I can't remember if they ever put it out on other people who used to do this
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:30.120]   You'll remember you used to go to things like the web crawler or spy or whatever and you could watch what people were searching for
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:35.320]   I remember that that was right. Yeah, and it was fascinating and people used to do it and look at it all the time
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:39.080]   twitter google used to do that within their offices
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:44.600]   And then they kind of got rid of that later on the difficulty with something like that is
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:48.280]   You know, there's a lot of filtering you got to do because you can reveal sensitive stuff
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:52.840]   And the number one search when I saw it last at google's offices was yahoo
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:59.480]   Yeah, because people instead of going to yahoo.com which is type yahoo and it's always like and they don't and they like to filter that stuff up
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:01.480]   but can you imagine like
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.520]   Can you imagine that buzzfeed ran?
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:09.720]   Google and you'd have like an app that would be showing you like in real time what the top
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:16.120]   searches were happening and you could just go there and you'd be like, oh, this is picking up here at this topic and you know, google trends
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:20.920]   Almost as an app and and possibly you'd have the ability to share or comment or talk about it
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.920]   I mean there's fun stuff you could do with it
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:27.720]   Which in turn would generate searches which in turn, you know is what pays for all the auto driving cars?
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:28.600]   so
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:34.760]   um, you know, I think there's stuff that they could do they're just and and you know, to be fair, I think what they're trying to do with today's
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:39.640]   Announcement is part of that and trying to better realize we've got this great data
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:44.760]   um, you know, and we know people are interested in it so we're trying to defend a better way to present it out there
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:52.440]   shocking result in the european court of human rights the case of delphi versus
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:58.440]   estonia delphi was a or I guess it is but maybe soon will be was a
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.920]   website that aggregates
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.720]   news in both estonian and
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.120]   Russian
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.120]   Also operates in latvia and lithuania
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:12.840]   At the end of the news our articles as on many sites. There was a comment section
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:15.320]   the comment section
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:23.000]   Was automatic and they weren't edited or moderated there was a notice of takedown such a system in place so
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:30.600]   A reader could mark a comment as insulting and it would be taken down and apparently fairly expeditiously according to court documents
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.720]   There was a system of automatic deletion of comments that included
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.680]   obscene words
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:42.440]   A victim of defamatory comment could notify an applicant company in which case the comment was removed immediately
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:45.960]   There was a terms of service or are they called it a rules of comment?
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:49.560]   Which said there should not be threats, uh, insults, hostility, violence
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.800]   nevertheless
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:54.280]   the government of estonia sued delphi
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:59.000]   Saying the site had a notorious history of publishing defamatory and degrading
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.840]   comments
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:04.440]   The european court had ruled that delphi was indeed
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:07.320]   responsible
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:08.200]   for
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:10.440]   libel posted in comments
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:12.680]   on their
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:16.360]   Site even if the website took down the comments after complaints it was held liable
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:19.800]   Because it should have anticipated bad comments in the first place
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:26.920]   This is uh, the human rights court in europe saying websites are liable for human for user comments
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:33.400]   Um, they've agreed to actually the case was ruled on once they re-heard it and the same thing
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:38.520]   Uh happened mike masonic writing in the tech dirt says the ruling is horrific
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:41.640]   uh, the right of uh
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:47.160]   uh protection of reputation versus the right of freedom of expression and the protection of reputation wins
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:50.520]   According to the european court freedom of speech
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:55.240]   Another great challenge coming out of europe. I wish jeff javis were here to
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.440]   Turn beat red and yeah
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.360]   Have steam coming as that of his ears. This is
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:03.960]   Just another terrible decision by a european court
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.520]   Yep, and I hope this doesn't extend
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:12.600]   Into the united states because it's very difficult. Uh, I mean we don't we don't allow comments for that reason
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:20.280]   But I think we could be sued for a chat room for that for that reason. Yeah, I think that this is unlikely to become a big issue because
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:22.760]   even though this is potentially
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:25.160]   um
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.160]   A precedent being set here
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:38.040]   In fact, it it contradicts other european union directives, right including their e-commerce directive, which which quote guarantees liability protection for intermediaries that implement notice and take down mechanisms
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:44.520]   on third party comments and quote and part of the problem that's happening with this estonia side is that there is uh,
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.680]   speech on that site that
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:51.240]   qualifies as hate speech and there are problems with the way delphi is
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:59.160]   Dealing with it and so in that case they're trying to turn the screws on delphi to get rid of this hate speech exactly
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:04.280]   But as a as a policy as a precedent as a thing that's going to happen europe wide
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:08.440]   This is not good. I don't see a world which facebook is going to be required
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.280]   Didn't be responsible for everything everybody says on facebook. Well, it'd be the end of the world. I mean it
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:15.880]   It'd just be terrible. Well, the end of the world is nigh though because of another european
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:22.280]   Directive which is the frant the french uh privacy commission, which is telling google they have
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:26.120]   Actually a few days ago now they have 13 days or something like that to
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:32.520]   censor the global internet according to the right to be forgotten rules within europe and that is the end of the world
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:37.240]   Well, it's an end of the world depending on how they implement it
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:39.880]   So and and that's part of what I wrote up on marketing land
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:46.680]   Last week and we we have a similar thing where we had a canadian court in the same same week say the same thing that you have to do
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:52.040]   This global censorship and what what is unclear is whether or not they want to have
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:56.760]   Censorship applied to people
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:04.360]   Physically within their boundaries or globally so and in part and this is what I called the myth of censorship
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:08.440]   google's played this little game and by and large either knowingly or
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:12.840]   Or out of ignorance the various governments around the world have played along with it
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:17.800]   Which has been that the government say you have to censor these results and google says, okay
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:21.400]   We've censored them from google france and everybody nods and wings as if
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:25.800]   You couldn't go to google.com from google france is the uncensored result
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:30.360]   Right and that that had worked and that most notably had worked in china
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.600]   Right where they kind of got around with it
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:37.800]   And then when china finally caught on with it it kind of didn't matter because google ended up leaving china anyway
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:43.640]   So but that's not working anymore people in in the EU, you know the regulators and whatnot
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:46.840]   I've said no we we realize you haven't censored this from google.com
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:54.440]   So people can still find this stuff and it needs to go and what is entirely unclear and I can't get a straight answer from anybody on is whether they're saying
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:57.160]   You now need to censor
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.680]   worldwide
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:03.800]   For everyone in the world or worldwide for everybody within our country's boundaries
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.280]   if it is the
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:11.880]   Ladder that you're saying look, you know if if someone is in our country and they do a search
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:14.680]   We want you to censor according to our laws
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:21.880]   It's you know those are the laws and it's not impacting other countries and
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:26.840]   It's not difficult for people who really want to fake an ip address to get around it
[01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:31.880]   And I would hope that that's the compromise that we get to that that that the governments
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:34.040]   You know are reasonable about this and say look
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:39.480]   We said you had to remove this material for our citizens. You've made sure that you know
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:44.520]   Reasonable steps have been taken so that our citizens can't get to this material
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:51.240]   We're done if it's we're going to insist that you remove this stuff from your search engine worldwide. That is a
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:54.200]   very scary situation because
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:58.280]   While say the Europeans that are pushing for the right to be forgotten
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:00.920]   I think that that's all in good and that the way it would happen
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:06.520]   I guarantee some of the same people pushing for that would freak out if they googled in said oh by the way
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:11.080]   We now have to censor all this stuff about Tiananmen Square because even for people in france
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:14.840]   Because we got to follow chinese law worldwide because they want to do the same thing
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:19.080]   Right pictures of of women's hair have to be covered in banned
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:23.320]   Because Saudi Arabia doesn't like it and etc etc. There's no end to it
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:26.360]   So i'm hoping that the the ip based
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.640]   Type of censorship is what we end up with that that that's what happens
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:36.360]   I'm you know sort of a gat that google has not been clear on all this sort of stuff
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:41.000]   But themselves by not but not explaining what's going on or outlined the issues
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.480]   But I assume that there's more negotiations going on and you know, we'll see how it plays out
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:48.280]   But that's what we'll need to have happen and by the way
[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:51.320]   The flip side and this is what my article got into was
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:57.720]   Google has been censoring worldwide on u.s. Law for some time
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:04.360]   If you file a dmca complaint and you get something taken out that's taken out worldwide that's taken out for the u.s
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:07.320]   so, you know
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:14.200]   Google might also have a weird situation where they then have to only filter google.com
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:17.320]   Dmca for stuff that's within the u.s
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:21.640]   I you know it gets more complicated than that and that might be part of the other reason why they don't want to kind of
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:26.200]   Get into this all granularity, but you know, they're they're probably gonna have to do something
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:31.480]   I mean, I think you're absolutely right what's likely to happen is that google will roll out censorship as a service
[01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:34.040]   So they'll go to every single country and say okay
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:38.920]   What's the menu of things that have to be censored will censor it globally for your citizens based on ip
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:43.720]   and and and it's going to be a very complicated internet the the
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:46.600]   illusion that
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:49.640]   search engine results actively and accurately
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:55.800]   uh, you know reflect what's actually on the internet is going to become increasingly false
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:04.440]   uh, and it's going to be basically a a hodgepodge of censorship and legal takedown notices and all that kind of stuff
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:08.760]   Based on ip and where you are will determine what you can see no matter where you are
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:11.400]   And uh, that's that's gonna suck
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:16.920]   I think this just in from the explosive dr
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.440]   mom atnt just got hit by the fcc
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:24.360]   With the largest fine in the history of the fcc 100
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:30.840]   Million dollars why because they said your data was unlimited it was liars those liars
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:33.480]   Uh, the fcc
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:42.520]   Said that the company improperly slowed down internet speed for customers who said it was signed up for unlimited data plans atnt throttled
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:45.720]   Uh, their speeds when they exceeded a certain amount of data
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:48.680]   The fine is the largest ever
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:53.880]   Levy to buy the agency atnt implemented the practice in 2011
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:56.680]   Uh, they say they will fight
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:02.760]   This tom weiler continues his transition from dingo to hero. He's playing it
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:04.280]   Wow
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:11.000]   Yeah, he said consumers get what they deserve to get what they pay for broad band providers must be upfront and transparent about the services
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.360]   They provide the fcc will not stand by idly
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.520]   While customers are deceived by misleading marketing materials and insufficient disclosure
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:25.560]   And he said that's our whole business model. Yeah, what are you talking about?
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:32.040]   That's what that's what the whole like that's what your plan is when you go to sign up for any smartphone planets
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:40.040]   The whole thing is all about you not knowing what is really going on probably won't help atnt's attempted acquisition of uh, direct tv
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:42.200]   That is such a good
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:45.960]   But I hope it hits other people too. I you know, I was yelling at team old
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:49.640]   Well, about the same thing when they talked about all their unlimited data and you had to go into the
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:55.640]   You know footprints to find it. I just I don't get how you say unlimited data. That's limited
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:00.760]   Right. I mean wait a minute. Wait a minute to play devil's advocate. It's not that they're limiting the data
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.120]   It's just that they're slowing it down. They're limiting the speed
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:06.760]   It's a limit
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.840]   It's a limit. It's like saying we're not unlimited this
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:13.480]   We're not limiting the speeds on the freeway. We're just slowing them down. I mean, it's like
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:18.680]   The same limit means that you're putting some kind of restriction on data
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:22.360]   I thought unlimited meant there's no limit to how much data you can get
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:27.240]   No, that's that's how you might interpret it to me if you say I get unlimited data
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:30.680]   It means that there are no limits you're placing on the data
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:36.120]   And if one of the limits you place on the data is how much how quickly I can stream the data
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:41.720]   And I view that as a limit, but I like it T mobile site right now and it's interesting because I look at
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:43.400]   Edit now
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:48.200]   And I think they're being much more forthright than they had in the past where they still say unlimited data
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:50.680]   But up to one gigabyte ltg
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:54.200]   It used to be you kind of had to dig that stuff out and it was kind of buried with it
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:37:00.440]   But I still think this is really significant because like remember you can unlimited data and T mobile when you go abroad
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:01.720]   Right
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:03.480]   That's pretty cool. Whoa
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:05.480]   Well, yeah, but they didn't tell you that
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:11.400]   Well, if you wanted to know that you got to dig through and try to figure out what just how fast is it
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:12.520]   What is it that I meant?
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:14.840]   So on the one hand, I think it's great that they have it
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:18.200]   But on the other hand when I dig through and discover that it's 128k
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.240]   It's like oh, well, maybe that's not going to do what I need
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:23.320]   I've heard by the way that it's faster
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:28.760]   I would guess they probably would guess that in two weeks. Yes bringing all T mobile phones to europe
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:31.960]   We shall I shall I shall report back
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:35.320]   Razor bought oh, yeah
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:41.000]   Hey, I recognize a company with a weird name. I want to buy you razor of course makes the boom slang
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.480]   The best named mouse in the world. It also makes gaming keyboards
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:49.880]   Oh, yeah was a kickstarter. I think it was kickstarter. Was it indiegogo was a
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:54.040]   Crowdfunded project to create a android based gaming
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:57.000]   TV thing and
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.440]   While we didn't think it was the greatest thing since sliced bread is kind of slow
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:04.360]   Um, you could put plex on it and that that made it pretty darn cool
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:08.600]   Razor of course is a gaming company makes sense. They could sell the uya as a
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:11.720]   accessory, although I have to say I have the nvidia shield
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:16.200]   Which does 4k video is a powerful tegra processor? I think k1
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:20.120]   And it plays games great on my big screen tv crossy roads
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:25.000]   On my big screen tv is a great deal. Yeah
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:30.520]   Razor actually had its own android console. The uh, I didn't realize this the forge
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:38.600]   Which also like the uya got terrible reviews, but like it did get very good 99. Oh, yeah was on kickstarter by the way kickstarter wasn't okay
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:45.160]   By the way snapchat now if you go in mcdonald's you'll get a new sticker capability. You could snapchat burger and fries
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:49.080]   I didn't even know they were doing this. Do you still use snapchat? Uh
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:54.200]   Remember that we all played with it for a while and that was like, uh, but I don't use mcdonald's right
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:57.240]   I can't see you in mcdonald's you should go in just
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:01.800]   To do it. I do deserve a break today, but don't buy or eat anything
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:06.440]   Just just snapchat it and just snapchat here. I am and then run as fast as you can
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:13.240]   Some things for the creepy clown can it is kind of cool. Is there a creepy clown? That'd be good if no mcdonald or in the hamburger sticker
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:15.400]   I'd like that or the hamburger
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:23.800]   Do you are you snapchatter danny? Oh, yeah, I love snapchat. Yeah, what do you use it? What do you use it for?
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:31.960]   Well, I use the my story features. So I take a snap I share it out and um, you know anybody can follow it
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:37.880]   No, but me you put all this work into this and then it's gone. Yep. Nope. You can download it. Oh, it's it's a lot
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:42.360]   Well, but still it's a lot like um miercat or or um
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:46.360]   Periscope because it's a lot of work and yes, you can download it
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:52.120]   But really at the end of the day not very many people's gonna see yeah, I mean, but well no, I I'd scale you know, I can
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:56.280]   Why don't you store a fire search? I'm trying to find one of my one of my
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:00.600]   Because like when I went to peris I was walking around. I was just taking a little
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:05.240]   Uh, it's not the one. No, that's not it. I'm trying to find my download of it. Um
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:10.520]   Give me a second. I find it. Um, this is really entertaining as I try to look for the snapchat thing
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:12.040]   but um
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:17.560]   it it you know, I was walking through and I was just taking pictures of stuff and sharing what I was seeing and you could do a
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:19.240]   little bit of video with it from there and
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:24.120]   You know, it's hard to know how many people but you have because they're not really suited for that
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:24.840]   but
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:25.720]   you know
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:31.400]   I'll have like 200 views of anything I'm doing and I'm like nobody on snapchat, right?
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:34.360]   And I actually think that's pretty good engagement. Um
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.520]   It's fun
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:42.600]   Yeah, it's fun like there's other choices that are more people it to last longer and of course people like snapchat because it doesn't
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:45.160]   Do it. You gotta do it. Here we go. Here's my paris thing
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:49.400]   Oh
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:52.200]   That's cool. And then it was just like everything I was seeing
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:55.560]   Yeah, and it's just like little three second clips of what you got
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:01.480]   So this is what I was doing throughout the day. Those are the love locks that were still surviving somewhere. Yeah, they're taking them down, you know
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:06.760]   Yeah, they're all gone. Well, you'll see because I went onto the bridge and then you see the little and so it's just as I'm walking around
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:12.200]   You're taking a little annotations if you want to see somebody who does it really well as josh constant from uh
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:16.120]   From uh tech. Oh my god. His are awesome. Huh
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.400]   His he's are awesome. He does a great job. They should hire him
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:24.520]   But I'm looking for something that I can take on my trip that will let me kind of tell
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:27.880]   The story of my trip in a way that I can like an album
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:30.680]   No, no
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:35.560]   Of course you can google google photos to do that for you automatically automatically
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:41.080]   That's true. I mean, I'll have any control photos and I'm thinking microsoft's this way. That's kind of cool
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:46.920]   That lets you do like presentations storehouses. It's iPhone only. I don't know if I'm gonna take an iPhone
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:48.040]   with you
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:50.360]   Uh, but yeah, I guess if I just take the pictures
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:55.480]   Yeah, and the video then google will automatically assemble well you can do the you can also do the thing
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:57.960]   I just did updated it yesterday the
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:02.120]   I want to see if I have another one here. It was for the uh, we did for matt cuts
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:04.280]   um
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:06.280]   You can do the uh
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:11.080]   Just pick all your photos and throw them together and make a very quick like one-minute thing with music and everything
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:16.040]   I like that and a model will do that. It was very very easy. Oh here. It is google that
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:19.320]   Okay, ready? Let's close that. Let's do that. Do you remember matt cuts, right?
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:21.160]   Yeah, well, you have heard of him. Yeah
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:27.240]   So he was because we did our conference two weeks ago and it's the one that he normally would speak at but of course now he's all kind of
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.080]   Retired so he sent you some
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:35.560]   Well, no, I just I looked for all the pictures I found of matt that I'd had and I put them all into google photos
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.680]   And then it just made a little
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:41.080]   Little thing like that
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:43.800]   Yeah, we all have big photo caches of matt cuts
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:49.240]   We should put those together. I keep meaning to create a story about matt cuts and yeah
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:51.240]   We'll photos with all the photos I had
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:55.080]   But that's what it was it was like I grabbed 30 photos. I tossed them in there
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:59.560]   You could rearrange them you pick your theme it does all the fades and have some standard music that now
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:02.040]   I'm sick of hearing because I had to hear it so much as I was doing it
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:03.320]   You were done
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.280]   Did you just do it?
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:06.840]   I think you downloaded your camera roll and now you have it
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:07.800]   Do you ever do it?
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:08.520]   I'm sorry
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:10.360]   The only thing I didn't like was
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:14.120]   You couldn't go back in and then add in another photo or make more edits
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:16.760]   Like if you didn't pick all the right photos from beginning you had to start over
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.040]   Yeah, I mean that's what google
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:21.720]   Stories does on google plus in that right google photos
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:24.840]   Do you ever use that? Do you ever have one pop up and say hey?
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:27.000]   This is pretty good and then go in and tweak it and all that kind of stuff
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.880]   I do sometimes but usually I can't I'm not that bothered
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:32.440]   Yeah, so you know usually I'm just kind of flipping through it
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.680]   And I've had that weird thing like was covered before
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:37.000]   I remember that I can't remember who wrote about it at the verge
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:43.080]   But you know they had pictures of his kids and then pictures of his like think his their grandfather's general
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:45.880]   He got mixed together and I've had weird things like that where
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:49.480]   Google's mixed different things together, but this sometimes it does a good job
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:52.520]   And then if I get back I always look it's as long as you can fix it
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:56.040]   You can fix it you can swap them out and yeah, you know, but the thing is that it's
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:00.520]   Yet again another frustrating google product. It's so awesome
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:03.640]   It does everything you want it to it's all it does everything we've been saying
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:06.600]   It will put in auto-assums. It'll put in videos. It'll put in pictures
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:11.960]   It lets you put in captions. You can swap things out swap things in nobody uses it nobody
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:15.320]   I mean, I almost never see people sharing stories on Google plus
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:19.400]   Well, that's but I think I think that's part of the challenge
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:22.600]   Like I love what Google's doing with Google photos
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:27.240]   You know, and this is what I said because they had their they did their what a press conference act words, but
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:30.040]   It's still overwhelming
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:32.920]   Yeah, and sometimes I get you know, like
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:37.080]   My family has all these pictures of me when we're on vacation of me doing this
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:42.200]   That's the other problem. Do you want to do something that's really easy to do?
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:44.200]   I guess that's why Google is the best way to do this
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:50.280]   Part of the reason I tend to want to share the photos when I share them is it's almost like if I don't curate them right then in there
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:55.240]   Yeah, never get created. No, it's kind of nice, but still yeah
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:45:00.760]   One of the crazy things about Google photos is that it's been chunking away at all of mine
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:02.520]   I know literally have 80,000 photos
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:08.280]   So I'm just getting like I just got a story a couple of days ago from my trip to olympia grease in 2012
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:11.160]   And it's like wow look at this
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:16.840]   You know, but it's like it's still it's still working on it. I'm still getting animations from when I didn't have any hair
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:19.640]   Wow, yeah
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:24.440]   Well, I'm still waiting. I've got I've got like 10 years and 300 gigabytes of photos
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:29.080]   But they're all in google drive and they I google got back to me finally yesterday telling me sorry not
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:36.440]   When they launched google photos they said and it's totally works now for people with google apps accounts
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:39.160]   Totally works with google apps accounts and I was like, okay
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:43.880]   I'm on google apps account right now and all my stuff on google drive is not talking the way that you said and they're like
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:48.360]   Shit, she's just rolling out and like they finally came back and he said yeah, it doesn't work
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:54.920]   So I guess they're still working on it. It'll be nice if it finally comes to google apps
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:57.880]   But I have noticed that what they seem to have accelerated is
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:04.520]   It's almost like they really are going back in time making even more animations and stuff just to get you all excited that they have it
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:09.800]   So yeah, if you go to the assistant you'll you'll find animations as you go back and yeah, I like that
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:11.800]   I think that's good. You know now I'm settled you're right
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:16.360]   All I have to do is just take pictures of my phone right and uh they'll line up on photos
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:18.920]   In fact my camera that I'm going to be using the sony
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:24.280]   A7s I tap to the NFC to the back of the phone and it copies all the pictures over to the phone
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:29.080]   Which are then uploaded to it's so easy in fact that 128 bytes per cent right?
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:31.640]   Well, but it'll do it over time time
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:36.840]   And the thing is you can post it now with google photos to facebook or twitter or or google plus or all the above
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:41.560]   And by the way, why we're sitting here. I just posted the the one to the big reason
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:47.000]   I just posted it already. It's so easy, but you're right. No one ever posts them. Nobody does and so but anyway
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.240]   It's I think it's a great feature and I probably the way to go google photos. I think you solved it
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:53.080]   You sell my conundrum
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:57.400]   I've been puzzling about this. I can't wait to see them. Yeah, google solved solved my oh my goodness
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:58.840]   But do you snapchat too?
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:00.120]   No
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:02.120]   You stand no
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:05.640]   It's fun. Do you need to do it?
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:07.800]   It's fun
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:13.080]   You're like always cutting edge. You got a snappy and I was but that's so old now. I feel I feel like
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:19.480]   I feel like the geyser at mine that my you know 18 year old nieces birthday party or something like dad
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:23.560]   Is not all apparently mierkett will now not only stream
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:27.640]   Live but save it out to youtube. Yeah, we'll see a stream to youtube which is cool
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:29.960]   I was doing that with my little Reeve from HTC
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:32.440]   Which is good because I didn't read oh and I'm your kid
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:38.280]   It was periscope surprised me that I knew that they would save your video. I didn't realize they didn't save it forever
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:44.360]   Right 24 hours. Look at something and I was like what you you deleted it? Yeah
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:46.280]   Yeah
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:49.640]   Was happy about that. All right. You convinced me now that I think about it
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:51.400]   It makes perfect sense to use photos
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:55.400]   And it's free and it's does it and it's all that I've been uploading every picture of
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:59.720]   Every digital picture ever taken back to 2001. It's been uploading slowly to google
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:04.040]   And there may be controversy about whether it's the best thing or the easiest way to ship
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:06.200]   but I can I I
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:08.440]   Believe that for formatting
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:15.240]   Compiling and posting pictures. It's way faster than anything else and it's the last it's it does it without you doing anything
[01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:17.320]   Yeah, which I kind of like yeah
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:20.680]   All right. Let's take a break when we come back Danny Sullivan is here from search engine land
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:26.120]   Always good to see you Danny at Danny Sullivan on twitter Mike yelgin from tnt
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:29.720]   Monday through friday 10 a.m pacific on uh twit
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:37.480]   Uh, we're gonna get you pics of the week, but first fresh books is my pick for the easiest way to get those invoices
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:39.320]   sent out
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:45.240]   It's one of the one of the most annoying things there is about being self-employed or you know having a small business is
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:48.040]   Invoicing getting the money from your clients
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:51.320]   And of course, it's kind of like the most important thing you do too
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:58.600]   Uh, but just firing the whole idea firing up word or excel and creating the spread the invoice and
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:04.600]   Printing it out putting it in envelopes putting a stamp on it mailing it and then if they don't pay you calling them
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:06.360]   It just was painful
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:08.680]   So much so that I often would just put it off for months
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:15.000]   Fresh books solved that problem. They bill in multi currencies. I was bill in Canada that made it a lot easier
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.320]   You can easily get your expenses into fresh books just take pictures of the receipts
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:21.720]   And if you bill for time and hours
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:29.720]   uh easy time and expenses all done by the uh app you can actually press a timer and then it'll go right into the invoice plus
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:31.880]   The best thing about fresh books
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:37.960]   You get paid faster turns out clients like these email invoices. They like the pay button
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:41.560]   Because they want to pay it. It's just a pain for them just like it's a pain for you
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:44.920]   Make it easy for them. You get paid on average five days faster
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:48.120]   And if you get a slow pay client, they'll automatically send out reminders
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:51.560]   You don't have to worry about those awkward phone calls and you know, it's great about this
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:54.520]   I use this all the time do fresh books. I do all the time
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:59.240]   That's what I use and it's really fantastic because you use from the cloud-based service
[01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:04.280]   You were you going there? It creates the invoice number. It does everything. It knows the address of it knows everything
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:08.040]   Yeah, he just plug in, you know the minimal details and off it goes, right?
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:15.080]   And then when the person replies to your email it doesn't go back to the service it comes into your inbox like a regular email
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:18.920]   So for example, I get a reassuring message saying hey got it. Thanks a lot, you know
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:22.920]   And again, it just part of the usual flow. So it's just it's so
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:28.920]   Anybody who who invoices and doesn't use it is basically nuts. It's so much easier. Yeah, here's the deal
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:30.920]   Go to fresh books dot com slash twig

[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:08.280]   And it even it even did an animation and auto awesome. They used to call him auto awesomes. Yeah, that's incredible
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:14.120]   That's uh, that's 14 15 years ago now almost almost 14 years ago. I love that
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:17.160]   Thank you google photos
[01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:23.960]   Mike you got a pick for us. I do I do it's a it's a service that went live today called earthcast earthcast
[01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:26.040]   dispelled ur th e
[01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:28.120]   C a s t
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:34.200]   And what this is is a site that will show you 4k photos taken from the space station
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:40.920]   Straight down at planet earth and i'm sorry. I said photos the thing that this is they are videos
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:42.840]   They're 4k videos
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:47.400]   Beautiful, so you we've all seen google maps and google earth and all that kind of stuff
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:51.720]   Well, these are actual videos you can see cars driving down the freeway you can see lots of stuff
[01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:58.280]   Live you can see cars moving yes, you can see movement and so on and they are going to be posting all the stuff and they're going to
[01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:00.680]   It's just random places
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:05.080]   They it's straight down from the is s and and across a swath of the earth
[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:09.400]   Uh that they cut they go across but it's super high res
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:13.960]   And they're gonna they're gonna have an api they're gonna do all this kind of really cool stuff
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:18.200]   But this went live today and it's basically 400 kilometers high
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:21.160]   It's going 25 000 kilometers an hour
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:27.800]   And so they do all kinds of computational stuff to make sure that the the video is really high quality
[01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:30.360]   um, but they it's just
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:36.680]   Breathtaking as you can see from this that's just incredible. Okay, so now you don't have to wear astronaut diapers to get the great view
[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:38.680]   You can if you want
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:44.760]   You might if you just sit there and stare all day. It's really it is really gorgeous. Yeah, uh, this is just from the website
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:49.960]   I'm just like I don't know what i'm doing. I'm just looking at the you are t h e
[01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:57.080]   C a st c a st earth cast with a you i don't know why they spell it that why
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:01.560]   Because earth cast with an e was probably taken earth cast with a you
[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:04.440]   Uh, unbelievable. Yeah
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:09.160]   So this is it must be a promotional video then this doesn't go on. Yes, no, right
[01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:13.000]   So if you go to the uh, if you go to the website earthcast.com
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:17.800]   You can see all kinds of promotional videos and different things that gallery they they have
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:23.720]   They talk about their api's that they're going to be doing they they have all kinds of images that they've posted
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:25.720]   um
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:29.000]   And it's going to be a service as well. So if you have a business if you're for example
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:35.720]   Are a food conglomerate and you'd like to monitor crop conditions or you know any kind of sort of industrial use like
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:41.160]   So there's there's a commercial there is at a price here there is but for the rest of us it is
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:44.280]   It'll give you a funny feeling inside to see
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:49.080]   Video like this. This is something they just mounted on the is s
[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:54.600]   I got two cameras to mount. Yes two cameras. I there are little there are cameras called, uh, isis
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:54:02.280]   And do they pay the iss for it? I risk check that I don't know but I imagine there's some kind of deal to profit
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:08.200]   He's bashed. Yeah, here's the live live feed right now because uh, there's a life. It's on the right side of the earth
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:10.920]   On the night side of the earth
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:14.520]   Just leave that we can watch sunrise or is it sunset?
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:19.880]   Sunrise sunset wait 15 minutes and yeah, the other one that's a sunset. I guess
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:22.680]   That was really cool
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:28.120]   Hey, Jason, where did you get the live feed? What there was just up a top left hand corner? It says live
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:34.440]   I love that on the mean site. All right. Great. Holy mo golly. That was perfect timing
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:42.680]   And with that we uh close today, so I think that's it. They're getting better now. That's the best pick in the
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:49.560]   Pick of the year and you can dial it down from 720p the live one is 720p 360p and 160p
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:54.440]   You can go full screen on that. So this is like a here's cars moving in boston
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:57.880]   Massachusetts you can actually so it is live these are
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:00.280]   Isn't vehicles driving down?
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:08.120]   Route 95 or something you could use this is pardon the phrase your new screensaver. There's there's there's Fenway park
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:10.120]   If there were a game going on we could watch
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:13.880]   Wow, yeah
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:16.600]   But i'm really enjoying the earth at night
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:19.720]   Yeah, it's dark. That's the live one. It's dark
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:23.720]   It's uh, well, you can see a little corona there not for you know, it's cool
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:27.800]   You're gonna see the sunrise and in another 40 minutes. You'll see the sunset again
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:31.240]   What a world
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:34.120]   Wow, I don't know if you want to follow that matt
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:38.360]   I mean, uh, danny. Do you want to follow that where you want to just go home?
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:41.560]   Oh, no. No, i'm good. Good. What's your pick?
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:43.880]   Sunset, uh
[01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:45.880]   Life takes all depressing
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:51.400]   I mean, that's what I mean. I'll just keep this feed going while you're talking about whatever
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:56.200]   If you want since it's a google thing, um
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:56:00.680]   Ami on our staff that are really good post today looking at google, you know
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:06.520]   It does a lot of direct answers to now you can search for stuff and it trying to put an answer right up there at the top of the page
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:11.720]   Um, and as they've expanded this it tends to be making more mistakes
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:18.360]   Um, either it's picking up answers for things where there's debates or it can get wrong answers or it can get not safe for work answers
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:24.120]   So, you know, I'd suggest taking a look at her when google gets a wrong article because it looks at some of the challenges that they face
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:30.680]   When they're trying to pick one answer as opposed to the usual we're going to give you the the 10 blue links
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:34.600]   You still get the 10 blue links that they've had out there before but you know, it's like
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:39.720]   Like if you do a search one of searches like does god love everyone and it comes back when an answer god only loves christians
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:44.360]   Okay, it can only do what's on the internet
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:49.400]   Yeah, um, you know, or I think this is still working if you this is my favorite
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:51.880]   Let me see if it still works if you search for king of the united states
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:56.760]   Um, please still work. Please still work. Please still work. Yeah, there we go
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:03.960]   So if you search for king of the united states it comes up as uh barak obama and um and you'll see it's really dramatic
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:07.800]   It's like this big huge box right that's the king of the united states
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:14.760]   And what happened was bright bar wrote this article saying all hail broccabama emperor the united states
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:16.760]   And so google started listing that up
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:24.680]   So a few months ago we wrote about how that direct answer was showing up and that turned us into the source
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:26.360]   So
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:32.040]   I mean, it's it's you know, it's wrong and yet no one at google's they're reviewing this sort of stuff
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:36.280]   And so as they've increased the number of direct answers that they provide
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:42.520]   It's becoming easier and easier to find these kinds of really weird glitches. You another one if you can type like what is 411?
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:45.560]   Um, you'll either get an answer from at and t
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:50.200]   Um, oh, looks like they killed that one. Yeah, it was coming up. Um,
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:52.920]   Maybe if you do it as like what's 411?
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:55.720]   It's not working there. Uh,
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:58:00.920]   The other thing I don't know if you want to bring that up on screen. We came across this young day was like a hiccup cure
[01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:10.120]   Is it oh no that one didn't go there too. So maybe they're fixing it. They're fixing stuff. That's what it is
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:16.600]   Stop hiccups stop hiccups. Is this not safe for work? Yeah, you should look away. Look away
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:19.000]   No, it's not. Oh there it is
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:25.160]   Oh, that one we talked about before. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, so you know, by the way, that does work. I tried it
[01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:29.160]   It might be actually correct, but when you consider that this is a
[01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:31.720]   You know, it's not what you google
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:36.040]   This is a long-standing problem. Although I'm surprised it's not getting better. It's getting worse
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:39.960]   It's getting worse because people are going for those because you're doing it. They're google bombing
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:43.000]   It's not because people are are specifically going at it
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:48.920]   There's not there are people who are becoming savvier to the fact that you can optimize to become an answer. Yes
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:51.240]   Has google
[01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:57.800]   Um, the people at Moz have a service where they try to track how often certain features appear in the google search results
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:03.400]   So about seven eight months ago, you would get a direct answer maybe for
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:07.960]   5% of the queries that you would search that they would check on google
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:10.920]   That's up to like almost 30 percent now
[01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:15.160]   So the reason is getting getting worse because they're becoming more
[01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:21.720]   Aggressive in where they're trying to find answers and but they're not coupling that with any kind of fact checking thing
[01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:27.480]   By the way, this will this is maybe a better thing too, but type in let's see if this works leo loport
[01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:31.080]   Let's see how famous you are. Uh, the port quotes
[01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:34.200]   Oh god
[01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:37.240]   That's a good thought. Oh god. No
[01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:37.720]   No
[01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:39.960]   All right, but let's try something else not that famous. Thank god
[01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:42.840]   Make the famous person like in indubaraka bomba quotes
[01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:49.880]   And is that working? Yeah, so they've got a new thing now where we use your eyes people
[01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:55.240]   You get close that they've said and it is very nice. The the only downside to this is
[01:59:55.640 --> 02:00:00.280]   Um, they don't source any of the quotes because hey facts is facts, right?
[02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:07.160]   Yeah, but not really are they no not really because sometimes like for example if you searched for a peti barnam
[02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:10.120]   Barnum quotes. Yeah
[02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:13.560]   You'll see that he says there's a sucker born every minute, right?
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:17.240]   Right, except he didn't say that one of his competitors apparently said it about
[02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:20.680]   Spurious, but everybody says that he says it right
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:28.920]   So because there's no source and there's no context you don't understand that and that might have been useful to get or another one was like
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:31.960]   Um, uh, if you type in eric schmitt quotes
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:39.000]   You'll see the third thing is hey you got something you don't even know maybe you shouldn't be doing it
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:43.240]   Yeah, well, he said that though. He said but when did he say it?
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:46.520]   Why did he say right? He say it? You don't get any
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:49.240]   What would have gotten?
[02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:55.480]   Yes, they actually sourced some of this stuff. Good. So, you know, it's new but some sourcing might be nice too
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:01:00.520]   But it's still kind of cool. They'll do that. Yeah, that's good. Now back to the sunset
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:07.400]   Yeah, uh or sunrise soon sunrise good news just came in from scooter x in our chat room
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:12.760]   The motor roller 360 is being updated now. Huh to five be wanting to roll out. Yes
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:18.680]   What do I get with that you get lots of stuff? We have been using five one on my urbane
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:21.640]   This is the one that adds Wi-Fi. It's amazing
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:23.880]   Who knows already on the motor?
[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:27.080]   Well, the the hardware was there but now you can connect your watch
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:30.200]   to Wi-Fi which means uh you can get
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:35.640]   Data from your phone over your Wi-Fi now leave your phone at home. Good. That'd be cool
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:39.560]   Yeah, you also get the the the scroll where you twist the wrist
[02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:44.200]   Scroll which is only good for strap hangers or somebody who's saying you know
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:48.200]   I find it very useful on the segue because I need to keep one hand on the so I can go like that
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:50.840]   Yeah, so I'm not on your throttle hand. Yeah
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:54.200]   You can now draw
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:56.040]   You could draw moji
[02:01:56.040 --> 02:01:59.480]   You'll really the ui actually is much better because in fact, can you do?
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:01.400]   I don't know if you can see my yeah, you can kind of see it
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:04.040]   So now I can slide over to applications
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:07.720]   So you don't need a separate application launcher and slide again to contacts
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:12.040]   Not that you can make a phone call, but it's good for texting and stuff like that. Those are my favorites
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:15.240]   Um, so that's that is much improved. I think
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:19.320]   Um a lot of the other stuff is uh is is pretty much the same
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:22.280]   Although I think watch faces can do more as well
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:25.720]   Oh, and I know the always on is great. So let me show you
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:28.760]   Yeah, I don't you know
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:30.840]   I need google keep on here for this to work
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:35.880]   Because I think that's one of the few always on things and I'm using every note instead of keep as my other it is
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:39.720]   Let's launch keep let's see. So uh, this is nice because I use keep
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:42.280]   For my shopping list, right?
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:46.040]   So my house crapping my shopping so there's my shopping list, right?
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:48.920]   But now when the watch goes to sleep instead of going dark
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:51.400]   It has an ambient mode for even apps
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:54.760]   So the ambient mode for uh keep will continue to show my list
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:03:01.800]   You can shop without ever getting off of your segue. It's exactly what you want. Yeah, so uh, this is um
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:06.280]   This is I think uh much wanted much anticipated update
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:11.640]   It's been out for the lg watches lg update at all their watches, but we've been waiting on the moato 360
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:15.320]   I still think the moato 360 is probably the best looking android wear watch
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:20.840]   So yeah, uh, if you've got one of those get your update get your update. It's rolling
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:22.920]   There's nothing you could do. Well, there's not much you get
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:25.400]   It'll just happen
[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:28.440]   Uh, but just make sure you have the latest android wear on your phone and uh
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:33.400]   Cross get it. Go get it in the next week. I also want next week's episode of this week in google
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:36.280]   You'll have it. I mentioned the uh android tv
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:42.200]   Made by n video the shield, you know, I haven't done it before you buy review that's still to come
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:45.800]   But it's so it's 200 bucks. I I like it
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:51.000]   Unfortunately android tv is missing some capabilities. There's no amazon on there yet
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.200]   I don't know why not there really needs to be there is netflix
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:59.480]   And if you use the google uh apps like google music, it's great with google music
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:02.680]   It turns google, you know your t your home theater will not do google music
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:07.720]   If you use uh netflix for if you have a 4k tv for 4k video, it will support that
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:13.880]   7.1 surround sound they just pushed out an update that means images pictures are also
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:19.480]   Uh 4k, which is great and that x it's not a k when I said i miss spoke
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:23.240]   It's an x1 processor, which is an incredibly fast arm
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:28.040]   Processor and you can't play games on it. It comes with the controller
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:30.280]   um
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:33.400]   But uh, you may also want to order the remote
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:38.200]   Do not get the 500 gigabyte version for 300 bucks because
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:42.760]   That's a lot for that storage. You can hook up. It has a usb port
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:44.760]   You can up of any usb drive
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:51.000]   So three terabyte drive for 100 bucks is a much better deal than 100 bucks for 500 gigabytes
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:55.800]   And you can also put a micro sd and that's what I did I put a 128 gig micro sd in there
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:59.640]   And what by the way, unlike smart android smart phones
[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:02.760]   It will automatically copy the apps to the sd so
[02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:07.720]   Uh, you got lots of room for games. So this is in vidias version of android tv
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:11.320]   It's android tv and I think it's probably the best one out there just because it's
[02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:19.160]   Easily the most powerful and i let's approach to because I think i've got the google android tv that they sold directly, right?
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:23.160]   Yeah, that little puck. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:26.120]   Yeah, I don't think that was very much more powerful
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:31.960]   Also more expensive 200 bucks is a lot that compared to a roku for under a hundred dollars apple tv for 69 bucks
[02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:34.600]   You get a controller with it for 200 get the controller
[02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:39.160]   And the controller has a microphone in it and you can talk to it much like fire tv
[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:42.360]   Um, so that's that's pretty good. It's nice looking
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:45.640]   It's actually smaller than it looks that makes it look kind of imposing
[02:05:45.640 --> 02:05:47.800]   It's really just a little skinny little box
[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:52.840]   Uh, but I think they've done a nice job. This is um, it's game focused, you know
[02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:58.840]   Um, and if they add I think if they added amazon, it has kulu it has netflix
[02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:02.520]   The add of the amazon. I kind of cool. We went we went on um, you know
[02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:06.920]   We went skiing back in february for the break and I took the android tv with me
[02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:10.200]   Um, and it was nice because you know
[02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:15.400]   We it was like less than trying to take an xbox right little games we could play it whatever
[02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:17.880]   But it was sluggish in some cases. Yeah, this is not
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:22.600]   Yeah, you will never say this is sluggish. It has a youtube 11 ac mymo
[02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:27.400]   Uh, two and five gigahertz fast processor three gigs of ram
[02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:29.560]   um
[02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:32.840]   And uh, what was there was something else I wanted to mention?
[02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:35.880]   Oh, you can use nvidia's game stream, which means you can play hardcore games
[02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:41.960]   Streaming from nvidia's. I haven't done that yet, but I'll have to give it a try. It's android 5.1
[02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:46.920]   Um, I am actually I like it a lot. It's pretty good. They just pushed out an update
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:52.760]   Uh, so I I think I'd I think I'd probably recommend it except for the price which is you know 200 bucks
[02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:55.160]   Is a little yeah a little steep
[02:06:55.160 --> 02:06:59.080]   For something that basically adds internet to your television
[02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:03.400]   And it's not I mean, you know android gaming is in the state of the yard gaming that you'd expect with xbox one
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:05.720]   It's a lot cheaper than the next box one
[02:07:05.720 --> 02:07:12.040]   Uh, it is nvidia so you get some of the uh games that right a lot of other android, you know folks
[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:15.640]   Wish they had access to because it's kind of adds some guest
[02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:19.480]   Yeah original almost forgot to mention it's a chrome right and it doesn't need to be configured
[02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:23.000]   It just shows up. I I decided a hard wire to put an ethernet cable in there
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:26.280]   So I'm getting great performances a great choice around uh
[02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:31.080]   Uh around that kind of stuff. It's great chrome cast advice. You know in a way
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:34.200]   Uh everything so many things chrome cast now
[02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:37.960]   I mean I could show time chrome cast show time so many of the apps on my phone
[02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:43.640]   I don't mind so much that all those apps aren't on it's like i had hbo now, but not hbo go
[02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:45.640]   But that's okay because hbo go chrome guests
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:46.840]   um
[02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:48.840]   Amazon does not yet chrome cast
[02:07:49.240 --> 02:07:52.840]   I think amazon google are gonna be kind of yeah like that
[02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:58.680]   Unfortunately, which is I mean I kind of wish amazon would just give on brace it well
[02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:00.840]   No, I give up but just embrace android
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:05.160]   Like not try to run their own thing, but just you know jump in on it
[02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:08.920]   Yeah, you know, but then again, you know if you're amazon you're watching google decide they want to be
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:13.800]   Your shopping thing get you you know to worry. Yeah
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:16.840]   Yeah, that's true
[02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:23.400]   All right, my friends. We're wrapping it up. Thank you so much. Mr. Danny Sullivan search engine land.com marketing land.com

[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:30.520]   You got to read his stuff. It's phenomenal
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:34.520]   Mike elkins here also every day monday through friday 10 am pacific
[02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:38.360]   1 pm eastern simed 1700 utc for tech news today
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:40.680]   Twit.tv/tnt
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:44.520]   That still works that still works so many things don't but that still
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:49.480]   Oh, man. We're working as hard as we can. We love the new I hope you like the new website
[02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:53.640]   I'm very happy with it the design and so forth, but we understand there are some issues particularly
[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:59.640]   I think the biggest issue for people right now is that when you want to download a single episode
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:04.040]   There's an issue with these download buttons. We're working on that. We understand it's kind of a
[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:11.560]   Thorny issue because it's a it has to do with how browsers respond to certain mime types internet explorer actually does it right
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:14.200]   Yeah, but it's the only one that I didn't see that coming
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:16.040]   I didn't see that coming. It's the only one that does
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:19.400]   But we're going to fix that with that's a number one priority for us
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:22.600]   But in other respects, I think it's just I hope you like it
[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:27.320]   I'm very pleased and I want to thank our developers at four kitchen for doing a great job
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:30.760]   We will you know if you go to the site twit.tv browse around
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:34.600]   Click the learn more button where it says welcome to the new web website
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:37.080]   It here is my long article
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:43.880]   About what's going on with this site why the site is the way it is what we did why so much of the site is invisible
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:49.480]   There's a lot more to this because we have a full api which we're making public through our developer program
[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:53.480]   Uh, and we want to encourage anybody who wants to build
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:59.080]   Anything from like a short little snippet that downloads the programs that you want to a full website
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:03.880]   Uh to do it the api is fully documented. There's a lot. It's very rich
[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:07.560]   You can get just about any kind of information you want about any of our shows
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:11.320]   Uh from the api. So if you're a programmer
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:15.880]   Especially if you're a programmer and saying I could do that site better do
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:19.080]   I maybe i'll buy it from you
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:22.440]   Twit.tv the new twit.tv. Thank you everybody
