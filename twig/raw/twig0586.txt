[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.200]   run to rewind.

[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.240]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, the show we cover the latest news from the
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.560]   Google verse with Stacey Higginbotham of stacey on IOT.com. Hello Stacey.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.240]   Hello, I knew you were going to catch me first because I just ate a cookie.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.480]   What's today's Christmas cookie of the week?
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.880]   Lemon Rosemary Butter Cookies and they are delicious.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.600]   Show us one.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.520]   I just ate the last one.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.360]   I knew that.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.840]   That's exactly why I said it.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.280]   I ate it.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.200]   Oh, man, I'm Jell's. Did you make this with your daughter or is this?
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.640]   Yes.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.960]   Yes.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.480]   And these were rollout cookies.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.840]   So we got out the rolling pin.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.480]   Very exciting.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.920]   We're practicing our Christmas cookies to share with people who want Christmas cookies during Covid.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.360]   Sugar base, right?
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.280]   Yeah, butter and egg yolk actually.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.000]   You know what I'd like to do is make a cookie that looks like Covid and see if anybody will eat it.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   With spikes and everything.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.040]   That's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.600]   Thank goodness he laughed at Buzzmachine.com.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.240]   I'll eat it.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.280]   I'll eat anything.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.080]   I'm Mikey.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.080]   It would be fun to pass out Covid cookies.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.200]   He's the Lening-Tow professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.240]   Journalism at the City University of New York and our most welcome contributor.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.680]   Contributor.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.200]   Hello, Jeffrey.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.760]   And on the far right there, that's Ant Pruitt of photography,
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.200]   hands-on wellness who cannot hear himself right now.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.720]   No, I have no idea what I'm saying right now.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.960]   He just can't hear himself.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.360]   Today, we will not talk about Apple's M1 chip.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.320]   You have my, well, I'm not going to give my word on that.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.200]   Oh, come on.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.600]   We could.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.480]   We might.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.120]   You never know.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:03.760]   I will talk about the Nest adage that took everything out, including your security cameras.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.720]   I mean, I don't mind if my Nest hub isn't working, but I mean, you take out my security cameras.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.040]   That's a potential problem.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.240]   Stacey and IOT, they fixed it.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.880]   What was, did they ever say why it went out yesterday?
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.040]   Oh, I didn't see a report yet, but I wasn't looking for it.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.760]   This happens.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.400]   I mean, this happens like at least two or three times a year.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.320]   So I mean, I always tell people, like for baby monitors, because there's all the baby
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.040]   monitor people.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.920]   That's another one.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.240]   Don't use these for baby monitors.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.880]   If this is really your only option, use a dedicated proprietary radio technology.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.240]   There's a reason that those exist, and it's because they're more resilient than trusting
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.120]   something in the cloud.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.960]   But this is cheap and it's easy to use.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.720]   And for most people, it's going to be good enough.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.840]   So.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.320]   Good news.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.280]   That's why I was going to ask why would someone use it as a baby monitor?
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.600]   Is it because it's a lower barrier to entry?
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.240]   Just so easy to just do it.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.720]   Well, and it's not a baby monitor.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.680]   It's cool.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.160]   It's you can look in and see a lot of the baby, the official baby monitor ones are pretty expensive.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160]   They don't tie into your smart home.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.760]   They're not going to get cool features like Nest might one day recognize,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.200]   hey, your baby is laying face front down.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.000]   Yeah, they shouldn't.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.480]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.960]   And alert you.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.560]   They don't do that now, but they could.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.320]   No, baby monitors are surveillance.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.640]   It's part of the evil takeover of technology.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.120]   This isn't, no, this isn't bad.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.840]   This is just.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.680]   Well, don't use it for a baby monitor because if it's down,
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.440]   you're not going to know.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.480]   There is a nest.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.840]   X or times Yale lock.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.040]   Apparently that was unaffected.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.600]   Thank goodness.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.360]   Because that would be a big problem.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.600]   If for 45 minutes, you couldn't get into the house, but that seems to be working.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.920]   All right.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.000]   Nest camera feeds were down or having issues.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.120]   The Google Assistant or Google Home app apparently working.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.520]   Okay.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.280]   It's this happened in August.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.760]   So it's not the first time and it probably isn't the last,
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.000]   but it probably should inform you about using these devices for anything
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.280]   mission critical like a baby monitor or a door lock.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.640]   I'm always, I've always been nervous about Bluetooth and other door locks.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.880]   I just want to regular physical door lock.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.320]   So I will say two things here.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.080]   A door lock can physically like it can gracefully degrade, right?
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.840]   You should have a key somewhere.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.400]   It fails closed, not fails open.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.840]   Well, yeah, it does fail closed, but you should still be able to get to it.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.280]   Bluetooth is also local, so you don't need cloud servers if you're.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.760]   That's true.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.680]   So if the lock has the token and your phone has the token and you're fine.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.680]   Okay.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.160]   That's true.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.600]   But you couldn't let your maiden or someone like that maybe,
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.200]   and that might irritate people.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.120]   I hate it when I can't let the maiden.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.800]   There's no one to sweep up.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.800]   My new car is it's a Ford Mustang Mach-E uses Ford Pass,
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.320]   uses the phone and Bluetooth Elle to unlock the door instead of a key dongle key file.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.440]   I think you haven't.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.000]   Not yet.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.680]   They're making it on on Tuesday.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.320]   I'd like you to do a show from the car, please.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.720]   I will.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:12.720]   I will.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.080]   I will.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.880]   But that's the new thing, right?
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:23.040]   Apple has this built into iOS, but to this point, I think it only works with a
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.240]   one model of BMW, the car pass or car key or what a car key, I guess it's called.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.400]   I just thought you also get a dongle.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.280]   I'm sure you still get a dongle.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:33.600]   I would.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.040]   I would expect that.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:41.840]   And there is a manual entry technique with a number pad on the door.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.800]   So you're not.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.560]   There are other ways to get in, but there's no lock and key.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.160]   There's no barrel for the key.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.280]   There's no key like that.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.720]   That's well, that's like the Tesla.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.840]   And I will say, I once got locked out of the Tesla, why didn't get locked out?
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.000]   I couldn't start it remotely from my phone because it was in a parking garage and it was
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.160]   too.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.600]   It couldn't access the internet and I didn't have my key fop with me.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:10.720]   Reminds me of a friend of mine who's a well-known director who had one of those new,
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:16.160]   the first edition fisker cars, electric cars that had the solar panel on the roof.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.040]   And I was asking his wife, what do you have?
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.600]   How do you like it?
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.440]   She said, well, wasn't great.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.600]   We drove up to the Oscars one year and couldn't get out.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.920]   So it was a good entrance, right?
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.080]   Go around the block.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.720]   Go around the block.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.760]   Go around the block.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.160]   John, go around the block.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.680]   So yeah, she wasn't a big fan.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.680]   If they were cool looking cars, they're still around.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.000]   They are cool looking cars.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.760]   Yeah, because they have solar panels on the roof,
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.080]   which do not accumulate enough power to actually do anything worthwhile.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.520]   It's just cool.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.040]   They're just cool.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.600]   Google Pay, well, you know, I should say that for the change log.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.920]   We don't, God knows, we need more things for the change log.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.200]   Yeah, I put it in for the big cup for the grown-ups table.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.160]   The grown-ups table, really?
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.760]   You want to put on the grown-ups table?
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.320]   Change log.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.280]   I think it's a big deal.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.240]   All right, it is a big deal.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.280]   No, it is a big deal.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.560]   It is a big deal.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.800]   And why would you shove it in the change log?
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.320]   Yeah, change log is the kitty table.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.520]   God.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.360]   Google Pay has been updated to peer-to-peer payments.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.960]   In fact, actually a lot of new things.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.160]   Oh, it links to your bank account.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:28.560]   Yeah, a lot of news.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.200]   Is that the story?
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.440]   We're talking about the bank account story.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.200]   Well, it's all part of the same.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.960]   Right.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.760]   I focused on a different portion of it than you did.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.960]   Oh, okay.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.200]   That's the change log portion.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.160]   That's the change log portion.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.960]   Oh, geez.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.920]   It now allows peer-to-peer to peer-to-peer to change log,
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.080]   because this is something that they've had before,
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.560]   updating and updating again.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.160]   There's a critical mass point.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.400]   Is it a big enough change that you might actually mention it on Twitter?
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.040]   I guess I feel like that's actually okay.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.320]   Would you do a fleet?
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.680]   Is the question.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.640]   They're called fleets.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.600]   What is a singular?
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.760]   Is there a fleet or are they just all fleets?
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.800]   Would you do a fleets?
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.640]   Do we know?
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.120]   A flint.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.760]   Twitter store.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.520]   I would, is the verb formed a flint?
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.120]   I will flip the fleet.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.160]   The fleet, I flip.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.000]   I flitted.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.720]   I flitted.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.320]   I said it's good at all.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:22.320]   It's good at all.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:22.480]   It's good at all.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.440]   It's good at all.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.080]   I flapped.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.800]   So this is a new feature on Twitter,
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.920]   which you will only get on mobile.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.120]   You won't get it on the desktop.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.000]   Normally you get it in any of the third party Twitter apps.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.320]   So you have to be using the Twitter native app
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.920]   on iOS or Android.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.240]   And it's basically Instagram stories
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.760]   or Snapchat stories.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.120]   It's a pretty-
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.160]   Or Facebook stories.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.400]   It's a pretty close clone of Instagram stories.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.200]   Have you played with it?
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:49.840]   Yeah, you have.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.960]   Because I saw your fleet.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.160]   Yes, I decided to give it a shot.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.680]   I don't know how long I'll play around with it.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.480]   And if I do,
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.800]   I'm just going to pretty much do it
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   the same way I do Instagram stories.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.640]   Because my audience over there
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.800]   is different from my audience on Twitter.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.720]   And you already have the content.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.840]   So yeah, so I'm just going to sort of double dip it
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.880]   and just use it as more-
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.280]   promotional and behind-the-scenes stuff.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.960]   If anybody's going to even watch it.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.160]   Is it easy to use?
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.320]   Yeah, it was pretty straightforward.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.920]   That's the real thing.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.520]   I think it's got to be easy to use.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.560]   People aren't going to use it.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.520]   If anybody watches it.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.960]   Because if no one's watching it,
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.480]   I won't put any more effort into it.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.720]   But I mean, I had like 100 people or so
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.360]   on that last one within the last couple of hours.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.280]   Well, that's one thing that's a little disappointing.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.480]   I don't think that Instagram does this or Snapchat.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.800]   It shows you immediately who's seeing it.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.640]   And what's more, if you have a multi-image fleet.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.000]   If you have a multi-image fleet.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.120]   But fleet is plural for many ships in a fleet.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.560]   It's a clip right now.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.800]   Okay, but this is a pun and a twist on fleeting.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.320]   So just say fleet.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.720]   It's A fleet or fleets.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.720]   Or is it fleets?
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.280]   One floats a fleet or fleets a fleet or one has flat.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.400]   Fleeted.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.560]   I done fleet.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:14.960]   Fleuted.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.200]   I saw three deer yesterday.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.640]   But did you see a fleet of deer?
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.960]   Were there multiple types of fishes?
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.160]   All right, back to Google Pay.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.440]   I don't know how we got in this one.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:34.800]   Google Pay is launching Plex bank accounts with City and other partners next year.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.240]   That's a little bit different.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.320]   The new app is in early access.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.040]   This is the official announcement.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.680]   Let's go say.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.560]   They had an event.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.280]   Say hello.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.200]   See, I didn't get the test.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.840]   If they have an event, it's bigger than the change lock.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.040]   It shouldn't be in the change lock.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:49.280]   Okay.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.640]   I don't know how that's the test.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:56.320]   So this is like, I guess I was focusing more on just that they're coming back.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.880]   I didn't necessarily think about the Plex car.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.440]   Where'd they go?
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.400]   They didn't go anywhere.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.200]   Oh yeah.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.440]   Okay, wait, let's start this.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.720]   Okay, just do the story.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.800]   Let's do the story.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.480]   We're getting a little bogged down.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.080]   So let's start with they had an announcement today where they shared.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.040]   What was it, Stacey?
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.960]   Google Plex.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.720]   And what is Plex?
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.600]   Oh, let's talk about it.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.000]   Theo, what is Plex?
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.080]   Plex allows you to have a digital bank account.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.600]   They've also added peer-to-peer payments.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.400]   And Google Pay now can only be used on one smartphone at a time,
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.400]   which is a bit of a disadvantage.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:42.160]   Google's kind of trying to get in the same business Apple's been in for some time with Apple Pay.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:48.080]   The announcement, say hello to the new Google Pay.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:53.120]   The new application will help you quote, improve your relationship with money.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.400]   End quote.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.760]   Well, okay.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.760]   It's also, it lets you, it's like Venmo in that you can help your friends.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.960]   You can say, hey, give me this money.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.360]   It also does things like it holds rewards for various businesses that you're working with.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.120]   I think Apple Wallet does that.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.920]   And then there probably are budgeting things.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.080]   Let's go to the video.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.600]   Oh, wait, it's 28 minutes long.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.160]   Never mind.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.840]   Let's not go to the video.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.760]   That's far beyond changing.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.880]   They're working with probably, was it 11 or 16 banks to offer this?
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.720]   Although there's something with City specifically,
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.920]   like if you want to start a new account with Google Pay, it'll be through Citibank.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.840]   And that's new, isn't it?
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.560]   That's new, yes.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.600]   Okay.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.520]   I guess, Antwa, you're thinking about maybe, remember they had a credit card for a while, briefly?
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.480]   It had a debit card.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.600]   It seems to have one.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.160]   I did two.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.440]   White debit card.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.480]   So that went away.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:48.480]   And they went away.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.680]   They just killed it off.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.400]   Now they wish they'd done that because Apple's making a bank on its Apple Pay card.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.680]   These Plex accounts are with Citibut.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.360]   Other partners will come along next year.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:06.560]   So it's more now, basically Google Pay was touchless payments, NFC payments.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:15.760]   And if you want, you can link your bank account with Google and get all this information tied to
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.800]   what you've purchased, which is kind of like searchability.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.280]   And I assume eventually analytics.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.000]   Well, and what's interesting, of course, is Google has for some time offered advertisers
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.720]   using Google's ad platform cross reference information.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.080]   This is what advertisers love.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:40.000]   Oh, and by the way, that person who saw your ad the next day charged that product at the store.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.680]   Remember when we announced that and everybody's like, "What?
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:49.280]   That's kind of creepy because I guess they're collecting the transaction information and they
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.640]   can match you up somehow to the credit card transaction."
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:16:00.720]   Well, advertisers like it because they want to know, did that person buy based on the advertisement?
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.440]   Yeah, that's everything they want.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.560]   Is it Valhalla or the Holy Grail?
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.000]   Valhalla is like heaven.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.080]   So it's, I would say it's more like the Holy Grail.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.160]   I thought I was in the same place, Leo.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.040]   I was like, "Hahaha, okay."
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.600]   Well, but it's heavenly.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.000]   It's the Hava of Apple.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:31.040]   I think they've arrived in Valhalla.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.880]   They've arrived in advertiser heaven.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.840]   I'm going to stick with it.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.640]   I'm going to stick with it.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.480]   Oh, he's going to go with Valhalla.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.760]   Uncle Valhalla.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:46.160]   That is where the heroes killed in battle in Norse mythology feast foreign eternity with Odin.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.520]   Oh, and are they waiting to take their basis?
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.040]   An endless meal with Odin?
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.200]   But aren't they waiting to come back and defend against Ragnarok?
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:55.680]   Yes.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.320]   Isn't it?
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:56.960]   Okay.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.160]   Stacey, now you're doing it.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:58.400]   See?
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.640]   And by the way, and we're talking about this on a Wednesday.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.000]   There's a new ransomware called Ragnar Locker.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.560]   Oh, well.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.200]   I like that.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.080]   I just like the name.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.200]   I don't like the ransomware.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:23.040]   With regards to this account, would you all recommend the average person to just dive in and
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.640]   use this as their accounting system bank account system?
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.400]   Or do you suggest going to Google?
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.840]   Oh, because Google will kill it three years.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.600]   Isn't that funny?
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.440]   That honestly, that is really a consideration nowadays with Google.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.840]   I don't know if I want to go all in any Google product,
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.000]   because then what happens with Google tires of it?
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.680]   Just as they did, and with that credit card, which I still have,
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.280]   but it's not useful.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:45.920]   And they didn't like--
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.960]   It's just a credit card.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.440]   Your bank-- and it's not your bank.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.640]   They're partnering with real banks.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.040]   Cities.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.320]   Or you'd have a real bank.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.320]   Your real bank account is never going to go away if you do this, right?
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.200]   And it's FDIC insured and all the good stuff that you should look for.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.760]   And it gives you the functionalities of things like Venmo with the protections
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.960]   of the financial system, which is actually kind of nice.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.960]   Banks for a long time have fought a rear guard battle against Venmo,
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.680]   with Zell, Z-E-L-L-E.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.960]   And a lot of banks use that Zell system to kind of give Venmo-like features to your bank account.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.760]   But nobody else has it, then what does it do, right?
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:29.520]   But Zell was actually-- they had a lot of fraud recently, so that's a little bit.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.000]   I like Venmo.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.120]   Everybody has Venmo.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.080]   Everybody takes Venmo.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.840]   I use Venmo all the time.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.480]   When my kids need money, I Venmo it to it.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.320]   Or cash.me is good, yeah.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.400]   That's from Square.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.280]   It's interesting.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:52.960]   I've been researching digital online-only bank accounts for some time,
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.280]   because I'm always looking to see if there's a better deal out there.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.120]   The thing when you're assessing an online bank account,
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.840]   you've got to figure out what the fees are going to be,
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.600]   what it's going to cost you if you go below a certain amount.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.360]   You may be if you have a savings account interested in what their rate is
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.000]   and the savings account and those vary widely.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.880]   So there is some consumer shopping that's appropriate before you create a bank account with anybody.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:25.200]   I usually go to Nerd Wallet, which does some reporting and rating of these kinds of things to see.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.800]   They'll at least-- there's at least a place you can go to kind of compare
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.680]   the various rates and so forth.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.560]   When you say internet or digital banking, what are you talking about?
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:40.560]   I've had an internet bank since 1998, '99.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.120]   You just thought that--
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.920]   So I used to be with Bank of America in 1980.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.480]   I started using an online bank.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.200]   It was so bad.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.960]   It was 40 characters wide.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.440]   White text on a black background was a terminal.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.480]   Even if you were using Windows in 1988, it was Windows out.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.280]   I don't know.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.600]   And then it was only all caps.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.840]   But you could do online banking.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:11.200]   What I'm talking about is not that, which is an online interface to your existing bank,
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:17.680]   but banks that have no branches, banks that have no physical place.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.120]   So that is my bank.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.640]   I have an account at first internet bank.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.680]   There are no branches.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.080]   So then the other thing that you look into if you're interested in that is,
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.600]   what about ATMs?
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.120]   Because I'm going to need cash somehow.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.760]   And there are all sorts of plans.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.840]   I actually looked at Axon Bank and I thought,
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.560]   "Oh, this looks pretty good because they had a high savings rate."
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.840]   But then I found out to get cash, I'd have to go into a 7-Eleven,
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.080]   that their ATMs were in convenience.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.360]   E-charges, $10.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.800]   And they were in convenience stores.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.440]   I have USAA, which I've had forever.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.240]   They have no branches either, but they do the right thing.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.200]   And this is what I would look for is, I can use any ATM.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   And they refund the ATM fee.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.880]   You want to?
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.560]   So first internet does that.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.440]   That's good.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.880]   That's the kind of thing to look for.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.960]   And I presume there's no fee checking.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.040]   No fee checking.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.600]   I mean, right now all savings rates are just...
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.080]   You could shop around though.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.480]   There are some savings rates as high as 1%.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.040]   But yeah, it's not enough to write whole entire banking account.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.680]   But would I, so would you say digital banking though?
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.880]   I'm thinking of much more modern things like, again, Venmo,
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:29.200]   even PayPal, although now we're, you know.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.960]   But a little bit more like...
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.720]   Venmo is owned by PayPal, incidentally.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.280]   Oh, I know.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.080]   So you are using PayPal.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.440]   Yeah, no, I think the...
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.920]   You want to use what the most people are using, right?
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.720]   Because if they...
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.720]   If you're using Venmo, everybody has to use it.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.480]   If you want to pay them and you want them to pay you,
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.120]   you use cash, the cash app.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.880]   And you find that most of the people you work...
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.680]   Most of my circle use this cash app.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.040]   And then they use Venmo.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.920]   But I like cash app because I was able to get a debit card to use.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.240]   Wow.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.560]   And if I want to do shopping online,
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.200]   I usually pay with that particular burner card.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.440]   I got a bunch of burner cards and cash app actually offers one.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.200]   One of the reasons there is this churn of all this stuff
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.640]   that people are really interested is that back in 2007,
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.760]   Vodafone created an electronic banking system called M-Pesa in Africa.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.360]   And M-Pesa was a huge success.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.520]   Now this was in an area where people had smartphones,
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.600]   but they didn't tend to have bank accounts.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.760]   Or broadband.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.040]   Or broadband.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:37.920]   So it was really...
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.080]   It took off because suddenly they could do all this banking stuff
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.120]   they could never do before.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.080]   And M-Pesa was such a success.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.480]   It spawned some follow-ons in other areas.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.120]   And I think that we've been the...
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.000]   And as is often the case when you have existing infrastructure.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.440]   You're slower to adopt the latest, greatest stuff.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.760]   But now you're starting to see, I think, a lot of institutions.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.240]   And it makes sense that Apple and Google would be in this too,
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.360]   trying to create these kinds of payment systems.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.600]   But if there's this many...
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.640]   And they don't talk to one another,
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.560]   that it's like the early days of email
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.320]   where you could email people at MCI, but not on AOL.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.760]   We need to federate these somehow.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.720]   And I try to put my credit card on my card.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.760]   It's good.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.320]   Go ahead, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:30.400]   No, I was just trying to put my credit card onto Google Pay.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.000]   And I never got the confirmation number for my bank.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.640]   And I couldn't do it.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.880]   And there was no help, there was no nothing.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.520]   Some banks don't...
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.320]   Don't say the word.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.320]   Oh, I will see...
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.600]   I see that and I will raise you the fact that I called
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.200]   when I tried to put my credit card into Google Pay.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.320]   It was like, "Oh, this is weird.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.840]   We're going to have to have you call your bank."
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.080]   And I was like, "All right, I'll call my bank."
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.960]   My bank was like, "You have no idea what's happening."
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.400]   They were like, "Okay, give me...
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.120]   I spent two hours, three different people,
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.280]   and the end result was, call us back tomorrow,
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.400]   because this really should work.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.680]   And we don't know why it's not."
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.560]   And I never called back.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:12.720]   So...
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.160]   Yeah, it doesn't help.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.200]   I know it's fair and confident.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:15.360]   It's just...
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.400]   ...are enough to help you.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.080]   Very interesting.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.200]   So Google...
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.280]   But you nailed it.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.520]   And that was a city bank card, by the way.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.200]   Wow.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:27.840]   You nailed it.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.040]   When you said Google's done this before and pulled out,
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.920]   they actually did it before Apple did Apple Pay.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.920]   So long time ago.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.880]   I was going to trust that.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.520]   I remember it was so long ago.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:44.000]   I remember still having the Logitech review Google TV at the time.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.200]   That's how it was.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.480]   That was the one, the keyboard, right?
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.800]   That was a piece of crap.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.680]   [laughter]
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.120]   Memories.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.560]   So...
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.920]   Oh, can we talk about Google Photos?
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.040]   Are we done with this story?
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.960]   Yes, we're done with this story.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.960]   That is the Google Change Log.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.120]   Oh, it's not.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:03.280]   No.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:08.320]   So Google has pissed off a lot of people by announcing.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:14.400]   We are not going to continue to make Google Photos for free.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.640]   You have until June of next year.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.800]   Anything you put up there now or all the way up until June will continue to be stored on Google
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.640]   Photos free forever.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:31.280]   But after that, when you upload stuff, it will be charged against your Google Drive
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.560]   or Google One account.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.760]   So you'll have to have...
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.120]   You get 15 gigs free, but if it's more than that, you'll be paying for it.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.000]   It's not expensive, about $99, 400 gigabytes.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.800]   I pay $10 a month for my Google One account.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.400]   That's two terabytes of storage.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.480]   So that's so I can store original photos you've always had to pay for that,
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.520]   unless you had a Pixel phone.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:58.160]   One zero, Willa Ramis says, "Google Photos just made the case for breaking a big tech."
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.880]   That seems a little bit of an overreaction.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.920]   Anybody want to...
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.280]   Yeah, that was my reaction.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.240]   It was overreaction.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.200]   And then I read it.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:15.280]   There was a point there about having killed other photos that could be an opening today
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.840]   that aren't there because you couldn't compete with free Google.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:24.960]   And okay, so I'm seeing this in PlayOut in the IoT space,
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.120]   which I'm glad that Will brought this up,
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.680]   because talking to executives who have smart products for the home,
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.640]   they talk about their cloud costs, which is a huge component of...
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.920]   Not a huge.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.920]   It is an ongoing though commitment on every product they sell.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.040]   But Google and Amazon can subsidize those costs.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.320]   Right.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:50.640]   They don't have the same pressures to come up with a subscription plan or
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:56.400]   to charge higher prices upfront on their connected device products.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.240]   And so I'm with them on this.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.680]   I'm like, yeah, there's something to be said for like...
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.720]   I mean, it's like the heroin model, right?
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.760]   You give people, you get people...
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.000]   Well, let me argue the other way.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.800]   Because it wasn't, in fact, Google and Amazon to put them out of business,
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:21.200]   it just does this was never a viable business unless you could subsidize it with other stuff.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.560]   I don't think that's true.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.840]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.280]   So I used a lot of these services I used ever picks.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.240]   I bought a device, there was a physical device.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.920]   They all went out of business.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.800]   But one of them, Picture Life, was using AWS to store it.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:42.640]   Its costs were in the first year, more than a million dollars to store these photos.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.640]   It reminds me of the ice cream store down the street.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.600]   Guy rented a place, started an ice cream store.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.880]   What he didn't count on was the huge expense of keeping the ice cream cold.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:59.120]   He went out of business as soon as summer hit, because he couldn't afford the freezers.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.200]   And you have to consider, when you start a business like this,
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.680]   that there is a significant run rate for storage.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.520]   I mean, YouTube doesn't make any sense if you're not Google.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.720]   Right?
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.200]   I mean, I know...
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.000]   Everybody thought it was insane, only Google could buy it.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.440]   That was the opposite, right?
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.080]   They could only make YouTube if it got bought by Google.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:18.400]   Right.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:25.840]   But on the other hand, another way to look at this is, what is the revenue going to be from this?
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.680]   When they get the photo, it's going to be de minimis,
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.760]   and they're going to have pissed off people and affected the brand,
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.200]   and given antitrust people something else to complain about.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.640]   Is this really going to be worth it in the end?
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.800]   It's going to be tiny revenue, isn't it?
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.520]   Yeah, probably.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.880]   Although, how much does it cost for them to do Google Photos?
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.720]   Was, I think, in the early days, the benefit was, we assumed,
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.200]   it was the AI training that they were getting.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:47.760]   Glory and set.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.240]   Right.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.840]   But they can't keep doing that.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.480]   Like they did that with one of their phone services early on.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.920]   4-1-1, Google 4-1-1.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:54.160]   Right.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.880]   We're going to give you a service until we learn enough of them.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.760]   But they said that.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.640]   They actually set that up front with Google 4-1-1.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.120]   That's true.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:01.600]   That's true.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.400]   But it was clear to me.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.080]   Why is it a problem for Google to say,
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.800]   "You know what? We need to drop this free service,
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.560]   because we want to make money off of it."
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.080]   Well, we can't afford not to.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.880]   I mean, because--
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.680]   What's wrong with that?
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.280]   I think one here has a very nice--
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:15.280]   Right.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.520]   --is to say, "You know what? We can add one more--
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:17.920]   I agree.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.240]   --line on the counting side of things,
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.160]   and have some more money coming in.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.000]   So why not do it?
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.600]   So it is the--
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.160]   There's a--
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:28.640]   There's a large--
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.760]   The real argument is that that's classic monopolistic behavior.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.000]   That's what Amazon is doing to bookstores.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.560]   You undercut all the brick and mortar stores
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:37.360]   till they go out of business,
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.800]   and then you raise the prices.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.120]   That Google undercut all the photo storage companies
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.240]   till they went out of business,
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.440]   and they raised the prices.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.800]   My only counter to that is,
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.040]   I don't know if they had a viable business
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.680]   with or without Google competing with.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.400]   It depends on--
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.560]   I mean, the question isn't--
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.600]   I mean, if you look at it that way,
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.280]   think of it like dumping, right?
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.080]   Does it cost--
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:56.960]   It's like dumping.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.520]   Right.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.720]   But is it--
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.160]   Dumping is wrong,
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.200]   because they're selling it at less than it costs them, right?
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.000]   So if Google is selling this for less than it costs,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.720]   it costs them, then it is driving people out of the market.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.320]   And it is kind of dumping.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.640]   Well, pretty much every free service that we use--
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.160]   Not necessarily like--
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.240]   Well, yeah, because it's your ad.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.240]   I mean, we're talking about how to get away from that
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:20.880]   and pay for that.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.080]   And Kevin is actually--
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.280]   So is Facebook Maps?
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.480]   Is Facebook doing that?
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.680]   Is Facebook dumping?
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.160]   No, Facebook created something new that didn't exist.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.040]   Google maps and ways--
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:31.520]   That's not true.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.400]   --friends turn to these--
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.040]   Everybody's Facebook--
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.400]   Everybody's Facebook existed before Google--
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.160]   before Facebook existed.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.320]   But they, incidentally, were free as well.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.080]   Well, they were free as well, as I would say.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:46.240]   And to your question, I think it's a cost-benefit analysis.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.240]   So we make an amount of revenue.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:53.600]   Is it worth it for Google given one animosity from customers
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.160]   to the public, or we say they're stuck with us to act with them?
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.000]   And then two, the bigger issue to me is I would think the policy people--
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.200]   Do you want to do this right now in the middle of this antitrust stuff, really?
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:03.520]   Yeah, it does.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.760]   You're going to get to wait a few months, the year maybe?
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.400]   Yeah, it does make that-- it's a harder argument.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:13.120]   Do you think the stakeholders and shareholders care about antitrust?
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.560]   They care about that bottom line.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.720]   They should care about antitrust, because the bottom line gets affected if they get broken up.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.440]   Actually, maybe not.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.080]   There's another argument.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.400]   Maybe not.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.120]   They get five stocks.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.680]   They're going to get their cash and run.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.000]   They care less once the lawsuit comes in.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   But right now, they want to see their money go up.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.600]   It's greed.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.480]   There's an argument that says that a breakup will be good for the stakeholders.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.880]   They'll end up with more than five stocks that are worth more than single stock.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.280]   Part or a company to run and it loses--
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.640]   Synergy.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.680]   --benefits to the consumers.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.080]   Synergies.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.040]   --loses benefits to us.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:45.600]   Yes.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.320]   Synergies.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.440]   Well, you lose the synergies.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:53.120]   There's this synergy that makes Google Photos viable as a free service, as it has been for 10 years,
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.760]   because Google gets other benefits.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:01.520]   It's just like Android's essentially free, because Google makes money on the advertising.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:10.240]   So, yeah, I mean, it's a really-- I don't know what the legal arguments are.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:16.240]   It may be-- we need an antitrust lawyer could say, well, that doesn't let you off the hook,
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.080]   or that does let you off the hook, because none of these companies--
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.320]   It's all really popular in antitrust anyway.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:22.640]   Right.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.320]   None of these companies were really viable, because they didn't have that synergy.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.200]   They just never made sense forever, Pics.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:29.840]   It's a good argument.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.720]   You make it go up.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.760]   You call me down, Elliot.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.640]   [chuckles]
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.960]   And then the other thing is, it isn't this for--
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.760]   if you use a Pixel, none of this applies to you, right?
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.840]   You take those photos and send them out there.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:39.840]   No, that isn't.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.440]   They changed that plan, though, right?
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.800]   Yeah, until sometime in 2021, I thought, right?
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:46.720]   I can't remember.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.040]   Okay.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:52.960]   So initially, when you bought a Pixel up to the Pixel 3, up through the Pixel 3,
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.000]   you had unlimited original photo storage.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.960]   Correct.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.320]   Okay. Everybody had unlimited JPEG storage.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.240]   You had unlimited original photo storage.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.640]   I don't know what-- what is the promise for Pixel 4 and 5?
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.840]   Is it still that?
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.320]   No.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.120]   They dropped that.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.160]   Oh, I thought it was still just a JPEG high res.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.280]   But everybody has that.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.040]   That's like the Aaron Rodgers discount.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.560]   Everybody gets it.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.520]   [chuckles]
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.240]   See, I knew you'd get it, and I knew these guys don't want to trip off.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:20.960]   But I knew you'd get it.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:21.280]   Go, go.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:21.760]   Go.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.800]   [chuckles]
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.360]   [chuckles]
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.640]   Um, but I looked at this no differently from--
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:33.120]   the likes of, say, YouTube and Hulu both have their TV services.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:39.280]   And YouTube comes out and say, "Hey, our rate is going to be $10 a month," or whatever.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:39.680]   Oh, wait.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.240]   No, this is--
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.280]   Who comes around and says, "You know what?
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.720]   We're going to do $8 a month."
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:48.320]   And then, half a-- you know, six months later, the rate goes up for both of those entities,
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.680]   because they can do it.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:55.040]   So Google confirmed Pixel 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 would all retain
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.680]   free Google photos, storage forever going forward, forever until they change it.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.800]   Right.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.480]   Don't they sit until sometime in 2021?
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.840]   Yes, this is important.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.480]   No, that's for people who are not Pixel owners.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.280]   Yeah, that--
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.400]   So, in June 2021, everybody else is losing the free.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.240]   In part, because some of these devices have lifetime guarantees for free storage,
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.200]   which was used in marketing the device, so they can't really--
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.400]   So, they're just talking about the backup.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.720]   If you have a Pixel 5 device earlier, your current backup quality options and benefits remain
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.440]   unchanged.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.880]   Uploads in high quality from your Pixel's 2 through 5 devices will continue to receive
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.400]   unlimited free storage.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:37.920]   Photos and videos backed up from other devices in high quality after June 1st, 2021
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.040]   will start to count toward your Google account storage.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:41.600]   Is that--
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:48.160]   So, that actually could tie into the antitrust stuff, because basically, they're penalizing
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.600]   anybody who doesn't buy their hardware.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.160]   Because they're wearing their phones.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:54.400]   Yeah, your rights, Stacy, but they probably are actually cursing them that they did make
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.480]   their promise, so it's actually against them.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:02.960]   And can a company not offer a benefit to buyers of their product with that?
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.800]   Yes, they can't have any trust issue.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.160]   They can offer that benefit.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.520]   Look, you bought our product.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.160]   We're going to give you--
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.080]   This is part of what you get when you buy our product.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.120]   Yes, it's not antitrust.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:15.600]   It does get into that Apple-y lock-in feeling, though, that I so low.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:20.000]   But feelings, as I've said so many times, are not illegal.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.560]   Really?
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.680]   At either rate, don't depend on Google Photos for your precious--
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.080]   We've talked about this many times.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.280]   You know, the Google death watch.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.880]   Google continually harms their reputation long-term.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:37.440]   And it makes it-- I would imagine, we just had two stories in a row, one that
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:42.480]   nest outage, and then this story, that make people think, maybe I shouldn't invest in a
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.080]   Google ecosystem product.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.560]   Oh, and actually, you could say Google pays similar, because they had a
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.000]   watch or they had a credit card that apparently died that Ants rolled
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.040]   totem around to this day.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.360]   Yep.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.560]   Yep.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.680]   So--
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.560]   So Joe, trust Google.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.080]   Yeah, I don't-- do you think-- I mean, certainly somebody at Google is
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.080]   responsible for thinking about things like that?
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.360]   Or maybe not.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.960]   It is convenient to have the full resolution of my--
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:17.680]   particularly the videos that I would film with the phone just go up and be stored.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.320]   But--
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:18.960]   Oh, God. Are you kidding?
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.760]   I have a system in place when I get back to the desk.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.880]   They're coming down.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.760]   Well, as--
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:28.320]   I can't-- well, there's Chris Markhart, one of our-- one of my contributors on the tech,
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.920]   I said, "Oh, gee, now you have to buy a hard drive."
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.360]   Like a normal person backing up their data.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:42.240]   Oh, you know, the premise was, "Oh, you don't have to buy a hard drive.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.000]   We'll back it up for you forever."
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.520]   But that really wasn't tenable.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.200]   And so you have to--
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.160]   Let me go find my zip drives.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.000]   So you have to back up your data.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.160]   You still have to do it for every other kind of data.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.840]   Why should photos be something special?
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.440]   And on the other hand, if you have Amazon Prime,
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.680]   you have unlimited original storage on Amazon Prime.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:05.360]   Shutterfly, which is-- see, this is another-- see, here's a perfect example.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.600]   Free photo storage with Shutterfly.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.280]   How can they make that work?
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:13.520]   Because they do prints and calendars and mouse pads out of your photos.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.760]   So they figure, "Well, if you store your photos here,
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.520]   it's a lot more likely that you will order stuff from us,
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.800]   and that will pay for the storage."
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.720]   I mean, storage is cheap.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.160]   Nobody wants those Google calendars, though.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.600]   I just got two Shutterfly calendars.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.360]   I made a scrapbook.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.600]   Let's see.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.440]   Oh, Kevin has piped in to say,
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.840]   "If we have to pay for Google Photos as a service,
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.880]   then they shouldn't get to use or keep the data," which is his two six.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.360]   I agree.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.560]   Just like with G Suite.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.920]   Oh, don't pre-umpt G Suite, Kevin.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.520]   But-- oh, no.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.640]   Don't forget that.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.120]   But that's right.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.840]   But that would be starting June 1st and going forward.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.800]   I have 60,000 plus photos stored on there,
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.080]   which are still going to be there.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.960]   And that's still for free.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.280]   So in that case, they can use that data, right?
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.480]   So Kevin's point is really that from June 1st forward,
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:07.840]   anything you store on Google Photos should not be used
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:12.160]   to gather, you know, to do machine language training or machine training.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.640]   But I think that they said that they weren't going to do that in fact.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:20.240]   I do believe I read that somewhere that they were going to--
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.160]   maybe I'm mistaken.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.800]   Well, and they do learning on your own photos too.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:28.400]   So like one of the services they offer is I can type in my name
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:33.600]   and I get pictures of me, which is actually pretty cool.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.680]   I'm going to still use Google Photos for that reason alone.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.800]   The automatic categorization is really, really useful.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.320]   And it's very effective, very good.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.640]   So Kevin, we do get something for that.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.520]   That's kind of the traditional Google tit for TAT.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:50.880]   We'll beef up our services based on your data,
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.120]   but in return, we'll give you those services for free.
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:56.320]   I think that's a fair trade and now it's more explicit.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:01.600]   Google is potentially being sued.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.120]   I don't even know what to make of this one.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.560]   They're trying to get a class action together.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.640]   A suit filed in the federal court in San Jose.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:16.240]   Because apparently Google Android phones mysteriously.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:22.880]   Even when they're not on Wi-Fi, without any applications running,
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:28.080]   will upload about eight or nine megabytes a day of data to Google.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:36.480]   And the lawsuit says you're basically costing us money on our cell data.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.520]   Because we're not getting any benefit.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.520]   This is just stuff being uploaded to Google.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.480]   I haven't seen a response from Google on this yet.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.160]   I don't know what it could be.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.640]   Well, why is Google doing this?
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.200]   That's what was being transmitted in that article.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.000]   Well, didn't.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.080]   Now they did have a bunch of stories,
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.880]   and I didn't read them because I get value out of them,
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.960]   but how to turn off the smart features and Gmail,
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.880]   so they're not using quite so much data.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.240]   Some of it may be something as simple as, you know,
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.760]   just trying to preload things so they load faster, for example,
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.280]   or pre-download stuff.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:17.840]   The attorneys for the plaintiffs took a brand new Galaxy S7 with Android,
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:21.840]   signed into a Google account with its default settings,
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.360]   and then let it sit without a Wi-Fi connection.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:29.840]   And they found that 94% of the communications about it,
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:34.400]   nine megabytes a day of data were sent or were between Google back and forth.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.480]   They didn't say whether uploaded or downloaded.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.080]   It sounds like, oh yeah, the device with all apps closed,
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:44.800]   transferred data, transferred data to Google about 16 times an hour.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.080]   Oh, okay.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.840]   And it's saying that a lot of this is log files for network availability,
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.280]   the apps and OS metrics.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:41:02.240]   So yeah, this is nothing essential to be continued.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:11.440]   And I'm going to guess, I haven't read down anybody has the agreements you agree to when you start using it.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:17.600]   Phone, I'm going to get somewhere in there that says you agree to provide us with information,
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.880]   help us improve our services or something like that.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:25.280]   I read a term that you can do recently, but it wasn't Google's, it was Instagrams.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.520]   Yeah, I know why because you're a photographer.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:33.040]   But there's many pages you have to read in the terms of service, the privacy policy,
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.480]   the managed Google Play agreement and the Google Play terms of service.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:42.560]   According to the attorneys did read them, they said, none of them disclose that Google spends
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.600]   users cellular data allowances for these background transfers.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:53.280]   Well, and this might just be stupid, not stupidity, but this might be a lack of understanding
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.880]   about how some people really monitor their data plans.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:01.840]   So if you're Google and you're an engineer thinking about this, you're probably not thinking,
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:06.880]   hey, we should only transfer this data over Wi-Fi when people are on that network because it's
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.680]   expensive, because they're maybe not thinking about data in terms of--
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.280]   That's exactly right.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.280]   Hey, let's take a little break. We got lots more to talk about.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.680]   See, it's been all Google all the time.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.720]   See, yeah.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:24.160]   And boy, that pay story was not changelogworthy.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:29.280]   I guess it wasn't because there were a lot of ins and outs.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.680]   So yes, I guess so.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.720]   Maybe not as many as we made it out to have the beginning.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.720]   Our confusion.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.080]   It was not sittling.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:38.880]   I'll agree with that.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:44.720]   We'll have more with Stacey, Ant, and Jeff in just a second.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.040]   Our show today brought to you by ESET.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:52.880]   For over 30 years, ESET E-S-E-T has been a global leader in cybersecurity.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.440]   It's the provider we rely on here at Twitch.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:59.680]   Yes, I didn't even know we were using ESET, but that's one of the beauties of ESET.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.800]   It's so lightweight.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.840]   It's so transparent.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.960]   You won't know you're running it.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:07.680]   Our managed service provider, our IT guy Russell, puts it on all the machines.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:13.760]   Even the machines that need every CPU cycle possible, every ounce of RAM possible,
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.520]   like our editor's machines, because of course, it's a small business.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.280]   The last thing we need is ransomware.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.520]   We need enterprise-grade security, but we can't afford to have it slow us down.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.600]   That's why we love ESET.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:32.800]   An ESET can block everything, even zero days, because they use something called the dynamic
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.920]   threat defense.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.080]   This is so smart.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:41.040]   It's another layer of security for ESET products like Endpoint and Mail Security,
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:48.560]   a cloud-based sandboxing technology to detect and stop never-before-seen threats.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.720]   There's always kind of the Achilles heel of any virus products,
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.040]   is if they don't know about a virus, they can't stop it.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.400]   We'll not with ESET and their dynamic threat defense.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:03.680]   When you get an attachment in your email or a suspicious program downloaded,
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.760]   it says, "Whoa, hold on.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.360]   Takes it, puts it up in the cloud in a sandboxed thing."
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.480]   Box, I guess I would say, and runs it.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.200]   It executes it and analyzes it.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:20.640]   And then if it's malicious, it stops it cold all before it reaches you or your network.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.240]   Dynamic threat defense.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:28.640]   It's just one more reason to use the layered security that ESET offers in a lightweight package.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.560]   And Russell loves it because of the ESET Security Management Center,
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:37.040]   which gives him a real-time overview of every endpoint on or off-prem.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:43.760]   We've got a lot of work from home employees now, but they all are protected by ESET, even off-site.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:48.080]   There's full reporting, automated security management for all operating systems,
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.200]   and Russell can access it whenever he is online.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.720]   He gets around.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:53.920]   In fact, that's one of the nice things.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.040]   He said you can get it on-prem or in the cloud.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.720]   You can buy it directly from ESET.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:02.080]   You can do as we do get it through your managed service provider.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.840]   There's an ESET reseller program too.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.680]   Just find the option that works for you and protect yourself.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.560]   We've been using this.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.080]   It turns out, without even, I didn't even know, for years,
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:16.480]   trusted by thousands of state and local governments, top universities,
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.240]   and enterprises worldwide.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.440]   And if you have compliance requirements in your industry, don't worry.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.000]   ESET meets those requirements.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.400]   Whether you take credit cards with PCI,
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.520]   handle customer financial transactions, GLBA,
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:32.880]   or if you're processing healthcare data, it's HIPAA compliant too.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.600]   Your employees are your first line of defense,
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.520]   so if you have a remote workforce checkout, ESET's remote workforce bundle for advanced
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.360]   ransomware and business data protection,
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.360]   along with other bundles that ESET offers,
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:47.520]   protect your employees no matter where you or they are.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.520]   They get top reviews from independent testing labs for minimum system impact
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.920]   and extremely accurate detection.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:55.440]   They're perfect for our small business.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.280]   I bet they're perfect for yours too.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:01.200]   ESET really understands the needs and concerns of SMB.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.480]   So trust ESET to future-proof your business.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.520]   There's an interactive demo waiting for you and a free trial
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.480]   when you go to try.eset.com/twit.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:16.320]   t-r-y dot es-e-t dot com slash t-w-i-t
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.440]   to get your free trial and interactive demo.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.800]   Thank you ESET for protecting us all this time.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.080]   And I didn't even know it.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.840]   try.eset.com slash t-w-it.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.640]   Uh, let's see here.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.080]   The next G is here.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.160]   You thought 5G was cool.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.760]   What do you see next G?
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:45.200]   And Google and Apple, among many others, are joining the next G Alliance.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.360]   Stacy, tell us all about 6G.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:52.160]   Silence.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.760]   Silence.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.560]   Stacy wants to cook you.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:58.080]   Stacy says, I don't want to talk about this.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.280]   6G.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.840]   I saw this and I said, not yet.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.880]   I will not read about this.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.480]   No, no, no, no.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.160]   Well, because this is not the Wi-Fi 6G.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.480]   This is actually the cellular 6G.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:15.200]   Correct.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.800]   And so the bandwidth not yet licensed,
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.920]   it will not be around until 2030.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:24.480]   So don't worry about it.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:28.640]   So, I mean, it's the time for normal,
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.520]   like it's the time for engineers to start thinking about this.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:35.920]   You do start thinking about your next G about 10 years more.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:36.560]   It's due.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.440]   You really do.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.640]   Because all these guys, what's notable here,
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.640]   this also happened with 5G,
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:45.520]   but the rest of the world was late.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.000]   But this is no longer just a cellular thing.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.640]   They used to be the 3GPP was all the cellular carriers
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:51.680]   and they got together and they were like,
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.000]   like I was writing about 4G
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.520]   and seeing demos and tests of that, you know.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.360]   2005.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.480]   Probably four.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:04.000]   Yeah, four or five years before it even made it into phones, right?
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.880]   So there's a lot of work that needs to happen.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:11.440]   And every G, it gets even more complicated in terms of,
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.720]   like 5G is incredibly complicated because of the multiple antennas
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.880]   that it can go across different spectrum bands.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:20.320]   So it makes sense that we're talking about this now.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:23.840]   But for most normal people, don't even worry about it.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.160]   The engineers are meeting.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.800]   In fact, the first meeting is this week.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.080]   But listen to who's in it.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:30.880]   I mean, it is your right.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.440]   It's not just cellular carriers,
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.480]   charter, communications, Cisco, HP,
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.560]   Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Intel,
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.480]   Keysight, LG Electronics,
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:44.560]   VMware, AT&T Bell Canada,
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:46.480]   Sienna, Erickson, Facebook.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:52.240]   I mean, Microsoft, Nokia, Qualcomm, Samsung, T-Mobile.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.000]   So it's all the carriers plus.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:54.960]   It's the hardware and manufacturing.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:02.480]   And you know, we got to plan because the world does not stand still.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.240]   Right.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:08.640]   And you know, who's going to need these high definition TVs?
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.920]   Was that what you were saying, Liz?
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:13.040]   I said, no one will ever want to have a TV
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:15.040]   that's more than 400 lines.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.480]   That's crazy talk.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:20.720]   I talked to some people at cable labs
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.640]   about the next gen TV.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.640]   It's actually kind of cool.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.360]   Is it AK?
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.960]   No.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.480]   It's a different filming technique.
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:30.800]   Oh.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.760]   For a more immersive experience.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.120]   Oh, it's high frame rate, high dynamic range.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:37.760]   Yes.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.160]   Yes.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:38.880]   All of that.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.000]   And I don't like it.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:40.640]   I don't like it.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.760]   I'm like, how many TVs will that be in a so far?
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.840]   Remember when they did the, what did they?
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:52.240]   So there was a movie, Ang Lee did a movie called Billy Lee's,
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.400]   Billy Swan's long halftime walk.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.600]   Did you ever watch that movie?
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.240]   Wasn't Lord of the Rings in 60p?
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.120]   I think, yeah, I think you're right, Lord of the Rings was.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.960]   In fact, people were saying Gandalf's wand,
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:07.360]   when it's 60 frames a second, looks like it's made out of,
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.640]   it's made out of resin and was purchased at Wands R Us.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.400]   It looks because when they filmed it,
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:19.760]   it was 24 frames and it was a little smeary and it looked real.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:24.400]   But at 60 frames, man, you can see every hair as it's glued onto his face.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.960]   It's not Billy Lynn's long halftime walk.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:31.040]   If you ever want to see what hyper realistic filmmaking is,
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.960]   it's promised you, you can't really see it on a regular TV.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.480]   But it was high frame rate, high dynamic range.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:42.320]   Ang Lee didn't let his actors wear makeup.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:50.160]   He shot them very tight and it's like the actors in the room and it's really creepy.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.960]   It's super creepy.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:56.320]   It just took you out of the movie entirely.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:01.280]   And it really shows how much we think of a film as being 24 frames.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.560]   It's a little bit dreamy.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:05.280]   It's a little bit unreal.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.680]   And if it's too real, it's not a film.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.560]   It's creepy.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:12.000]   It's gotten to the next one.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:12.880]   It's Danny Valley.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:13.200]   It is.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.800]   It's too canny.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.040]   It's like too can, Sam.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:24.560]   Although when you play in video games, you want that high frame rate, right?
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.680]   In fact, that's the big thing.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:32.320]   Oculus 2, the Quest 2 is 90 frames finally to match the vibe and others.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.360]   And the higher frame rates better.
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.080]   But I'll tell you, high frame rate in a movie.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.840]   I think I'm the only person that didn't mind it.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.520]   Did you see it though?
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.880]   Did you see it in high frame rate?
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.560]   It's a old person versus young person.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:47.440]   Because there's very few theaters that can show it in that frame rate.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.440]   I didn't see it.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:55.120]   I never went to the theaters unless it was Star Wars or Black Panther.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:57.360]   Yeah, it's high frame rate.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:01.360]   Like if someone's watching soap operas, it doesn't bother me.
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.760]   I like how crispy it looks.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.360]   There's so much.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.400]   It's so proper effect.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:12.000]   You'll notice some of the people on YouTube are doing 6P on summer day videos.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.360]   And it looks pretty good to me, but all of the comments are complaining about it being too real
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:17.920]   for them.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:18.880]   But I love it myself.
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:22.880]   There's two problems with high frame rate.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:28.560]   One is that some TV, almost all TVs now, will do frame interpolation to get,
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.960]   to take the 30 frames and make it 120.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.560]   Or 240 even.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.480]   And that really does have that soap operas effect.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:39.680]   It looks very strange because they're faking it by interpolating frames.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.600]   That's a negative.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:42.480]   That's a bad effect.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.080]   And Holly was lobbying against that.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.040]   They say turn off frame interpolation.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:50.160]   But then there's the natively shot at 60 or 120.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.400]   And I agree with you.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:58.320]   If it's a documentary kind of thing, if it's recording real life,
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.320]   that's fine.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.800]   It's when it's doing a story, a movie as in like a Hollywood story,
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:08.480]   it's kind of it's disconcertingly real.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:13.440]   Would you not consider it like you're looking at a Broadway play or something?
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.600]   Yeah, except you're right there.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.680]   You're looking at Broadway play.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.080]   Yeah, right.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:18.560]   You're on stage.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.600]   No, you're watching Hamilton in 120 frames for a second.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.080]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:22.080]   That's true.
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.520]   It looks outstanding.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.600]   Not that I'm watching Hamilton, but that's true.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.760]   Why aren't you watching Hamilton?
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:28.960]   He doesn't like Hamilton.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.360]   I'm not a musical person.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.160]   I like music.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.000]   Love music, but musicals never really did it for me.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.680]   Oh, Hamilton's not a musical.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.160]   It's just...
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.120]   Yeah, it is.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.560]   Okay, it's a musical, but it's the best.
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:41.600]   I was like, yeah, it is Leo.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:42.640]   It's a musical plus.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:44.720]   It's so much better.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:49.680]   That's like saying, I don't know, a German chocolate cake is just a cake.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.200]   It's like saying, I like Popeye's chicken, but not on a sandwich.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:55.920]   I mean, well, we know who says that.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:00.960]   That's like saying, "Caccio and Pepe's just spaghetti dinner."
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.160]   That's...
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:04.560]   Jammerby.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:08.160]   Still in trouble with me, Jammerby.
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.040]   Still.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.520]   And they're out of a school.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.400]   Cammerby could use that.
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.440]   We're in a cadre of Pepe crisis, I hope you know.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:15.680]   What?
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.840]   Yeah, it's not in.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.880]   They ship it from Italy.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:19.440]   Very disturbed.
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:22.880]   COVID's another casualty of COVID.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.720]   You want a fun little story?
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:29.840]   Yes.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.920]   L'Oreal.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:32.880]   Where did I put it here?
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.280]   A line 200.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.240]   Because you're worth it?
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.320]   Because you're worth it.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.760]   No, because you are.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.920]   Because you are worth it, baby.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.480]   L'Oreal.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.520]   Oh, interesting.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:48.240]   He's introducing AR makeup.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.600]   Because obviously, the problem with the business,
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:51.520]   I saw somebody today on Twitter say,
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.000]   "My makeup's all gonna expire before I have to use it."
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.600]   There are another friend says, "No, I gotta...
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:56.160]   True."
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.080]   I gotta do it in the Zoom meetings.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:02.480]   And then I see L'Oreal announces the first digital makeup line.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:05.920]   It's purely for online.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.560]   It is for AR.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.520]   Oh, it's AR.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:13.520]   It's a Snapchat filter.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.720]   They're not gonna be working on this right now.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.080]   It's a Snapchat filter.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:20.000]   It is, but L'Oreal's making a business out of it.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:20.400]   Kind of.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.920]   Shh, sector.
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:22.720]   Are people really...
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:22.960]   So...
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:25.520]   Okay.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:29.280]   [laughs]
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.000]   This is the moment when even Stacey feels old.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:32.640]   Breathe, Stacey.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:33.520]   No, no, are people...
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:34.640]   Like, I'm not breathing.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.040]   I'm just...
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.000]   I'm just thinking about it.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.960]   I'm like, "Would I pay for this?"
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.240]   I mean, I own...
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.360]   I pay...
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:43.520]   I spend crazy amounts that you wouldn't know what to look at me,
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.680]   but I have quite the makeup drawer.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:48.480]   And every now and then, I will go crazy with fun,
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.160]   like euphoria-esque makeup and mawigs.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.400]   But...
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:59.520]   I'm just trying to think if people...
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:05.600]   Like, if the effect is good enough on a zoom or whatever,
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.920]   that it's gonna handle...
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:11.680]   Like, I mean, fake makeup looks weird when you move.
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:12.240]   Like the filter's like...
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.280]   Holy cow.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:13.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.360]   They're using it...
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.400]   It's Snapcam.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.600]   It's Snapcam.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:19.120]   Yeah, Snapcam.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:21.680]   So it's just some Snapcam filters.
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.880]   That's what this is just a gimmick.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.080]   It raises interesting questions.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:24.640]   It's a gimmick.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:25.520]   It's all it is a gimmick.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:28.000]   But will L'Oreal...
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.520]   What Stacy said in turn...
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.840]   Will L'Oreal be in a makeup company and value...
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:37.200]   Hey, Leo, you're a guy who buys fake hay, so let's not get to...
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.560]   No, you want to know what L'Oreal's business opportunity is?
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.960]   I saw it at CES and I think it's freaking baller.
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.000]   This was last year.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.200]   Do you want to know or not?
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:45.920]   Yeah, it's freaking...
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:46.480]   Who baller?
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.600]   You're trying to act young again.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:47.920]   Go ahead.
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:52.800]   If she were trying to act young, she would say it's
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:53.600]   hella baller.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.960]   I'm just saying.
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:59.440]   I think that's like acting like you're from California or Seattle.
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.000]   I don't know.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.680]   This is MOS.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:04.000]   Makeup as a service, says Zephyr.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:10.400]   This is a personalized compact that you take your picture,
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.640]   you get all the information about your face,
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.000]   and then it will...
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:14.480]   It...
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.600]   There are color cartridges and it will make the color for you
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.200]   so you can apply it for that day.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.040]   3V.
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:21.440]   Yes.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.160]   So it's kind of like...
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.240]   I mean, it's personalized makeup.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:30.960]   It's like the bar robots where you stick your beverages
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.880]   and your condiments or whatever.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:33.600]   And then it...
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   A personalized cocktail.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.640]   You hadn't yet bar.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.120]   I think...
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.560]   Or for your skin treatments.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.880]   This is actually brilliant because if you think about it,
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:47.120]   half of the Snapchat videos,
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:51.200]   Facebook Reels, Instagram Reels, Facebook...
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:54.080]   Half of them have Snapchat effects.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:54.880]   I mean...
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:55.840]   Yeah, all of them.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:56.640]   Everybody does this.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.120]   Yeah, I see so many smooth out faces.
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:57:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:01.920]   And influencers go crazy with this stuff.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.960]   I think it's actually a very smart move on L'Oréal's part.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.640]   It doesn't look like they're charging for it,
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.720]   or maybe they are, but it can't be very expensive.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.200]   Not...
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:10.720]   The idea is...
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:13.040]   And it works with not just Snapchat Cam,
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.800]   but it's just they have Snapchat filters, Instagram filters.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.240]   They even have Google Duo filters.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.200]   Google Duo.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:20.880]   All three people using that.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.360]   So they put some effort into this, but they don't charge for it.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:25.360]   But this is a brilliant brand play.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.880]   I actually think this is quite smart.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.960]   And you could test out their colors on your face
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.520]   without actually going into a place and testing it out.
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:32.960]   Good point.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:36.160]   You could say, "Oh, how much did you get that look?"
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.040]   L'Oréal.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.800]   It's smart for...
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:40.480]   I think they're really saying, "Where do you get that look?"
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.920]   When you get that look.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:44.000]   In that for a mainstream makeup brand,
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.200]   that's actually really smart.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.600]   It makes them a little hipper.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.440]   I mean, L'Oréal is not...
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.080]   I don't think...
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:52.080]   You tell me, Stacey, but I wouldn't say that.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.600]   They're not like, yeah, fuck here.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.400]   They're not like, yeah.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.840]   And I was at Codden Astill when
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:02.000]   cosmetics companies were worried about a lot,
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.040]   and they wouldn't go anywhere near it.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.080]   They hated Sephora.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.280]   They didn't want to be anywhere near Sephora.
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:08.800]   They wanted to control their experience in blooming deals all on their own.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:12.720]   Then they had to go into Sephora and found out it was actually pretty good for business.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.760]   And then they avoided online like the plague.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.400]   And then finally slowly came on.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:20.000]   So the high end cosmetics won't do this.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.280]   So this is really smart from L'Oréal is it gets ahead.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:27.360]   You want to read a really interesting book.
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.440]   It's kind of peripherally about this.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.560]   It's called Clean.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.840]   It's by a physician named James Hamlin.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:37.040]   And he talks about the history of soap.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.560]   And the history...
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:42.000]   It really is the history of cosmetics from the very beginning.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.480]   It turns out that soap really didn't exist
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:50.480]   until the nackers, the slaughterhouses,
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:55.840]   realized they had this huge surplus of animal fat and animal byproducts.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:57.040]   They couldn't do anything with.
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:01.360]   And so they turned it into soap, but now they have all this soap.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:05.680]   And they couldn't figure out what are we...
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.440]   So they created literally marketing.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:12.160]   This is a very early marketing success about 150 years ago.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:15.840]   They created a market for daily bathing, which didn't exist.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.840]   You mentioned what the world smelled like before that.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:18.960]   It didn't exist. Nobody bathed.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.480]   They thought it was bad for you.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.920]   They created a market for it.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.480]   They...
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.480]   Ivory 99.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.680]   It's fascinating.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:27.280]   People in Western Europe didn't bathe.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.160]   People in like...
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.280]   No, you're right.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.080]   Muslims did...
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.200]   They thought Europeans were disgusting.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.560]   It was religious rituals.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.680]   Jews did it was religious.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.840]   But in the West, yeah, we didn't bathe.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.200]   We were disgusting.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.240]   But they created a market with using marketing.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.480]   It's fascinating story.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.280]   This is...
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.040]   The beginning of the book is all about that.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.080]   And because they had a surplus product,
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:52.400]   they became a billion dollar market.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.600]   And actually the cosmetics market really is a follow-on to that.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.960]   Later on in the book, he talks about...
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:57.760]   And deodorant.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.320]   And deodorant also created invented...
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.120]   An invented need.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.680]   It's really fascinating.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:10.480]   And actually there's some evidence that he's a physician.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.240]   So he's talking a little bit about the evidence that
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.880]   probably all this washing is not good for you.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.600]   You're hurting the microbiome in your skin.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.440]   You're damaging it.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.880]   Every now and then you need some filth.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.880]   A little filth.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.680]   Not a bad thing.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:28.560]   As you're doing the history moment, 196 is a very fun video.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:34.640]   The all the sage, the computer with people inside.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.160]   This is from archive.org.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.240]   By the IBM Military Products Division.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.040]   So I have to say one of the things that...
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.000]   Dicty Bartolo does every Saturday afternoon with his giz fizz.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.720]   He plays these old movies and they're so much fun.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:51.600]   They're so great.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.680]   You're in the learn, he calls it.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.240]   So we're watching a rocket launch.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.800]   Today we're going to be on guard in the sky when it comes to the ground.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.520]   So we must be on guard because the ruskeys are going to come and get us.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.000]   That's right.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   So we need IBM to protect us.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.720]   The national resources that are so precious to us.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.720]   The kids could get bombed any second.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:16.080]   Well this was you and me, Jeff, ducking and covering under our school desks.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.920]   Preparing for the Armageddon to come.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.360]   But thank goodness IBM was there on guard.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:24.160]   On guard.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:27.200]   Protecting our little children.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.160]   By the way, playground equipment that these days would be considered so dangerous.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.520]   Danger!
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.400]   They would be banned.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.360]   Forget the rushes.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.760]   So many broken arms.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.000]   Oh my god.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:52.320]   There is a picture of one of the very first jungle gyms installed because people were worried
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.560]   that kids weren't getting enough fresh air and getting outside.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:03:02.160]   Kids were climbing literally 20 or 30 feet up on these things and swinging from them.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.840]   Over rocks.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.800]   Oh, round.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.240]   It was nothing.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.720]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.320]   Being kids.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.280]   And you know what?
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.240]   We liked it.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.720]   My fear of heights began then.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.840]   Here's a picture.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.000]   This is in 1900.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.680]   This was built.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.040]   This was on school yards.
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:25.600]   Oh my lord.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.640]   My palms were sweating.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.720]   These kids.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.960]   Let's get in the middle.
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.000]   Just kind of sitting there.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.240]   Just hanging up upside down.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.800]   The early days of school playground equipment.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.520]   Oh my lord.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.760]   Here YouTube changed their terms of service.
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:46.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.600]   YouTube has changed their terms of service.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.400]   Breaking news.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.240]   Ant Pruitt has the story.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:04:00.640]   Well they updated their terms of services regarding the ads that are going to run on
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:06.880]   some people's accounts that aren't necessarily in the YouTube partner program.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:16.800]   Oh, like if I put ads in my, like this, like we do, what are they going to do?
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.080]   Oh, it's going to run ads but not give you money.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:23.920]   You're going to be able to get some of the revenue share.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.800]   The whole three or four cents that they give you.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:29.760]   But if you're someone that doesn't qualify,
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.160]   YouTube has said we may put ads on your videos.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.440]   But you won't get revenue.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.640]   You're not going to get in it at night.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.880]   But we're going to put ads on your videos from time to time.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.440]   I love it.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:46.800]   They are killing the YouTube rewind this year and probably for every year from now on.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.320]   That is.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:48.960]   Oh rewind.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.000]   Was that the like things that happened on YouTube?
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.520]   All the wonderful things that happened.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:05:00.000]   The most hated video on YouTube, it was the 2018 rewind.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:00.880]   Yeah, it was.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:05.040]   I didn't understand why they didn't stop back then.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.760]   They just didn't move the needle the right way.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:16.720]   But you know, it was a way that of YouTube, let me see what the 18 million thumbs down on this.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.400]   Of course, it has 208 million views.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:22.080]   That's the fresh prince about.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.920]   It's rewind time.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:30.800]   If I control rewind, I would want Fortnite and Marques Brownlee.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.880]   This is, this is, some might say the jump the shark moment.
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:37.680]   Is this what you want?
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.280]   You know who I would have asked for it.
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.480]   So these are all YouTube.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.280]   What's that around?
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.480]   And there's Ninja.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:43.520]   Bring some of that jumping music.
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.120]   Driving the bus, the Fortnite.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.320]   You said jumping music?
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.120]   Jumping music.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:53.040]   Now they have to jump out of the bus.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.520]   Because it's Fortnite.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.000]   Get it?
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.760]   Yeah, this is triggering me too.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.040]   Yeah, yeah, you don't have to watch it.
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:04.480]   This is what kids did in the 21st century before we had playground safety.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.840]   They would jump out of buses.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.440]   Jumping out of a bus.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.360]   But this was YouTube.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:16.800]   I think this was their idea to, you know, kind of reward the most important voices on YouTube.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:20.400]   But then PewDiePie wasn't in it and people got all upset and then down.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:26.000]   How do you figure rewarding this would be rewarding to those big creators?
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.360]   Oh, you know, wider audience.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.840]   Yeah, it's also an honor.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.880]   But isn't the algorithm already doing that?
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.200]   Pushing it?
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.160]   No, no, no, but it's an, you don't understand that because you have no ego.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.960]   It's an honor.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.440]   It's true.
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:44.880]   It's an honor to be in the video.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:48.880]   Like you're one of the top creators and people watching and go,
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.640]   "Oh, I saw I just seen in there.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:51.680]   She's one of the best."
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.160]   No, I think that that was a big deal.
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.800]   But the backlash has been pretty, uh,
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:02.960]   even Marquez kind of wasn't too happy about the rewind.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.480]   Yeah, he looked thrilled.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:16.320]   So rewind's gone for this year because YouTube says it was a bad year and we didn't think we
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:16.640]   wanted it.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.040]   It wasn't.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.400]   I mean, they're not wrong.
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.120]   We don't want to relive it.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.320]   Do you see the Rockefeller Christmas tree?
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.120]   What? No.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.560]   What did I miss?
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.400]   Something my mom would have said,
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.280]   "Lead it in the corner.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.000]   It'll be fine."
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.520]   Wait a minute.
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:31.920]   Wait a minute.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:32.320]   What?
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:32.480]   What?
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:35.840]   This is the Rockefeller.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.440]   Oh my God.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.440]   That's the best they could do.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:42.800]   It's like Charlie Brown's Christmas tree.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.960]   It was okay when they cut it down.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.240]   But by the time it got there,
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.320]   and they also apparently rescued an owl from it,
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.200]   which is nice.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.960]   And they're rehabilitating me out.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.320]   It's so ratty.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.240]   Oh my God.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.200]   That's terrible.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:00.960]   Wow.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.600]   They're going to have to.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.360]   It's going to have to be like 2020 right there.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.440]   That's what they say.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:12.960]   The internet is trolling the Rockefeller Christmas tree for being so 2020.
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:16.160]   Oh my gosh.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:16.720]   Unbelievable.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:21.600]   Well, once they put the five miles of lights on it and the L'Oreal Snapchat filters,
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.960]   I think you won't notice a difference.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:27.520]   Oh, now that's something like a tree filler filter.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:32.800]   That could be kind of a virtual or virtual ordinance where you could have it like,
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:37.840]   you could do like a winter wonderland theme or like a country Christmas theme or,
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:38.640]   I don't know.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:39.680]   That'd be kind of fun.
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.160]   I'm so glad you brought that up because I missed that meme.
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.280]   I hate it when I miss the globe.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.360]   Rockefeller Center Christmas.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:48.400]   Oh, the Rockefeller Center?
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:48.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:49.920]   I was like, I missed that.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:50.560]   Yeah, sure.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.840]   It wasn't in our rundown.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.880]   Thank you for bringing that up.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.600]   Very important.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.080]   I think it was.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.600]   Carsten, you failed.
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.240]   Well, maybe it is.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.760]   No, I shouldn't say it wasn't in a rundown.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.280]   It probably is.
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.880]   Carsten's pasting it real quickly.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.520]   Sorry, Carsten.
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.800]   No, I'm sure it's in there.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.640]   You got dime, Carsten.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:09.600]   Stick it in there fast.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:09.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:10.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.000]   Yeah, it was a line on 476.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:12.720]   You just didn't see it.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.320]   There are a lot of lines in here.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.600]   There are.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.080]   Oh my God.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.000]   I kind of looked at this and I was like,
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.280]   oh, I don't even know which ones I care about.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:21.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.280]   Wow.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.840]   Well, there's zoom.
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.360]   What's wrong with Christmas from over here?
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.720]   There is zoom Santa.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.520]   Oh, and zoom's taking.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.400]   Oh, you should tell everybody that zoom is going to let people
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:37.920]   like talk if you don't have a zoom account for more than 40 minutes over Thanksgiving.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:42.000]   And I was curious because next week is Thanksgiving and we've all got a plan.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.320]   Not how are you handling this, but what is your zoom slash virtual attendance strategy
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.200]   for Thanksgiving?
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:49.360]   Right.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:56.400]   Because I don't think I want to, like, I know I want to eat virtually at the table with,
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.240]   like, I don't want us all trying to be eating a Santa.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:09:59.280]   That does not sound fun.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:09:59.840]   No.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.200]   We haven't really figured it out yet.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.600]   I was really hoping I could get like creative ideas, anything.
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.320]   So I saw, and I don't know if this is true,
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:17.040]   I saw a stat that said 38% of all Americans still plan to go travel to Thanksgiving gatherings
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.400]   of more than 10 people.
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:23.760]   Well, that's just dandy silly.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:29.120]   And I also saw shortly after that, somebody said,
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.880]   your zoom Thanksgiving is going to turn into something hard.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.520]   I can't even say it because it's so depressing, something like your Christmas funeral.
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.320]   Enjoy your enjoy your COVID.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.600]   Thanks, givings.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.280]   And then your Christmas funerals.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.880]   Yeah, so we were going to do that.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.000]   We were going to have family.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.920]   We went through a bunch of strategy ideas.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:56.560]   We were going to get tables outside, but it's cold, of course, and it's rainy and,
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.760]   you know, that wouldn't be good.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.640]   So then we said, all right, what if everybody gets a test?
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.720]   But then the problem is not everybody was willing to get a test.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:11.680]   And if they did, they would have to quarantine from the, like, the time before,
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.800]   a few days before they got the test to the meal.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:18.320]   Yeah, because even if you just got, if you just got exposed,
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.480]   it's not going to show up on the test for five to nine days.
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.040]   So you got to like quarantine for a week before the test,
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:26.640]   get the test, and then not do anything.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.160]   Sounds feasible.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.040]   Yeah, it's not going to happen.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.320]   Some damn turkey.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.000]   So we like turkey.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.840]   We basically, and it's not the turkey.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.360]   It's your family, but yes.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:40.720]   But in the worst, it's doubly difficult because it's also Michael's 18th birthday on
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:41.120]   Thursday.
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.400]   Oh my.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.240]   So that's a big deal, right?
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:44.720]   You're 18.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:45.200]   Yes.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:45.840]   That's huge.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.720]   Everybody wanted to gather to celebrate that.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.800]   But Lisa and I just decided, no, it's going to be the three of us.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:57.760]   And just because of COVID, and we said, Michael, you're 19th,
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.080]   we're going to make it a really great birthday,
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.440]   but we just can't do it this year.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.000]   He understands, but it's still hard.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.600]   And then, and I have on order, like a 20 pound turkey and an 18 pound ham.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:14.080]   So I think we're going to freeze the ham for three people.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:15.120]   And a cat.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.720]   I think that's what Darley Parker said.
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:18.480]   Eternity is a ham and two people.
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:23.120]   We're going to freeze the ham.
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.240]   We're going to make the turkey.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.560]   And then I think we're going to drive around to people who are local and deliver,
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.640]   you know, turkey care packages, I guess.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.200]   So that's awesome.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:33.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.000]   Oh, and you could sign in for turkey.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.880]   What are you doing, and for Thanksgiving?
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:41.120]   Not doing a thing.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.960]   Hopefully I'm watching television and we're just hanging out.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.800]   Thanksgiving for us.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.360]   I know this is going to sound weird, but where I come from,
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:56.560]   Thanksgiving dinner was pretty much like going to grandma's for Sunday dinner.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:57.440]   You're right.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:01.520]   Hardly any differentiation other than a turkey, if that.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.480]   So it had never really changed for us.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:09.440]   And even when I stopped going down to my mom's for Thanksgiving or whatever,
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:15.040]   it was just another meal and we just sort of hung out and relaxed for a day in a hand.
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:18.080]   I think in an America that did do that, that had Sunday dinner
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:22.400]   with all the family, Thanksgiving isn't as important.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:26.240]   But it's assumed a lot of importance in the modern America,
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.360]   where we're all a diaspora and nobody gets together.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.800]   And it's the one time of the year everybody gets a chance to get together.
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:33.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:39.040]   I remember being young and some of the classmates would just
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:44.320]   be all excited about their dinner for Thanksgiving and they would tell me what they're having
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:44.960]   and this and that.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:49.840]   And I'm just having a mental checklist going, we had that Sunday, we had that Sunday.
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:50.640]   Also like that.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:56.640]   And just it's like, oh, so every Sunday dinner at my grandmother's or my great aunt's home was
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.640]   like Thanksgiving for most people.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:03.120]   But see, that's a testament more to you and your great family and what you did on Sunday day.
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.640]   How big were those Sunday dinners?
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.400]   Oh, dude.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:11.760]   It would be probably 20 people in and out coming in to eat.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.280]   See, that's Thanksgiving.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.720]   Yeah, that's Thanksgiving.
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:15.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.560]   And you had it every week.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.360]   I'm so jealous.
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.360]   I am not good.
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.720]   God, that sounds like a lot of work.
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:23.120]   If you're Italian in New Jersey,
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.480]   yeah, Sunday gravy.
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:24.880]   That's what people do.
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.320]   Yeah, make the Sunday gravy.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:26.560]   Yeah.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.480]   I kind of wish I had.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.680]   With the wife, not the mistress.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:31.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.200]   You keep your, what is it?
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.600]   The gum, not, not gum bar there.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:37.920]   The what?
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:38.320]   There's a.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.000]   Let's not offend.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.600]   There's an attack.
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:42.000]   I know.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.800]   And the sopranos, the guma, right?
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.560]   I think it was your guma anyway.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.760]   Oh, I know what you're talking about.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.720]   There's a soprano thing.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.920]   Yes, soprano thing.
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:50.960]   Gaba Ghoul or something.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.560]   Gaba Ghoul is also very good.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:57.280]   You should have Gaba Ghoul, but not your guma at your Thanksgiving.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:57.920]   I'm just saying.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.520]   Very important to make the distinction.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.800]   Don't forget the cannoli.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:06.880]   And don't forget, leave the gun, take the cannoli.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.080]   But I will.
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.440]   I'll call my mother and check on her.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.760]   But that'll be about it.
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:16.320]   I don't.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:20.240]   We don't really just do a whole lot of reaching out or anything like that.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:21.040]   What about you, Jeff?
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.520]   Are you planning, you're not planning a big event?
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.480]   No, we're debating still.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:26.880]   I mean, son, Jake is embossed with his girlfriend
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.040]   and they are quarantined.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:33.600]   But as of now, they're coming down and staying a week.
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.120]   Quarantine not here.
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.160]   I don't know.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.120]   That's so risky.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.640]   I know.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.920]   We haven't seen him in ages, but yeah.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.960]   So what do you think, Stacey?
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.320]   What are you going to do?
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.480]   Oh, ours is.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.560]   Well, I was going to suggest
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:16:00.480]   either appetizers or kind of zoom happy hour after the dinner.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.560]   It's easier to drink than eat on Zoom.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.080]   Right.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.880]   And it's a smaller amount of time.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.640]   Plus, I was trying to figure out the logistics of getting my stuff on the table
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.680]   when they were getting there.
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.840]   Like there's four families that are trying to.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:16.400]   Oh, well, challenge it.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.400]   That is not going to happen.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:22.000]   Well, most like two chunks of family are in Austin,
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.920]   one's in San Antonio and then we're up here.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:27.680]   And that's just my husband's family, the other, my family's small.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:31.440]   And they'll just, my parents haven't celebrated Thanksgiving since
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.520]   they only celebrate when we come.
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:36.240]   Although my mom's so sad.
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:39.920]   I'm half worried that she's going to show up at my door and then what do I do?
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.680]   But I sent my mom, and she got it yesterday, unfortunately.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:48.640]   A little Harrington's ham with some Vermont cheddar, some bacon,
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:53.280]   some a whole little care package that she could nibble on and notch on.
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.560]   And then we're going to zoom her.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:17:00.800]   But yeah, it's, but this is just one of many, you know, sacrifices.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:06.560]   Some of us losing loved ones, there'll be, as they say, an empty seat at that
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:07.360]   Thanksgiving table.
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:07.520]   Yeah.
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.160]   Because of course.
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.120]   So it's awful.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.240]   Thank goodness knock on wood.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.200]   We haven't watched it.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:15.040]   Maybe you need Clint Watts zoom room line two, 14.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:15.760]   I just saw this.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:22.400]   Actually, can I just show you the best zoom room ever?
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.600]   This was our guest on a floss weekly.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.120]   Oh, man.
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:30.000]   This guy is beautiful, wasn't it?
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.520]   What a beautiful zoom room.
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.520]   This was patient.
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:39.120]   They were talking about patient privacy and so forth.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.280]   I don't know who this guy, what was his name?
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:41.760]   Do you remember?
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:44.560]   This is just here with the patient.
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.200]   So last name.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.400]   This is a zoom room.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.520]   Man, and a zoom beard.
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.000]   Jeff, I think we found somebody even better.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.280]   No, it's what he beat me.
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:53.840]   Oh, no.
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:56.080]   Somebody look at, okay, look at Jeff.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:00.880]   Now look at our Adrian Groper, the hie of one.com.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:01.920]   Look at that zoom room.
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.040]   Wow.
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:03.520]   Wow.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:04.000]   Wow.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.480]   That is a zoom room, like a cathedral ceiling.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:10.880]   And man, he needs stained glass behind him,
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.720]   but that's the only thing wrong.
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.400]   He sat down and everybody.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.280]   Preshowing left.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:17.680]   Whoa.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:17.920]   Whoa.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.160]   Is that a record player?
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:21.760]   Don't it's an IBM typewriter on the left.
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:22.720]   Back here as a select.
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.200]   Look at that.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:24.320]   You cut that right away.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:24.800]   Look at that.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:26.480]   Wow.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.000]   All right.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.280]   What line again?
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:29.680]   Mine.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.800]   Well, you got two of these.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.280]   You can see zoom Santa on 210,
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.040]   or you can see Clint Watts' zoom room,
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:35.760]   one, two, four, two.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.280]   I like this new line thing.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.640]   We're going to do this from now on.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:41.440]   Because you're getting old.
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.800]   You can't find the stuff quick enough.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.240]   Let's go to Clint Watts' killer zoom room.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.120]   I just saw this.
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.000]   Just when I think I got
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.320]   if I work from home setup, optimized,
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:53.440]   selected wisdom has to go on TV and show it up.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.560]   I'll show it off.
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:56.480]   Oh my God.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.520]   How many monitors?
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.280]   One, two, three, four.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.720]   He must be a day trader.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.720]   No, he monitors this information.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:03.600]   He's former FBI.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.120]   That's awesome.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.400]   That's just overachieving.
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.000]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:08.480]   Huh?
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:11.200]   And I bet somewhere it's a television.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:11.520]   Okay.
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.400]   But I am going to point out.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.760]   I guess he goes on the upper left.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.000]   Your uncle Ned goes on the lower right.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:16.800]   He doesn't get a longer away.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.720]   You can really do a zoom Christmas on that.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.920]   But look, I got to point out he's using an apple airport
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.360]   extreme router over here.
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:25.680]   Definitely did that points for that.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.680]   That thing is not only at a date,
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:31.040]   not made anymore, but probably a security flaw.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.080]   Just waiting to happen.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:32.960]   Maybe not.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.880]   Maybe he knows maybe Clint knows something I don't know.
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:35.680]   He's a security guy.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:36.160]   He is a security guy.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:36.640]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:38.160]   Maybe.
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:38.560]   Well, you know.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:39.920]   Meanwhile, zoom Santa is going to,
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:40.880]   I got to get to this.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.160]   They want to charge.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.280]   I think it's 30 bucks for a prerecorded Santa.
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.520]   50 bucks to talk to Santa live on zoom.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.400]   Oh, please.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.880]   And you don't even get to sit in his lap?
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.320]   No.
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.840]   Not everybody wants to sit in his lap.
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.040]   I do get to sit in his lap.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.560]   He's scared.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.400]   Oh, wow.
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:02.240]   Yeah, who doesn't have pictures of terrorized children
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.920]   sitting in Santa's lap, right?
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:07.440]   Screaming their lunch sound.
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:10.480]   Now, the good news.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.520]   It's more adorable though.
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:12.800]   The kids are adorable.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:13.440]   Yes, they are.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:17.600]   The good news is we might even have a vaccine.
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.520]   We might have Thanksgiving next year.
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:22.720]   There's not one, but two excellent candidates.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.600]   Uh, for Moderna and Pfizer.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.400]   But the best part of the Moderna story.
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:28.960]   And.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:33.680]   Is that Dolly Parton donated $1 million
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:37.200]   to the development of the Moderna vaccine.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.840]   Which is freaking awesome.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.280]   Good honor.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:44.720]   Uh, Gretchen McCullough wrote some lyrics,
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:48.880]   rewrote the lyrics of Dolly Parton's famous Jolene song.
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:52.480]   And then one of our, it turns out one of our viewers,
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.280]   Ryan Cordell, set it to music and sang it.
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.200]   Oh, so I, as I tweeted this,
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:58.560]   I said, this is just perfect.
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:59.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.560]   And Mike Isargia pointed out,
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:04.640]   and he, Mike and I, and sing along with Ryan, his version.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.880]   So remember, Dolly Parton donated $1 million.
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.760]   And this is what the internet comes up with.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:15.200]   Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.200]   [Laughter]
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:20.240]   Make another, please go in my heart.
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.000]   [Laughter]
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:22.800]   Thank you.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.960]   Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.360]   [Laughter]
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:30.320]   I was at a temporary.
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:34.080]   [Music]
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.720]   That was awesome, Ryan Cordell.
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.280]   So that was Mike Isargia and I singing along.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:41.760]   I, I loved this because it was, it was,
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.240]   it is what the, what collaboration on the internet was, right?
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:46.720]   Somebody suggested that, that saw that happen.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.400]   Then she wrote the lyrics.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.080]   Then he sang it.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.240]   And then people spread it around.
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.920]   This is the new collaboration on the internet.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:54.720]   It's a beautiful,
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.600]   that's a good point.
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:56.080]   Isn't it?
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.800]   And we all got, I think we really enjoyed it.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:04.240]   And I think it was, you know, heavily retweeted.
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.560]   Actually, when I saw it, it hadn't been retweeted much.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:10.320]   So I, I said, I'm, I got to spread this around a little bit more.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:13.120]   I saw it before it was retweeted a thousand times.
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.560]   Oh, good.
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:15.440]   You're so hip.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.880]   Shall I, shall I play the whole thing?
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.400]   Because I want to, I think everybody.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.760]   No, no, we should do an ad.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.360]   Because I have to leave in 45 minutes.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:22.880]   Oh my God, you're right.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.640]   Sorry, Ryan.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.640]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.840]   Your chance at internet fame is over.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.320]   Is over.
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.280]   So now Dolly has to cover her own cover.
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.200]   Oh yeah, I want to hear Dolly do it.
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:40.080]   If Dolly doesn't.
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:40.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:41.440]   Isn't that great though?
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:41.920]   Do that.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.400]   She's turned out to be like this internet saint.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.760]   She is.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:46.480]   God bless her.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:51.120]   You're just a good person and sometimes the internet rewards that.
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:55.360]   Man, our show today brought you by brought you by
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:02.000]   our show today brought to you by Linode.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.680]   I am such a Linode fan for years and years and years.
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:09.840]   Linode who was famous, you know, I don't know how long ago,
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:15.200]   one of the very first places you could go to set up a server fast and easy running Linux
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.800]   on solid state drives.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.920]   They were really early on the solid state drive.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:23.680]   And man, it is the best way to set up a cloud infrastructure
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.640]   for anybody who wants to host a website or build an app,
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:31.120]   store, backup, media, launcher, enriched developer applications,
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:34.960]   hosted services, websites, AI and machine learning workloads.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:36.640]   Yes, they have those too.
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:39.680]   They've got gaming services, CI/CD environments.
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:44.320]   I use it myself just as a hobbyist because when I want to create a web-based app,
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:48.720]   it's so easy to spin up a Linode instance to get it running so affordable.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:53.440]   And you can launch and scale with their virtual machines, start small,
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:57.840]   you get busy, you get successful, you get big, you can grow with it easily.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:03.520]   Flat pricing across 11 global data centers everywhere in the world.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.480]   That's why 800,000 developers use Linode.
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:10.080]   They have an intuitive cloud manager, full-featured API.
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:13.840]   And the best, and I give them such credit for this
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:18.240]   because they're geeks, they love geeks, they know you, they understand what you're up to.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.400]   And they have the best customer support.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:24.720]   They're there 24/7 every single day of the year.
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:28.640]   And it's the kind of customer support you really want with knowledgeable people.
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:30.240]   They're not reading it out of a notebook.
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.480]   They can really help and they won't pass you off.
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:34.160]   Nothing.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:39.040]   No matter what size plan you have, you're going to get the best support you've ever experienced.
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.960]   Linode also has a great YouTube channel.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:47.200]   So if you want to know how to set something up or secure your instance or whatever,
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:52.480]   you can do that at youtube.com/linode, L-I-N-O-D-E.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:58.000]   Lots of testimonials at the website if you go to linode.com/tweg.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.800]   But here's one I just plucked, Bryce Adams from Medioric.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:06.800]   He says, quote, "From the start, we were looking for a partner, not a provider.
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.840]   Some of the large providers see us as only a transaction."
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.040]   You know what that's like.
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:16.240]   Linode is the kind of partner that will be with us from the start today and beyond.
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:18.240]   Linode is, they're the original.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:19.280]   They're the one.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:21.280]   It's the best way to do cloud infrastructure.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.920]   Linode's virtual machines are fast and they're very affordable.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:28.640]   Whether you're like me working on personal projects
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:30.640]   or you're managing enterprise infrastructure,
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:35.600]   you deserve simple, affordable, accessible cloud computing solutions
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:38.400]   to take your project to the next level.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:39.600]   I want you to check it out.
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.880]   Here's the deal.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:43.360]   We've got $100 in free credit for you.

[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:03.200]   They have plenty of distros to choose from.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.560]   You can configure it however you want with any features you need.
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:11.120]   Pay for only what you use linode.com/tweg.
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:15.280]   Or simply text if you're mobile running around right now.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:21.520]   Just text "twit" to 474747 and they'll send you a direct link.
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:24.720]   Text "twit" to 474747.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:26.080]   I'm a huge fan.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.400]   I was so pleased when they called us.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:31.200]   I said, "I will do this ad for you.
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.120]   I just think you guys are the greatest.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:36.400]   I've been a linode fan and I've used you for years."
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.320]   One of the very best.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:41.840]   Give you the address one more time.
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:42.720]   I want you to use it.
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:50.640]   Text "twit" to 474747 or go to linode, l-i-n-o-d-e.com/tweg.
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:55.280]   But do, do, do, do, do, do.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:55.760]   Let's see.
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:56.720]   What should we talk about?
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:58.240]   We've jumped all over the place here.
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.120]   This is so good.
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.880]   I'm having so much fun.
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:03.200]   And you have to get out of here.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.360]   Mudge is a big deal.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.200]   Mudge is a huge deal.
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:11.120]   At Twitter, Mudge was part of the Cult of the Dead Cow.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.240]   You know who that is, right?
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:15.360]   Yes, the beginning of the internet.
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:20.640]   Well, yeah, actually really one of the early hacking groups.
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:23.040]   Mudge is kind of legendary.
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.880]   Very good pick for Twitter for their security guy.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.880]   I think Twitter-
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:29.280]   Did we talk about-
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.160]   Oh.
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:32.160]   I think Twitter is going to be very interesting
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.440]   in the post-Trump world.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.920]   They've said already that they are going to treat his account
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.040]   like any other account.
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:40.960]   Facebook says, "No, no, he's still a world leader.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:45.440]   We're going to still give him a little bit of slack."
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:47.360]   I think it's going to be really interesting to see what
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.480]   Twitter turns into.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.400]   It was almost-
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.560]   The Trump presidency was really a proof of concept
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.440]   of what Twitter could be.
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:55.440]   Facebook is saying he's still a world leader
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.600]   because he's still currently the president.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:58.000]   Or-
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.040]   No, after all you leave-
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.480]   That's what we're talking about.
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:00.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.880]   Interesting.
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:07.360]   Amazon opens a drug store.
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.800]   That's a pretty big deal, I think.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.160]   Yeah, they bought Pillpac.
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:10.640]   Remember, they-
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.920]   Pillpac was an advertiser.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:12.480]   One of many-
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:13.280]   He's one of the sponsors.
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:17.920]   One of many sponsors has gone on to fame and fortune being acquired by Amazon.
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.840]   On your back, on my back.
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:22.400]   What we do is they come along, we go,
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.160]   "Here we go, up, up, up!"
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:27.040]   We lift them up and they jump over the wall into the Amazon land
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.000]   and we never see them again.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.400]   But Pillpac is actually really cool.
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:31.920]   Say a lot of ring when you're over there.
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:32.880]   Yeah, rings over there,
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:33.920]   audible's over there.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:36.160]   There are a lot of people on the other side of that wall.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.000]   So Amazon acquires the-
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.120]   Amazon,
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.320]   I-V-O.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.440]   Come on, you can do it.
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:42.400]   I'm not against it.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.200]   No.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:47.280]   I'll be the first to say I'm not against it.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:52.320]   So we've kind of known Amazon had ambitions in the pharmacy world.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.000]   They will offer free delivery.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.920]   Just like a regular pharmacy,
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:58.320]   but by mail pharmacy, this is a big move.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.560]   They're using the Pillpac infrastructure.
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:02.960]   They bought them a couple of years ago,
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:05.920]   including the pharmacy software,
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:07.040]   the fulfillment centers.
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.640]   And most importantly,
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:10.160]   I think the relationships with health plans,
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.720]   because it's one thing to say,
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:13.920]   "Well, you can buy your drugs here,
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.520]   but if it's not covered by your health plan,
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:16.400]   nobody's going to do it."
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.800]   At least not people will have a health plan.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.480]   There's a free two-day shipping for prime members,
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.160]   a savings program.
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.560]   Amazon, we knew they were going to get into health.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:27.920]   It was just a matter of time.
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:28.960]   It's a big market.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:31.120]   And they also last Wednesday,
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.920]   launched their Care Hub service too,
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.960]   which you can see in Care Hub,
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:41.840]   was there where you can link your Echo device to someone else's?
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.920]   I think this is so good.
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:46.320]   Yeah, so I could have my mom,
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:48.000]   she has to have a separate account.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.280]   It's not she's on my account.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:49.920]   Right.
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:51.920]   But our accounts are linked.
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:54.960]   So what she could say, for instance,
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:56.880]   instead of calling 911,
[01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.240]   she could say, "Call 911."
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:59.760]   It would call me, she would call me,
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.040]   and I could say, "Mom, what do you need?"
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.480]   And I could come right over.
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:03.520]   Right, or just,
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:04.960]   "Madam A, get help."
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:06.880]   And it would call whoever she's linked to.
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:07.360]   It doesn't mean that.
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:11.280]   And then you get a list of her interactions
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.120]   with her Echo device throughout the day.
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:16.240]   So they don't say like she wanted you to play Jolene.
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:19.440]   It says, you know, she asked for anything.
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.560]   She listened to music.
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:21.760]   But see, that's what you want to know.
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:23.360]   Is mom alive?
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:25.840]   Is mom, she getting out of bed?
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:27.040]   That's a big issue with elders.
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:28.320]   Sometimes they just won't get up.
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:30.240]   You want to know.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:33.120]   And so my mom uses Echo like crazy.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.200]   I'm going to absolutely set this up.
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.080]   Thank you for reminding me,
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:37.680]   because I meant to do that.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:40.400]   Okay, so yeah, but you combine that with things like pill pack.
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:43.760]   And you think about the picture that you can get.
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:48.160]   And this is where I think metadata is really kind of
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:51.200]   maybe something we should start thinking about,
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.640]   because it's one thing to say,
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:56.160]   hey, you know when your mom's turning on,
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:57.440]   it doesn't say turn on the light.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:01.280]   It actually just says smart home versus entertainment
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.720]   if she played a song, for example.
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:08.080]   But you'll have a sense of how she's moving about her day.
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.440]   And you think about like,
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:12.160]   okay, and now I might get a sense to her medicines
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:13.600]   that she's taking or taking.
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:19.600]   It's good, but it's also a little disconcerting.
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:21.360]   And you know, he should be really clear
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.280]   when you set these up what they're sharing.
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:25.120]   Like my mom would never do this.
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:27.040]   My father would
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.040]   get that advice out of here.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:29.840]   I don't know what to do with that.
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:30.400]   I'm dual.
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:31.520]   I got to figure that out.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:32.160]   I can't do that.
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:32.800]   That's why you.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:33.600]   Oh, my mom would like,
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:35.600]   I don't want Jeff Bezos knowing what I'm doing.
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.960]   Yeah, you got see,
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.680]   we did it early on before they thought about that.
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:42.880]   And we told Lisa's parents,
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:43.840]   just watch this.
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:46.800]   Hey, A word play Elvis.
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.360]   And that was it.
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.040]   That was all they had to hear.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:50.720]   And they have it now in the house.
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:53.040]   And we don't have to mention the Jeff Bezos or anything.
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:55.200]   And that's the keys.
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.560]   You got to really sell it on the,
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.480]   you know, the uses.
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.000]   No, that's the first thing my mom asked.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.360]   She is definitely on the.
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:01.840]   She's too smart.
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:06.160]   Can't help you with smart parents.
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:08.480]   You're your moral panic has spread to your mother.
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:09.280]   How dare you.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:12.240]   Jeff, no.
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:13.680]   The other way around,
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:14.960]   you inherited your moral panic.
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.000]   You came by it honestly.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.680]   Could be.
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:18.240]   Could be.
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:18.880]   Yes.
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:19.760]   Yes, I came by it.
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:22.160]   So.
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:25.920]   The other thing about the Amazon pharmacy,
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:27.120]   tell me if this is,
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.040]   because I have a good drug plan with my union.
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:34.240]   That people without insurance can buy prescriptions.
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.640]   Yeah, but a full.
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:39.280]   Boy, no, no, they're paying.
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:40.240]   No, they're paying.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.480]   So Amazon has a health plan?
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:42.880]   Do you have to.
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:43.440]   Amazon.
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:45.040]   Basically, I think it's you buy.
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:46.960]   Whereas an 80% here.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:48.000]   Well, somewhere here.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:48.320]   Shoot.
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:49.840]   Does that make a choice?
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:50.240]   That's a good one.
[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:51.200]   Straight up that way.
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:52.080]   That's interesting.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:54.560]   No darn, where is it?
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:56.320]   So remember Amazon created a.
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.640]   Require health plan.
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.560]   Amazon created a.
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:05.760]   Employee insurance plan for its employees.
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:06.720]   They were working with.
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:08.080]   Who was it?
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.120]   Oh, I can't remember.
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:10.880]   Big financial services company.
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:13.680]   Last year to create this kind of.
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:14.720]   Amazon health plan.
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:15.440]   And at first.
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:17.840]   That you know, they were saying,
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:19.280]   oh, it's just for our employees,
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:21.600]   but it was often it's often been considered this is.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:23.920]   So here's the here's the deal.
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:25.280]   Prime members.
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:27.040]   Now the benefit of prime.
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:30.240]   Get up to 80% off generic medications.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.600]   And up to 40% off branding.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:34.080]   Oh, that's what you have.
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:34.720]   That's really interesting.
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:36.400]   Yeah, it is, isn't it?
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:41.040]   Yeah, it's like some my migraine medicines are like a thousand to two thousand dollars.
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:44.000]   That's what we call late stage capitalism,
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.480]   where your health plan is provided by Amazon.
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.000]   Yeah, it's your part of your Amazon prime membership.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.680]   16 times one.
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:53.360]   It's your health plan.
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:54.480]   Another day older.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:54.880]   Wow.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.880]   That was on a deeper and.
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:57.920]   Wow.
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:58.240]   Yeah, good.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:58.640]   All right.
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:00.320]   So just look, they don't require.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:02.640]   Health insurance either.
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:03.840]   And it's just another way to.
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:04.640]   Right.
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.960]   Find something that's a little less expensive for you.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:07.840]   On your prescription.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:08.560]   Oh, I get it.
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:08.880]   Okay.
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:11.520]   So yeah, this is the inside RX savings program.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.040]   All right.
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:17.360]   I bet you the discounts aren't that good.
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.400]   Yeah, it says up to.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:19.760]   So yeah, one does not know.
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:24.720]   Improperly installed ring cameras are catching fire.
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:26.560]   So this is a stupid story.
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:27.760]   I know it's dumb.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:28.800]   Yeah, of course.
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:31.600]   Don't screw the safety screw into the.
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:32.000]   Safety.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:32.640]   To not.
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:34.400]   Yeah, not the wood screw.
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:39.120]   But they did recall like a lot of them.
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:42.240]   They did because that's what you have to do when you have.
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.160]   I mean, you can't have an exploding doorbell.
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.640]   No, you shouldn't anyway.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.080]   But again, that's because they were screwing the long screw
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:54.160]   in, which was puncturing the lithium ion battery.
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:55.680]   And that's why exploded, right?
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:58.560]   It was mistakes and installs.
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:34:59.440]   Yes.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:01.760]   Yes.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.560]   Put it in her to.
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:03.200]   Sorry.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:03.840]   Put it in her.
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.240]   Sorry.
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.920]   Put it in her to.
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:06.880]   That was me.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:07.920]   That was typing John.
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:09.600]   I like.
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:12.320]   Let's find another story.
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.880]   This is Stacy's looking for the.
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:16.880]   How about the change log real quick?
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:17.440]   Let's do it.
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:17.440]   Okay.
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:18.240]   Let's do it.
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:18.720]   Let's do it.
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:19.600]   It's time for.
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:23.920]   The Google change log.
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:29.520]   Wow.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:32.400]   This is the worst color choice ever.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:37.200]   Google has launched the Pixel 4a in a new color called barely blue.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:42.000]   I had a Mustang that color and everyone made fun of me.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:42.640]   Barely.
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:43.280]   There's one of the lot.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.080]   I bought it.
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:44.960]   It's baby blue.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:48.160]   Barely green crap apple is talking.
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.320]   Now this is blue.
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:53.120]   I like that baby blue or it's kind of like a grayish.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:54.000]   It's a blue.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.720]   It's a pale blue.
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:59.120]   It's what we used to call baby blue, right?
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.680]   This is blue blue.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:02.880]   This is apple blue.
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.360]   That's a beautiful blue.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:05.680]   Don't you?
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:07.040]   The apple blue is gorgeous.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:07.440]   Don't you.
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:08.080]   Wait, is that it?
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:08.800]   That's black.
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:09.280]   It's black.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.560]   Right now that looks great.
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:11.840]   It's a blue.
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:12.960]   Yeah, that doesn't look good.
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:13.600]   It's a blue.
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:15.200]   It's a blue.
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:16.400]   And it blew on the edge.
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:18.240]   I was really excited about the blue, but that's awesome.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.200]   Well, there's another blue.
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:23.520]   There's a bright blue for the iPhones 12 and the iPhone mini.
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.200]   This is the iPhone Pro.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:31.120]   It's a more subtle hue of blue as opposed to barely blue.
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:37.440]   Big Chrome update latest, the last Chrome update of the year is 25% faster.
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:40.160]   And if you have a new M1 Mac,
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:46.160]   there's a new Chrome for you too that is native to the M1 processor,
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:52.400]   which is a big deal because Chrome is quite the pig on Macintosh devices.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:57.680]   And they're trying to get back some of that market share from Safari.
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.680]   So new version of Chrome.
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:03.200]   Part of the reason Google is pushing this,
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:08.880]   they don't mention this in this article when they say it's faster and better at battery life.
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:12.960]   And it starts up 25% faster and loads pages 7% faster.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:16.480]   They don't mention the two, not one, but two zero-day flaws
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:18.320]   in the previous version of Chrome.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.280]   And you really should get the new Chrome to patch that.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.200]   That's really bottom line.
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.240]   That's why you should do it.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:30.160]   There's some, this is, I think the third zero-day in as many months in Google Chrome.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:34.240]   You know, this virtual work is not working out for them.
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:35.280]   Wow.
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:38.960]   Tennessee Valley Authority, is that what TVA is?
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:39.280]   Yes.
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:45.040]   Two new solar farms for Google and Vanderbilt University.
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:50.480]   Two 100 megawatt solar farms built in the Tennessee Valley
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:53.440]   display green energy for Vanderbilt University
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:58.080]   and the Google data centers in Bridgeport, Alabama and Clarksville, Tennessee.
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:03.120]   TVA is, as you might remember, started during the Great Depression.
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:10.560]   It's federally owned utility and they're on track to reduce emissions by 70% below 2005
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:11.760]   levels by 2030.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:14.240]   And a lot of this is through solar.
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:16.400]   So that's nice.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:17.520]   10 million customers.
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:22.880]   I drive by Bell Labs and they have a huge solar lawn.
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:26.400]   I think of all that, that, that, that farmable property underneath
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:29.520]   that's just not covered up by the solar panels.
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:30.800]   I don't know, there's something weird about that.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:37.760]   So, yeah, just think of all the corn we could raise.
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.440]   Or you could have a Bell Labs.
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:40.880]   The Bell Labs.
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:42.080]   It's weird.
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:45.200]   I think it's better to grow power than to grow corn.
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:45.600]   Okay.
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:45.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:50.400]   We're, we don't eat all of the corn we grow.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:50.720]   That's right.
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.320]   We have an XC programs.
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:53.840]   Yeah, we're feeding the pigs.
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:01.600]   Use Google's AI to make monsters
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:07.120]   with Chimera painter, a trained machine language,
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:11.520]   I'm sorry, machine learning model that automatically creates a fully
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:15.920]   fleshed out rendering from a user supplied creature outline.
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:19.520]   So here's the initial kind of, whoa.
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:21.840]   So this is again.
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:24.640]   Tell us again what again is Stacy.
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:32.000]   A generative something adversarial network network.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.440]   Is that what you're meaning to say?
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:34.480]   Yes.
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:34.960]   Sorry.
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:36.880]   You have like, oh, can't work.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:36.880]   What?
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.080]   Making me work again.
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:39.760]   So this is cool.
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:41.520]   These generate critters.
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:43.360]   Oh, there's a creepy, organic generative.
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:44.640]   It's a quirky bunny.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.880]   It's a quirky bunny is exactly what it is.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:49.280]   Or it's a kai, no, it's like a kai orgy.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:51.120]   A fox, a fox orgy.
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:53.200]   It's a coyote looking coyote fox orgy.
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:55.600]   Yeah.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:56.240]   What is that?
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:02.240]   I guess what they're doing is they're taking one of the negative features of
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:04.160]   GANS and turning it into a furture.
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:10.160]   An issue with using GANS for generating creatures was the potential loss
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:16.960]   of anatomical and spatial coherence when rendering subtler low-contrast parts of images.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:23.280]   Examples of this conclude eyes, fingers, or even distinguishing between overlapping
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.600]   body parts with similar textures.
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:29.440]   See the affectionately named Boggle Dog below.
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:32.640]   Oh, is that the Boggle Dog?
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:33.840]   That's the Boggle Dog.
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.120]   The world famous.
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:36.800]   Look at this foot here.
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:38.000]   It's going whoop.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.640]   To solve this.
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:42.160]   I think it's adorable.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:44.960]   So anyway.
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:46.640]   I would still look it.
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:49.920]   Here's this is something you can you can download and try.
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:53.200]   Chimera Painter. Actually not.
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:57.040]   I don't know if you know it's on the web.
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:57.920]   It's not a download.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:00.720]   So just search for Chimera.
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:01.520]   So make your monsters.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:02.320]   Painter.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.000]   And you can make some monsters.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.200]   You can do it.
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:05.920]   This you know what?
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.680]   I think your daughter and enjoy this Stacy.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:10.960]   Maybe that'll be our zoom Thanksgiving activity.
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:11.760]   Create monsters.
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:16.480]   And then we can create Pokemon style rules for them and then play a card game.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.120]   Nice.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:20.000]   Well, the adults are like, what is happening?
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.240]   Well, they're in the line again.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:23.440]   That's the grown up table.
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.640]   Should we get either wide at the grown up zoom.
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:28.240]   A point of order.
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:33.760]   Mr. Chairman, can we talk about dying Google products in the Google change log?
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:34.640]   I guess that's a change.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:36.240]   I debated that, but I think that's fine.
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:37.280]   It's a change.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:38.320]   It's a change.
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:39.760]   Google is what are you from rule?
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.080]   I say it's a change.
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:42.400]   Yes.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:42.880]   Yes.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:43.520]   Basically.
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:46.240]   What is the appeals court here?
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:47.120]   Stacy?
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:47.600]   Is it okay?
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:48.160]   Dining things.
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:49.360]   Madam, Justice.
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:53.520]   May we put things that are going away in the change log?
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:54.720]   Yeah.
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:55.760]   That's a change.
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:57.040]   Death is change, man.
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:58.080]   Death is change.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.840]   Google is killing.
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:00.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:01.040]   Shutting down.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:05.840]   It's VR filter map expeditions, which we thought really was super cool.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:12.400]   Used cardboard to allow students to tour the Louvre or something.
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:14.640]   But apparently they said.
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:21.600]   Well, they said VR headsets are not always accessible to all learners.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:22.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:26.800]   It's made out of cardboard, but inside the cardboard is $1,000 in French phones.
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:27.360]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.280]   It's just a cardboard on the phone.
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:30.320]   I think it's the phone.
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:35.920]   Google is bringing driving mode to Assistant.
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:38.240]   This is an update to Google Maps.
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:41.120]   There's some COVID related features.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:44.640]   You can see the live status of your takeout of delivery orders.
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:45.840]   Ooh.
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:46.800]   Mm.
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:53.360]   That's nice, as well as the launch of the long expected new Assistant driving mode.
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:55.840]   I don't know.
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.120]   I'm not sure what that is.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.080]   I put it in here.
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:01.760]   I'm driving here.
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:05.440]   So if you don't have an Android Auto compatible car,
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:11.760]   the new Google Assistant driving mode in Maps is essentially
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:18.720]   allows drivers to get alerts about incoming calls.
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:19.280]   Oh, I see.
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:22.080]   It turns the phone itself into a driving mode.
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:25.680]   Have the Assistant readout text messages and control your music,
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:27.280]   but without leaving Google Maps.
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:29.040]   So it's all built into Google Maps.
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:30.560]   That's interesting.
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:34.240]   So Maps becomes your kind of your driving companion.
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:40.000]   I'm excited my new car is going to have Android Auto as well as Apple's CarPlay.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:40.480]   I can't wait.
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:42.720]   Every time I see those commercials, I think about you.
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:45.040]   Are you they're running commercials now?
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:46.160]   Mm-hmm.
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:46.640]   For the most.
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:48.640]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:52.000]   Okay.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.440]   Okay.
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:56.560]   I guess there's one more that I was just going to ignore,
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:57.200]   but I'll put it in.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:00.560]   Google Chrome introduces tab search.
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:03.920]   Too many tabs open.
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:05.280]   Now you can search for you.
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:08.000]   This is sad.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:08.720]   That is just sad.
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:08.800]   That is sad.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:14.000]   That is, we've created a problem and we're going to enable and make that problem just.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.600]   You have so many tabs open.
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:17.600]   You don't know what you got in your tabs.
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:20.480]   I know one guy who keeps like 400 alive.
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:21.360]   Josh Benton.
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:21.760]   Why?
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:23.440]   I don't know.
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:25.680]   I just start the store and I'm a peek.
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.320]   Yeah, or something or close them.
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:30.000]   Close it and I'm just keep them.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:30.960]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:35.360]   And speaking of closing, it's the end of the Google change law.
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:39.200]   Can I ask you to explain one story to me?
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:39.600]   Explain.
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:40.640]   You're so smart, you're too.
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:41.600]   Explain to me.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:41.600]   You're free.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:42.400]   You're four.
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:42.960]   You're five.
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:45.200]   One ninety four.
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:47.200]   Federated login.
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:47.680]   Oh.
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:52.720]   Why are there a hundred and ninety four stories on this thing?
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:54.640]   Oh, that's not even the one who's two and he's gone.
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:55.200]   It's two and he's gone.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:59.840]   Post-cookie world federated login.
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:02.400]   Yes, Stacy, we're staying till we get them all done.
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:05.520]   Young lady, you're going to eat your broccoli every story.
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:10.400]   So this was a the privacy community group,
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:17.200]   a committee of the World Wide Web Consortium meeting representatives from Apple and Verizon said,
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:24.000]   they think browser software should, even though the sharply limiting the use of third-party
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.080]   cookies should continue to facilitate federated login.
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:32.960]   That's the idea that a user can be recognized at multiple independent sites,
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:37.920]   log into Facebook and then you're logged into 16 other sites, I guess.
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:38.960]   That's all it is.
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:39.200]   Yeah.
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:42.160]   Well, but there was a debate over all this.
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:46.160]   When I log into something with Google, so it gives me the option to log into.
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.120]   That's the one.
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:50.320]   Yeah, once you're logged into one Google site, you're logged into all, right?
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:51.600]   That's it.
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:52.320]   You nailed it.
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:55.040]   Well, Apple has a proposal for his log in.
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.760]   Apple has a proposal and Google has one called WebID.
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:02.320]   So this sounds different.
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:06.640]   And I can't worry about this.
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:07.440]   Okay, never mind.
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:08.640]   They're fighting over it.
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:10.800]   It might be a while.
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:12.960]   Virtual IDs.
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.720]   And this is to get rid of cookies?
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:16.480]   Or is it because cookies are still like?
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:16.960]   Because cookies are going to die.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:19.760]   Yeah, everybody's killing cookies for privacy.
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:24.720]   But what about, I mean, if this weren't proposed by like advertising people,
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:29.280]   the World Federation of Advertisers pushing for things, I feel a little better about it.
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:30.800]   That's how it's going to support me, though.
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:35.520]   There is a benefit to being able to stay logged into things.
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:36.080]   Yes.
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:39.280]   As anyone who has cleared their cash can tell me.
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:40.560]   Oh, yes, Leo.
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:42.240]   Oh, my God.
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:42.400]   Oh, my God.
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:43.920]   Oh, my God.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:47.360]   So we did not commemorate it.
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:50.560]   And actually, I felt really bad when I got home last Wednesday,
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:53.040]   because it was 11/11.
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:58.880]   And of course, it was in the 11th minute of the 11th hour of the 11th day of November in 1918,
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:02.400]   that the war to end all wars ended World War I.
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:07.040]   And we celebrate Armistice Day on 11/11 because of it, where Poppy's to commemorate
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:10.080]   the fallen at Flanders Field, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:14.000]   I apologize for not mentioning that.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.520]   This is a fascinating project.
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:18.560]   I love this.
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:30.160]   The Imperial War Museum in the UK has an image of the sound of the end of the war.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:33.280]   But it's an image, not a recording.
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:35.760]   It was made on film of sound pressure impulses
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:40.960]   picked up by sound ranging equipment stationed along the allied front.
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:44.000]   The actual sound itself was long lost.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:50.800]   There were six tuned low frequency microphones arranged in an arc behind allied lines.
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:56.240]   The microphones were connected to a string galvanator at the forward listening position.
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:00.800]   A low frequency signal picked up by one of these microphones would move a thin wire in the
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:06.000]   galvanator and cast a shadow onto a piece of moving film.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.160]   Technology, huh?
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:12.800]   They never really made sound.
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:17.520]   The film would be developed after which analysts could decode the patterns on the film
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:20.640]   and they were using them to work out the positions of enemy guns.
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:28.480]   So the museum, the Imperial War Museum, had a picture of this, the end of the war,
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:29.920]   this recording.
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:37.840]   So they did a little forensic work and they were able to turn it into actual sound.
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:42.800]   And now here, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever,
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:50.880]   the sound of World War I ending November 11th, 19, 18.
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:49:02.160]   [Music]
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:03.040]   It's in stereo.
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:08.560]   So these are their artillery guns firing.
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:20.080]   And then word goes forth that an armistice has been signed,
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:27.440]   the war is over, and the guns go quiet.
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:31.280]   Can you imagine?
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:43.280]   That's, that's, and there's some birds.
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:46.080]   Yeah, and then birds.
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.960]   Can't imagine that at all.
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:50.800]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:53.040]   Wow.
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:55.680]   Wow.
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:59.120]   All right, let's take a little break when we come back.
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:02.320]   Your picks of the week, and then we're going to let Stacy get out of here
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:04.240]   for a Zoom Thanksgiving or something.
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:05.280]   I don't know what she's doing.
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:06.960]   Yes. Zoom Thanksgiving.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:07.360]   That's it.
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:12.320]   This episode of Twig brought to you by another great podcast you ought to know about.
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:13.600]   Remote Works.
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:14.640]   We talk all the time.
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:19.280]   Mike Elgin, of course, is the greatest proponent of working all over the world.
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:25.680]   Remote Works is a podcast that tells the amazing stories of teams that made the shift to
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:27.600]   working remotely.
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:28.640]   Season two just came out.
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:33.200]   The premiere is, you're going to, I think you're going to really enjoy this podcast.
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:36.720]   The premiere is racing into a new world of work.
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:42.000]   Melanie Green, she's the host, speaks with Aston Martin Red Bull racing drivers.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:46.720]   Max Verstop in an Alex Albin about what the pandemic taught them about adapting to work
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:47.840]   differently.
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:52.320]   Christian Horner, who's the Aston Martin Red Bull racing team principal shares insight
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:56.720]   to how he kept his team close when half of them were suddenly forced to work remotely.
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:59.920]   What does a race guard driver do when he's working remotely?
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:04.080]   I can think it had something to do with having the right technology.
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:09.920]   Also, the second episode of season two, Remote Works Extreme Arctic Edition.
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:17.360]   Imagine if you will, consider if you will, living in a tiny hut built in the 1930s,
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:20.240]   no running water, no electricity.
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:23.200]   The nearest town is 86 miles away.
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.120]   Your nearest neighbors are polar bears.
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:26.800]   Who would choose that?
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:29.600]   Wilson Eva Sorby and Hilda Follern-Strom.
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:35.040]   This is their home office in Svalbard, Norway.
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:40.960]   Listen, son of a comes from Squamish, British Columbia, a community of 19,000 people.
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:45.360]   Then this opportunity came along, the chance to live in this remote location
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:47.840]   and collect data to help scientists.
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:51.840]   This was a chance to make their contribution to fighting climate change.
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:56.800]   So they packed up and moved to Bumsaboo, and they've had to learn how to work with a lot
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:59.040]   of extremely complicated technology.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:01.280]   There are, it's not all freezing cold.
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:04.320]   They'll learn about digital nomads working from the beach in Barbados,
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:06.480]   Bali, and beyond.
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:07.760]   It's not just about remote work.
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:10.720]   Each episode is full of insight and advice you could apply to your work.
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:14.400]   And your team, look, we know distributed work brings challenges.
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:18.320]   We're all doing it these days, but it also can be opportunity.
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:20.000]   That's what remote works is all about.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:25.840]   Helping you find new ways to work, collaborate, and discover new possibilities.

[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:37.440]   Thank you, remote works and Citrix for your support.
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:38.640]   Remote works.
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:40.080]   What a good idea for a podcast.
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:45.200]   I wish I thought it was fascinating to see a sponsored content podcast like that.
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:45.920]   It's really smart.
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:53.440]   Yeah, because Citrix, of course, is the facilitating software that allows you to do remote access.
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:56.480]   Pardon me?
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:58.320]   Do they do Webex or go to meeting?
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:52:59.840]   Cisco does Webex.
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:01.680]   Citrix owns GoToMeeting.
[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:03.920]   Yeah, they own a lot.
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:06.080]   They, I think now actually they may not.
[01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:08.720]   Now, I think LogMein has acquired those.
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:11.520]   So, yeah, originally they created GoToMeeting.
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:12.320]   You're absolutely right.
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:17.920]   But the Citrix client is absolutely widely used in their price.
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:19.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:20.080]   As you well know.
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:26.240]   Our picks of the week stays in case you have to run out the door to your Zoom Thanksgiving.
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:27.440]   Why don't you kick things off?
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:29.840]   Okay, I have.
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:31.440]   Do you want something?
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:35.760]   Do you want to see something in action or do you want to see something that I haven't installed yet?
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:40.240]   Ah, both.
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:40.720]   Both.
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:41.840]   No, we're not time for those.
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:41.840]   Both.
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:42.400]   Pick one.
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:44.560]   I don't care whatever you like.
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:46.320]   Say the other one for next week.
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:49.600]   Yeah, whatever you do now, we'll save the other one for next week.
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:51.920]   I always promise y'all update something.
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:54.960]   Because I show you before I install them so you can see them,
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:56.320]   which I feel is kind of unfair.
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:57.440]   But...
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:00.000]   I know we have to see them in C2.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.600]   Oh!
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:03.120]   Then I have to take you with me to like my mailbox.
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:04.480]   It's the exploding ring cam.
[01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:05.920]   No, no, no, no.
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:07.760]   This one I'm not going to put.
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:10.000]   Do not hammer a nail through the battery.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:10.720]   Exactly.
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:13.360]   I'm going to follow the basic rules.
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:15.120]   You know, I have a ring camera for years.
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:15.840]   I installed it.
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:16.720]   I didn't blow it up.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:18.480]   This isn't a ring camera.
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:19.440]   All of these instructions.
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:20.480]   But this is what is this?
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.560]   This is the ring doorbells.
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:26.560]   Sorry, this is the ring mailbox sensor that will work with the ring footage.
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:27.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:30.480]   This is that Amazon thing, right?
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:31.520]   This is sidewalk?
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:32.400]   Is this sidewalk?
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:35.760]   Okay, so this is not sidewalk yet.
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:38.320]   One day the ring bridge,
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:41.200]   so you need a ring bridge and you need this sensor.
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:42.400]   This is the sensor.
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:43.280]   God, it's huge.
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:44.560]   Good lord.
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:47.680]   Okay, there you go.
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:50.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, our first review, a hands-on.
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:52.080]   First unboxing.
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:52.560]   God, it's weird.
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:53.760]   You do things big.
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:55.520]   Wow.
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:56.320]   Where does it go?
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:57.280]   Does it go on the door?
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:57.760]   Do you have to have a...
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:59.120]   It goes in your mailbox.
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:54:59.920]   It just goes in there.
[01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:04.320]   It goes in your mailbox and when it goes off, it opens and it's like,
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:05.840]   "Oh, hey, you got mail."
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:08.880]   This is go, "You've got mail."
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:12.000]   It does not, but I bet I could set up an
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.040]   Madam May notification.
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:13.600]   You can make it easier to do an if-
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:14.480]   Just then that.
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:16.000]   So which part goes where?
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.160]   Well, that's a good question.
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:20.240]   Again, literally just unbox it.
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:20.720]   I do a one, you can find it.
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:20.800]   One, two, three.
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:23.440]   My bet is this is a mount.
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:24.800]   So if I wanted to, I could mount it.
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:27.120]   This is a PIR sensor.
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:27.920]   Okay, what's that?
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:28.560]   Infrared?
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:30.240]   Uh-huh.
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:30.960]   Yeah.
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:35.200]   So when light, the mailbox is opened,
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:37.520]   light comes in and that triggers the PIR sensor.
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:38.560]   That's my bet.
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:40.080]   And this plugs into something?
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:41.840]   I don't see where it plugs in just yet.
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:42.880]   But my...
[01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:45.040]   What was motion as a door opening or something?
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:45.520]   Hold on.
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:46.160]   Yeah, we'll see.
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:46.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:47.520]   It's motion.
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:48.000]   It's motion.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:48.800]   Oh, it is motion.
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:49.040]   Okay.
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:50.400]   It's motion or...
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:55.440]   Yeah, it's any sort of movement and light counts as movement.
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:58.320]   This looks like it slides on to something.
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:01.200]   I'm guessing this is a puck that stands outside.
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:03.600]   So because your mailbox is like a Faraday cage,
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:05.360]   so you can't get the signal out of it.
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:06.720]   Oh, that's exactly what it is.
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:07.120]   Sure.
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:10.160]   So that's what I'm thinking this is, the antennas and such.
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:11.200]   And I don't see where this goes.
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:12.880]   Maybe in here.
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:14.640]   Anyway, haven't installed it yet.
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:16.480]   We'll tell you next week how it works.
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:18.080]   But this is my thing of the week.
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:23.120]   Oh, this is $29.99 and you do need a ring bridge to work with it.
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:24.080]   Oh, this is the sticker.
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:25.920]   So yeah, this goes on the outside of your mailbox.
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:27.520]   Yeah, that's what exactly what it is.
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:28.720]   Yeah, so that's...
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:31.600]   And that would also be the antenna for sidewalk
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:33.600]   once the bridge is installed and all that.
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:35.520]   So this is for a rural...
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:37.360]   They call a rural mailbox.
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:40.080]   So what are the thing that has a door and...
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:40.880]   How do we have?
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:41.840]   Yeah, the kind we have.
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:45.600]   Yeah, like I have to walk a whole tenth of a mile to get to my mailbox.
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:46.160]   Real box?
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:46.560]   Yeah.
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:46.720]   Wow.
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:48.720]   I built it at acre.
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:50.240]   It's a long skinny acre too.
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:50.880]   That's 526 feet.
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:53.840]   That's a long way.
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:56.320]   Let me tell you when I'm bringing out the trash cans, I noticed.
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:57.520]   Oh, I used to have to do that.
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:00.880]   In fact, what we would do, what we ended up doing, we were so lazy.
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:03.120]   We had a van, we'd open the back door of the van.
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:07.040]   The kids would sit on the lip of the van and hold the trash cans and roll them out.
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:08.640]   I'd drive them out.
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:10.720]   That was probably insanely dangerous.
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:11.760]   Wow.
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:12.560]   Yeah, we don't do that.
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:13.840]   That was very lazy.
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:14.560]   Very lazy.
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:15.200]   Kids loved it.
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:18.240]   They begged it, bring out the trash.
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:24.000]   So in to be clear, this isn't sidewalk yet.
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:27.120]   Because the ring has not been certified.
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:30.560]   The ring bridge has not been certified yet as a sidewalk enabled device.
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:32.240]   But one day it will be.
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:32.720]   Oh yeah.
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:33.760]   So here's how it works.
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:36.240]   Or here's what it looks like when you've installed it.
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:39.760]   The sensor is going to go on the door of the mailbox.
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:40.320]   Oh, see, there you go.
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:42.000]   And then you're exactly right.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.520]   That's the antenna.
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:47.520]   And the reason they do it that way, of course, is the wire can go down below and out the opening
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:47.920]   like that.
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:51.520]   So you don't have to drill a hole in the box or something like that.
[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:52.560]   I'm tempted.
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:54.880]   I mean, I could see my mailbox from my front door.
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:57.520]   It's not like, but I never know if there's mail in it.
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:58.880]   Yeah.
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:00.880]   You know, you really, you have a problem.
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:04.880]   You don't want to walk 526 feet there and 526 feet back,
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:06.800]   which is now not a tenth of a mile.
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:08.240]   Disappointed because no one loves you.
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:10.080]   But if my math is correct, it's a 20.
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:11.440]   In the rain, y'all.
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:12.960]   Cold rain.
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:18.080]   So you don't want to, you in the rain, walk a 20th of a mile.
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:18.800]   That's a lot of.
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:21.280]   Not that I try.
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:22.800]   It's not that bad, but sure.
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:26.640]   Please don't write me.
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:28.080]   I know my math is wrong.
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:29.040]   Thank you, Stacy.
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:31.120]   Jeff, do you have a number?
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:32.320]   I do.
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:33.360]   I was fascinated by this.
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:37.600]   So Etsy got a huge surge thanks to masks.
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:41.120]   They've been growing in 20% a year.
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:41.520]   Yes.
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:42.720]   So does Lisa.
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:44.400]   Right.
[01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:47.520]   It's a growing 20% a year over the last five years.
[01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:49.200]   This year, they're growing 80 to 90%.
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:50.800]   Holy cow.
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:54.400]   So it took three years growth into one year.
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:55.920]   Now, not all that was masks.
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:57.360]   No, we should go there.
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:59.120]   You see all these other ideas.
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:02.160]   I bought three Christmas presents so far from Etsy.
[01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:03.200]   All these customers.
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:09.120]   So when the masking came, Etsy sent out a push notification
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:12.080]   to all their sellers saying, "Calling all sellers,
[01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:13.840]   start making face masks."
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:18.720]   And hundreds of thousands of existing in new sellers
[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:20.320]   started selling face masks.
[01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:22.880]   Some of Lisa's best face masks come from Etsy.
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:26.000]   And then you discover all that's cute too.
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.520]   Oh, I think I'll get that as well.
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:29.120]   And that's what that's what led to you through.
[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:29.520]   So interesting.
[01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:31.280]   Really smart, huh?
[01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:33.280]   I love that.
[01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:33.920]   Great number.
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:35.920]   Mr. Ant Proit.
[01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:37.760]   Your pick of the week.
[01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:37.920]   Okay.
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:42.720]   Well, mine is because you know, I love watching Netflix
[01:59:42.720 --> 01:59:46.000]   on the weekends or any type of docuseries.
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:49.840]   And this is probably something that's not new to many of you,
[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:52.800]   but it's called Song It's Bloder.
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:57.200]   And it's focusing on the musicians and artists
[01:59:57.200 --> 02:00:01.840]   as they sit down and begin to create the work of art
[02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:03.840]   that they're getting ready to put out.
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:06.960]   And in particular, I've watched the first two episodes.
[02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:10.640]   And the second episode was featuring Hamilton.
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:12.480]   Lin-Manuel Miranda.
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:12.880]   See?
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:13.040]   See?
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:15.120]   You like that one after all about it, huh?
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:15.440]   See?
[02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:15.920]   Hold on.
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:16.400]   Hold on.
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:16.880]   All right.
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:18.960]   And I'm like, watch Hamilton.
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:20.960]   But I respect the process.
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:25.680]   Some people don't know, but I used to be in the band.
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:28.640]   Even though I was an athlete, I was still in the band.
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:29.360]   I didn't know that.
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:31.120]   To march and things like that.
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:38.720]   And I was also in concert band and also in jazz on "S
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:39.280]   saxophones."
[02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:45.760]   And so I love the work and the process that goes into people
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:48.800]   sitting down and composing music.
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:49.280]   People--
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:52.080]   I'm going to piss some people off.
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:55.920]   But I give a little bit more credit to people that sit down
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:01:01.040]   and put a C on the F# on the staff, more so
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:03.120]   versus writing out lyrics.
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:07.920]   It just seems like it just takes a different type of brain to do that.
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:12.160]   But just the story behind those two episodes just really blew me away.
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:15.200]   Alicia Keys is another one that I love.
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:23.200]   And that song, "3-Hour Drive," the way it came together had two total polar opposites
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:32.560]   far as how her input came in versus the co-op artist in there, how his input came in.
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:37.280]   It's two different ends of the spectrum, but yet it melded it together to make this
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:38.080]   beautiful track.
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:40.480]   And it just-- it really warmed my heart.
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:43.200]   Because I heard the song before and never thought anything about it.
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:45.520]   But when I heard the story behind it, man, it--
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:47.600]   get your writing of feels.
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:52.080]   I actually watch a lot of the music programming on Netflix.
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:54.080]   They have some really good music documentaries.
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:54.800]   Oh, yeah.
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:56.960]   I even like the Taylor Swift ones a lot.
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:01.040]   Miss America, I actually really enjoyed that and the Gaga.
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:02.880]   I love that stuff.
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:05.760]   I love to see what it's like to be in that life.
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:09.840]   So I have not watched song exporter.
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:11.520]   I see it in my grid.
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:13.440]   So thank you for the recommendation.
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:14.320]   I will watch it.
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:15.360]   Yeah, I love that stuff.
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:20.000]   We've come to the conclusion in the nick of time,
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.120]   because it's time for a Zoom Thanksgiving.
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:26.160]   Now, for those of you who'd like to stick around for our Zoom Thanksgiving,
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:28.640]   we will be doing that after the show.
[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:31.840]   But meanwhile, Stacy has to get the hell out of here.
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:33.760]   Stacy on IOT.com.
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:35.760]   Subscribe.
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:38.160]   We're not having a Zoom Thanksgiving after the show.
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:38.720]   Oh, we're not.
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:39.760]   Oh, I misunderstood.
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:40.800]   Never mind.
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:42.320]   What next week is Thanksgiving?
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:43.200]   No, I'm kidding.
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:43.760]   I'm kidding.
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:43.760]   I'm kidding.
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:44.400]   He's hurting us.
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:46.800]   I'm not even going to be here next week.
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:47.600]   We're going to be on Jason.
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:48.720]   I won't even be dessert.
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:49.760]   No.
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:52.320]   It'll be a short show and we'll talk only about Google.
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:52.960]   Oh, God.
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:54.960]   You guys are going to really show me up.
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:56.720]   You probably will too.
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:02:57.440]   I know that.
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:02:58.480]   Dang it.
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:03.200]   We should mention, by the way, that Apple has announced
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:06.880]   that even though they own all rights to the Charlie Brown specials,
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:11.760]   they are going to let the Peanuts holiday specials
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:13.120]   err on public television.
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:14.320]   What are they charging for?
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:15.280]   Yeah, I don't know.
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:16.080]   I don't know.
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:20.320]   But I'm glad because it felt bad that if you didn't have an Apple TV subscription,
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:24.720]   you wouldn't be able to watch these kind of classic Peanuts episodes.
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:27.200]   So I'm glad that they're going to put them back on broadcast.
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:28.640]   In fact, that's a better place to put them.
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:33.120]   No Dolly Madison ads though, but those zinger ads, but that's the way it is.
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:35.840]   Stacey on IOT.com.
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:36.640]   Listen to her podcast.
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:39.360]   She does with Kevin Tofel, the IOT podcast.
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:43.520]   I didn't get around to Om Malek's amazing article on the Apple.
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:44.640]   It's a good one.
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:46.400]   But I highly interviewed everybody.
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:48.480]   He had some brilliant insights.
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:52.080]   Om, it's like the Om of old.
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:53.920]   It was really great to read that article.
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:57.520]   So just that's your assignment for the week.
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:00.800]   Because I felt like we did enough M1 stuff last week.
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.360]   People were getting upset, but it really is a great article.
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:06.320]   Your old boss at Giga Om.
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:10.880]   Thanks to Ant Pruitt, hands on wellness, hands on photography.
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:12.480]   You're doing the low key thing.
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:17.040]   Escarit sir, low key portrait photography.
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:19.360]   We're going to do a lab.
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.600]   So I'm going to walk you through setting up your lights and
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:23.440]   nice camera snapping it nice.
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:24.960]   You're going to love it.
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:25.520]   You can't wait.
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:29.680]   You can find it at twit.tv/hop and twit.
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:30.080]   That's right.
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:33.680]   How? Thank you also to Jeff Jarvis.
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:36.960]   My friend Jeff is, as you probably know by now,
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:40.720]   a Google shareholder, former TV critic,
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:44.160]   and the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:48.000]   at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000]   At the City University of New York.
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:55.040]   Did you know that Wrigley was originally a soap maker?
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:59.760]   And they put gum in the soap to get people to buy the soap.
[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:02.960]   And people like the gum better, so they stop making the soap.
[02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:04.400]   And they start to make the soap.
[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:05.360]   I don't get how this happened.
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:09.360]   No, the gum was a come on to get people to buy the soap.
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:10.720]   Oh, oh, oh, I see.
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:13.520]   Free gum with this bar of soap.
[02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:15.200]   And it turned out people really didn't care about the soap.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:16.080]   So they made it.
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:17.840]   They said, we're getting in the gum business now.
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:21.840]   Another little tidbit from that great book, Clean.
[02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:23.120]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:24.640]   We do this week in Google.
[02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:26.320]   Sometimes it even has to do with Google.
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:31.440]   Every Wednesday roundabout 2 p.m. Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:33.120]   2100 UTC.
[02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:34.720]   Here's how you can watch.
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:36.720]   You just go to twit.tv/live.
[02:05:36.720 --> 02:05:38.160]   There's a live video stream.
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:40.320]   There's also audio if you want to just listen,
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:41.200]   maybe because you're at work.
[02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:49.200]   If you are available, chat with us as you listen at twit.irc.tv.
[02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:52.480]   But there is no stigma to people who don't watch live.
[02:05:52.480 --> 02:05:55.440]   In fact, most everybody listens after the fact
[02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:57.040]   because it's a podcast.
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:06:02.000]   You can get on-demand versions of the show at our website, twit.tv/twig.
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.400]   All our shows are there in audio and video.
[02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:06.640]   You can also get it on YouTube.
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:09.280]   There's a whole YouTube channel devoted to this week in Google.
[02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:14.480]   Best way to get it though, subscribe, get your favorite podcast application,
[02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:19.680]   search for Twig, and then that way it'll automatically download whenever the show is available.
[02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:25.440]   If you are not listening live, you want to still interact with us.
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:26.640]   We have a great forum.
[02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:28.080]   I want to recommend it.
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:33.280]   It's the Twit community at www.twit.com.
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:33.840]   Thanks everybody.
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:36.720]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:37.200]   Bye-bye.
[02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:40.240]   I'm Jason Howell, host of Hands-On Android,
[02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:43.440]   where each week I take a look at the Android operating system
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:46.160]   and really dive deep into what it can do for you
[02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:48.640]   and how it can improve your quality of life,
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:51.200]   whether it be tips and tricks on how to use it better,
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:55.280]   whether it can be little known secrets that open up a world of possibilities,
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:58.640]   so many topics to dive into, including your emails.
[02:06:58.640 --> 02:07:02.240]   Subscribe by going to twit.tv/hoa.
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:07.120]   We'll see you there.
