[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.380]   It's time for Tweg. This week in Google, we're just off Samsung's Note 10 announcement.
[00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.880]   Actually, Samsung has to a few things. We'll break it all down for you.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.320]   Talk about Elizabeth Warren's plan for World Broadband.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.480]   And Google's little trick. It's pulling on the European Commission.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.840]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.880]   What's the surprise appearance for Matt Pruitt?
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.360]   He's all coming up next on Tweg.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.560]   Netcast, you love.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.400]   From people you trust.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.400]   This is Tweg.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:44.400]   This is Tweg. This week in Google, episode 520, recorded Wednesday, August 7th, 2019.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.400]   Call me when it comes in shimmer.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.400]   This week in Google is brought to you by Epson's Eco Tank Pritters. Kiss expensive cartridges.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.400]   Goodbye. At an Epson Eco Tank printer to your home or office, Epson's Eco Tank comes with a ridiculous amount of ink.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.400]   Just fill and chill. Check out Epson.com/EcoTec.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.400]   It's time for Tweg. This week in Google, the show where we cover the latest in the Google verse.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.400]   That includes Facebook, Twitter, journalism, chips, IOT, whatever.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.400]   Whatever our expert panel wants to talk about, starting with Stacey Igenbotham of Stacey on IOT.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.400]   Hello Stacey!
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.400]   How are you? Yay!
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.400]   Stacey's already broken in because we just covered the Samsung event.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.400]   We will talk about that in just a little bit, the new Note 10.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.400]   I don't know if I care for the idea of being broken in.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.400]   Like a good new Stacey like a phone.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.400]   Oh, sure.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.400]   That's Jeff Jarvis. He is on the road again. He's in Palo Alto with Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.400]   The hardest working man in a journalism school, J-School.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.400]   Full disclosure is I'm here for tomorrow, a one day thing on the Facebook oversight board.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.400]   Oh.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.400]   They're paid for the hotel, but I don't receive anything else from Facebook personally in any way or any platform.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.400]   This is part of that journalism matter initiative that they're doing.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   Well, this is the oversight board about how they do content moderation.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.400]   Oh, I did. You're on that board.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   No, no, no, no on the board, but they have these meetings where they're trying to get input, they're being reported about it.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   And it's more, I'm getting more and more involved when I like it or not in policy.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   So, that's fine here. That's my disclosure.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   But we have another important test.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.400]   Our newest, Twit.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.400]   Aunt Pruitt is in the house.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   We love Aunt Tech Republic writer.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   He's got his own YouTube channel and he's been on any of our shows including this show many times the last few years.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   And somehow, I don't know how, Lisa convinced Aunt and the family to move out from North Carolina.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   They're going to be coming to Petaluma and being part of the Twit family. I'm so thrilled.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   That's so great.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   Isn't that great?
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   So excited.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   You're here to end it a month.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.400]   Aunt was sitting over there studying, I guess he's getting ready to take over.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   And I said, "Well, come on on to the show. Get on this show. As long as you're here, let's do it."
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   But full disclosure, you didn't know and you weren't prepared.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   Yeah, I'm so glad you were running through that.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   You're running through that as quick as I can.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   Neither are we.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.400]   That's the truth.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   So, Jeff and Stacy were both here.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.400]   Actually, you were here too watching the Samsung Unpacked 2019 event where they announced a surprisingly large number of products.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.400]   We knew they were going to announce a Note 10 and a Note 10 Plus.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   And there really were no surprises there.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.400]   It's a pretty nice looking fablet if you can still use that phrase.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   Was the phone even the story?
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   It was a little bit.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   I mean, that was the sensible part for the 6.3 inch, 6.8 inch Note with a stylus.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   What do you think the story was, Aunt?
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   I like the idea of the tablets, you know, because it seems like we already knew what the phone was going to be about.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400]   There was no surprises there.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.400]   That's true.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   And like the S6 had actually been announced, but they were, gave us more details on that.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   Really, the big surprise was to see Microsoft CEO, such a Nadella, stride on stage.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   Even after there was already a Microsoft VP demonstrating there's an app called Your Phone and Windows that lets you pair a Samsung or other Android phone with your Windows machine so you can see the Samsung screen get text, make phone calls.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   There's going to be, I guess, a tighter integration.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.400]   They'll also be part of the Samsung DEX.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:47.400]   That's their desktop environment where you dock your phone or connect it with a USB-C cable to a monitor keyboard and mouse and suddenly you've got a PC.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.400]   It'll also work with Windows PCs now so that you'll, in effect, you were confused by that, Stacey.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.400]   And I don't blame you.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   It looked like you had a Samsung on top of your Windows kind of.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:06.400]   Yeah, I just, I still, I mean, I get the utility of having bringing things from my phone to my computer very easily because, like, you're like, "Oh, I'm working on an email."
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   And you're like, "Oh, I got to take this out."
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   But I was really up at the time.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:19.400]   That's kind of what Apple does, which is continuity, which is the idea that you can be working on a phone and then it will automatically just do a hand off to the Mac or vice versa.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   By the way, they did say PC or Mac, Scooter X or Chatmod is saying.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   So it wasn't that they're excluding the Macintosh.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.400]   It wasn't that Microsoft has some special relationship.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.400]   And frankly, I would guess it goes both ways.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   Microsoft isn't going to say, "Well, we're only going to work with Samsung."
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   Microsoft's current strategy is to work everywhere their users are.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   Mac, PC, Android, whatever.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   For this, the next to continue to be a feature, I'd like to know what are the numbers on usage.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   That's the option.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   You know, who's using that?
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.400]   Because they went from the dock to now just a regular dongle.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   Although you've been able--
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   That looks like just a cord.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   Was it just a USB cord?
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.400]   So that's what's unclear.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.400]   You can buy for--well, this is a little pricey.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   Samsung makes a DEX USB-C cable.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.400]   But I was able to buy it.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   Let me see if I can find it here.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   A cheap, like, yeah, here's a $25 DEX adapter that comes with what you really need.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   Extra ports.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   Well, it's not extra in a sense.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.400]   Because remember, you're connecting a keyboard mouse and monitor to it.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.400]   But yeah, I guess there's one extra.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.400]   There's a type C.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.400]   Type C.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.400]   That's $25.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.900]   I paid, I think, $15 for one.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.240]   They all work about the same.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.760]   You don't need to buy Samsung's expensive DEX puck to do this.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.400]   Actually, this looks like a really good one.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   I might order another one.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.400]   You can never have a USB-C power in.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.400]   Since I never use it.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.400]   Oh, yeah, that's what the USB-C for.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.400]   You're absolutely right.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.400]   That's power.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.400]   Yeah, I'm using that right now.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.400]   I'm using a J5 create.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.400]   On what?
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.400]   On your--
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.400]   Right now, so that way I can put the headset in and I'm using Ethernet and its power.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.400]   I'm using my Dell external monitor with USB-C, which has been my new favorite.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   I'm using my Surface Studio for the very last time.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.400]   No one.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.400]   I'm giving it to the end.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.400]   My precious.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.400]   Hello.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.400]   Hello.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.400]   It's going to be his desktop at work.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.120]   Then I have ordered a new Lenovo.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.520]   It's kind of equivalent, but more modern, more up to date, and about $1,000 less than
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.520]   the Surface.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.440]   It has a pen, just like-- everybody's got a pen now.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.600]   That was actually one of the things I was curious about with a note.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.520]   I have the Samsung Galaxy S10.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.520]   Love it.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   It's got an iced phone.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.520]   Does everything I want?
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.600]   Is an 855 Snapdragon in here?
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.720]   I thought, what am I going to need the note 10 for?
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.560]   They kind of won me over with the pen, because a pen looks like you can make gestures.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.720]   You can write and it will convert your text to your handwriting to text, which is not
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.720]   new, but it's--
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.360]   Yeah, I told you it's my handwriting.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.440]   There's a lot of people that really dig that stylus.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.560]   You and I, we talked about Mrs. Pruitt and her affinity for the note until she got a
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.560]   hold of Vanilla Android.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.560]   That was an interesting story.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.560]   Yeah, tell me that story.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.560]   She got a hold of Vanilla Android.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.560]   She got a Pixel, right?
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.520]   She got a Pixel a couple years ago, and the note 8, I believe, came out.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.160]   And I remember her loving the note.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160]   So I said, I'll just get her the note 8.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.640]   Got her the note 8.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.520]   She was like, what is all of this stuff?
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.520]   It's all the stuff.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   It's all the stuff.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.520]   You know, so she was like, can I just have a Pixel again?
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.200]   And I got her a Pixel.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.640]   And we came to the conclusion.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.840]   She really loved the stylus with the note.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.440]   Because she does a whole lot of note taking and keeping her day squared away.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.440]   So does she miss the note?
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.560]   Does she want to go back?
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.880]   If only it was clean like Vanilla Android.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.880]   She's made it very clear.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.880]   Why doesn't Google pop a stylus in there?
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.600]   That might actually be kind of nice.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.080]   It's also interesting, and Scooter X is reminding me that they talked, Samsung talked about
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.080]   gaming and how gaming, especially on a big phone like that, 6.8 inch phone.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.560]   Sounds like a horsepower.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.720]   And lots of horsepower is a really now moving to mobile.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:21.280]   They send their building Discord, the chat client, into their Samsung phones.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.080]   So they have a partnership with Discord, which is a little discordant, if you'll forgive
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.080]   me.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.080]   I wonder if--
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.080]   It's a pretty grim shot.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.480]   But you know, I don't-- first of all, you can easily add a Discord app to your phone.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.080]   I don't know why you need to have it built in.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.400]   But I guess because it can be used while you're gaming.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.400]   But what wants to do that?
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.400]   I mean, you're gaming.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.840]   How are you gaming, and chatting at the same time?
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.440]   They said, you could say GG now.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.440]   I don't need to.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.400]   The millennials can figure that out, I guess.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.400]   I guess that's who it's for.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.880]   Yeah, we're out of that league.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.880]   So they're--
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.840]   Too old for this phone.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.840]   Too old.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.600]   You know, I actually had that feeling watching because they brought in a bunch of influencers,
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.080]   travel blog, vloggers.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.920]   Basically it was a bunch of Instagram and YouTube stars, right, to demonstrate the
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.920]   features of it.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   Right.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.920]   And it really did feel like it was more for that crowd.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.240]   I thought it really interesting.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.920]   Instead of using pre-built Snapchat style filters with Instagram or Snapchat or whatever
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:23.400]   platform you're on, you can actually use the pen to draw a new filter that would just
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.880]   like the Snapchat filters sync up with the face, move with the face.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.680]   You can create 3D images in real time of something sitting in front of you.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.680]   That was impressive.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.080]   Animate it with your emotions.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.160]   That was impressive.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:43.320]   But this isn't the same processor we've seen all year, Stacey, the Snapdragon 855.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.000]   I mean, why-- anybody could do this, right?
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.520]   Oh, wait, what?
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.480]   Is this the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855?
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.800]   We lost our Snapchat.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   No, no.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.920]   Sorry, I was just influencing.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.560]   I didn't apologize.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.240]   I was reading ships stats.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.240]   That's what I want you to do.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.720]   That's what I'm going to you for.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.720]   I was coming.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.720]   I was like hurry up.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.640]   Well, OK, I apologize because we just got all this information.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.760]   They did announce a new Exynos, which according to a non-tech-- and this of course would be
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   for the international version of the note-- according to a non-tech is not a big difference
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.720]   from the existing Exynos, the 9825.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.720]   Actually, no.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.720]   No, it is.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.800]   It's 7 nanometers.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.720]   I was going to say the only difference is it's actually a really big difference.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.720]   It could be bad.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.040]   I don't know.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:39.320]   It's their first 7 nanometer chip built using EUV, which is extreme ultraviolet lithography,
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.360]   which is a way to deal with leakage on the chips.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.760]   But it's a brand new manufacturing process.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.680]   Oh, you know what that means.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.920]   It could be good.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.920]   It could be bad.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.440]   But yeah, it might be dicey.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.080]   So I was going to say it is just a smaller version.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.440]   So they moved down of the 8 nanometer.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.760]   It's also a different-- yeah.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.280]   It's the same chip made at 7 nanometers.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.040]   So I don't know.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.040]   I mean--
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.040]   Who knows?
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.040]   No one knows.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.040]   It's new.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.040]   Who knows?
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.800]   They kept the cores like the frequencies.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.120]   They kept those mostly the same.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.320]   So it's not like you're going to see a sudden power boost here.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.400]   I think-- let's see.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.960]   What do they change?
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.040]   It's basically the same except at the middle cores.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.760]   They're going to go from 3.1 gigahertz to 2.4 gigahertz
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.200]   for those of you guys who are counting all your hertz here.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.640]   Do you think they're going to put in a dedicated AI or DSP,
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.800]   kind of like Google does with their Pixel phones
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.680]   for photography?
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.120]   Right now they have the Mali, the ARM Mali core.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.520]   They've built their own GPU, which is probably good enough.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.760]   I mean, even though Google's got their dedicated processor,
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.680]   I don't think we know the workloads yet on the phones
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.120]   that are going to need this.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.840]   Like some other things they're showing might benefit
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.760]   from a slightly different chip design.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.760]   But they're just not that new, really.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.120]   I mean, we've seen--
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.240]   Adobe was able to do this with an iPhone.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.400]   They're the 3D mapping three or four years ago.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.800]   Yeah, I'm thinking about things like handling
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.240]   the zoom in on the mic.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.000]   I mean, I'm trying to think about--
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.920]   and you've got the fingerprint recognition.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.840]   I don't know how-- do you train it,
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.400]   and that model just gets executed, or are you
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.400]   training it all the time?
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.880]   One thing that is new is there is a time of flight sensor
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.040]   on the back of the phone.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.520]   Does the iPhone have a time of flight sensor
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.520]   for tracking your face, or do they use a different--
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.880]   No, they paint your face with red dots.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.560]   No dots, sorry.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.120]   They have the infrared dot projection to give you--
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.640]   so they both have kind of the same purpose,
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.680]   which is to get depth information.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.400]   Time of flight measures the time it takes to bounce stuff
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.200]   off of you, as opposed to a map.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.120]   So an R.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.400]   So there-- Yeah.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.000]   What was in your lighthouse camera?
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.760]   That's right.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.200]   Was a time of flight sensor.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.000]   So North America, China, and Japan
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   will get the Snapdragon 855 Europe,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.840]   and the rest of the world is Exynos 9825.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.520]   I do have to say people have been complaining
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.480]   about the Exynos version of the Galaxy S10.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.840]   That it's got issues--
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.280]   And--
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.360]   Well, sluggish at times.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.440]   And--
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.040]   Yep.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.680]   Try to remember what some of the other issues were.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.200]   People were not happy with the camera in the Exynos version.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.080]   It couldn't do as good a job as the camera in the Qualcomm
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.640]   version.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.360]   6.3 and 6.8 inches, 1,200 nits brightness.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.320]   That's a nice bright--
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.640]   that's a very bright screen.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.680]   HD or 10 plus.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.080]   The Samsung makes the best screens ever.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.240]   8 gigs of RAM in the small version.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.240]   The plus will have 12 gigs of RAM.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.480]   Internal storage, 256 gigs, or 512 gigs on the plus,
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.400]   if you want to pay for it.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.520]   Plus, it looks like no micro SD card in the Note 10,
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.600]   only in the Note 10 Plus.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.000]   So for a lot of people, you're going to want to go with the Note
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.440]   Hokes, Note 10 Plus.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.040]   Because they also mentioned 45 watt charging.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.680]   That's Note 10 Plus only.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.160]   Oh, wow.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:04.660]   Really?
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:05.960]   That incast that.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.600]   Why screw us people with smaller hands over,
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.440]   or people with pockets that are not--
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.000]   Small hands people are not good people.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.680]   Hey.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.600]   I didn't say that.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.760]   You should get rid of all the small hands people.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.960]   All people with tiny hands.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.480]   Not a little bit run for office.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   I know.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.320]   Oh, look at the size of that man's hands.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:29.960]   They're huge.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.000]   He's got huge.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.160]   I just-- if you just show your hands, everybody,
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.720]   I have the smallest hands.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.600]   I bet I'm even smaller than you, Stacey.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:36.960]   Show me.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:37.920]   Do it.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:38.440]   Show.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.640]   I have-- look at that.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.080]   Look at that.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.920]   She's got monster hands.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.720]   So I'm a small hand.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.600]   I admit it.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.720]   Stacey, you're OK.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.640]   I have a quarter octave reach on the piano.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.080]   But I like a big phone.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.000]   I cannot lie.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.840]   I do not like big phones.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.440]   I love them.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.640]   I love the largest screens.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.640]   You're a big guy, though.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.480]   You're 6'2".
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.840]   Well, but still, even when I'm dealing with my creative stuff,
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.000]   I love the extra real estate with it.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.480]   Well, that's what they're putting.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.640]   Would you ever edit video on that?
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:13.400]   I just edited one while watching the live stream.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.400]   Geez.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.360]   So he's the young.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.520]   This is his night for.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.000]   I am not the young.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.280]   I still like the idea that they were trying to have the
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.840]   influences out there and pushing it and whatnot.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:31.040]   But I think someone can still team up with them like Adobe
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.360]   to bring out all of this extra horsepower.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.800]   Rush on this would look great.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.960]   Rush would look good.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.240]   But I was thinking more along Adobe Capture, because I've
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.120]   used Capture to Capture.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.520]   That's the one that has a 3D.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.000]   You can pick up textures and things like that.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.200]   But use that to scan a laptop or whatever and pull it into
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.160]   dimension in Australia.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.520]   Isn't it interesting that Samsung is building in that
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.280]   capability and video editing, it's going to come with a phone,
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.800]   a Samsung tool to cut.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.600]   That's interesting.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.560]   It at least is trying to give me $1,000 worth of tool.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.960]   That's a good point.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.720]   Oh, that's a good-- yeah.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.080]   That's a good point.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.640]   The biggest battery will be in the 10 plus 43 milliamp hours.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.960]   4300 milliamp hours.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.880]   That's a lot.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.240]   43 amp hours.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:21.680]   A 10 megapixel dual pixel front camera, F2.2 with 4K video.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.040]   That's the front camera, though.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.720]   Of course, the rear cameras, will there be three of them?
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:34.640]   Effective angle of shooting will be 77, 123, and 45 will be
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.400]   the telephoto.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.840]   So you have a very wide angle, 123 degree wide angle.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.800]   A telephoto 45 degree in the middle will be a 77 degree.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.960]   The middle camera is the one with all of the features,
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.840]   the big size pixels, the tri-stack CMOS sensor,
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.040]   the adjustable aperture.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.600]   It can go down to F1.5, which I think is very interesting.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.600]   That's nice, but if you don't know how to focus,
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.760]   that's no good.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.760]   Didn't you love, though, that you can have bouquet in both
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.160]   stills and video?
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.520]   Real time bouquet.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.560]   Again, if you don't know how to focus--
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.120]   If you don't know how to focus.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.080]   I want to give you a bouquet.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.920]   It's the blurry background.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.400]   It's that.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.280]   Skype does it now, but Skype does a terrible job.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.680]   And there's really a natural--
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.240]   It looks so bad.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.960]   Some people can use it.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.320]   The point is you could do it in software now.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.360]   And that's the story with this phone,
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.600]   is look at all the cool crap you can do with software.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.440]   Yay.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.680]   It will use, as I said, the time of flight sensor,
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.280]   and that's how it's going to do.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.240]   See, we were able to do that Adobe scanning
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.480]   without that depth sensor.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.120]   I imagine it'll be better if you have something.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.680]   Seems like it'd be a lot better now.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.040]   Additional information.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.640]   There's such a high demand for designers today
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.440]   with 3D objects, whether it's gaming,
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.040]   or whether it's from--
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.920]   Yeah, even if you kind of get a rough image,
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.440]   you at least get an image you could show and share.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.920]   I think that's going to be very interesting.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.960]   I really do want to play with that.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.720]   The fight--
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.920]   Remember that the naked mirror, which
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.240]   does a 3D scan of your body, and then talks to you about weight
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.160]   loss and that sort of thing, do you guys remember that?
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.760]   Or am I the only one who?
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.440]   Trying to forget.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:26.120]   But the point is, the point is having that on your phone
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.320]   is pretty powerful for things like, hey,
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.160]   will this furniture fit in my room, too?
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.720]   Will these clothes fit me?
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.520]   You could start creating--
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.240]   I just use my phone to measure me for shirts.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:38.640]   Is that wild?
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.600]   You put it on the ground.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.840]   And then you stand in front of it.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.240]   They give you an outline, and you stand,
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.280]   and you do a profile, and you do a phone.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:45.960]   I ordered the shirt.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.520]   We'll see how well it does.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.120]   That's pretty cool.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.840]   It was quick.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.800]   If it actually gives me a custom tailored shirt,
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.320]   I'll be blown away.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.600]   And that sort of thing, making that commonplace
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.960]   in the models that are generated by that accessible,
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:01.760]   that's going to be awesome.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.200]   Imagine, especially for people with long arms like me,
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.880]   that would really make my day, because I hate shopping
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.880]   just for that reason right now.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:15.480]   There will be 5G variants of both phones, $100 extra for the S
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.160]   for the Note 200, $200 extra for the Note 10 plus.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.120]   But Stacey, you don't think somebody should run out
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.280]   and get a 5G phone today?
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.200]   No.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.560]   I mean, we don't know how it's going to handle battery life.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.520]   The antennas are--
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.400]   This is the first iteration of the technology.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.040]   It's not going to be awesome in your phone.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.240]   And there's really not a compelling reason for most people
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.280]   to do this, because you're going to hit a bandwidth cap,
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.960]   or you're going to be throttled down.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.640]   So don't do it.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.880]   Wait till next year's devices come out with 5G.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.560]   They'll be cheaper.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.360]   They'll be better.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.120]   There's no point in doing it if your carrier doesn't offer 5G
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.840]   in your neck of the woods at all.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.160]   Also, there's that.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.560]   How many markets is it in you?
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.400]   I don't know how many markets.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   And it depends on where you are in the market.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:08.800]   That's true.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.240]   You could say Providence, which is supposedly 5G market.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.360]   But I bet you my mom just outside of town limits,
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.240]   she's not going to get it.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.800]   You probably have to be downtown.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.240]   And again, I don't think you need it.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.120]   Somebody I was talking to said something really smart,
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.760]   which is I really wish the carriers would stop focusing on
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.080]   getting the fastest speeds in just a few places
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.880]   and bring every place that sucks up to a middle level.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.520]   So instead of--
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.600]   Why not do you have consistency?
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.680]   Yeah, consistently good service as opposed
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.040]   to these pockets of like, I can download
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:50.360]   an entire season of Game of Thrones in 20 seconds.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.040]   So why is not a wireless?
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.560]   But I'm wired.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.200]   This was Warren put out an issue of all day.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.080]   I loved her proposal.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.280]   I think the book marked it.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.400]   I don't know you guys.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.440]   Really?
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.200]   Yeah, so--
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.720]   Let me read the actual proposal.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.000]   Yeah, OK.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.840]   We'll talk-- let's defer that till we finish the note 10.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.600]   Because I do want to talk about it.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.440]   I read it and I thought, yeah.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.480]   But maybe not.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.480]   And so we'll talk about it.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.080]   And again, it's a proposal from a presidential candidate.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.560]   And even if she got elected, she might not
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.720]   even be able to make it happen.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.720]   Because presidential candidates promise many things,
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.160]   often few of them.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.760]   Really?
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.320]   Materialized, really?
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.080]   True.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.200]   Really?
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:38.560]   Really?
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.080]   You could explain this to your kids later.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.920]   So don't get all excited about the 5G model, unless you really
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.520]   know you're in a 5G neighborhood and you've already got it.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.560]   And Verizon says they're going to do it in 50 cities by the end--
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.480]   well, 30 cities by the end of this year.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.200]   We said the same thing about 4G.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.720]   And the first iteration that--
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.720]   I'll get your hopes up.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.760]   And just wait.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.480]   And also, the antennas are not ready yet.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.600]   So this generation is not going to be kind to the full battery life.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.480]   Yeah, not the 5G phone you want.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.840]   They're sticking with what I consider a subpar ultrasonic fingerprint
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.440]   sensor through the screen.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.600]   I don't like it on the S10.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.720]   Plus doesn't work very reliably.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.680]   I've seen now the future of under-screen fingerprint
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.480]   readers on the OnePlus 7 Pro.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.360]   I've talked about this before.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.080]   It's fast.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.720]   It's accurate.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.160]   It is not ultrasonic.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.080]   It's optical.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.680]   And it works really, really well.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.480]   So I'm a little disappointed.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.040]   I guess Samsung probably is committed to these sensors.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.200]   And it's going to take them a while to change.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.680]   Heart rate sensor, their face unlock is built in.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:43.240]   I use that actually as much on my S10 plus as anything else.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:48.680]   Qualcomm QC 2.0 fast charging on the Qualcomm processors.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.320]   USB PD, power delivery.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.280]   Wireless charging.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.040]   Reverse charging, which is the weird thing that Samsung does,
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.440]   where you could charge stuff on the back of your Samsung
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.200]   phone like your earbuds.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:07.880]   It's expensive, starting price $949 for the low end Note
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:14.960]   10, 1099 for the Note 10 plus with 256 gig storage.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:20.840]   If you want to max it out, 512 gig storage will cost you $1199.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.400]   But I'll probably do that because--
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.600]   Just had a heart attack.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:28.600]   It does come in as Stacy was very pleased to learn iridescent
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.200]   shimmery color as well as pink.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:32.640]   Mother of--
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.360]   I think we should call it shimmery.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.200]   Shimmer is good.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.000]   Shimmer is--
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.400]   Comes in shimmer.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.400]   Shimmer.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.440]   It's the first time Samsung has gone for a non-central camera
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:45.840]   positioning.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.840]   I'll show you.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.320]   I have the S10 and the camera is horizontal
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.320]   across the top.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.200]   Now it's going to be more like an iPhone where it's over on
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.400]   the side.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.560]   But it had to probably to make room for these extra sensors
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.040]   like the time of flight sensor, which apparently is not
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.920]   available on the Note 10, just the Note 10.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.640]   It won't make a difference in your composition.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.120]   No.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.200]   It's just fine.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.960]   You're looking at the biggest sensor.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.600]   The screen is a great viewfinder on the--
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.120]   A viewfinder on the side.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.160]   Best viewfinder possible, yeah.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.440]   Aura glow is that color.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.240]   That's what they call it.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.760]   Aura white, Nora black.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.600]   Those will all be available August 23.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.240]   I think pre-orders start tomorrow.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.120]   So get your finger ready.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.920]   Get your credit card warmed up.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.000]   If you're going to buy one of these, I guess we will.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.520]   I will.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:42.040]   And Jason Howell will, because it's our job.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.240]   It's our job.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.920]   You say it with such pain.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.440]   Oh, it hurts me.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.760]   No, you know what, and this is a very expensive time
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.400]   to hear from me, because I have to buy this.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.720]   I have to buy the Apple phone, the Pixel phone.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.080]   I have to buy-- I'm going to have to buy that Samsung Notebook.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.760]   I said, I'll just see what Windows are.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.840]   I'll hold the Chrome both Excel soon.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.840]   No, I'm not--
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.760]   We're waiting to hear, though.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.520]   Maybe we will.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.760]   I know we're doing it for the Pixel.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.720]   I honestly think you should watch, because Samsung also
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:14.040]   announced the Samsung laptop, the S. And that actually
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.920]   looks kind of interesting.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.160]   It's very thin.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.240]   It's a little heavier than it ought to be, 2.11 pounds.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.720]   But the thing that is most interesting
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.240]   is 23 hours battery life, because it's on an arm chip.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.200]   I presume it's on-- well, we talked about it, didn't we?
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.760]   The new Qualcomm CX part.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.560]   What do you-- what-- tell us about that, Stacey.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.720]   You're an expert on these chips.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.320]   Oh, the Qualcomm-- what is it?
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.160]   The Hs-- you keep surprising me.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.160]   I'm reading about the broadband.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.160]   Stacey, wake up.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.160]   You're coming back to the phone.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.160]   Stop bleeding.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.160]   Stop bleeding.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.160]   No, I know.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.640]   You believe in preparation.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.320]   That's my problem, and I apologize.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.520]   No, it's OK.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.120]   I just thought we were done with that.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:57.520]   Were we?
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.680]   Maybe we were.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.720]   I want to know if that's going to be a desktop class processor.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.840]   That's really my--
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.720]   They're comparing it.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.200]   The benchmarking I've seen is against the Intel Core i5,
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.520]   which is a table chip, but it's not high end.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.640]   No, but it's a good enough chip.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.680]   I'd be very happy if it's i5 speed.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.800]   Yeah, I'd take that.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.400]   So I'm like a 64-bit.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.480]   It's clock rate is 2.8 gigahertz.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:27.200]   So it's got an integrated Qualcomm GPU in it,
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.360]   so it's in Dreno 680.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:29.800]   And--
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.680]   I'll tell you why.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.520]   I'm nervous, because I did buy one of the very first ARM
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.960]   Windows machines, the HP NVX2, and it was literally unusable.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.320]   I mean, it's really sluggishly slow.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.480]   I like the form factor.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.080]   Love the form factor.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.400]   Oh, you know what might be the issue, though?
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:46.800]   What?
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.880]   Is how many Windows apps, when yours was out,
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.640]   were configured for the ARM 64?
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.280]   That may be part of the problem, right?
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.600]   You've got to get an ARM--
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.080]   Right, ARM 64.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.520]   Not only an ARM OS, but ARM apps.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.800]   Otherwise, you're running an emulation.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.360]   Well, so they weren't--
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.360]   the ARM Windows apps were for 32-bit cores for the longest time.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.480]   I think they're just doing the 64-bit when they--
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.080]   because I mean, the 64-bit ARM cores
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.320]   have only been out for a couple years.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:20.160]   So what you're saying is I should fire that sucker up.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.240]   You should buy one and see how it works,
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.440]   because this could be--
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.480]   Easy for you to say.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.000]   It is.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.120]   Well, it's only $9.99.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.720]   Only $1,000.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.920]   And in a way, I'm glad Samsung decided to not low-ball it,
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:39.880]   because you can't get a good laptop for less than $1,000.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.080]   That's a reasonable price for something like this.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.120]   And we just want a Netflix machine.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:44.680]   Right.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.520]   I'll be very interested to see if this processor, the 8CX,
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.920]   will-- it is 7 nanometers.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.200]   It is designed for computers.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.840]   It's not a mobile part.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.600]   And it doesn't require a fan?
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:59.400]   No fan?
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.680]   23 hours of battery life.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.200]   Now, a lot of people said, oh, yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.320]   But actually, that's the whole point of ARM, isn't it?
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.440]   All day battery life.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.720]   I'll say I believe it when I see it, because first of all,
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.840]   are they basing that on it just sitting around--
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.800]   They're saying continuous video playback.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.320]   So Netflix--
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.640]   That's not the most challenging thing.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.440]   Right.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.280]   All right, so Netflix--
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:22.840]   I mean, even this--
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.320]   I'm a browser and a bunch of other windows that would use more.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.760]   Even this beast of a machine right here from MSI,
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.480]   I believe it's out of inches.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.040]   16 hours of battery life.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:32.560]   It is?
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.720]   That's what they touted for.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.400]   That's a joke.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.520]   I'm getting nowhere near that.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.760]   I could tell you that, just looking at it.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.800]   I'm like, why would you feel the heat right here?
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.400]   I don't.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.280]   But see, this is-- and it has LTE, gigabit LTE built into it.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.040]   So this is really a mobile--
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.640]   this is to compete with the MacBook Air, basically.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.440]   Which has pretty good battery life, so.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.120]   Which Apple just refreshed.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.520]   It wasn't awesome.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.560]   I'll be honest.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.160]   I actually returned my MacBook Air for a MacBook Pro,
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.440]   because it was just--
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.360]   I'm like, how am I spending so much money on this?
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.360]   So underpowered.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.720]   All right.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.480]   And I should say the Qualcomm 8, whatever,
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.960]   is using the ARM 76 core, which is actually a really powerful.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.200]   A76 is a really powerful core that they actually
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:26.400]   use in server class servers and even some gateway equipment.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.160]   So this is not--
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:33.320]   Samsung-- Samsung said 40% faster CPU, 80% better graphics
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:37.800]   performance, and improved memory bandwidth.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.840]   I'm reading the version piece.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.840]   Memory bandwidth.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:45.040]   That's how fast your data gets through.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:45.840]   Sorry.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.960]   It's all about the I/O bus.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.120]   13.3 inch display, 10 point multi-touch.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.960]   Comes with 256 gigs or 512 gigs of storage,
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.640]   but you could go all the way up to 1 terabyte.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:01.560]   But most importantly to me, it will come in pink and gray.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.560]   I want to get the--
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.280]   Is the pink for everyone?
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.880]   It's for me.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.960]   No, I thought it was only for certain--
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.320]   Oh, for certain markets.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.360]   Certain specs too.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.000]   It's for certain people and certain markets.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.720]   But I would get it in pink.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.040]   Gray is boring.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:21.920]   Gray is boring.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.520]   The pink has a--
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.080]   I need something to distinguish from my other people.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.160]   It's not bright pink.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.240]   It's not like your fingernail polish.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.080]   It's kind of a rosy glow.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:29.560]   Kind of--
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.360]   Is it rose gold?
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.200]   It's rose.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.400]   It's really close to that.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:38.480]   What was the name of the Pixel 3A color?
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.680]   Mostly pink, nearly pink, sort of pink.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.480]   Nearly purple?
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.000]   Nearly.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.240]   Not quite pink.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.800]   Yeah, it's kind of like that.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.240]   Yeah, it's kind of like that.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.200]   It's-- this looks really nice.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.080]   Only when it comes in shimmer.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.600]   Shimmer.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.600]   I do like this.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.100]   Yes.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.200]   Stacey, you deserve shimmer.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.400]   The abalone shell.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.360]   Nothing less than shimmer for Stacey.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.760]   And green button says it best blush.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.280]   They said on stage it looks--
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.600]   This is an interesting quote.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.160]   It looks like a laptop but has the essence of a smartphone.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.280]   What is foldable too?
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.280]   Oh, and that's very marquee.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.000]   I guess--
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.800]   Does that mean it's super portable?
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.000]   And you just take it with you all the time.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   All right.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.120]   I mean, it's our age old complaint as content creators.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.440]   Sometimes you want something.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.520]   You can just fling out like a smartphone.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.040]   And since it's always connected,
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.240]   you don't have to mess with things.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.240]   But you could type in and have it be connected.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.480]   This is the one journalists the press take
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.880]   to events like this, frankly.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.440]   Something light enough.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:31.920]   If it's good.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.920]   If you can type on it.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.920]   It's not laden with ports.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.440]   It's got a headphone jack and a Type-C port on one side.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.360]   Type-C port on the other side.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:42.960]   And that's it.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.560]   So it's kind of like the Pixelbook with dual sided dice.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.720]   I wish we had a card reader.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:49.880]   You know what?
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.600]   I bought my--
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.120]   I now have three or four card reader donkeys that I stick in.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.040]   But I have an on there one that's awesome.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.560]   Type-C is--
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.200]   The good news, everything's going Type-C.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.840]   So this is a reasonable investment now.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.680]   So just buy a whole bunch of dongles.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.840]   I even bought it.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.560]   I'm so in on it.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.600]   I even bought a Type-C Ubeke.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.520]   It's like, yeah, this is the future.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:14.920]   So why I get a Type-A?
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.120]   It's all far behind all these.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.440]   So I guess it's small.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:17.960]   Wow.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.720]   You're stupid.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.720]   I stayed in.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.040]   Look what I have tethered to it.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.880]   It's tethered as a little adapter.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:24.640]   So I could still use--
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.040]   Well, that's nice.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:26.720]   Isn't that cute?
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.560]   And it's got--
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.640]   I lost the first one.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.160]   So I got one with a leash.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:35.560]   I saw a Type-C in a outlet.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.880]   You know how you can stick USB into outlets now?
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.080]   So they've got Type-C as part of like,
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.120]   outlets so you can change out in your house.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.480]   And I'm like--
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.280]   Makes me-- that's really nice.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:48.720]   Everybody who bought the Type-A outlets really sad.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.880]   Now I need a dongle for my outlet.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.800]   So sad.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.160]   All right.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.720]   So OK, I think we've said everything there
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.840]   is to be sad about the Samsung event.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.120]   They came off fairly well.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.240]   There were no dancers.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.360]   No sync-- it was a little bit of singing.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.880]   Oh, no, that was Stacy.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.840]   That was me.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.240]   You're not going to ask me about chips again,
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.960]   because I'm going to go back to the broadband plan.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.040]   Go read the broadband plan.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.160]   Go read up on Elizabeth Warren's broadband plan,
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.160]   because that's our next topic of conversation.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.480]   And again, even though Sachin Adele was there,
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.960]   it was a typical Sachin Adele speech, which
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.920]   is just kind of airy, fairy, and didn't really say anything.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:25.800]   But I have a feeling--
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.760]   You've spoken circles.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.920]   It's significant that he's there.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.640]   It's like you have the CEO of Microsoft on stage
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.160]   at a Samsung event.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.520]   That's Microsoft saying, we're really--
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.320]   we're working on something.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.000]   We're serious about this.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.080]   We're serious about this.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.160]   Yes.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.200]   And kudos to Mary Jo and Paula, who had heard rumors
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.960]   Microsoft would be there, and they heard
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.640]   that it would be a really big executive.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.280]   But both of them said, oh, there's no way.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.480]   It couldn't be Sachin Adele.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.440]   But I think you know that during the live stream saying,
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.200]   this is Microsoft saying, we're done with phones.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.880]   We got bigger and better things, such as services
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.720]   to worry about.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.960]   And we can really blow up with that.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.160]   And I think that's what Adele has been doing since he came in.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.560]   And I think very, very smart.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.320]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.680]   When we come back, we're going to take a secret peek.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.200]   Thanks to Fast Company inside Google's top secret design lab.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:16.720]   Ooh.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.920]   We'll hear Elizabeth Warren's proposal for a broadband plan.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.280]   You know, whether you agree with it or disagree
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.680]   with the fact that any presidential candidate even
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.320]   brought this up makes me happy.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.720]   Well, Joe Biden did bring it up.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.880]   And so has your buddy, Amy.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.520]   Boba Char.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.120]   Boba Char.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:34.720]   My buddy.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.360]   So I wish you were my buddy.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.480]   She seems like she'd be--
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.200]   she's Minnesota nice.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.520]   She'd be fun to hang out with.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.680]   She'd bring you a hot dish and talk about broadband pay.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.880]   Honestly, I think that's what we--
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.560]   Is that what America needs?
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.520]   Is a hot dish and broadband?
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.160]   A hot dish and broadband open the door.
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.000]   Yeah, fine.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.160]   I'll do it here.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.400]   I show they brought to you by my printer.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.840]   I love my Epson Eco Tank printer.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.200]   I love it.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.560]   I love it.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.800]   For several reasons, you know, even a photographer
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.840]   was a long time.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.640]   Maybe you remember, I remember very well,
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.680]   Epson's always been the best photographic printers.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.240]   I remember going on a Lightroom Adventure.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.480]   We had a bunch of Epson printers.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.160]   And I knew photographers that would take their black and white
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.880]   Epson printers.
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.640]   The only printer is really from Monochrome prints.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.080]   And they would have big tanks on the side of them.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.800]   And I think that was an aftermarket thing,
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.840]   although maybe Epson eventually did offer it.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.800]   But it just made sense.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.320]   If you're making prints, the last thing
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.840]   in the middle of the print, you want to have happen
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.000]   is the ink cartridge to run out.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.080]   That prints ruined.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.400]   Bad streaks.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.320]   And that paper is expensive.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.520]   So they were using tanks way back when-- well, now Epson's
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.360]   brought that home.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.120]   And I think this is huge.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.560]   Because what they're really doing is they're saying,
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.920]   you know what, we care more about our customers than our bottom
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.720]   line here.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.400]   You can kiss expensive ink cartridges goodbye.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.040]   No more trips to the store in the middle of a print job.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:02.920]   Epson's amazing eco-tank, wireless color, all in one super tank
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:06.120]   printers come with a ridiculous amount of ink.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:10.120]   In the box, thousands of pages worth.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.160]   Probably won't have to go get more ink for a year or two.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.240]   We've had our eco-tank for a couple of years now.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.360]   I actually have not yet bought a second load of ink.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.240]   The super-sized, easy to fill tanks
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.160]   mean fewer trips to the store, less frustration to you.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.480]   And you know what, Epson wants your printing experience
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.800]   to be stress-free and easy.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.560]   And by the way, look at those bottles.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.640]   They're uniquely keyed, so you can't use the wrong one.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.520]   They're auto-stop.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.920]   So it's really easy to-- I've already-- because we
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.800]   have two eco-tank printers at home--
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.920]   filled two of them.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.080]   And it's simple.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:42.920]   I was a little nervous.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:43.440]   Nope.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.880]   No must, no fuss.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.520]   Eco-tank is changing the way people print.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.360]   Get the compact eco-tank printer for your home or office
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.400]   so you can just fill and chill.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.240]   There's a model for everybody.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.880]   7,500 black pages, 6,000 color pages with that ink.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.640]   That's incredible.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.480]   I use it to scan.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.360]   I use it to print.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.160]   It supports Google Print.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.080]   Really a good printer.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.880]   Check out epson.com/ecotankleo today

[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.920]   Look, Shaq says, just fill and chill.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.760]   You're going to do it which--
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.920]   I got to say, Shaq's making that printer look awfully small.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.120]   But remember, he's got a three-foot-wide hand.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.400]   So I'm just saying.

[00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.440]   Eco-tank printers.

[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.120]   Epson, exceed your vision.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.160]   I love epson.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.600]   I'm an epson fan going way back.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.800]   All photographers are, I think.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.280]   Definitely.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.880]   Because that's the best photo producer.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:12.840]   It's the standard.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.160]   All right, have you had time to read the proposal?
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:18.680]   Stacey?
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.560]   No, I can't find the proposal.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:24.440]   So what I have found is people talking about the proposal.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.520]   So I don't know where she has issued the proposal.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.960]   It's not on her website yet.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.480]   All right.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:29.760]   So--
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.360]   Interesting.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.200]   One thing I have to admire about her,
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.000]   and I wish every candidate would do,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.320]   she's been very clear about her policies.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.360]   I don't know yet.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.400]   I don't know how you could vote for somebody who
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.480]   didn't have a very clearly spelled out.
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.760]   So you know what you're getting.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.600]   Right.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.520]   Admitting that.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.680]   I got to point out, you can propose this till the cows come home.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.760]   Even if you get elected, doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.280]   Congress has--
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.320]   Yeah, it's all expensive.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.600]   And there's lots of spots.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:01.440]   But what it does though, it enters things into the debate.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:01.840]   So--
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.600]   And I like the idea that she did--
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.080]   She did hear that should be a right.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.040]   She proposes.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.360]   Let me just say what she's proposing.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:11.320]   To earmark, $85 billion in federal funding
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.960]   to expand broadband networks in rural areas.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:14.840]   Now, this isn't new.
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.560]   I think the FCC has a rural broadband plan.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.560]   I don't know how much work they can do.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.720]   They just announced a new one.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.560]   We can talk about that.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.240]   In fact, they right now have $4.6 billion a year
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.280]   to fund rural broadband.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.840]   And the Rural Utility Service, according to New Engadget,
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.560]   doles out 800 million year in grants and loans.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.920]   But this is significantly more.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.560]   The $5 billion funding for expanded broadband
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.960]   on Native American lands alone would surpass what the FCC currently
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.480]   offers in total each year.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.920]   About half of Native Americans on reservations
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:49.120]   or other tribal lands don't have broadband access.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.480]   I think this acknowledges broadband now needs to be a right.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.480]   A standard.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.400]   In this-- in fact, the United Nations says broadband's a right.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.600]   It needs to be a right in this country, though.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.600]   Because it's not a privilege.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:05.200]   It's how you interact with government, if nothing else.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.200]   She wants to see--
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.760]   So how you can apply for jobs?
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:08.560]   I mean, there's--
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:08.560]   Exactly.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.880]   --all these studies, like, only 30% of jobs aren't--
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.360]   sorry, let me redo that.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.000]   70% of jobs are only available.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.520]   You can only apply to them online.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.600]   See now, I'm going to stand with my team.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.720]   Wow.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.720]   So-- OK.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.200]   She wants to--
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.200]   Did you finish talking about the plan?
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.240]   Not yet.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.200]   And apparently, her plan is on medium.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:34.120]   So go to the Team Warren Medium Post.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.240]   My plan for rural America.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.640]   Nice pair in the original.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.480]   Sorry, guys.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.480]   It should be on the website.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.480]   I guess eventually it will.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.800]   It's kind of ironic.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.880]   Maybe it's-- maybe there's something to be said.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.760]   She's digitally literate.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.080]   But put it on your website too, please, Ms. Warren.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.520]   Well, I'll say, having-- I spent, like, half the time
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.800]   scrolling down the website, because she's
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.000]   got all of her plans there.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.080]   And they're comprehensive.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.920]   But there are a lot of plans.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.000]   This is-- there's quite a bit of stuff in here.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:08.880]   Yeah, she acknowledges that these communities,
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.440]   the rural communities in America, feed our nation.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.480]   They're leading the country in sustainable energy.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.400]   They generate 99% of the wind energy.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.440]   And they're pioneering efforts to harness solar energy.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.480]   We need to give them broadband.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.960]   She says corporate and government leaders
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.440]   have turned their backs on people in rural communities.
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.560]   And this is something she wants to fix.
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:29.800]   I applaud that.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:33.480]   I have to say, she wants to set up an office of broadband access
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.040]   that'll be part of the Department of Economic Development
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:36.880]   that would oversee--
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.360]   Which does not exist.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.800]   What, the Department of Economic Development?
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.520]   We have the US Economic Development Administration,
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.760]   which is part of the US Department of Commerce, which I think
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.800]   is what she's talking about.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.200]   Maybe that's what she meant.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.040]   I was like looking through-- I'm like, where is that?
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.320]   Where is she putting this?
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.760]   D-E-D-D.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.600]   It would oversee the funding.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:00.080]   Funding would not go to ISPs, but to electricity
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.240]   and telephone cooperatives, nonprofits, tribes.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.120]   And this is where I really get behind her.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.200]   Cities, counties, and other state subdivisions.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.400]   She would require-- she would use federal law
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:15.400]   to require local governments and state governments that
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:21.760]   have made laws against municipal Wi-Fi to reverse those laws.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.520]   And by the way, just to stay on that for one second,
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.800]   Ajit Pai with the same route with the opposite end of it.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.960]   Yes, he said you can't--
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:29.760]   Just today.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.880]   Well, where he's also trying to tell him not to regulate.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.880]   We can't regulate.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.520]   FCC saying we're not going to regulate.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.080]   And by the way, you better not either.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.640]   This is today.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.200]   It was actually two days ago.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.600]   Are we talking about the franchise tag?
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.320]   Yes.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:45.800]   Yes.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.200]   It had to do with cable companies,
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.200]   but it's the same-- basically the same thing.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.480]   OK, you've got to finish the plan,
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.040]   because I've been waiting to say something.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.320]   OK, so federal law, when it's sure local governments
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.240]   can build their own networks, that's
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.280]   going to be a big part of this.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.620]   And I think that's great, because it's
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:07.680]   banned in many states now, thanks to heavy lobbying
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.680]   by the telecom industry.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.000]   More accurate broadband maps, because right now,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.480]   there is a lie in broadband coverage maps provided by the FCC.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.920]   They are wrong.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.400]   They're wrong.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.560]   Why don't you talk more about that, too?
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.960]   So Joe Biden also did, as you pointed out,
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.560]   Jeff has a proposal $20 billion.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.720]   But I have to say, $85 billion sounds good to me.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.680]   Stacey Higginbotham, the floor is yours.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.200]   Hold on.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.320]   I need to get my popcorn.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.480]   Hold on.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.880]   OK.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.040]   There's a couple things with this plan.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:50.200]   One, I don't want to see a new department created.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.600]   I know that I'm not 100%.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.400]   I think she is talking about the US Economic Development
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.080]   Administration, which is part of the Commerce Department.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.320]   But we actually have two departments
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:02.120]   handling broadband fund dispersal right now.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:08.720]   We have the NTIA, and we have the Department of RUS Rural
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.480]   US something.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.320]   Rural so hard to say.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:12.840]   So--
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.840]   Rulagers.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.920]   Rul, jar, rulvers.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.720]   Anyway, so we've already got places where this can be handled.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.760]   So I'd like one to see this plan administered
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.280]   from one of those already existing departments,
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.840]   just for simple reasons.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:33.080]   Two, the idea that she wants to say
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:36.920]   that the big ISPs can't participate,
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.560]   I think that's going to be a problem,
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.680]   not just because it will make her plan politically
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:45.120]   unfeasible, but also because--
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.080]   I don't know if there is enough expertise for setting up
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.560]   rural networks.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.080]   Her point--
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.000]   Her point is we have--
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:52.600]   I get--
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.280]   She says we funneled money into these ISPs--
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:55.800]   We have.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.640]   --who promised they would do this and never deliver.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.920]   So then hold them accountable.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.920]   Hold on.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.420]   Hold on.
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:01.920]   Yes.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.440]   So then we need to hold them accountable,
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.680]   because we also funneled a lot, billions and billions
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:10.280]   of dollars into no name rural ISPs.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:13.080]   And those guys have taken the money and run.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:14.320]   Look at the scandals and life.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.280]   So I want to say that the knee jerk,
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.520]   no big corporate entities is wrong.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.600]   I think from a policy perspective,
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:27.080]   some things she has right, making it possible and easy
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:30.320]   for municipalities to set up networks,
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.040]   I think there should be a policy for--
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:33.720]   Yeah, let's have competition.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.680]   And it's OK if the city wants to compete.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.440]   Let's have competition.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.240]   So yes.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:42.240]   And if you use these funds, I think you probably
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.320]   should have some sort of rules about letting other people
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.360]   into the network.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:46.920]   Ah, I agree.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:51.080]   Or maybe building-- maybe there should be--
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.120]   instead of-- and here's a crazy plan.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.200]   Using this money, if you get this money,
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.640]   instead of just putting in your lines,
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.440]   you're putting your lines with conduit.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.240]   And then other people can do their own lines through it.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.960]   Absolutely agree.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:04.480]   And--
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.800]   Or a British version.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.600]   But what about the British version?
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.120]   That is not an optimal version.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.120]   The BT version?
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.360]   That's why I was asking.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.440]   That is-- we did something similar with telephone lines
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.040]   back in the-- I don't know what it was-- late '90s.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.480]   Tell me what the BT plan is.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.600]   Tell me what that is.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.200]   Their network has been forced to be opened.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.600]   How about this?
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.800]   A lot of municipal experts propose
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:34.400]   that the infrastructure be owned by the municipalities,
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:39.120]   by the local authorities, who then are required to offer it,
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:42.000]   just as you described, to any company that
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.760]   wants to run over those lines or wants to run more lines
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.240]   through the conduit.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:50.920]   Guaranteeing that you have proper infrastructure
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.920]   that's maintained by the municipality, which
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.240]   has the right of eminent domain.
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.440]   So it's frankly easier for them to put this stuff in.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.520]   All the legwork's done.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.520]   All the legwork's done.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.800]   I admittedly had a great expense,
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.640]   but she's proposing a significant amount of money
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.960]   for these municipalities.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.480]   And then say, hey, Comcast, come on in.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:10.600]   But also Cox and Spectrum, come on in Frontier, come on in AT&T.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.240]   Get them all on there.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.840]   That's real competition.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.480]   Competition?
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.480]   Yes.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.400]   Now, if there is real money for municipalities
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.240]   to set this up, that will work.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.960]   But I will say Google, actually, for a while,
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:26.040]   talked about doing that with their own Google broadband,
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.600]   and it didn't happen.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.240]   And in some cases, it's because there's
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.600]   no demand in the US.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.240]   That's why the government has to do it,
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.840]   because the government is not driven by demand.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.200]   No, no, no, there's no demand.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.200]   Why Comcast doesn't want to use the same--
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.240]   The municipality does it.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:41.760]   Right.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.760]   And then the municipality does it.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:48.000]   But that's fine.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.760]   I am worried that, in addition to money for this,
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.040]   you're going to have to also make sure there's
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.760]   funds for expertise and accountability.
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:57.280]   I agree.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:57.680]   I agree.
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.160]   Because while Chattanooga is awesome,
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.360]   not everybody is a Chattanooga.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:07.560]   The other thing is, if we decide that this is an actual right,
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:11.000]   and she compares it to putting out electricity
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.080]   across the nation in the 30s--
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.680]   Very much like the Rural Electrification Project.
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:14.960]   Yes.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:15.320]   Absolutely.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.600]   Then we have to say that these municipalities
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:23.000]   are offering a service that may not ultimately be profitable.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.200]   And that's really hard for us to do right now.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.680]   That's right.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.080]   But--
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.080]   But just--
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:28.880]   And then we're going to get--
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:31.640]   There is a perfect analog to the rural electrification
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:34.400]   projects of the 30s, because--
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.800]   And the phone lines, too.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.280]   And we deemed it vital that there
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.880]   be electricity everywhere in the country,
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.920]   that rural people should not be disadvantaged
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.680]   by not having access to electricity.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:46.440]   So we made it so, even at a deficit.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:46.800]   Right.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.800]   But the Telecommunications Act plus our flippable flopping
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.200]   over net neutrality have made that legally questionable.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.640]   So that's something else we're going to have to--
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.920]   Her problem plan has to deal with that.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.000]   And I think Elizabeth Warren's smart enough
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   to dig into all these and be like, yeah.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.560]   The other things that I think are really important here,
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.600]   I would like to see--
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:10.280]   I would really like to see her talk about bringing
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:13.920]   wireless to rural areas, because A, it's more economical.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:18.480]   But B, the current way we allocate and value spectrum
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.240]   is at odds with the value that that spectrum can actually
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:21.840]   provide.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.560]   So we do it based on a per-pop person per pop.
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.600]   And we need to start thinking about with IoT
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.000]   and things like that, that our spectrum,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.440]   we should be thinking about it for devices, not just people.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.520]   So because of things like agriculture and telemedicine,
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.680]   which she's talked about in her plans as well.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.840]   And then the other thing is she wants to appoint FCC
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.280]   commissioners who will restore net neutrality.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.240]   I think that's great.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:48.040]   But basically, we just went through this
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.360]   where we had an FCC commissioner who was like, yeah,
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.080]   net neutrality.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.520]   And then we had one who was like-- and that was Cenikowski.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.480]   And then we had Wheeler.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.520]   And we were all like, what's he going to do with net neutrality
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:57.680]   at first?
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.200]   He was like, ah.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.160]   And then he was like, yeah.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.480]   And then we got Ajit Pai.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:05.760]   And he's like, so I would like to see actually,
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.640]   instead of an FCC commissioner, I
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.960]   would like to see her push for laws that can actually
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:10.680]   entried this in.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:15.320]   Yeah, the FCC only can do what it does with the consent
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.520]   of Congress.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:19.360]   It's Congress mandates and gives the FCC the privileges
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.840]   and rights to do whatever it does.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:24.240]   So ultimately, Congress supersedes the FCC.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.240]   So you're exactly right.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.560]   Make it a law.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.600]   Get it through Congress.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.400]   That's better anyway.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.960]   That's more democratic anyway.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.440]   OK, so that's the plan.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:33.760]   I think it's great.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.480]   I'm excited that people are talking broadly about broadband.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.280]   And I'm excited they're talking about the lack of rural
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:38.960]   connectivity.
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.520]   And as a former broadband reporter,
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:42.880]   I am just like, make it sexy.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.000]   Oh, did I talk about broadband maps?
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.640]   The FCC actually did a good thing a couple of days ago
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.240]   when it changed its plan for broadband mapping.
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.640]   And I was really shocked because again, Ajit Pai.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:56.360]   In the past, they were letting ISPs say.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.400]   So what happened is--
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.200]   Yeah, they got connectivity.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.800]   In 2010, they said, hey, we're going
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:02.920]   to make a national broadband map.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.280]   And we were all like, yeah.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:05.160]   And then they were like, we're going
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.520]   to count broadband based on census block.
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:10.640]   So if one house in an entire census block has broadband,
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.280]   then that area is fully covered.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.640]   And we were like, no, that's a good idea.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.080]   But that's what we went with.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:21.560]   The new rules say that you can actually--
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:23.640]   they will still count by census block,
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.760]   but ISPs now have to create--
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:28.680]   they're polygons of no service zones.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.600]   So they're going to actually have to confess
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:32.600]   where they don't have service in a census block.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.080]   So that could make it marginally more useful.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.920]   So I'm really hopeful there.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.320]   Yay.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:37.680]   OK.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:38.640]   And that's it.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:39.280]   Ooh, sorry.
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:39.960]   I got so excited.
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.280]   I'm like, what?
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.920]   I'm not a single issue voter, but I have to say, if I were,
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:46.440]   that's the issue.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.440]   That is the issue.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.320]   I mean, there's a lot of--
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:51.200]   What drives us toward internet is a right.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.880]   That's an important principle.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.480]   I might have to trade in my Amy hat.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:58.880]   Well, she has a plan.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.560]   I just don't know what it is.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.640]   I don't know what it is either.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:01.720]   That's the problem.
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.360]   As much as I like Klobuchar, you can't really deduce
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.840]   your policies from her website yet.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:09.240]   But that's just a matter of somebody's got to type them in.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:12.800]   Good.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.880]   I'm glad you're right.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:17.360]   I'm glad that that discussion is in the open.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:17.800]   But--
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:23.000]   And I love-- this is a super complicated issue.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.760]   And I think I love that Warren is tackling it with actual,
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.320]   like, hey, we're not just going to throw money.
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:30.720]   But she's actually trying to figure out
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.200]   where you could put the department, how are it.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.640]   So I think there's a lot of good stuff.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:35.800]   She's a wonk.
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.040]   She's a collegey wonk.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.640]   And sometimes we need--
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.560]   I would love to have a policy wonk, yes.
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.960]   Well, remember, though, that was Bill Clinton
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:46.240]   was a reputedly a policy wonk, too.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.600]   No, he wasn't.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.120]   He was charming.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.520]   That was Bill Clinton's big thing.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:51.720]   That's what he was.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.880]   His wife was a wonk.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:53.440]   She was charming.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.720]   She was a wonk in spades, yeah.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:00.520]   Google's going to pause listening to EU voice recordings
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:01.920]   while regulators investigate.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.120]   I suspect that'll end up being in the US as well,
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:08.400]   because already Apple and Amazon have said, OK, OK,
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.480]   we won't listen unless you say it's OK.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.760]   That's the right thing to do, opt in.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:15.440]   Google, actually, they don't opt in,
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.600]   but they do let you opt out.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:17.480]   And they always have.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.560]   Well, I think they all let you opt out.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:20.520]   I don't know about Apple.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:20.920]   No.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:21.760]   Amazon does.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.640]   Amazon lets you opt out.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.560]   Apple did not.
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.760]   Amazon didn't disclose what the people--
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.440]   I think the big issue is people were like, what?
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.040]   There are actual people listening to this.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:31.800]   Well, now we know.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:32.320]   Everybody.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.320]   That changes everything.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:34.680]   Everybody has people listening.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.600]   In fact, what did I just see?
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.080]   There's people--
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:37.840]   Cortana?
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.840]   Cortana probably.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:40.840]   Skype.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.440]   Skype has people listening to its translation.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:43.840]   I'm a nice guy.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.440]   I'm a nice guy.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.920]   Hi.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:47.920]   How are you?
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.280]   You bored?
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.960]   It's only for the translation feature,
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.040]   Skype to make sure the translations are accurate.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.360]   But that's the thing.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:57.640]   You need people for this stuff to be accurate.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:54:59.000]   Get the fallout, must be.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.360]   And you're not even surprised, really.
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.600]   If you think about it, it's got to be.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.100]   Is he?
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:02.600]   Get ready?
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.200]   Get ready?
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.200]   It's just more moral panic.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.200]   Oh!
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.200]   Fire!
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.280]   Press the button.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.600]   Press the moral panic button.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:15.080]   Oh!
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:18.360]   Amy Klobuchar wants to roll out high speed internet
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.840]   every household by 2022.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:23.280]   But if she's going by the FCC high speed internet goals
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.400]   right now, that's 25 megabits.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.600]   I still take that.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.600]   But the question is, is she going to pay for it?
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.960]   Because it's one thing to say it.
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.400]   It's another thing to say.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.920]   And it's going to cost $85 billion
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:35.000]   and the government's going to pay for it.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.320]   So when we get to phones, when we're
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:41.080]   all telephonification, right, to this day,
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.760]   you pay a fee on top of your phone bill,
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:46.280]   which you still have it for that purpose.
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:46.760]   Yes.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:52.440]   To subsidize the unprofitable lines in rural areas.
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:54.320]   Why isn't that a model?
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:55.640]   It is a model.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.200]   That's the thing.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:58.400]   We've solved this, not once, but twice.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.920]   Twice.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:04.160]   A lot of those funds, though, well, in the FCC
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:09.720]   and the telephone world have been not used for their intended
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:10.240]   purposes.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:11.040]   Yes, there's that.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.240]   There's always that.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:17.240]   No, I'm just like these have weaknesses.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:19.200]   And there's so many.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.080]   Anyway, yeah.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:25.080]   Google's doing a fun thing.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:28.320]   So there's now going to be-- this is in response to the EU--
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:31.880]   a browser ballot when you set up your Android phone in Europe.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.920]   You get to choose your browser.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.680]   And you get to choose your search provider,
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:41.880]   except apparently Google's going to auction off the right
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:44.680]   to be one of the choices.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:48.640]   Because they're forced into it by the regulation, as I recall.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:51.680]   In each country, there'll be an auction.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.680]   Search providers will state the price
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:56.160]   that they're willing to pay each time a user selects them
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.720]   from the choice screen.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.800]   Each country will have a minimum bid threshold.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:02.640]   The three highest bidders that meet or exceed the bid threshold
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.760]   will appear on the choice screen.
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:10.520]   I don't know if that's really the spirit of the EU requirement.
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:11.800]   Unintended consequences.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.920]   It's a profit thing.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:18.160]   How long will this last?
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.200]   OK.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:25.520]   I think that's probably was not the intent of the EU commissioners.
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:29.520]   They did, according to the Verge, leave the means of compliance
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:34.200]   up to Google, but the European Commission continues to monitor.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.960]   So I wonder if we'll just think of-- well,
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:37.520]   let's see if we could sneak this poem.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:44.040]   Eric Landry, who is the CEO of a privacy-focused search
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:48.480]   engine in France, quant, called it a total abuse
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.840]   to the dominant position to ask for cash just
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:53.960]   for showing a proposal of alternatives.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:59.920]   Duck.go, CEO Gabriel Weinberg, said a ballot box screen
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:02.120]   could be an excellent way to increase meaningful consumer
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.400]   choice if it's designed properly.
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.640]   Unfortunately, Google's announcement today
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:09.400]   will not meaningfully deliver choice.
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:12.240]   A pay-to-play auction with only four slots means consumers
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.760]   won't get all the choices they deserve.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:17.480]   And Google will profit at the expensive competition.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.680]   But isn't that what it's all about?
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:19.800]   Google's profits?
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:21.880]   Well, for Google.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.840]   I can't imagine that you will let this stand.
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.440]   Google says--
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:27.920]   I swear I didn't put up the rundown today.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:30.560]   It's so funny, too, because both ways.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:35.760]   The EU governments are planning to monitor your travel,
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:39.480]   not only in planes, put on trains and roads.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.920]   So you have GDPR on the one hand, and the one government
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:43.840]   on the other hand.
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:45.880]   Government always wants to know.
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:50.240]   Well, all of these technologies can be used for surveillance.
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.680]   And it's just, will the government decide not to do it?
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:54.520]   Yeah, why wouldn't the government do it?
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:56.600]   And balloons over our heads soon?
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:02.720]   That's the Pentagon using aerial and satellite surveillance
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:03.640]   to monitor.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:06.680]   This is just a test getting ready for--
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:09.600]   Getting ready for the terrorist invasion.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.740]   Hi.
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:15.360]   It hasn't been bring this up, but I think it's important.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:18.040]   Report, I think, in Politico, a put on the rundown
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:21.560]   under government that the White House is circulating a plan
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:25.160]   to an executive order to go after a so-called censorship
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.520]   of the right on social platforms.
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:30.200]   So this has been a drumbeat that's been going and going and going
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:34.120]   ever since we played that clip of President Trump on--
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:39.080]   see, was it Maria Bartiromo show?
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:42.600]   Trump says, I got my eye on you, Google.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:47.240]   And yeah, I'm not surprised that this has been coming.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.240]   And Trump is actually--
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.080]   Trump is actually--
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:51.920]   He's weak.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:52.840]   So I stood up to try.
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:54.680]   I said, my office had praised me and said,
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:55.960]   what, what, what, what, what if it worked?
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.280]   Which is something this stood up to try.
[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.480]   I can't possibly deny.
[00:59:58.480 --> 00:59:59.720]   He's stuck with it.
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.320]   He can't do anything.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.760]   So he's really playing games on the platform now.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.480]   So Trump has actually accused Google of, quote,
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:12.080]   very illegal, end quote acts, but doesn't specify with--
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.040]   No backup.
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:13.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.960]   Distorting results for political purposes
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.600]   would harm our business as Google
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.840]   and go against our mission of providing helpful content
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:21.760]   to all our users.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:29.680]   God, I'd be stunned if there is an executive action
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:30.360]   against Google.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.840]   And I can't imagine what it would be.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.360]   What do you order?
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.960]   What can Trump do?
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:40.200]   Well, obviously they're going to win against the first limit
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.880]   case because--
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.720]   What is he going to say?
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.280]   Someone to say something is as bad as telling
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.040]   what they can't say.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:53.000]   But I think there'll be some ridiculous language
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.320]   about some requirement of neutrality, which is BS.
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:01.880]   So does political have any--
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.600]   they say the White House is circling drafts
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.720]   of a proposed executive order that
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.160]   would address allegations of any conservative bias
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:09.520]   by social media companies.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.560]   This is a source within the White House,
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:13.920]   a White House official, and two other people
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:17.240]   familiar with the matter a month after President Trump
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:20.360]   pledged to explore all regulatory and legislative
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.040]   solutions on the issue.
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.800]   No one, none of the three, would describe
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:27.160]   the contents of the order.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.640]   I suppose a trombone.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.480]   There's no challenge.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.000]   Fellows.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.680]   I'm going to come after you.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.600]   I would be amazed if anything came out of this.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.640]   Well, it's the age of amazement, yes.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:38.680]   It is, isn't it?
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.960]   I don't think even Stephen Miller would know
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.200]   what to write in such an executive order.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.480]   I don't know what to write.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.640]   Let's build a wall around the Googleplex.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.080]   I mean, I don't-- there's nothing-- what are you going to do?
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:52.840]   It all just makes my head hurt to think about it.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.640]   And I wonder if our president even knows
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.720]   what he's talking about in this.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.360]   No, he doesn't know.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.560]   This is all--
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.720]   this is stagecraft.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.880]   He saw some Fox and Friends hosts say it,
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:04.640]   so he's just writing it.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.520]   He's just stoking a fire.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.040]   Yep.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.640]   But if he's looking for a template,
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.320]   look no farther than Turkey.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.520]   Turkey.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.920]   Turkey has now--
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.800]   So--
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.800]   And I don't-- I embrace this.
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:18.920]   Working in broadcast media, television, and radio,
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:24.920]   because broadcast uses a public resource, the airwaves,
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.200]   they are subject to FCC licensing.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.440]   You have to get an FCC license.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.160]   You have lots of community requirements
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.600]   that can't say the seven deadly words.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.200]   There's just rules.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.160]   And every broadcaster understands that and knows it.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.600]   And frankly, I think embraces it.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:44.280]   But online content has never been regulated by the FCC,
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.640]   because we don't use public airwaves, podcasts, blogs,
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.880]   streaming media--
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:50.280]   Right.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.560]   --is unregulated, as it should be.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.920]   And in fact, it's a very important place for free space,
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.040]   just as newspapers are.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.920]   They don't use public resources either.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.360]   It's maybe the streets to deliver them.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:06.040]   Turkey has decided that its radio and television watch dog,
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.760]   which is called our tuck, will have the right
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.280]   to oversee online content, including streaming platforms
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.600]   like Netflix and online news outlets.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:21.520]   You will now have to get a license to broadcast on the internet.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.960]   I presume that's podcasts and blogs as well.
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:24.960]   I don't know.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.280]   Actually, get their hands on.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.680]   Yes.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.440]   And of course, one of the things they're
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.760]   going to be watching for is anything
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.560]   that is negative about the government.
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.960]   So what we just talked about, that
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:40.520]   would be illegal in Turkey.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.040]   China.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.040]   That was about our government.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:43.520]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.240]   Well, if we were talking about the Turkish government in Turkey,
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.840]   replace Trump with Erdogan and then continue,
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.800]   we would, I guess, be taken off the air.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:53.800]   We would have issues, yes.
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.640]   Humans, right, human rights lawyer in Turkey
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:01.240]   said this is the biggest step in Turkish censorship history.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:04.920]   All outlets producing opposition news would be effective.
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:08.240]   Everyone who produces alternative news and broadcasts
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.080]   will be impacted by this regulation.
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.320]   Every news report that can be against the government
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.160]   will be taken under control.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.400]   I never hear about Turkey in the news in general.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.760]   Well, we've been talking about it a lot
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.520]   because of the encroaching authoritarianism.
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.020]   OK.
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.200]   So that explains it.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:25.540]   It's slow.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:29.520]   Erdogan, who was a democratically elected president,
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:35.400]   has slowly been moving to control all negative comments
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:39.600]   to control the press, shut down protests.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.960]   And the people I know who live in Turkey
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.080]   where Turkish people are very upset about this.
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.240]   So it's like this is the way of the world now.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.680]   She does.
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.640]   We are definitely seeing a--
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:56.560]   as America is falling back on its commitment
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.880]   to let's call it free speech everywhere.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:04.200]   We're seeing other people in nations say, oh, wow.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.080]   America is not going to get upset about this.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.160]   Let's do it.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.680]   But we've got to hold the line.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:12.600]   I still think this is the shining beacon of freedom
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.000]   to the rest of the world.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.400]   And we've got to hold the line.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.000]   And we've got to stand up for the values that
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.800]   made this country unique and have brought--
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.560]   the thing that always strikes me about America,
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.440]   there are only a few countries in the world.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.920]   I could think of three that became countries not because
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.080]   of their geography, because--
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.400]   well, our country because people live here--
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.520]   but because of an idea.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.440]   One was Israel.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.400]   Liberia, the state where slaves moved, was one.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.880]   And America has been for 200 years, a country
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.080]   that people came to from all over the world
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:50.440]   because we espoused freedom of speech, freedom of religion.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.040]   People came here initially came here
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.960]   because they wanted the freedom to worship as they chose.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.320]   Really just freedoms.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:01.280]   And this is what's so unusual about this country.
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.960]   This is a country of ideas that people came here
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.200]   from all over the world because we all
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.920]   agree this is the right way to be.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:11.720]   This is how a society should be organized.
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.800]   Cannot give that up.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.040]   Cannot give that up.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.120]   Yeah, well, I think it's happy there's
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.240]   not so much an attack on the First Amendment,
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.840]   but it's an effort to chill.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:24.040]   Well, we'll have that effect, but it's not going to chill us.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.920]   No, it's going to--
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.040]   Not right now.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.040]   Not yet.
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.560]   Not today.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:33.280]   Not here, not today.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.280]   So here's one.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.440]   Here's the other end of this.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.760]   It's Achan.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.160]   Yeah, this is a really interesting conversation.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.680]   I've been reluctant to have.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:45.480]   So Achan has now, for the third time,
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:48.400]   been the place where a shooter's manifesto has been posted
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.200]   before he participated in a mass killing on Passo the most
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:55.280]   recent, the Christ Church killings
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.080]   and what was the other was the mosque shooting,
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:57.680]   I can't remember.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:03.480]   But Achan is clearly a place for people--
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.520]   Or the context.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.680]   It maybe was the synagogue shootings,
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.080]   but it was clearly a place--
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.000]   well, I don't know what is it.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.240]   It was created because 4chan was too restrictive.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.600]   It's where the people who are kicked off of 4chan go.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.840]   And we can all understand.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.600]   And there will always be an Achan.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.720]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:25.000]   So Cloudflare-- and by the way, I'm a fan of Cloudflare.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.120]   Matthew Prince's CEO said we discussed this all day,
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.400]   Cloudflare was providing DDoS protection.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.280]   For Achan, as it does for many, many sites.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.520]   They were not the hosts.
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:35.440]   They were just the protector.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.400]   Yeah, they're the DDoS protector.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:40.600]   They-- in fact, the host is still-- is right now,
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.640]   and I think debating whether they should--
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.320]   two cows, which did the registrar,
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.880]   is debating whether they should allow that.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.560]   So this is a big debate.
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.760]   Cloudflare-- and Matthew Prince is a real free speech advocate
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.960]   who says, I don't want to get in the position of deciding
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.360]   which speech is OK, which is not.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.360]   But he finally-- and I think he was right--
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.840]   said this goes over the line.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:05.560]   And he terminated Achan's support on Cloudflare.
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.160]   I think-- I don't know what two cows
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.120]   is going to end up doing.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.120]   Good move.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:09.520]   Two cows.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.640]   He fired them as a customer.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:13.560]   You can always fire people as a customer.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.120]   Good move.
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:15.360]   You can.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:15.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.760]   OK.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.200]   But you also understand that the reluctance
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.920]   to do that because you don't want to get in the business--
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.760]   I do.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:23.200]   --because--
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.160]   --choosing winners and losers.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:28.720]   But you can-- let's take McDonald's.
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:29.640]   Or let's take Walmart.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.120]   Walmart's probably a good, actually, a good use case.
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.160]   Walmart wants as many people as possible in its stores.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.440]   They love you, right?
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.280]   They-- I can walk into a Walmart in Texas,
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.680]   and there will be an open carry nut running around.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.640]   There will be some sort of crazy person screaming
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.080]   at their kids at top volume, and maybe even hitting them.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.960]   These are not people that I'm like, yeah, top of humanity,
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:50.480]   right?
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.000]   Right.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.080]   But they still have a place.
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.600]   They can go into Walmart at a certain point,
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.280]   like if the open carry guy pulls out his gun
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:01.880]   and starts pointing it at those kids who are misbehaving,
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.360]   Walmart's going to say, you know what?
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.200]   They have the right.
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:04.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.120]   Nobody questions that.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.600]   By the way, I should just say, two cows
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:11.000]   did drop a chance domain registration two days ago.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:11.640]   And I should also--
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.000]   You're Canadian.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:12.480]   I could see that.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.760]   Yeah, I should also make the disclaimer.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.680]   Two cows owns Hover, which is our sponsor.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.200]   It may even have been Hover, I don't know.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.080]   But two cows has its own domain registration.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.800]   So this happened to the Daily Stirmer.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.640]   This happened--
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.800]   Exactly.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.200]   This has happened before.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:29.960]   It's an appropriate conversation.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:33.200]   And just like you could always find a place to get your underwear
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.960]   and toilet paper from Walmart, you can find it somewhere else.
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:36.960]   Well, that's the real point.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.560]   There'll be a 16-chan or a 32-chan.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.320]   There'll be some other-chan tomorrow, right?
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.160]   Somebody's already got it and works.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.120]   But you don't have to do business with them.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:46.480]   Right.
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.920]   And you can fire them when they start behaving beyond the social norms.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:54.600]   And I'd say walking into a place and shooting people
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.840]   and then publicizing your message, because all of this
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.840]   is about publicizing the message associated
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:00.320]   with killing so many people.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.400]   I think that's a pretty--
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.960]   that's an OK place to draw a line.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.080]   Right.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.560]   I think you're right.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.120]   You make it very clear.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.120]   Yes.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.760]   I agree.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.000]   Thanks, Walmart.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   Um--
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.160]   What else do we--
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:19.920]   I'm about to go.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.160]   Do you want to do the change log?
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:23.160]   Yeah, because we're going to ramp up in a few minutes here.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:27.200]   So let's get to-- I think the highlight of the show.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.640]   We get to hear the song.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:29.520]   The trumpets.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.360]   Yes.
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.400]   The Google Change Log.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:37.680]   Hello, everybody.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:41.000]   This is Leo LaPorte, your Google Change Log reporter.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.600]   This week, Google announced made by Google products
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.320]   will start using recycled materials
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:51.760]   and will be carbon neutral by 2020.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:52.680]   What do you do?
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:53.840]   They're still getting charged.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.560]   They're still going to charge you $1,000 for recycled material.
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.680]   What do you do?
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.320]   It really bothers me when I buy something.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.440]   I don't want to say a lot, right?
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:01.960]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.400]   It always bothers me when I buy something.
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:04.440]   And Apple's the worst at this.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.840]   And it's just this beautiful-- you don't even
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.000]   want to throw the box away.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:07.760]   It's airtight.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.640]   It's perfect.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:11.240]   And you can't break it down and recycle it very easily.
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.080]   There's no--
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:12.920]   it doesn't collapse.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.440]   You have to cut it apart and cut it.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.200]   It's fine to do what Amazon did with the frustration-free
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:18.680]   packaging.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:22.480]   Put it in something that's brown paper, clearly recycled.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.560]   I don't mind.
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:23.960]   It's a beautiful--
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.520]   product's going to be just as good.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.280]   So I was in San Francisco last week also, right?
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:32.200]   And the last item there, I walk up to City Lights Books
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:32.960]   and I stop.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.920]   I'm hungry and I've got an early flight to the next morning.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.040]   So I stop and I get some nice templates.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.560]   Try it out.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.200]   And I decide to get some soup to her.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.560]   I'm going to take it back to the hotel in a little wine.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.200]   And I say to the nice lady, can I have a spoon?
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.720]   Oh, no, she said that's now against the law in San Francisco.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.280]   San Francisco, right on.
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.520]   Can't give you a spoon.
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.120]   Ring your own spoon.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.360]   But, but.
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.160]   What is the soup?
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:56.360]   It's more than dumplings served in?
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.080]   Three millimeters.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:57.560]   Of course.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:00.560]   Plastic, of course.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:04.840]   When you go to San Francisco, be sure to wear a spoon
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:05.920]   in your hair.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.720]   And when you overthink something.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:11.160]   That is a perfect example.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.200]   We're going to wrap this in eight layers of plastic,
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.400]   but we can't give you a spoon.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.760]   I'm going to give you a spoon.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:16.760]   It's saying yes.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:20.160]   And we're going to have a recycled paper labels in there.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:22.480]   Google Fit will now track your sleeping,
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.120]   whether you want to or not.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.120]   No.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.520]   Just spreading.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:28.680]   Just spreading fun.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:29.680]   Just spreading fun.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:31.400]   It's the Ariana Huffington app.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.840]   I don't actually want to go to sleep with Google Fit.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.120]   So thanks for doing that.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.880]   But I don't want to put my phone in my bed.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:41.520]   Search Engine Land had this story about Google launching
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.800]   a new algorithm to better understand useful and timely
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.320]   information.
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:53.200]   So, featured snippets don't have to be new necessarily.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.840]   I don't understand this.
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.000]   It could be time.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.480]   The problem is if you do is go with currency,
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.720]   then that's capable.
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:01.160]   And it may not be the most important and most relevant.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.080]   More accurate.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:05.320]   So it's a bit more relevant, better than more recent.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:06.000]   Yes.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.600]   And I always use the tools when I use Google Search,
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.880]   which I haven't been lately.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.880]   But when I kind of miss-- actually,
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.200]   no, it's built in the start page automatically.
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:17.640]   The tools that say, I only want to see results in last week,
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.280]   last year, or last five years.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.040]   That's often useful, because if I'm
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.960]   searching for a bug or something like that,
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:26.920]   Google is going to add-- I think this is a really good thing--
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:31.200]   automated text to speech for emergency calls
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.000]   made via the pixel.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.320]   So often, when you make an emergency call,
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.120]   you can't speak.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.160]   You're having a heart attack.
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.280]   You were shot.
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.440]   You just fell over.
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:43.520]   And--
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.200]   That's awesome.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.600]   So the system is simple.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.080]   When an emergency call, the phone app
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.600]   will now offer three additional buttons.
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.240]   You don't have to say anything.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.880]   Just press medical, fire, police.
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.880]   Tapping the button will activate a text to speech feature
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:59.000]   that will read out a message informing the operator
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.160]   that the caller is using an automated service
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.080]   describing the kind of help.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.600]   So in this case, this is the text.
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.560]   You're being contacted by an automated voice service
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.440]   initiated by the caller.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:11.160]   The caller may be unable to speak or hear,
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.040]   my location is--
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.880]   And plus code for my location is I require medical assistance.
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.880]   That's fantastic.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:18.360]   This is--
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.480]   Oh, God, what if they only give the plus code?
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.520]   Well, this is the best community to--
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:25.720]   I'm at 849VCWC7 plus AQ.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:28.000]   Oh, thanks.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.640]   Is the plus code must be like three words, where like it's--
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:32.440]   It is like--
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:33.280]   It's a GPS.
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:35.240]   So years ago, I had to call 911.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:41.200]   Only once in my life, I had a conflict with a contractor.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.800]   And--
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.400]   But he left, and so I hung up the phone.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.160]   Oh, they come anyway, baby.
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:48.680]   They come back.
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:49.160]   They come back.
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:49.680]   They come anyway.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:50.160]   Absolutely.
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:50.760]   They come anyway.
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:51.240]   Yeah.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.040]   I didn't know that.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.400]   And then what is the other thing you're
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.560]   supposed to do if their person is in the room with you
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.880]   pretend you're ordering a pizza?
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:04.360]   And the operator knows, oh, he can't talk.
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.120]   And you order the pizza and say, please deliver it
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.720]   to this address.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:08.160]   Is that work?
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:08.960]   I did not.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.040]   I don't think that was actually a thing.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.280]   I think it's a thing.
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.960]   Maybe I dreamed it.
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.240]   No, I've heard something.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.400]   I could have dreamed it, but I think it's the case.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.680]   You know what I dreamed last night?
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.520]   What?
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.960]   There'll be no paper on Mars.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.560]   What?
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.880]   But there will be cartagrades on the moon.
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:27.360]   What about paper on--
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.920]   What about paper on the Mars?
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:31.520]   I just realized there'll be no trees.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:33.560]   There'll be no paper.
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.040]   OK.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.040]   Sorry.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.520]   Fox News says--
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.560]   Thanks Gutenberg.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:44.480]   Fox News says that pepperoni pizza 911 code is a myth.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:44.920]   Oh.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.720]   So I apologize.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.240]   Yeah, I think there's documents, though, of police--
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.560]   or of pizza delivery people helping that's actually true.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:59.480]   Like, people in a hostage situation or a dicey situation,
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:02.280]   pizza people have called the police after delivering a pizza
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:05.280]   to a home and seeing someone in distress or mouthing things
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.240]   like police behind the person answering the door.
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.200]   So there have been situations where that has actually happened.
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.000]   So maybe that's where that myth arises from.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.280]   The LAPD posted this tweet last year.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:23.800]   The LAPD has seen this graphic circulating
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:24.920]   on social media channels.
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:28.280]   It's false text, "2911" is a much better option,
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.320]   your exact location, and the nature of the emergency
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.200]   is what's needed to send the right resources.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:33.560]   So what--
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:36.640]   I suspected if you called and went through--
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.560]   Can you send them?
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.120]   I think that would work.
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:41.920]   I think you'd figure it out, yeah.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.400]   But anyway, I apologize for spreading false news.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.480]   Fake news.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.120]   Shame on you.
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.240]   I think what Google's doing, though,
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.840]   is actually a great solution, right?
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.340]   It is.
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.080]   This is dial 911.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:52.720]   Press a button.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:53.520]   You can put the phone down.
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.440]   It's faster than texting.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.920]   I still think that really needs to be communicated
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:00.480]   to the responders, because you hear a robot talking
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:03.760]   in your ear that you're thinking, oh, what kid has done this now.
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.760]   Oh, that's true.
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.880]   I'm sure Google's doing that.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:11.760]   Google's Advanced Protection Program can now block risky downloads
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.720]   also in Chrome.
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.240]   I thought you didn't need that in Chrome.
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:21.400]   Well, so this whole idea-- and by the way,
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.800]   this one using Gmail is a good idea--
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.920]   Gmail will filter out known ransomware
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:29.000]   and other threats from your email will block it.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.080]   But this is also--
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.400]   attackers are shifting their strategies, says Google,
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:38.880]   to threaten advanced protection users outside of email.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:41.880]   So Google announced the Advanced Protection Program
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:46.880]   was coming to the G Suite and cloud accounts, as well as Chrome.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.920]   Linked malware and drive-by downloads
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.000]   of the new threats of the attackers
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.600]   trying to get users to unknowingly download harmful software
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.160]   into the devices.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:58.880]   So you'll see-- this is an example of what you might see
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.920]   on your screen-- file.exe was blocked by advanced protection.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:05.520]   Was the incognito update-- was that last week?
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:06.800]   Yes, in Chrome 76.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:07.760]   Chrome 76.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760]   Chrome 76.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:10.880]   So that was the issue of where you went to the New York
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:14.640]   Times in incognito, hoping to bypass the paywall.
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.880]   The New York Times is saying--
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:16.880]   [GROANING]
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.240]   You're in incognito mode.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.480]   You can't use the Times.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:23.320]   So now you can't, which we shouldn't tell anybody,
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.960]   because Jeff's going to be pissed off.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:25.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.760]   Sorry, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.120]   I subscribed to the Times.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.160]   Me too.
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:29.720]   And the Post.
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:30.400]   I do too.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:31.400]   I do too.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:31.960]   And Wire.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:32.960]   And Wire.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:33.800]   And Blooper.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.560]   But it's our job.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.960]   And by the way, we rely on these to make the show.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:43.240]   So I think it's a fair trade.
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:44.740]   Yeah.
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.860]   All right, let's wrap her up.
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.100]   What do you say?
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.800]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.480]   Carsten.
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:54.140]   Oh, that's--
[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:56.540]   The Google change law.
[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:58.280]   Geez.
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.560]   There was a lot more to talk about.
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.120]   That's bad news.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:00.780]   I didn't run out of--
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:02.380]   I mean, we didn't even come close to going
[01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:03.060]   through those stories.
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:09.660]   Disney has announced its prices for Disney streaming service.
[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:12.660]   If anybody cares, if you want to get your Marvel movies,
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:13.460]   guess what?
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:14.780]   They won't be on Netflix.
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:16.740]   They won't be on HBO.
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:22.900]   You'll have to pay $6.99 for Disney Plus, which
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:26.180]   is less than Netflix to be fair that'll launch November 12.
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:30.420]   And there's a special version, a bundle for Disney Plus, Hulu,
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:36.100]   and ESPN Plus that will be a scant, a mere $12 in $99.
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:37.180]   Is that right?
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:40.780]   Yeah, $12.99.
[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:42.420]   Stacey, do you have a pick of the week?
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:45.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:49.020]   You better we didn't compare today.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:50.020]   I did.
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:51.420]   I did have one.
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:52.420]   Let me remember what it is.
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:55.260]   Your blood sugar is depleted.
[01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:56.460]   Come back to me.
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:56.960]   Hot.
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:57.900]   Pleated.
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:59.940]   How about you, Jeff Jarvis, the number of the week?
[01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:00.980]   There can be.
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:04.860]   There can be no other number this week than 30 to 50.
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:06.220]   30 to 50?
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:09.820]   You mean the age group of women that all date?
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:10.820]   No.
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:12.420]   30 to 50?
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:14.700]   Oh, punch A-A-V-X.
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:15.980]   Your job to punch me out.
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:16.980]   Yeah, punch Leo.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:17.900]   Don't release it when punch me.
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:21.300]   Just fine while you're home.
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:25.420]   30 to 50 feral hogs took over the world.
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:26.460]   That's the one you need.
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:29.820]   This is why you need long guns and bump stocks.
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:30.780]   Because what if you got a--
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:31.820]   Just a three to five minutes.
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:34.060]   30 to 50 feral hogs come into the playground.
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:37.100]   Now, in fact, there are issues in some areas with feral hogs,
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.380]   but it was just the perfect--
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:39.220]   I just lived in one of those areas.
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:40.980]   What do you mean?
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:41.780]   30 to 50 feral hogs.
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:43.260]   And I have seen feral hogs, and they
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.420]   are not to be messed with.
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:45.420]   No, I'm not.
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:49.020]   Even if you have an automatic weapon,
[01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:50.740]   I would stay away from the feral hogs,
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:54.700]   although those little feral hog babies, man, they look cute.
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:55.940]   I couldn't find it again.
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:59.980]   I saw a video of a feral hog trap that was phenomenal.
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.180]   I couldn't find the video.
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:02.620]   What's wrong with feral hogs?
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:05.020]   They're just pigs with a little extra fur.
[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:05.660]   A teeth.
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:06.860]   It was teeth.
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:08.860]   Well, if you don't want them, they won't bug you.
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:10.460]   OK.
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:13.540]   And by the way, bullets don't stop feral hogs.
[01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:16.700]   You need one of them boar stickers.
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:18.740]   Aunt, I'm not going to put you in the spot,
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:20.700]   because you just didn't even know you were going to be on.
[01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:22.100]   We dragged you into this.
[01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:23.060]   I found something.
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:25.900]   All right, man, this guy's good.
[01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:28.300]   Well, and of course, it's just a plug to me, too.
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.300]   OK.
[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:30.140]   Good luck, self-assumed.
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:32.660]   Even better.
[01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:33.300]   Back in June--
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:35.340]   We're going to call Aunt Jitsu.
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:36.540]   Of course.
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:41.540]   I believe it was back in June, the CTA invited me to CES Asia.
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:44.460]   And while I was there, I was able to cover the event and so
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:45.380]   forth.
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:48.420]   And I sat down with one of their executives,
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.220]   Ms. Karen Chupka.
[01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:52.380]   And it wasn't an interview.
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:54.260]   I wanted to treat it like a conversation.
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:57.180]   And it was a really, really, really good time
[01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:01.140]   sitting down and talking to her about being with the CTA
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:02.660]   for 30 years.
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:04.820]   The Consumer Technology Association, is that right?
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:05.340]   Yes.
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:05.840]   That's right.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.940]   People that do CES.
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:12.180]   And she's been at the job for 30 years.
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:13.700]   And she's a female.
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:16.520]   And she's dealing with consumer technology and dealing
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:20.800]   with other cultures all around the world that look at things
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:24.220]   differently far as gender rights, gender equality,
[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:25.340]   and things of that nature.
[01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:29.720]   And she was really, really candid about that, as well as
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:32.480]   just talking about some of the old stories of CES
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:36.500]   of your registration days in the mail and things
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:39.060]   get the good of that.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:39.820]   So where is that?
[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:40.660]   We can find that.
[01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:42.300]   It's on tech republic right now.
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:42.500]   Nice.
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:43.860]   I put it in our-- there it is.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:46.740]   We got it up on the screen there.
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:48.660]   But yeah, there's a lot of fun.
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:50.700]   She was fun to talk to.
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:53.300]   And she believes in AI and still believes
[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:55.220]   that it still has a ways to go.
[01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:59.180]   But the CTA is really pushing for equality
[01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:01.420]   they've made about-- I think it was about $10 million
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:05.440]   investments for giving opportunities to minorities
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.920]   and women to get into entrepreneurship.
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:16.040]   The CTA itself has like 71% of its executive team is female.
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:16.640]   That's awesome.
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.280]   You know, it's just a little stuff like that.
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:18.680]   That's really great.
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:20.640]   It was a really, really cool conversation.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:24.760]   So just hop over to that link in our own tech republic.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.960]   Give that a read.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.440]   And let me know your thoughts on it.
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.360]   It's-- I had a lot of fun with that one.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.980]   Very nice.
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:33.360]   OK, I found my thing.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:34.160]   All right.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.720]   Her thing has emerged.
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:36.920]   I knew I had it.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.080]   I just was like, what was it?
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:39.080]   Where'd my thing go?
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.120]   It is Camect.
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:41.680]   Camect.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.000]   Which is-- Camect.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000]   You're like, what is this?
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:44.360]   What is that?
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.360]   It is an indiegogo project that allows
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:49.400]   you to connect your smart home cameras.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.440]   Any-- a wide variety, including Nest, Arlo, Wise, et cetera.
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:56.480]   And you can basically link them all together.
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:59.200]   It's a networked DVR that is--
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.200]   Oh, this is cool.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:00.920]   --for all sorts of smart homes.
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:03.640]   So I don't have to pay that monthly fee to Nest.
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.200]   Exactly.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.960]   Although there is a monthly fee to remotely access your feed
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:07.320]   for this.
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.320]   So I will say that.
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:09.840]   That always is going to be the case.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:10.320]   I think.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.320]   Well, I mean, if you're sending camera data from--
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.800]   but you could keep it all local on this drive
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.960]   if you wanted to not pay the fee.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.320]   And if you're on the same network,
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.920]   you'll still be able to see it.
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:22.320]   But this is an interesting device.
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.640]   It's supposed to ship in December.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.960]   I don't know if it will.
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.920]   But I thought it's already met its goal.
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:33.080]   So I thought this was actually kind of a neat product.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.520]   I think a lot of NASA's will let you do this, too.
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:36.360]   I may be wrong.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.640]   I don't know how hard it is.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.560]   A lot of them are not user friendly.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:42.800]   And you have to have them with the right--
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:45.520]   they have to have the right codex and software.
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:50.600]   And this seems to do that part for you.
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:51.640]   But you're not wrong.
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:53.640]   A lot of NASA's will do that for you.
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.080]   It's just not user friendly.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:57.160]   So yay.
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:59.600]   Yay, Stacy and her thing.
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:00.400]   Nice.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:03.720]   Stacy Egan-Botham is the host of Stacy on IoT with Kevin Tofel.
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:06.400]   Actually, Stacy on IoT is the part as the website.
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:09.960]   The podcast, the IoT podcast with Kevin Tofel.
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.640]   I had a scoop today, and I didn't tell you about it.
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.120]   What's your scoop?
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.640]   Do we have to listen to the show to find out?
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:17.400]   No, I actually posted it on the site.
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:20.600]   There was Walmart is doing a program like Amazon Key,
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:21.520]   which we knew.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:27.000]   But it has filed with the FCC for a wireless device
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.720]   that will be Walmart's hub in the smart home.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.720]   And it will use that as a Z-Wave to Wi-Fi hub
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:35.480]   to open your garage door and--
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:36.480]   Nice.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.200]   Eventually, probably a door lock.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:38.720]   Nice.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:39.720]   So there's a little hub.
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:40.560]   So fancy.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:41.080]   Very nice.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:42.440]   That's it.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:45.760]   I didn't mention that the FedEx folks have decided
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:48.480]   to cut all ties with Amazon.
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:50.280]   They've now cut ground.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:52.800]   They've cut air a while ago.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.320]   So expect more of those nondescript sedans pulling up
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:58.680]   to your house and throwing boxes out the window at you.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:01.600]   Getting more blue trucks in the Charlotte area now.
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.440]   Yeah, we've got a lot of prime trucks now.
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.120]   It used to be a lot on marked cars,
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.880]   but finally they're prime trucks.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.120]   Although a lot of people on Reddit
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:10.080]   say that they're the worst drivers ever.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.000]   They are.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.440]   They are.
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:15.760]   Thank you so much, Stacey.
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.000]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.320]   He is a professor of journalism at the Townite Center
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:22.520]   for an entrepreneurial blah, blah, blah
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:24.880]   at the City of University of New York.
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:26.360]   He's also at buzzmachine.com.
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.760]   And he's a beloved figure whose microphone has been muted.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:39.920]   He's a beloved figure amongst all of us twig listeners.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:40.400]   Thanks, Jeff.
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.560]   What do you go home?
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.320]   Friday morning.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.480]   OK.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.000]   OK.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.920]   Have fun in our neck of the woods.
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:50.720]   Good luck with those Facebook folk.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.280]   And we will see--
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.840]   actually, I will not be here next Wednesday,
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.520]   because I'm going to the podcast movement,
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:59.480]   the big podcast convention in Orlando next week.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.800]   But we will have-- I think Jason's going to host.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:02.800]   Jason.
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.000]   We love Jason.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:04.520]   We love Jason.
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.840]   Jason Howell will be in the chair.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.400]   We'll move the table up a little bit for him,
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:08.880]   because he's--
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:09.400]   The Giants.
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:10.760]   He's a tall guy.
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.920]   The Giants.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:14.440]   Speaking of Giants, we are so glad to welcome
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.800]   Ant Pruitt to the Twitter family.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:16.880]   Yay, Ants.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.720]   Ants and his family are great, and he will be a great addition.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:22.760]   I can't wait to see the stuff you're going to do.
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:24.440]   And of course, you'll see a lot of Ant.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:27.080]   It'll probably be the first person to fill on this show,
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:28.560]   starting as soon as you get--
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.600]   actually, you're not even an employee yet.
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:31.120]   No.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.760]   Since you start getting a paycheck.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:37.280]   But Ant, you've already got a house, and the family,
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:39.800]   you're going to get in a U-hall and drive out
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.920]   from Charlotte Nguyen.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.200]   We shall be here by the end of the month.
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:44.680]   OK.
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:45.760]   I can't give you an honor.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.760]   Boys are signing up for high school and everything.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.080]   It's like I'm signed up this morning.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:49.960]   Did you?
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:50.800]   Don't say what school.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:51.800]   Oh, I'm not saying what school.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.240]   They're good looking boys, and you're going to have a lot of--
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.680]   they're going to need a lot of attention.
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.280]   I tell you.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:59.880]   So anyway, we're just so glad to have you as part of the family.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:00.360]   Thank you.

[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:07.280]   Kind of like Bob Hope on the Johnny Carson show.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.280]   I think I was more like Volentold.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.920]   Volentold, that's what you were like.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:13.800]   Oh, I am stealing that for my kids.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:14.600]   Isn't that good?
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:17.560]   Who have been Volentold for this?
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.000]   Miss Lisa walks in the door.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.200]   Hey, you're getting on Twitter.
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:22.280]   Yeah, Miss Lisa told it.

[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.800]   That's all for us.
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.600]   It was a unanimous vote.
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:29.320]   It was a unanimous vote.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:32.600]   We all demanded more and.
