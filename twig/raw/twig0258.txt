[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.600]   Gina Trepenny has the day off.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.960]   Danny Sullivan's here from Search Engine Land,
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.400]   along with Jeff Jarvis.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.360]   We'll talk about all the Google News and your last chance
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.440]   to write to the FCC about net neutrality.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.920]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.920]   On Twig.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.600]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.440]   The show we cover at Google, but anything else
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.360]   we also want to talk about.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.600]   We talk a lot about journalism.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.800]   That's partly because we have one of the most prestigious
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.920]   professors of journalism in the entire world sitting
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.760]   on my right hand.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.920]   It's the lovely and talented Jeff Jarvis, Professor--
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.840]   I'm trying not to bore you with journalism today
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.200]   and try to stand up to substituting on Gina
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.520]   Trepani's screen.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.520]   Ah, you are on Gina's screen.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.520]   So you're on my left hand.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.760]   I apologize.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.680]   I was looking over here.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.280]   But wait a minute.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.760]   It's Danny Sullivan of Search Engine Land,
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.280]   a great person to fill in for Gina Trepani.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.800]   Danny, great to have you.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.280]   Thank you.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.800]   Good to be here.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.800]   Gina has the day off as you probably figured out.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.080]   I put some journalism stories in here, Jeff,
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.840]   because I wanted to ask you about them.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.880]   Oh, OK.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.120]   See?
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.600]   I think of you, man.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.600]   All the time.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.880]   I sense the audience running away at this point.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.920]   Well, yes.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.280]   You know, it's funny.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.200]   I was talking to Abby about it, and she said,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.000]   that's kind of inside baseball, Dad.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.560]   But as an article in Medium from a BBC tech journalist who
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.320]   says tech journalists are facing extinction,
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.200]   very soon I won't be needed, David Lee, writing here.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.000]   Danny's yawning.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Danny's yawning.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I don't know.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.840]   It's like this on top of yet another--
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.040]   oh, SEO is dead article.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.160]   I almost tweeted yesterday that telegraph marketing is soon
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.960]   will be dead.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.360]   No more dot, dot, dot, dash, dash, dash,
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.120]   ads in your inbox.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.600]   Exactly.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.000]   And OK, in that case, yeah.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.960]   Because, you know, now I don't think
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.320]   tech journalism is going to die.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.080]   He actually makes the point that I would make, which is that--
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.080]   you know, he's talking about basically how in the '90s,
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.680]   the BBC had an internet correspondence.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.400]   It's a correspondent.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.040]   And the notion that, wow, there's an internet correspondent.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.160]   Everybody blew everybody's mind.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.120]   Of course, nowadays, if you don't cover--
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.360]   you know, if you're covering the news,
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.160]   you're covering technology.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.600]   And I think that that's probably really more the story,
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.640]   which is technology journalists to survive
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.840]   need to be techno experts writing about everything else.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.600]   And I think that's a fair way to put it.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.640]   A journalist is always a journalist,
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.120]   and that's not going away.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.040]   But I mean, so that's sort of like saying everybody uses money,
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.000]   so we don't need a money correspondent.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.360]   And the reality is I agree with the idea
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.160]   that you don't necessarily have to have a reporter who just
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.400]   covers the internet because it's a weird new thing.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.840]   On the other hand, it's extremely helpful
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.720]   to have a reporter who covers the technology beat
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.400]   because they want to do in-depth coverage of what's
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.680]   going on in the technology beat in a way
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.360]   that you don't cover or don't understand if you're just
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.560]   a general assigned reporter.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.560]   Right.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.560]   And me and I--
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.080]   You know, and I deal with this all the time.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.560]   And we saw this with the whole right to be forgotten stuff,
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.960]   where you'd have people who didn't know search engines, who
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.000]   would understand what they thought was going on with search
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.960]   engines and make assumptions that weren't necessarily correct,
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.000]   because they weren't search journalists.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.480]   And they weren't even tech journalists.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.200]   They were like, I'm a political journalist,
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.880]   but I understand some of the technology stuff.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.640]   So I guess I know what I'm talking about.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.240]   That's actually the real risk, isn't it,
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.840]   that technology would be written about by people who use it,
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.320]   so they think they understand how it works.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.000]   And the net neutrality debate is another example of the--
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.360]   the deep technology you need to have
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.400]   to understand what's really going on.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.840]   Because beyond me sometimes, and certainly
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.680]   beyond any general assignment reporter.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.840]   And I think you get both of those, by the way.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.600]   I think that sometimes it's great to have someone who
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.160]   doesn't understand technology, because they don't sometimes
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.120]   get so caught up in trying to explain all the nuances.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.480]   And they just approach it as a normal.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.960]   And you get a better perspective in that way.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.720]   But I think you'll still have tech journalists as well.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.320]   Yeah, I mean, in some way--
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.320]   another way to express it is when everyone is a tech journalist,
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.960]   no one is a tech journalist.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.400]   And part of the problem with tech blogs, as don't we know,
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.520]   is that the explosion of bad Xerox
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.440]   is getting weaker and fainter with each copy,
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.520]   is really ruining the field, as a most--
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.760]   and there's only so many good ones.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.800]   You are one Danny.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.800]   I think recode is good.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.160]   I think the verge is good.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.240]   But there aren't many now.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.080]   There's a lot of crappy copies out there.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.320]   And that affects the field.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.800]   But that doesn't mean that it takes away
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.960]   from the need for people who do it well.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.200]   Article New York Magazine about Cara Swisher.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.440]   Did you see this?
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.520]   So the picture I can't figure out.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.440]   It looks fake.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.880]   She sounds like it's--
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.680]   it looks staged.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.160]   Silicon Valley's most feared and well-liked journalist.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.320]   I'm not sure about the well-liked, but feared for sure.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.360]   How does that work?
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.400]   I like what that--
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.080]   I just hit in the trees.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.440]   It's a strange picture.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.560]   It looks like it's staged.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.800]   She's supposedly talking to Jane Metcalf,
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.160]   founder of Wired, who has apparently--
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.080]   It's a couple from 10B movies.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.240]   Extras from 10B movies.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.000]   I didn't know Jane Metcalf wore a scarf,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.400]   kind of like-- I don't know--
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.800]   Steve Tyler, an arrow-lipped.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.560]   Very good.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.080]   That's it.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.440]   You got it.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.440]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.880]   Apparently, behind to the right
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.160]   looks like an extra out-of-costume from Ben Hur.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.280]   It's just begs to be photoshopped.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.640]   And then you got with a guy with a gimme hat.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.600]   Who looks like he's out of some baseball movie.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.400]   It's a very weird picture.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.560]   It really does.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.320]   You know, it's funny because I think probably people
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.000]   kind of gloss over and start reading the article.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.080]   But you and I both went, what's going on in this picture?
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.000]   Strangeest thing.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.880]   And they do point out--
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.560]   I couldn't come up with a way to tweet about it
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.480]   to say what was so weird about it, but it's very weird.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.960]   Well, it's also the way it's lit.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.800]   It's very odd.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.280]   Anyway, we shouldn't focus on the picture
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.320]   because it's really about care.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.880]   Oh, it did.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.240]   Sorry about that.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.560]   Good for her for getting--
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.280]   But I laughed a lot because at one point it says,
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.120]   one of the reasons for Swisher's unusual status
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.520]   in the valley is her longevity.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.880]   Now 51, she began covering tech in the early '90s.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.440]   Yeah, I kind of know.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.280]   Wow.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.160]   That long ago.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.560]   Anyway, she certainly is one of the most powerful people.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.800]   And she's one of the best.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.720]   She's very good.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.160]   Let's give it.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.840]   The recode really has high standards.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.520]   And for them, a scoop is really a scoop.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.880]   And they link to things.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.400]   And--
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.480]   She's very good at that.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.920]   Here's the thing to me.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.480]   Before recode, when they were at the journal,
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.400]   MOSPER was the brand.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:33.880]   He owned it.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.080]   Now to me, Swisher is the brand.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.640]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.520]   And Walt's not been writing a whole lot of recode.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.640]   He's kind of the elder statesman at this point.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.880]   Speaking of weird pictures, did you
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.280]   scroll down to see the picture of Cara that they--
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.480]   That's weird too.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:48.980]   Yeah.
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:49.960]   That's great.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.440]   She's in the ivy, lost in the ivy.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.240]   There's her dogs, one of whom crapped on our cottage floor.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.480]   I went in the Cara visitors a few years ago.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.720]   I'm not sure if it was Phineas or Leroy, but anyway.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.200]   Isn't that weird?
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.440]   It looks like the ad where they pulled the old Chicago
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.840]   complier out of the ivy.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.000]   It really feel.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.480]   I can't remember who the ad was for,
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.320]   but it kind of reminds me of that.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.400]   Cara is a character.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.680]   We love Cara.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.440]   Anyway, enough inside baseball.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.680]   Let's talk about Google.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.760]   Big story.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.920]   Alan Malali, who's just recently departed as CEO at Ford.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.720]   And really, I think, well-regarded CEO, perhaps one
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.560]   of the best CEOs in the country, has now taken a job with Google.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.000]   He's on the board of directors.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.040]   It wasn't he rumored to be a CEO candidate for Microsoft
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.560]   or was that always just speculation?
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.040]   Well, it was speculation.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.640]   Nobody really said.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.160]   In fact, one of the things we heard
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.400]   is that the Ford board went to--
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.520]   Malali had said, would you please deny this
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.840]   because we can't get back to business until you do?
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.920]   So I don't know if he really was considered.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.760]   Certainly was mentioned.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.480]   I know Malali because we've interviewed him many times
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.400]   for this show.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.120]   Ford was a sponsor, and we always got good access to him.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.040]   And I always regarded him as a very smart.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.760]   He was an engineer at Boeing, designed the 777 cockpit,
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   went to Ford, and really turned the company around
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.560]   to the point where they didn't have to take any money
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.400]   from Congress as the other two big three automakers did.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.680]   And don't have the disasters that GM has just--
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.200]   No GM disasters, exactly.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.640]   Ford's become a very successful-- probably
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.080]   the most successful US auto manufacturer, maybe
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.400]   the most successful in the world.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.280]   And he's a smart, cagey guy.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.600]   But I knew he was retiring three years ago, he told me.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.080]   Yeah, I'm in my 60s.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.080]   You know what happens when you hit 60?
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.800]   It's all downhill.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.280]   Yeah, I know.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.760]   It's all downhill.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.760]   He said, I'm in my 60s.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.720]   I want to spend more time with my family.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.960]   This is much more like I expected as a second chapter
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.460]   for him.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.800]   And the board of directors, effective July 9,
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.640]   so he's sitting there now.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.160]   Interesting too, because I think Google's biggest problem
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.720]   now, which Schmidt has long said, is that the company's too big.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.600]   It's hard to manage.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.280]   I hear that from around there that it's siloed
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.040]   and it's got issues.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.520]   And you take Model A from a huge company like Ford.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.320]   And I hope there's some insight to figure out
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.000]   how to keep Google to be Google.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.200]   Yeah, I wonder-- you've served on boards.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.320]   Yes, tiny ones.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.320]   Tiny, tiny ones.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.320]   What is-- how important-- well, see,
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.720]   I guess it depends on the company.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.200]   For instance, Microsoft's board is really a rubber stamp.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.000]   They don't-- there's only a few people
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.320]   with any power on the Microsoft board.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.520]   The rest are just there to say, yes, sir.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.840]   What is-- I don't know what the-- maybe you have some insight.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.360]   What is the Google board like?
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.600]   Is it smart, strong-minded individuals?
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.440]   I don't know.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.160]   I-- no, I don't think so.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.240]   Let's look who's on it.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.320]   I think-- well, Larry is in Sergey, of course,
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.640]   and Eric Schmidt.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.520]   John Doar, there's a strong-minded guy.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.240]   That's true.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.400]   General Parker, partner, Kleiner Perkins.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.640]   Diane Green.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.400]   She's from Intuit, or as a member of the board of Intuit,
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.840]   MIT, CEO of VMware from '98 to 2008.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.120]   Smart technologist, John Hennessy.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.600]   John Hennessy.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.360]   President of Stanford.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.960]   He's not going to be that tough.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.960]   No, Anne Mather.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:18.480]   I don't know what Anne Mather-- she was previously
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.000]   a director of Central European media enterprises.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.200]   Boy, geez.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.600]   OK.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.200]   Moneygram, she was at Moneygram International.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.240]   She was Pixar exec, EVP, and CFO at Pixar.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.320]   Oh, OK.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.680]   But only from '99 to 2004.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.240]   She was also a village roadshow.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.800]   You know, one of the things that tells you
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.440]   is which areas Google has some ambitions in.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.960]   Yep.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.400]   Autos.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.080]   Paul Adolini, former CEO at Intel,
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.120]   there's a strong-minded guy.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:50.680]   Paul Adolini is not going to take a backseat to anybody.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.720]   Rameshiram, who is a venture capitalist.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.040]   He was also at Amazon in the early days.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.480]   And Shirley Tilghman, president of Princeton.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.240]   Two big academics, Stanford and Princeton press.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.080]   I think those are a few strong personalities on there.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.480]   I think this is not a board that's
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.400]   going to fight Laurie and Sergey.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.080]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.400]   When you have founders on the board and former CEOs
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:20.360]   on the board, it really is tough to stand up
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.760]   if you're the president of Princeton.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.520]   Say, well, I think Google should do this.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.320]   Yeah, well, thanks.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.080]   You know, and again, I have such a little bit of this.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.120]   I would love to be on more boards.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.000]   I found it absolutely fascinating.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.640]   And one of them, I was the outside director.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.520]   And I was-- well, I've always been the outside director,
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.040]   but I was needed in that capacity.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.520]   There were issues in the board where
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.760]   I was the guy who had to stand back and say, whoa, everybody.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.400]   And say some of the tough things.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.800]   That's what a board should be doing.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.400]   Should be--
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.680]   A board should not be a representative.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.920]   But you know, you're just--
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.080]   it's a small group of people.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.760]   You get the dynamics a lot easier than you do in a company
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.240]   and in a time-warner with task forces all over.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.160]   It's a lot harder to give.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.680]   You have, you know, 6'8" people, and you have a tough issue
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.360]   before you, and you can see where the interests are.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.720]   That makes it pretty clear.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.480]   I do think it's interesting that they've got somebody
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.320]   from the movie industry on the board.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.120]   Alan has experience in autos, of course.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.000]   So with the Autonomous Cars, that will be interesting.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.080]   But he's also an aerospace engineer.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.240]   And certainly, he has some aerospace ambitions
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.680]   with Project Loon and drones and so forth.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.240]   Anyway, I think that's a good snag.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.520]   I'm sure he'll be on other boards.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.960]   It's not a full-time job.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.520]   I'd love to be on that board.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.960]   That'd be fun.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.960]   Good job.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.960]   I don't know.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.960]   How does that work?
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.600]   Is the board-- probably the board has a committee
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.640]   on board members that nominate people
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.640]   and the board is a whole vote.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.640]   Yeah, probably.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.000]   Well, what they also do is they hire headhunters just for boards.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Right.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.760]   I mean, the issue is you have higher liability
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.800]   in the public company, but--
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   Incidentally, happy birthday, Jeff.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.800]   Oh.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.560]   He turned 60 yesterday.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.440]   My entire comment on it was 60 period.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.440]   F word period.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.440]   I saw that.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.440]   I love that.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.680]   That's how I started my day yesterday with that little choice.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.600]   I post on Google+, I loved it.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.040]   It's Google+, Dad.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.040]   I've tried with Norm.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.960]   Danny, what is going on with Google+, you know?
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.640]   Google was kind of at pains.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.360]   They didn't mention it at Google I/O, but Larry,
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.560]   in an interview, was at pains to say, we're very happy with it.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.840]   He was very excited about it.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.480]   If you were more excited about Google+,
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.000]   I guess I don't want Larry to be that excited about anything
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.600]   if I were to survive.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.080]   Well, it was Violet Blue who blamed Sergey Brin
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.480]   in no uncertain words for letting her down.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.720]   Now, the good news is one of the things Violet Blue was so
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.240]   mad about was the Nim Wars early on.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.360]   Google+ demanded you use your real name.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.320]   And people like Violet Blue and others who either didn't
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.280]   want to use their-- I guess her real name is Violet Blue,
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.240]   so that's not an issue.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.200]   But there are others.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.760]   Our own Dr. Kiki, Kirsten Sanford, who was best known
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.200]   by her brand, Dr. Kiki, had trouble being Dr. Kiki.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.360]   She succeeded at some point, didn't she?
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.320]   She succeeded.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.040]   Lady Gaga succeeded.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.600]   If your big name you succeeded, the example
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.600]   Violet Blue brought up that was the negative
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.240]   was that somebody who was in gender transition kind of got
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.880]   outed to her in employers because she had two
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.520]   Google+ accounts, an official one in her own.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.600]   And then because the names had to match,
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.640]   it got revealed to her employers that she was in transition.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.560]   She wasn't ready for that to happen.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.240]   And that's one of many good reasons
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.000]   why anonymity might be nice.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.920]   Google has announced-- they announced yesterday,
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.640]   we're going to let go of that requirement.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.080]   We're going to allow you to use handles on Google+.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.160]   But is that much of a real change?
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:09.520]   I don't think that's a change suddenly
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.120]   caused people to embrace Google+
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.840]   that they weren't doing it already.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.680]   I suspect that it's a change that's
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.400]   being done in part to hide other disconnects
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.560]   from what Google+ was to what it's becoming.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.400]   And in other words, back when Vic left,
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.920]   and then the rumors came out that Google+ was going to die,
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.400]   there was all this discussion of, well, no, it's not going to die.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.240]   And we love it, and it's going to stay there.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:38.440]   And I think really the better perspective was, no,
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.520]   they're not going to kill the Google+ sharing system.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.760]   But all the Google+ application that
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.960]   had been going on within Google, where they would take Google+
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.880]   and use that to underpin everything,
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.520]   is going to slowly, over time, be backed away.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.320]   And the products are not going to be required
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.480]   to have all this Google+ stuff in them,
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.800]   although they'll still use Google accounts.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.920]   And then if you think about it from that way,
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.560]   then you can imagine that if, say, you're on YouTube
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.320]   and you are used to having a handle or name or whatever,
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.360]   you don't want to start up your YouTube account
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.800]   and then be forced to have to have first name, last name,
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.200]   and all this weird stuff.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.560]   And in fact, when they merged the two together,
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.720]   they didn't force that upon YouTube.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.000]   And if Google goes out and brings in other products,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.880]   or if they're changing other products that are out there,
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.800]   they may have decided, you know what?
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.040]   Enough with this.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.080]   OK, we wanted everybody to have a verified identity on Google+,
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.880]   and they all had to have certain names.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.240]   We're not trying to shove Google+ at anybody anymore.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.160]   So let's back off on the name requirement,
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.320]   because not only does that help with the relatively small people
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.760]   who are upset about it, I mean, it wasn't impacting
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.480]   that many people, and I'm not saying it's not a big issue
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.520]   for those people, but if you wanted to list all the reasons
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.640]   why Google+ is not more popular,
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.240]   this wasn't a big issue for it.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.160]   But there may be other--
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.920]   But there may be other issues that are going on,
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.840]   but I suspect that this is tied to something
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.160]   we haven't seen yet.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.960]   And to give you an example of that, then I'll shut up.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.800]   But a week ago or two weeks ago, Google announced
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.800]   that they were no longer going to show images or authors
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.040]   in their search results.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.920]   So you used to be Google's on this big thing.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.520]   Like, you should use Google+ and tell us your name
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.040]   and then link it to your website so that if you've written a post,
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.040]   we will have a picture of you that will show along with your name
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.160]   and you're an author and everything.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.520]   And they dropped all that.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.320]   And everybody's like, well, why'd you drop all that?
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.400]   Because you told us that this was really big,
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.360]   and it was really helpful, and it did a lot of good stuff for people.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.000]   And I suspect one of the reasons they dropped
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.320]   is because they knew that they were going to let up on the name
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.400]   requirement.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.360]   And maybe they'll start to let up on the image requirement
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.320]   that's with authorship or whatever.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.360]   And so if someone wants to go by a name of Big Daddy, check me out,
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.120]   and that's their name, they want to have it,
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.800]   that might not be the author name Google
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.360]   wants to reflect in the search results
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.840]   that anybody might see as well.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.480]   And so there's all these things going on that I
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.000]   don't think we're getting the full picture of.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.920]   And I suspect that this name changes
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.400]   and just about dealing with some of the real issues
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.000]   that people have had, but it's connected to others.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.160]   It'll all get tiny good.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:08.680]   Yeah, I'm looking.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.000]   I just searched for my name Leo LaPorte.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.360]   And I did the author equals the rel link
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.120]   or whatever it was you were supposed to do.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.880]   And it used to be when you'd find my blog,
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.800]   there'd be a picture of me on the left that's gone.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.880]   That's kind of annoying.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.120]   I mean, I spent a lot of time getting that working,
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.640]   and I liked it.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.280]   Because curiosity theory on that was that it reduced
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.680]   click through to Google Ads.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.520]   I have no idea.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.520]   I actually--
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.680]   Well, that meant what I saw.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.440]   And that was based off of one really, really tiny little study.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.200]   And I know the person who did it, and we looked at it,
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.320]   and we thought, should we write an article?
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.480]   And I'm like, we'd like to see a little bit more off of this
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.160]   before we decide that was the reason they dropped it.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.720]   I think it was more paranoia speaking than anything else.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.280]   The reaction I saw to the name change thing was,
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.240]   uh-oh, the trolls are going to come back to YouTube.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.440]   I saw that in a lot of British sites.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.960]   Well, that-- I mean, look, so that's the trade-off, right?
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:00.400]   Real name policy means really, in general,
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.120]   you're going to be responsible for what you post.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.120]   Whereas when you-- on the other hand,
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.360]   there's a real value to anonymity on the net.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.840]   We don't require real names in our chat room, for instance.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.960]   That has a mixed bag.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.440]   Some people can do stuff and drive buys and stuff,
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.920]   and they're not really responsible.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.320]   The other hand, it gives them a freedom to speak.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.480]   Certainly, if you're a whistleblower,
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.120]   or you're in a country where it's not OK to speak your mind,
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.680]   these are all valuable things.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.960]   Doesn't Google still-- this is my question,
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.240]   and it's for you, Danny.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.840]   Doesn't Google still know your real name?
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.720]   Isn't it-- isn't it, in fact, just giving them
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.760]   more information, tying your handle to your real name?
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.960]   Well, it depends on how you sign up for stuff with Google,
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.280]   right?
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.840]   I mean, if you open a Gmail account,
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.160]   I don't think they're requiring you to--
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:42.660]   No.
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.240]   Not like they verify your name, so you can put anything
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:45.920]   that's in there.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.960]   Yeah, I have a Gmail account that's chief to it.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.760]   I could change my name to chief to it on my Google+.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.480]   Yeah, you could change it now.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.640]   Yeah, good luck having two or three accounts.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.920]   Let me tell you about that still.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.680]   But you just don't want to have--
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.160]   You don't want to have multiple accounts.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:01.680]   I do.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.320]   You're just instead of--
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:07.600]   Well, you never want to Google Apps account.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.840]   But they can figure out your real name that they want to.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.160]   But I mean, it's a real name.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.760]   OK, you want to be conspiracy theory-minded,
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.720]   then it seems to me the real advantage to Google is good.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.520]   We know their real names are gathering information on that.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.840]   Now we'll know their names.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.800]   But I think the real name is you kind of
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.760]   go to something else that seemed to be part of what Google
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.360]   was trying to do, which is that--
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.200]   and this goes to Eric Schmidt's book
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.520]   that he brought out last year, which
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.680]   is that Google had this belief or seemed to have this belief
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.320]   that the more they could verify everybody's identities,
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.400]   the more they could then decide, this is good information,
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.040]   this is bad information.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040]   We can trust this person.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.800]   We cannot trust that person.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.880]   And so this seemed to be a blow against all that.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.680]   If you're not going to be verifying people
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.200]   and having them use their names, then this whole thing
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.600]   that you were spinning up about how we're
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.240]   going to have verified information and so on,
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.600]   it doesn't work as well.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.480]   Although you get other benefits that come out,
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.720]   which may be information you weren't
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.920]   going to get because people didn't want
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.000]   to share it into their own names.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.400]   Yeah, I think it was a--
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.880]   I have a slightly different take on this.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.120]   And it's in Kuwait, so I'm not saying it's complete.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.200]   But I think that--
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.880]   and we have this just got a little bit of this discussion
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.560]   a few weeks ago.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.840]   When Zuckerberg said he was breaking up the big blue app
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.720]   and he doesn't care if you use WhatsApp for chatting
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.840]   and use Instagram for photos and use Facebook for this
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.840]   and so on and so forth, Google's essential structure
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.760]   is that they have an underlying relationship database
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.880]   on top of all kinds of apps--
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.520]   maps, mail, calendar, and so on--
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.840]   that generates signals about your context
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.640]   of what you're doing right now and help Google give you
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.400]   better services as a result.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.160]   So what should that underlying database look like?
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.840]   The problem is that Google+ kind of violated that.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.080]   It said, everything in the social is right here
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:55.920]   in the same thing.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.240]   And if you want to do photos, it's here.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.760]   And if you want to do talk in, it's here.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.880]   And if you want to do Hangouts, it's here.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.680]   And you've got to come to Google+ to do that.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.560]   And I think that's anti-Google.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.160]   I think it's better to have these things be somewhat separate.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:11.400]   And underneath that is a separate function of identity.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.840]   And so I think identity needs to be a lot more sophisticated
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.360]   than it is now, where you will have your real name here.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.320]   It wasn't a good enough policy.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.640]   Obviously, when you use Wallet, Google
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.080]   knows something real about your identity.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.160]   When you use Android, Google knows something real about your identity.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.600]   Maybe not your name, but they have something
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.560]   that is tangible to tie into.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.600]   And so there's a quality of identity
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.240]   that I think is much more subtle and enters into things
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.280]   as we move forward.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.760]   And it's not as simple as saying, number one,
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.160]   you must use your real name in Google+, and number two,
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.720]   all these functions fit with that identity in Google+.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.240]   That's what was getting them in trouble somewhat.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.720]   And except for eating them out as concepts,
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.280]   we'll let them develop in ways that I can't predict.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.760]   We know they're sitting there at Google,
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.840]   and they know exactly what they're up to, and they're listening
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.040]   and laughing.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.320]   Yes.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.120]   You mortals, you mere mortals.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.280]   Be fooled them again.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.800]   I think that just--
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.360]   It's reading the tea leaves as Patrick has it.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.800]   I just think, Jeff Allen, who scores what I was saying,
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.640]   I think Google does have a coherent database
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.880]   and giving them your name is just one more signal.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.760]   It's very easy for them to correlate that with your real name.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.720]   It's all is in the service of gathering as much information
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.400]   as it can about you.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.520]   Yeah, and the solution to the damned multiple account
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.840]   problem, which has never been solved.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.840]   Yes.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.080]   They promised to promise to promise.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.440]   They said, oh, we had the same problem.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.040]   We're going to solve it.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.200]   They haven't.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.400]   The solution is for me to have the facility to say that,
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.120]   and that is me.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.680]   But that's what author equal--
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.080]   it did.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.560]   But what the same was like me.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.160]   But that's me.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.040]   And they should want to do that.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.880]   I think this kind of goes to what you're saying, Leah,
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.360]   where they will--
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.400]   and some of what you're saying, Jeff,
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.240]   where they're trying to force us all into one place.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.360]   If you flip back and look at Facebook,
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.960]   you have a Facebook profile, and you
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.080]   can decide to put stuffs out on your Facebook profile
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.680]   as you want.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.000]   But that's primarily something that's only used at Facebook,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.500]   right?
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.000]   You're bio.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:13.960]   That would have these links.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.960]   Oh, this is--
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.760]   --but no, no, your profile, right?
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.640]   You also have Facebook account.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.080]   And your account can be used to do all sorts of things.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.800]   Like I'm going to have an Instagram account.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.120]   And if I use my Facebook account to open Instagram,
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.440]   I'll set up a profile as I want at Instagram, separately
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.600]   from my profile over Facebook.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.360]   And what Google had was Google accounts.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.320]   And then Google accounts started gaining Google profiles.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.200]   And then we got Google+, and then they made the whole thing.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.620]   There are no more Google accounts.
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.300]   You really kind of have a Google+ account.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.220]   Although there are some people who have Google+ accounts
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.300]   that don't enable Google+.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.020]   So those are Google.
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.900]   They've really kind of got rid of the idea of Google account.
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.100]   And I think that's what's coming back,
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.980]   is that we're going to have Google accounts.
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:01.700]   And Google accounts may have profile information
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.340]   that primarily you might see within Google+,
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.340]   but you'll use your Google account for other stuff
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.220]   like I want to enable maps.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.940]   And on maps, I may have a different profile.
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.280]   I might even have a different nickname
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.240]   that I want to use when I'm on maps
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.820]   than when I'm commenting on YouTube in different places.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.940]   As part of this whole spirit of, hey,
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:22.580]   the days of one giant app for everything is over,
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.260]   now it's all about everybody's got the single purpose
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.700]   app that's sort of coming back.
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:35.340]   It's very-- also, I should point out, it's very possible
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.860]   that Google is completely benign and just observed.
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.940]   This wasn't serving people.
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.220]   It wasn't a good thing.
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.540]   OK, you know, violent-- it's very possible Google said,
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.740]   you know, violent made a good point.
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.940]   Let's get rid of that.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.380]   Or could be the--
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.860]   I mean, I get religious about things.
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.100]   Or this could be a fixed thing.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.460]   Religious about it.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.580]   Oh, OK, now he's gone.
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.180]   Well, does anybody really care about that?
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:57.660]   No?
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.580]   All right.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.380]   I mean, there's an engineer in the thread
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.100]   who is a really, really long thread who actually commented
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.660]   and said this was in the works before Vic left.
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.220]   And Vic was all aware of this.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.580]   So it wasn't something that happened.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.940]   It just suddenly happened.
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.620]   At the same time, you know, as a reaction to violence
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:18.140]   concerns, you know, over two years, three years after it
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:22.380]   happened, it's like, I'm maybe I'm just too cynical,
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.180]   but part of me thinks, yeah, Google's about to launch
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.300]   its own secret app.
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.020]   And so they decided, well, we better have an anonymous name
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.140]   situation because--
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.860]   I think that's what's going on.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.980]   Oh, yeah, you know, maybe.
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.180]   Wow.
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.060]   I like that.
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.300]   That's a good theory.
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.300]   Right, but I mean, if you're Google
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.820]   and you're looking at the explosion of things like this,
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.940]   and you're saying, do you want to do this sort of stuff?
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:44.300]   Yeah.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.740]   But we can't do it because all we said,
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.180]   everybody had to have real names, then suddenly saying,
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.020]   well, you know, we've thought about it and you're right.
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.780]   It only took us three years to decide that it made sense.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.380]   But now, you know, we're glad we arrived
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.580]   at the right decision.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.820]   In the time I think Snapchat came out,
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.740]   Secret and Whisper came out, Facebook's tried twice
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.380]   now to create such apps, Google hasn't done anything
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:05.740]   in that way.
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:06.820]   And they can.
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.220]   I think it's a problem for Google credibility
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.100]   to come out with things that are like fat.
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.500]   I think Danny's theory is right about an account
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.500]   architecture and identity architecture being separate things.
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.260]   I think that's the kind of Google way to look at things.
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:23.620]   And if anybody knows their way of thinking, it's you, Danny.
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:28.860]   One of the things they said is that up to now,
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.260]   Google flagged pseudonyms or even unusual names,
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:36.060]   like Violet Blue, for review, that's gone.
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.220]   Pending appeals have all been granted.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.860]   If you appealed and said, now I want to use that name,
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.820]   they said, OK, and now you'll be able to change your name.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:46.700]   It used to be you could change it three times in two years,
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.100]   which is not a lot.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.500]   Now it's once every 30, 90 days, once every three months.
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.140]   Another thing, by the way, is, you know,
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.460]   if you really are kind of scaling down Google+,
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.780]   and you're losing people, and you don't really
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.500]   want to spend a lot of time on it,
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.700]   having somebody sit there and deal with all this stuff
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.620]   is easier just to say, yeah, whatever you want.
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:05.100]   Whatever.
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.420]   Do whatever you want.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.860]   We're going to or cut you in a moment anyway.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.540]   So you five people who were assigned to try to enforce
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.300]   these rules.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.860]   That's all right.
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.540]   I like real names on one.
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.940]   I mean, I really have mixed feelings about this.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.260]   Real names do raise the quality and the tone
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.140]   of the conversation to the degree that people are a lot
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.300]   or have been able to use phony names on Google+,
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.780]   as a degree there's been trolling and harassment
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.820]   on Google+, and you know what was happening?
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.420]   As you know, whenever I put a file,
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.100]   I got to the point on Google+, put up a photo,
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.660]   I would get the horrible comment spam.
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.220]   Cool, okay.
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.580]   Hi.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.580]   And how were all those things appear?
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.980]   They appeared in names like, would appear to be Thai
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.220]   or Vietnamese or something like that.
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.060]   You won't know where they're a real name anyway.
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.340]   What's, where's the dictionary of real names
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.700]   across all languages?
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.220]   It's pretty hard to give anybody the job to say that
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.820]   Twang Dong is a Vietnamese real name
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.420]   or it's a made up spam name.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.980]   And here's the good news.
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.460]   We've had three years of real names.
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.580]   That's enough.
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.940]   The tone has been set.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:08.780]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.340]   You could also just say, fine, that will stop.
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.660]   But really the tone has been set.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.180]   I'm not going to, what am I going to do change my name?
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:13.940]   No.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.020]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.620]   So it's a job done.
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.660]   It would be another way of mission accomplished.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.180]   Another way of describing this.
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:26.740]   Google, one of the creators of Google Glass
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.820]   has gone over to Amazon.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.900]   I thought that was kind of interesting.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.900]   Maybe, I don't know, maybe,
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:40.900]   Babak Parvez, who is one of the research directors on Google X.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:44.900]   Maybe he's going to Amazon to do Glass at Amazon
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:45.900]   or maybe there's other big print.
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:49.900]   Or Glass has such kudos now that nobody care that he left.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:50.900]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:51.900]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.900]   He did also do Google contact lenses,
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:58.900]   which is something that's actually starting to come to market.
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:30:59.900]   I think that...
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:00.740]   No, Vardis.
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:01.740]   Vardis has proposed...
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:02.740]   Or at least research, yeah.
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:03.740]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.740]   Well, they have to do FDA approval, obviously.
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:06.740]   Yeah.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.740]   It's not imminent.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:12.180]   But these would be contact lenses with circuitry that would be able to do things like, for
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.740]   instance, measure your blood glucose level.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.540]   That's something Google doesn't probably want to get in the business of because you have
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.540]   to get FDA approval.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.540]   It's a medical device.
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.140]   It's kind of a different kind of business.
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.060]   Let no Vardis do this.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.020]   That's what they do so well.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:33.580]   I went and spoke at Novardis once in Basel and the size of the structure of having to test
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:34.580]   things.
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:35.580]   I just...
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.580]   I mean, I knew it intellectually.
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.380]   When you sat down and saw how many people they had to get for each test and all they
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.660]   have to go through for the data, Jesus, it's unbelievable.
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.660]   Oh.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.660]   I mean, for a good reason.
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.660]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.660]   For a good reason.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.660]   Yeah.
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:55.220]   So there's that big New York Times article we all saw that by Andrew Ross Sorkin, who
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:32:01.140]   somebody said is Wall Street's favorite Times reporter, that Rupert Murdoch offered $80
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.660]   billion for Time Warner.
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:07.660]   But buried in there is the notion that now that Time Warner turned it down, now that
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:13.380]   Time Warner has turned it down, it might be in play and that Google might be interested.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:19.980]   I think that's the most absurd speculation of the month because Google cannot own content.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.340]   It just would put itself in terrible channel content.
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.340]   But it does.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.340]   It owns YouTube.
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.900]   No, no, no, but that's not, no, that's not.
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:27.900]   That's a platform for content.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.860]   It doesn't own the content there.
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:30.860]   It doesn't.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:35.060]   Even when it bought next to networks, it kind of shoved the content aside and kept the platform.
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.060]   And the problems they have in Europe, now the age of one more, problems they have in Europe
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:44.900]   now about complaints that they advantage their own stuff, well, yeah, they're going to push
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.900]   their own maps and that's okay.
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:50.580]   But if they start pushing their movies against somebody else's movies, the anti-trust festival
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.420]   is just going to be gigantic.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.300]   I can't see them doing it.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.300]   I don't care.
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:02.140]   I mean, I, you know, back when the rumor was in the day that, oh, Google could buy the
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:06.780]   New York Times, I used to be the same thing, like, well, no, they would never do that because
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:10.580]   they don't own content and that's a real conflict.
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.540]   They all know sorts of content now.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:17.900]   And I've given up trying to figure out if there are no go areas for Google or not.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.780]   Are there reasons why they wouldn't do it and are they going to do it?
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.900]   There's good reasons why they wouldn't do it.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:26.060]   But yeah, I can see Google deciding that it's going to be fine now.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.780]   And they could buy something like Time Warner and they could decide that they want to sell
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.300]   off parts of it and we want to keep the cable thing.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.540]   What would go, you know, we want to keep this as a continued experiment of what we're going
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.540]   to do and delivering information.
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.660]   And I said, really, why would you want anything that's in Time Warner?
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.060]   You know, what, oh, I want AOL.
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.860]   What would you want, I guess?
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:48.860]   That's a good question.
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.860]   What is Time Warner?
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:50.860]   Oh, oh.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.860]   So, you know, I'm not going to do it.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:53.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:54.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:55.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:56.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:57.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:58.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:33:59.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:00.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:01.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:03.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:04.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:06.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:07.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:08.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:09.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:11.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:18.860]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:19.860]   I'm not going to do it, frankly.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:20.860]   But that's another matter.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:25.860]   When Sorkin wrote of this in the
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:30.860]   Times, I guess Variety magazine
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.860]   asked Jeff Bukes the CEO of Time
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:34.860]   Warner about this speculation.
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.860]   And Bukes says, "I know nothing.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.860]   I don't know whether he did it in
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:39.860]   the past."
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.860]   So we don't know if this is
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.860]   classic rumor crap.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.860]   That's also rumor-murdock having fun
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:46.860]   and putting time Warner in play.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.860]   He loves doing it.
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:48.860]   You've got to think.
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.860]   He just loves that.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:50.860]   I mean, if you're, look, you're
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.860]   ancient, you're rich.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:53.860]   Let's just play with him.
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.860]   Yeah, the interview was going to
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:56.860]   interview by the BBC a few minutes
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:57.860]   ago.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:58.860]   Everybody's going to speculate
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:34:59.860]   and have fun with us now.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.860]   It's around Sun Valley.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.860]   It's silly season.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.860]   They do stuff for the Allen
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:06.860]   covers.
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:07.860]   Hey, let's take a break.
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.860]   I'm going to talk about
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:10.860]   what some are speculating is a
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:11.860]   massive shift to Gmail.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:12.860]   Too bad.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:13.860]   Gina's not here.
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:14.860]   Maybe you talked about it
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:15.860]   last week.
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:16.860]   I don't know because this is
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:17.860]   something really Gina would have
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:18.860]   something to comment about.
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:19.860]   A Gmail API and how that might
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:20.860]   change things coming up.
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:21.860]   First, though, a word from our
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.860]   sponsor, hover.com.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.860]   A better way to register and
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.860]   manage your domain names is how,
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.860]   you know, when I discovered
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.860]   hover, I moved everything over
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:34.860]   there.
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.860]   By the way, they have a great
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.860]   concierge service that will
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.860]   improve your sites.
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:38.860]   The valet, they call it now
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.860]   the valet transfer service.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:42.860]   For free, they will move your
[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.860]   sites over the, which, by the
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.860]   way, is not an insignificant
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:47.860]   chore.
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.860]   I wish I had to use this valet
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.860]   service because there's other
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:52.860]   domain name companies that
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:53.860]   don't want you to move and they
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.860]   lock your domain and they'll make
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.860]   it hard.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:57.860]   The valet service does it for
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:58.860]   you for free.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.860]   They transfer all the DNS
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:00.860]   settings.
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.860]   They do it all so easily.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:03.860]   And the cost $10.
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:04.860]   That includes an additional year
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.860]   on your domain.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.860]   Right now, Hover is having a
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.860]   sale in all the new domain name
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:11.860]   extensions.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.860]   Through September 1, whether
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:13.860]   you're an existing customer or
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.860]   a new customer, great time to
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:16.860]   start a new project.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.860]   Every single new domain, deep
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.860]   discounted.
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:24.860]   I'm talking.club.ninja.guru.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.860]   Not just about anything.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.860]   Geeks, developers, designers,
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:29.860]   programmers, love Hover.
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:30.860]   They know it's going to be
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:31.860]   simple.
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:32.860]   They're done with the idea that
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.860]   you try to buy a domain name and
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.860]   you have to go through 80 pages
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:36.860]   of yes, no questions.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:37.860]   You want to buy this?
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:38.860]   You want to buy this?
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:39.860]   All that up selling.
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:40.860]   Hover gives you what you need.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.860]   You register the domain name.
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:42.860]   They give you this week in
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:43.860]   Google Club, this week in
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.860]   Google community, this week in
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.860]   Google Camp Academy Institute
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.860]   International Foundation.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.860]   You state an education all
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:52.860]   and say you can educate.education
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.860]   for 16 bucks for a year.
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.860]   That's good.
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.860]   Look at all of these.
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.860]   They make it so simple.
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:01.860]   They give you who is doing it
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:02.860]   and they give you who is
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:03.860]   domain privacy because they
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:04.860]   know that you're going to want
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:05.860]   that.
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:06.860]   You can add email to any of
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.860]   your domain names.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.860]   That's a real good reason.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.860]   You may say, well, I don't need
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:11.860]   to do a website.
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:12.860]   I'm not doing a website, but
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.860]   let me ask you, are you still
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.860]   using at AOL.com at Hotmail.com?
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.860]   Even at Gmail.com is your
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:20.860]   email address.
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:21.860]   What if you decide to move
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:22.860]   next year?
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:23.860]   Are you going to have to tell
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:24.860]   everybody your change the name?
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.860]   Best thing to do.
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.860]   Do this when your kids are
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:27.860]   young.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.860]   I did it for Abby and
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.860]   Henry.
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:30.860]   Get their name and it's a
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.860]   Abby at abbyloport.com.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.860]   And no matter what they use,
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:35.860]   from now on, whether they use
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:37.860]   Gmail or anything else, they
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:38.860]   just have it forwarded by
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.860]   Hover to that system.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:41.860]   That's so good.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.860]   Very powerful DNS management,
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.860]   bulk management tools,
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.860]   fantastic support team, the
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:48.860]   best support around.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:49.860]   They're famous for their no
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.860]   wait, no hold, no transfer
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:52.860]   customer service.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.860]   When you call, you'll get a
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:54.860]   real, leooport.exchange.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.860]   holiday.
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.860]   Oh, I need that one.
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:58.860]   .email.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:37:59.860]   See?
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:00.860]   There you go.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:01.860]   Get your name.email.
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:02.860]   See, would you see if
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:03.860]   leport.email is there?
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:04.860]   Because then I could say
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.860]   leo at leport.email.
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:07.860]   That would be a good name.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:08.860]   That would be good.
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:09.860]   Quick.
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.860]   Quick before somebody else does.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.860]   Hover.com.
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:13.860]   That's one of the problems
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:14.860]   with Hover.
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:15.860]   So easy and quick.
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.860]   People can jump in.
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.860]   I'm going to do it.
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.860]   I love Hover.com.
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.860]   And you will too.
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:25.860]   I want you to go to
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.860]   hover.com and get 10% off
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:28.860]   your first purchase.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:29.860]   All you have to do is use
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.860]   the offer code twig in the
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.860]   number seven, twig seven,
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:32.860]   because it's in the seventh
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:33.860]   month.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:34.860]   We thank Hover so much for
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:35.860]   their support.
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:36.860]   Let me just see.
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:37.860]   Could you -- let's see.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:38.860]   That's management.
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.860]   See, by the way, the
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:40.860]   management console is so cool.
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.860]   I've got the who is
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:43.860]   privacy.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:44.860]   I do lock down and I have
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.860]   auto renewal turned out.
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:47.860]   Look at all that.
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:48.860]   I have all twit.careers I
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:49.860]   have.
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:50.860]   Twit agency, twit company,
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:51.860]   twit equipment, twit
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:52.860]   expert.
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:53.860]   I love that.
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:54.860]   Let me see.
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:55.860]   Let me just try.
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:56.860]   See.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:57.860]   Add a new domain.
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.860]   Unfortunately, little port.email
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.860]   has been taken.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:02.860]   Like recently?
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.860]   I'm not sure.
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.860]   I searched for it right after
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:06.860]   you asked and it was gone.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.860]   Sorry about that.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.860]   I can get loport.today.
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:26.860]   Loport.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.860]   You can get domains with
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.860]   attitudes so you can get --
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.860]   There's one for you, Jeff.
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.860]   Loport. gripe.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.860]   We can have Jarvis. gripe.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.860]   You got a problem with that?
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.860]   This is fun.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.860]   This is really great.
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.860]   I highly recommend you play
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:46.860]   with Hover.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.860]   Sign up.
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:48.860]   I moved all my domains
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:49.860]   there because it's just the
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.860]   way to do it.
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.860]   Hover.com.
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:53.860]   Give it a try.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.860]   Today, loport.bike.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.860]   Loport.camera.
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.860]   That's where my photos should be.
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:00.860]   It's kind of hard, though.
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:02.860]   I got to warn you when you go
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:03.860]   to Hover.
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:04.860]   You start playing with this.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:05.860]   You're going to end up
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:06.860]   registering a bunch.
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:07.860]   Loport.computer.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.860]   I like these.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.860]   These are good.
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.860]   Loport.cheap.
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.860]   I like Loport.dating.
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.860]   Yes, I like that.
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.860]   Here's domains with attitude.
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.860]   Loport.sexy is available.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.860]   Loport.ninja.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.860]   Loport.buzz.
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:25.860]   These are fun.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:26.860]   Loport.viyas.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.860]   Loport.moda.foutball.
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.860]   That would be good.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:31.860]   I can't stop.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:34.860]   Stop me now.
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.860]   Thank you so much, Hover.
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.860]   Oh, here's freeloport.com.
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:39.860]   There you go.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:40.860]   Free Loport.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.860]   So if I ever get arrested,
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.860]   let me just register that.
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.860]   I'm going to go to Hover.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.860]   I'm going to go to Hover.
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.860]   I'm going to go to Hover.
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.860]   I'm going to go to Hover.
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.860]   So if I ever get arrested,
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:56.860]   let me just register that.
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:58.860]   And that would be good if I become
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.860]   a political prisoner and be nice
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:01.860]   to have lying around.
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:02.860]   You might want to register that

[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:06.860]   Yeah.

[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.860]   This is so awesome.
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:16.860]   All right.
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:17.860]   I'm going to check out.

[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.860]   I love it.
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.860]   All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:24.860]   what was I going to say?
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:26.860]   Gmail has announced an API.
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.860]   This is one where we really wish
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.860]   Gina were here.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.860]   Because, you know, the Verge wrote a
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:34.860]   story.
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.860]   This is more than just like a little
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:37.860]   announcement.
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:38.860]   This is the new Gmail.
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.860]   Maybe, Danny, you can elucidate.
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.860]   Oh, gosh.
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:43.860]   I'm not even up on it.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.860]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:45.860]   Well, the idea would be--
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.860]   Yeah, I think it was easier.
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:48.860]   It's easier for third parties to
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:49.860]   interact with Gmail and--
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:50.860]   Yeah.
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:51.860]   Well, let me-- let me--
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:52.860]   I can fill this in a little bit
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:53.860]   because I've struggled with Gmail's
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:54.860]   iMap.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:55.860]   Gmail's iMap implementation is
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:56.860]   nonstandard.
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:57.860]   It's one of the things that's
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.860]   screwed up Apple Mail.
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:00.860]   Oh.
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:02.860]   Because, yeah, they do some things
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.860]   that are not supported in iMap.
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:06.860]   For instance, you can use iMap
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.860]   to get your Google Mail.
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:10.860]   But, you know, Google's labels
[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:13.860]   are not iMap folders or labels.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:14.860]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:15.860]   And you can have multiple labels
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:16.860]   on a single message, which iMap
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:17.860]   does not allow.
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.860]   That's why they're not folders.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:23.860]   So it's a potential problem.
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.860]   And iMap implementations with Gmail
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:27.860]   just-- you won't necessarily get
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.860]   a one-to-one match.
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.860]   So-- but iMap is an API.
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.860]   If you think about it, as is Pop3,
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.860]   these are agreed-upon protocols
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:37.860]   for contacting a server and
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:38.860]   interacting with it.
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:40.860]   You'd say, "Give me the mail."
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:41.860]   I got the last message I got was
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:42.860]   this.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:43.860]   "Give me everything new."
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:44.860]   The server reacts.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.860]   There's more to it than that.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.860]   But that's basically what a protocol
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.860]   does, what an API can do.
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:52.860]   But I think Google's responding to
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.860]   complaints about Google's iMap by saying,
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:54.860]   "Look, we're going to give you better
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:55.860]   than iMap.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:56.860]   We're going to give you a full API."
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.860]   So if you're an email client,
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:01.860]   you can do all the things that iMap does
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:02.860]   and then some.
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:03.860]   They say it doesn't replace iMap,
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.860]   and I think it's still use iMap.
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:06.860]   For one reason--
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:07.860]   Isn't it more than that, Leo,
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:09.860]   with an API now any application
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.860]   to work with your email account?
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.860]   Exactly.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.860]   And I can imagine email as being
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:16.860]   more integrated with other things.
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:17.860]   Exactly.
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:18.860]   Now, there are limits.
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.860]   It really isn't an iMap replacement
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:21.860]   because there are a limited number of
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:23.860]   calls that you can make each day
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:24.860]   to the API.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.860]   So it's much more what you're describing,
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:29.860]   Jeff, where I'm using a program--
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.860]   maybe I'm using Flipboard and I want to
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:32.860]   email something.
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.860]   Normally what Flipboard will do is launch
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.860]   an email client and do it that way.
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:38.860]   With an API, if you've got
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:39.860]   Google credentials in Flipboard,
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:41.860]   you could just have Flipboard send it.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.860]   Or you could create a new WOWE calendar
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.860]   application that's packed and schedule
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:47.860]   things with people and stuff.
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.860]   In fact, in the story that I read,
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.860]   Sunrise, which makes it fabulous,
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.860]   web-based, but also Android and iOS
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:55.860]   calendar that uses Google Calendar,
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.860]   said, "Yeah, we could use this.
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.860]   This would be good."
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:01.860]   So, yeah, I think this is--
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:03.860]   I'm not sure I would agree with the
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:04.860]   Verge.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.860]   This is in the next generation of Gmail.
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:07.860]   No.
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:08.860]   But we don't know.
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:09.860]   It depends.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:10.860]   If somebody invents something,
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.860]   it's amazing with it.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:13.860]   Right.
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.860]   They still don't have an API.
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.860]   They have a limited API for Google+.
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:19.860]   Yeah.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.860]   Alice Hamburger writing in the Verge says,
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.860]   "The Gmail API could turn our email
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:24.860]   accounts into gold mines."
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:25.860]   And that's a good thing.
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.860]   Remember, Google started this.
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.860]   Before Gmail, you deleted the mail as you
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.860]   went because you didn't have enough storage
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:33.860]   for it.
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:35.860]   And Google's whole pitch with Gmail was,
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.860]   "Don't save all your mail and now you
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:39.860]   have great search and that mail becomes
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.860]   a database of useful information."
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.860]   And this just takes it to the next level, I guess.
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:48.860]   [SOUND]
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.860]   Okay.
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:56.860]   Apple and IBM are partnering in enterprise.
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.860]   IBM has got to port many of its enterprises,
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:03.860]   quite a few enterprise apps, to the iOS platform.
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.860]   Some have said, in fact, we were talking about
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.860]   the Sun Windows Weekly, that this is perhaps
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:09.860]   targeting Microsoft, which has a very compelling
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:13.860]   mobile API for enterprise, mobile platform for enterprise.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.860]   But most agree, it's really aimed at Android,
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.860]   which doesn't.
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.860]   And it could become a big differentiator between
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:25.860]   iOS and Android in the enterprise space.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.860]   Part of what Paul said on Windows Weekly was,
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.860]   and this would surprise me, kind of,
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.860]   is, "Oh, IBM's not that much of the enterprise anymore."
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:33.860]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.860]   And you guys then went on to make fun of Lotus for a while.
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.860]   That's actually not true.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:39.860]   I think--
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:40.860]   Yeah, I wonder about that.
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.860]   His, obviously, IBM's entire business is enterprise.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.860]   Yes, but I wonder what he meant by that, that's what I'm saying,
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:49.860]   in terms of what's its cloud to deliver enterprises through this,
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.860]   as I think what he was saying.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:52.860]   Right.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.860]   Well, in particular, compared to Microsoft,
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.860]   which has a very compelling enterprise story
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:00.860]   across all platforms.
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:05.860]   Azure Cloud, desktop with Windows, and of course on the Windows phone,
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:07.860]   and they all integrate.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:12.860]   I think it goes after Microsoft a little bit as well.
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:16.860]   But it really puts the screws to Android.
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.860]   Because Android really-- I mean, it's-- and I mentioned this,
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.860]   it might really be against Samsung,
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.860]   because Samsung is starting to move to the enterprise
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:25.860]   with their Nox platform and so forth.
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:27.860]   Yes, which they didn't at I/O.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:28.860]   They mentioned--
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:29.860]   They will take on Nox.
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:30.860]   Well, no, no, they--
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.860]   They embraced--
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:32.860]   Yeah.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:33.860]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:34.860]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.860]   It took on as an hug.
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:37.860]   Yes.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:38.860]   Smart move.
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:46.860]   What would Android need to do to be competitive in enterprises?
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:50.860]   And what's the vulnerability with BlackBerry dying?
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:51.860]   Where's the opportunity here?
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:52.860]   Well, this--
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:55.860]   Hichon BlackBerry always was that it was a secure server
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:56.860]   that you could run in your enterprise.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:01.860]   So your email would be secure, safe, controlled.
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.860]   The BlackBerry, as a platform itself, was secure,
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.860]   so you don't have to worry about industrial espionage.
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:08.860]   And I think--
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.860]   For everybody except the Saudi Arabian and American governments--
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.860]   Well, then they gave the source code to India, that kind of.
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:17.860]   But I think you can't say that about at least the perception of Android is
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.860]   it's insecure, it's unreliable, it's a patch and mess of holes.
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.860]   It doesn't have a consistent story across the board.
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.860]   iOS has a much stronger, I think, story there.
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:32.860]   What this is in response to is the fact that business was owned by BlackBerry
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:36.860]   and Microsoft until 2007, and all of a sudden the iPhone came out
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.860]   and people started bringing their own device to work.
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:46.860]   And IT directors who had first rejected this were forced to embrace it.
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:48.860]   And that's really changed the landscape.
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:50.860]   All of a sudden you're seeing iPads in business.
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.860]   You see iPhones everywhere.
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:57.860]   It's put BlackBerry almost put BlackBerry out of business.
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:02.860]   I think it's one of those partnerships, the IBM Apple partnerships,
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.860]   one of those partnerships that you see every once in a while
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:09.860]   where two companies get together because the enemy of my enemy is my friend
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:13.860]   or something like that.
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.860]   Hidden from Google.com
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.860]   It's not quite what I want it to be.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.860]   It's a little too manual right now, but I do hope it can be automated
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:24.860]   to find you everything that had the right to be forgotten.
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:28.860]   It's now memorialized and Streisand did forever.
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.860]   It was just a matter of time before somebody did this.
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:35.860]   A list of search results emitted, erased, or censored due to the
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:37.860]   used right to be forgotten.
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:40.860]   Oh yeah, that completely bogus made up site.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:42.860]   It's not real?
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:43.860]   No.
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:44.860]   Oh, crap.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:45.860]   Yeah.
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:48.860]   Oh, in fact, if you look at the first comment,
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.860]   like one of the first comments should be mine asking the guys
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.860]   some questions on how you came up with the first comment.
[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:54.860]   So, how do you get this stuff?
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:57.860]   So, is there no, I think they get it from occasional stories or something.
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:48:59.860]   There's no mechanism.
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:00.860]   There's no mechanism.
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:01.860]   It's guest.
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:02.860]   No.
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.860]   So, for example, take the third one, Mario,
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:07.860]   Gonzales, I'm not pronouncing it right.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:12.860]   That is the guy who caused the whole story.
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:13.860]   He's the one who created this.
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:14.860]   The whole story.
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.860]   To my knowledge, he hasn't actually filed a right to be forgotten request.
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.860]   And actually, if you search for his name, you will still find the
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:22.860]   whole thing that kicked all this off.
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.860]   So, that's bull.
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:25.860]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:28.860]   So, some of these other things, they've taken some of the ones down
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:31.860]   that I called out and said that that wasn't correct.
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:32.860]   But you did all right.
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:36.860]   You don't necessarily know that these are correct.
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:39.860]   What they have on the right is a link to the source.
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:42.860]   And it seems like the sources are news articles about.
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:43.860]   Yeah, but the source is the news.
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:49.860]   So, what's happening is, Google sent notices to publishers saying,
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:57.860]   "We have taken an article out of search results for names we will not tell you
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:00.860]   or name or names we will not tell you."
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:05.860]   So, what people started doing when these first went out was going and thinking,
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:09.860]   "Right, well, this article is about this former Merrill Lynch banker.
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:13.860]   Therefore, the Merrill Lynch banker is trying to clean up all the search results."
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:17.860]   And, in fact, in that particular case that happened with the BBC,
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:20.860]   it wasn't around the bank or Google came back and finally said,
[00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:24.860]   "Actually, it was one of the 27 people who commented on the article who decided
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:27.860]   they didn't want that article showing up for their name."
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:32.860]   So, you know, these articles, you can make an elite, as some people are,
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:36.860]   and mistakenly in doing this, that whatever the article is about,
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:39.860]   that person, that person who must have made the request,
[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.860]   or potentially you could go through and pick out if there was only one name
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:43.860]   mentioned to make that.
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:47.860]   But the source is not the source that these were things that were being told.
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:50.860]   And, in fact, we don't even know why the source,
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:54.860]   like the hidden from Google hasn't even told you who submitted the links.
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:58.860]   You could go submit a link and say that Google told you this had to be removed.
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:01.860]   And for all I know, whoever this guy is that created this site,
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.860]   isn't doing anything to verify it.
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.860]   So, it's like a whole site.
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:06.860]   I'm disappointed.
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:07.860]   I am too. I was hoping.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:08.860]   It's really...
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:11.860]   But don't they...
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:14.860]   They do put on the page where there's a link erased.
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:17.860]   There is a reference on that page that says something has been...
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:19.860]   There's a lot of...
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:21.860]   No, no, not on the source pages.
[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:26.860]   No, no, but on the Google search results, it says you're not seeing the full results.
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:27.860]   That's right.
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:31.860]   And Google will show you that message for virtually any name you search for,
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:33.860]   regardless of whether or not something was pulled.
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:35.860]   That's the other confusing thing here.
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:36.860]   So, Google did two things.
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:37.860]   Why did they...
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:38.860]   They brought it that much, Danny.
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.860]   So, Google did two things in recent weeks.
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.860]   One, they started telling publishers whether or not a link was pulled,
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.860]   but they didn't tell it what it was pulled for.
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:52.860]   Two, they started putting increasingly, and eventually it will be for every name
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.860]   for someone who is not a celebrity.
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.860]   I'll explain that.
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:00.860]   A disclaimer at the bottom of the page says some results may have been removed.
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.860]   Or some results may not have been removed.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:07.860]   Because the problem is Google wants people in the EU to understand
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.860]   that this kind of censorship is happening.
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.860]   But they can't put it on just the places where it's happening,
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:15.860]   because in some cases where somebody has a common name,
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.860]   then that's effectively outing the particular person to say,
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.860]   and they made the request.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:25.860]   So, their policy is we will disclose on every common name that we can come up with,
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:27.860]   and we're rounding it out even more and more.
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:31.860]   But basically, if you do a search for a name and you get one of these notices,
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:33.860]   we want to notice to come up for any name you search on
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.860]   to tell you that the results may or may not have been censored.
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:40.860]   That is not an indication that any censorship actually happened.
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:45.860]   And then the reason you get the exception for the celebrities is because
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:49.860]   if they started putting that on just every celebrity name,
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.860]   then people would assume that celebrities are going out.
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:53.860]   It's like the reverse.
[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:56.860]   People would then would see this for celebrity names and assume the celebrity
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:58.860]   is trying to keep something out.
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:00.860]   So, they're not trying to make it show up for celebrity names
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:02.860]   so that people won't get the wrong impression in that regard.
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:05.860]   And these two things are being connected.
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:07.860]   So, this site is bull.
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:09.860]   It's like crap.
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:10.860]   No one should share it.
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:12.860]   No one should talk about it.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:16.860]   This kind of site may emerge with care.
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.860]   Could be done to help you understand that.
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:22.860]   But a lot more care should be happening than what's going on with this guy's site.
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:31.860]   What about the judge that says Microsoft has to delete or reveal email
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.860]   stored on servers anywhere in the world?
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:38.860]   The US judge, remember we talked about the Canadian judge that said
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:41.860]   Google had to delete stuff on its servers everywhere in the world?
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:45.860]   Well, now there's a US judge who said that Microsoft doesn't matter.
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:48.860]   He says it doesn't matter where the data is stored.
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:49.860]   It can be stored overseas.
[00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:52.860]   But if the UK is like that where judges have tried to say,
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:55.860]   if it's in your control, that's sufficient.
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:54:00.860]   So, all this is happening.
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:03.860]   This is part of the, this is part of the, this is part of the,
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:07.860]   I've got this article eventually I'll get to called the myth of Google censorship.
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:13.860]   There is this game that gets played with countries that want to censor search results
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:14.860]   and Google.
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:16.860]   And to some degree other search engines is the one you see,
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:19.860]   there's a Microsoft and the game is like this.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:23.860]   Well, we want to regulate the internet and at the same time we know there's no
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:26.860]   possible way we can regulate the internet when we don't control the whole thing.
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:31.860]   So, if we want search results censored, we're going to tell you to censor the search results.
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:36.860]   And Google will say, okay, French court, we have now removed the results from Google
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:37.860]   France.
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:38.860]   Censorship is done.
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:43.860]   And then the court goes, aha, you have removed it from Google France, nudge, nudge.
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:45.860]   All right, we get it.
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:46.860]   We've done the censorship.
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:49.860]   We're okay because no one in Google France would ever go to Google.com.
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:50.860]   Aha.
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:52.860]   And this is like what happened in China, right?
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:55.860]   There's a whole thing I think it's Steven Levy's book where he talked about it.
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:55:00.860]   When Google had to do the censorship in China, they censored the stuff for China.
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:02.860]   They didn't censor it for .com.
[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:05.860]   And no one really thought to look at the .com site.
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:06.860]   They don't think about it.
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:08.860]   So, okay, we have censorship.
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.860]   And this is where the server data is stored.
[00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:12.860]   It's the same sort of thing.
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:15.860]   Oh, you're a company doing business in our country.
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:17.860]   You know, you're a company doing business in our country, right?
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:19.860]   You have offices here.
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:20.860]   You sell advertising here.
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:22.860]   You reach out to our consumers.
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:27.860]   You are a business entity, let's say, operating in the UK, regardless of whether or not you
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:31.860]   want to route all your money through Ireland, regardless of whether or not you want to
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:34.860]   claim that all the server data is stored on the US.
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:38.860]   But since you want to say all that stuff, I guess we can't possibly get the data off
[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:39.860]   your server.
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:42.860]   And now you've got, you know, you're going to have countries saying, I don't care where
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:43.860]   the data is.
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.860]   You're a business doing business here.
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:46.860]   Right.
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:49.860]   We want that information to deal with our legal processes.
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:52.860]   And in some cases, there are legitimate reasons to say that.
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.860]   In some cases, not legitimate, right?
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:59.860]   But it's sort of this like calling vole on this whole, well, it's not located in the
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:00.860]   country.
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:07.620]   Therefore, I guess we can't touch it because data only lives in and only has jurisdiction
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:09.860]   on the part of the cloud.
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:14.860]   If you run a cloud, if you're Google that runs a worldwide cloud, the argument that
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:19.860]   well, you can't get to the data, you know, with your legal request because it's in the
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:20.860]   US doesn't hold up.
[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:26.860]   It holds up even less when you've got the US running around just getting the data itself,
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.860]   whether it's without legal processes.
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:35.340]   But you have governments including the Canadian and European and for a while Brazil trying
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:39.860]   to insist that their citizens data had to be held in their countries.
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.420]   Now, there was two reasons for that.
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:44.380]   One was supposed to protect it, but also the other one reason because it would make it
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:49.380]   more susceptible to subpoenas of those governments in those countries.
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:52.380]   I agree.
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:57.460]   I mean, you're absolutely right, Danny, but I kind of liked this phony dance because it
[00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:00.380]   kind of preserved the integrity overall.
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:05.460]   Now, if a country, any country says, well, we don't, you know, China says we don't want
[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:14.340]   any information to show up on Google about Falun Gong and then enforces it worldwide,
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:18.460]   there goes any information about Falun Gong, whether you're in China or not.
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:19.980]   And that bothers me.
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:20.980]   Doesn't that not worry you?
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.740]   I mean, I agree it was a fiction, but it was a useful fiction.
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.740]   Oh, no.
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:28.740]   I mean, there's all sorts of things that I get worried about on when you want to make
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:31.700]   data requests or you want to make censorship requests and everything.
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:40.180]   But I think we're about to go into this new era of the myth of, well, this is only happening
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:42.420]   on this server, this is only happening in this car.
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:43.420]   I think that's going to change.
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:47.700]   And it's going to make the same, but it's going to make, but we know that, but it becomes
[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:53.020]   much more complicated if you're a politician, you get called out on it because now you can't,
[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:57.660]   because now you have to decide, do I want to turn this into an international incident?
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:58.660]   Yeah.
[00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:02.540]   I want to, you know, so maybe the, okay, maybe then the right way to do this is be honest
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:03.860]   and say it's everywhere.
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:05.560]   Now what are we going to do?
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:08.700]   But the Chinese government can still rule, hey, we're going to block, you have to block
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:11.540]   all search results for Falun Gong worldwide.
[00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:13.180]   Then what?
[00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:18.340]   Well, that's the problem I had with with with Sarkozy and with right.
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:19.340]   Vivian Redding.
[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:20.340]   Right.
[00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:23.700]   Vivian Redding in Europe said, I want Europeans data held to European standards all around
[00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:24.700]   the world.
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:25.700]   I'm going to dictate this.
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:26.700]   I'm going to dictate law around the world.
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:30.380]   Well, then that's nothing that stops the government of China or Iran or so on saying
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:32.180]   we want the same freedom.
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:37.180]   And then if Germany says you cannot, you cannot sell that Nazi memorabilia on eBay, you
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:41.140]   only change that in eBay, Germany, but you sell Nazi memorabilia throughout the west of
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:42.140]   the world.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:46.860]   Now this is a maybe a, yeah, then what if you have to build out of Germany and so you
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:50.260]   end up with the lowest watermark of freedom and the highest watermark.
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:51.260]   Exactly.
[00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:52.260]   And that's my fear.
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:53.360]   That I hate that.
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:57.260]   So what's happened, Danny is we had a useful fiction, which everybody news was a fiction,
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:02.540]   but at least it protected, you know, it didn't bring into the lowest.
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:05.180]   You understand the rationale behind Sergei's.
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:06.780]   I mean, Larry's Island.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:12.840]   Right. So take one of those, those hover domains you had, you know, you know,
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:13.840]   dreamlaport.com.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:20.340]   His island doesn't protect him from doing business in other countries that are still
[00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:24.500]   going to find ways to regulate the advanced stuff that they want.
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:25.500]   I know.
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:26.500]   So how do we solve this?
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:28.020]   Is it maybe we need an international court?
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:29.020]   Maybe we need it.
[00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:30.020]   This all needs to go international.
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:32.620]   No, I don't know how any government involved in it.
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:34.340]   That's the problem.
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:35.340]   Governments are going to hold together.
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:39.540]   Institutions of old are going to hold together on this against this disruptive group force.
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:40.540]   Well, I bet.
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:44.020]   I mean, you ask how you're going to solve it and yet, but when you talked about Jeff
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:48.660]   about people in Brazil, one of the data stored there, whatever, it's like at the same time,
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:52.060]   the place that you thought was supposedly the safe place for all this stuff.
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:55.540]   You got people outside the US going, well, I don't want my stuff stored in the US because
[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:57.900]   apparently they just buy on it all.
[00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:58.900]   Yeah.
[00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:00.940]   So, you know, I need a dark net.
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:05.140]   We need an underground net run only by the technical elite, the hackers of the world.
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:07.260]   And just keep government out of it.
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.060]   What do you say?
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:10.060]   No.
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:11.060]   No.
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:12.060]   Okay.
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.060]   Well, you still need and you still need.
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.700]   I think that there's a place in the world for rule of law and I think that we should have
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:18.700]   reasonable laws.
[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:20.460]   There's a lot of place for the rule of law.
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.460]   Right.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:22.940]   And I think we should have reasonable laws and that.
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:25.700]   But should it be the lowest common denominator of freedom?
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:31.740]   No, but I think that if Google were serious about not wanting the censorship to happen
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:38.060]   in the EU, for example, they would say, okay, we disagree with this right to be forgotten
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:43.060]   and that it's implemented so badly that we won't do business there or we won't follow
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.060]   this law.
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:47.780]   Oh, come on, Danny, they're not going to, you know, and you ask, but you ask how they
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:50.860]   change your responsibility to their shareholders, full disclosure.
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:54.860]   I am one in a small tiny bit to run the company.
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:59.580]   Well, if you're not going to cut off all of Europe because you get pissed off where that
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:00.980]   is, you just can't do that.
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:01.980]   They did it to China.
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:02.980]   No, they didn't really.
[01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:03.980]   They didn't really.
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:04.980]   They didn't really.
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:05.980]   They did do it in China.
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:06.980]   They pulled off China.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:07.980]   They're not running.
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:12.580]   Yeah, but they weren't really, but they were prevented from doing meaningful business in
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:16.980]   lots of ways there be they still serve Chinese consumers through Hong Kong and through.com
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:17.980]   and it still works.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:19.500]   Yeah, but in the way that they want.
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:25.500]   And what Google could say is, look, we are going to, you know, I mean, it's, I agree
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.180]   with you, they're not going to do it.
[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:33.420]   But they're not going to do it because it is too expensive for them to do, not because
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.700]   it would be the right thing to do.
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:38.980]   So when they, they, did they not go back into China?
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:44.900]   Did they not find, you know, after the, they ran a, they, they don't do the censorship
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.100]   anymore.
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:51.660]   If you try to go to Google China with the Chinese extension, you, I think either get
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:52.660]   redirected or whatever.
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:54.140]   Google that CN goes to Google.
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.140]   Right.
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:56.940]   And then in Hong Kong, they just do whatever they want.
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:57.940]   Right.
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:01.380]   And I can't recall what the situation is with their business operations that are there.
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:03.300]   I think they can still have business operations.
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:09.380]   But by virtue of not a seeding to the censorship demands, they made it more difficult for them
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:13.220]   to try to grow the market share that they were already struggling with from the earlier
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.220]   hair.
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:17.980]   Sort of the Chinese may have made it virtually impossible for any foreign company to succeed
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:18.980]   there.
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:19.980]   So they weren't succeeding anyway.
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:20.980]   Right.
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:26.820]   So maybe the only hope is that countries like China, rulers of countries like China,
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:29.900]   maybe the, the, the detriment to this.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:34.700]   Oh, but there's no detriment to China because, because now the Chinese Twitter and the Chinese
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.380]   Google and the Chinese, this and the Chinese, they're all succeeding.
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.380]   Right.
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:39.380]   Yeah.
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:40.380]   Why bow?
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.380]   Yeah.
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:42.380]   And eBay and bubble gold.
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:43.380]   So I was, I was reading my favorite magazine.
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:47.820]   I love it because, well, for instance, the best dresses to wear this season, 40 wedges
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:50.420]   guaranteed to make your summer easier.
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:52.780]   16 of our favorite brunettes.
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:58.620]   And all of a sudden I'm reading an article who lo and behold, about a Google employee,
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.620]   Google's security princess.
[01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:04.980]   I was getting ready to be all upset that this was sexist and horrible.
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:05.980]   I was too.
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:09.300]   But wait a minute, before you get to the good part, because it is all right, but I do have
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:13.580]   to read this to breeze appears to wear black almost exclusively.
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:17.740]   It's slimming, she says, shrugging, not that she needs to worry about that.
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:22.620]   She has a simpatico face, always worn bear that could easily elude from one ethnicity
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:23.620]   to another.
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:29.100]   And a classic gap in its eight a sleek tomboy aesthetic, dark wash jeans, clean line, crew
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:33.300]   necks and chug tailors with the occasional bomber jacket thrown on top.
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.940]   And as was when I read that, I thought I was bored with this.
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.140]   I thought, oh crap.
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:43.980]   But it turns out to breeze who is in charge of security information security at Google
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:47.260]   and yes, indeed her car does say security princess.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:49.820]   This is actually a great article.
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:53.580]   And it's related to this is L magazine, which is a fashion magazine.
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:57.580]   And it's related to their L's women in tech series.
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:01.220]   There's an article why we need women who code.
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:05.580]   And despite that one paragraph, a lot of this is actually pretty good, isn't it, Jeff?
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.140]   Yeah, it is well written.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:11.940]   And the fact that she she has the irony to make that her own title is kind of delightful.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:17.780]   So it's a profile of her and it really talks about her as an intelligent person to talk
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:22.500]   about steg, I don't know why I'm seeing an estate lottery ad, but that's, oh, it was
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.500]   fine.
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:24.500]   I don't.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.980]   Oh, well, wait a minute.
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:30.140]   Maybe I do need a lot of lipstick.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:34.540]   They talk about stegenography and how she used stegenography.
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:38.380]   This is this is actually a article worthy of wired magazine.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:41.140]   They got a good, a good writer to write about it.
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:44.860]   And despite that one paragraph, that's from from the issues of misogyny going on with
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:47.540]   technology companies and we don't have to go to the catalog.
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:50.300]   There's been a lot of them recently.
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:52.100]   I think you've got to attack that from both ends.
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:55.260]   And one way is to a women's audience.
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:58.940]   I wish she didn't were here for this discussion today to make it more appealing to make it
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:05.020]   more something to aspire to.
[01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.980]   They talk about Google's struggle to get more women in Google.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:10.180]   They talk about to breezes.
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:13.380]   She says she doesn't perceive gender as a negative for her, although she's one of the
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:16.980]   few women and has always been in her field.
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:20.940]   She thinks she quote maybe a little more pushy than the female stereotype among the women
[01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:21.940]   she mentors.
[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:25.340]   Some continue to struggle to navigate Google's at time star winning environment.
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:29.420]   She says where you have to kind of demonstrate authority without explicitly having it.
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:32.940]   That's a very good description, by the way.
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:38.740]   I, you know, kudos to Elle who wrote this article and apparently is doing other articles
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:46.220]   along with 40 wedges guaranteed to make your summer easier about women in technology and
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:47.860]   why we need women who code.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:48.860]   And that's good.
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:49.860]   That's great.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:50.860]   And I think you're right.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:55.060]   I think this is where you, this is a very important part of the front is to push the
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:56.060]   pull.
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:57.060]   We got to push the guys.
[01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:59.660]   We got to pull the women into technology.
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:03.140]   Wow.
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:07.780]   And they've got beautiful pictures of Marissa Meyer and other women in technology.
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:08.780]   Grace Wu to pixel.
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:09.780]   I know.
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:10.780]   Oh, what's right?
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:13.740]   This is not sexist on me, but I got to see what's Marissa wearing.
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:14.900]   Let's see if I can find her.
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:18.300]   Actually, maybe maybe they they issued her because she's so well known.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:24.060]   SpaceX, the operations lead and CFO at Square code for America.
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.060]   There's Cara.
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:26.380]   There's Cara looking good.
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:27.380]   I just love her jacket.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.380]   She keeps.
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:29.860]   I think Elle provided that jacket.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:30.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:31.860]   I'm guessing.
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:33.660]   No, they do not have.
[01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:34.660]   They mentioned Cara.
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:35.660]   There's category.
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:36.660]   Yeah.
[01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:37.660]   I love it.
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.460]   It was totally awesome.
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:42.460]   Anyway, thank you, Elle.
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.260]   I was I was so prepared to go.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:45.260]   Oh, God.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:46.260]   Yeah, I was too.
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:47.260]   That's why I put it in.
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:51.180]   It was like, you know, a chart beat you share before you read.
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:56.220]   I stuck it in the in the rundown and then then looked on the like, it's an all.
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:57.220]   Yep.
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.260]   Actually, I did the same thing.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:00.260]   I bookmarked it.
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:01.260]   Yeah.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:03.820]   I want to make sure we get everything in.
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:04.820]   You guys want to talk about.
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.900]   There's any story that I have missed.
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:08.220]   There was so much stuff.
[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.500]   It's it's a jam packed a and we're almost out of time.
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.580]   So I don't want to I don't want to go crazy.
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:16.980]   Quartz talks about how busy Mark and Driesen has been on his Twitter.
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:21.020]   He joined Twitter in 2007, but for some reason, January 1st of this year, decided to start
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:24.420]   tweeting and tweets every 10 minutes.
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:26.460]   He's amazing.
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:34.140]   P Marka and and Fred Wilson has done some tweets about really admiring the I mean, but
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:37.180]   do we say that that and Driesen invented the tweet storm?
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:40.460]   No, he didn't invent it, but he has mastered it.
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:42.660]   He has mastered it and popularized it.
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:45.220]   He's basically writing entire articles.
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:46.780]   Reinvented it, I suppose.
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:48.860]   Yeah, I guess that's that's the way to put it.
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:49.860]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:53.900]   And but but then the key to him is that once he does that, then he goes into conversations.
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:58.180]   I mean, I actually have an and Driesen column on my tweet deck.
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:01.780]   I don't have an I don't have a column for any other individual user on earth, but to
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:03.580]   try to make sense of and Driesen.
[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:09.460]   I I I I dedicated one to him and and Twitter needs some better functionality because you
[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.420]   can't really judge the conversations.
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.500]   The threads don't hold together.
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:16.100]   It needs a lot more work on this, which which Fred Wilson kind of acknowledged in some tweets
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.100]   about this.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:20.100]   He's he's admiring at what Mark has done.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:21.100]   And and it's hard.
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.700]   I've done a, you know, if you were, I've gone to four or five and it doesn't hold together
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:24.700]   very well.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:31.660]   When I asked him about this, whether he kind of wrote about ahead of time and no, it's
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:33.500]   it's he just he gets a feeling.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:38.300]   And well, and if you look at where he's tweeting, it's like right after meals.
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:42.180]   So I think it's in the crapper, but just a thought.
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:51.860]   I wouldn't, you know, speculate FCC has given us a few more days to to comment on an open
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:52.860]   Internet.
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:09:00.900]   You can email open Internet at FCC.gov 700 80,000 comments so far was to close on Monday.
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:04.060]   This is of course on the FCC server out again.
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:05.060]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:06.580]   Keep up the good work, folks.
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.260]   I called into Howard Stern today to urge his viewers.
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:10.420]   He had John Oliver on it.
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:14.020]   They before John arrived, I called in to say everybody's got to do this.
[01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:16.420]   I filed my comment on Buzz machine.
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:20.260]   If you want to see it, we all should be filing to the FCC.
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:30.180]   And if you haven't seen John Oliver's screed against cable company, FRE, aka open Internet
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:35.580]   pro open Internet, aka cable, anti net net discrimination.
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:38.140]   Do watch that on his show.
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.900]   See the terminologies was really good.
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:40.900]   Double negatives.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:43.380]   All he's saying he shouldn't be calling it.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:44.820]   You shouldn't say I'm for net neutrality.
[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:46.540]   You should say I'm against cable company.
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:47.540]   Efri.
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:48.540]   Yes.
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:50.340]   And it's on his the week, the week.
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:51.340]   What is it called?
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:54.540]   The week ahead, the week behind the week last week, last week tonight.
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.340]   That was a great show.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:58.660]   And he you can see it on YouTube.
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:00.900]   It's a 15 minutes well spent.
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:07.020]   And then email open Internet at FCC.gov or visit the FCC zone site where you can.
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:11.660]   Or else we're going to have people like Comcast in charge of our lives and Veronica Belmont
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:12.660]   and Ryan Blox.
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:14.020]   We know what that looks like.
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:18.420]   You know, I saw this when they posted it on Google plus and immediately said, you know,
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.100]   I'd love to play this on the radio show Little Night.
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:25.260]   I know that every media outlet in the world would pick this up within minutes.
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.260]   It's on the today show.
[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:27.260]   It's on the nightly news.
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.260]   It's everywhere.
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:31.260]   If you play a little bit of it, you've certainly heard it by now.
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.860]   Veronica and Ryan are moving.
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:35.900]   And of course, good friends of the Twit.
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:37.140]   And they're moving.
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:40.460]   He was the founder of the founder, well, not the founder, but the former editor, chief
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:43.820]   and gaggit, founder of.
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:47.860]   I forgot geek, right?
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:48.860]   Digit.
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:49.860]   What is it called?
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:50.860]   Digit.
[01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:51.860]   It's magic.
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:52.860]   It's magic.
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:53.860]   Digit.
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:54.860]   Gadget.
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:55.860]   Brilliant guy.
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:56.860]   Great guy.
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:57.860]   Regular on Twit.
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:04.220]   And they were moving and they wanted to cancel their Comcast service and take up a new service
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:07.460]   called a Stound, another provider.
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.940]   Brian is in the other room while Veronica is trying to do this.
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:13.620]   And after about 10 minutes of hearing her get more and more frustrated, he gets on the
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:19.700]   lines and records the conversation with one of the most.
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:21.420]   Return the cable car for us.
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:29.540]   That's a retention specialist I've ever heard a Comcast representative, a podcast, apologized
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:31.340]   via Twitter almost immediately.
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.540]   It sounds like you don't want to go over this information with me.
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.540]   I mean, did you all want to go over that information?
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:39.180]   Okay, that's the easiest way to get your account disconnected.
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:45.100]   I am declining to state why we are leaving Comcast because I don't owe you an explanation.
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:48.380]   So if you can please just proceed to the next question.
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:50.820]   If you have to fill out your form, that's fine.
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:12:02.020]   Please proceed to the next question and we'll attempt to answer that if possible.
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:03.860]   The guy will not take no for instance.
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:09.820]   You know what's beautiful about this is that Ryan uses a customer service tone of voice
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:10.820]   back on the customer service.
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:12.820]   He does not lose his temper, which I would have.
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:13.820]   I would have.
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:15.820]   You were the F word like you wouldn't imagine.
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:22.700]   I would have been going to Zirko Notto and my kids can tell you what that sounds like.
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:27.060]   But no, Ryan stayed extremely calm and just said, are you done?
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:28.060]   Are you done now?
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.820]   Can you go to the next page because I want to cancel?
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:33.140]   They finally the guy says, well, I've already done it.
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.820]   And then Ryan says, can I have a confirmation number?
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:36.820]   He says, no.
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:40.460]   Well, we first of all, Comcast admits it's an employee.
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:41.620]   It's not some third party.
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:42.740]   This was an employee.
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:45.940]   But also Comcast does admit is this is the culture they've created.
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:46.940]   Right.
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:49.780]   They try to blame the employee or embarrass what this employee.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:50.940]   I'm sorry, no.
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:55.780]   This guy is doing this because he's afraid he's going to get shot when the prisoner escapes.
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:57.260]   I think that we agreed.
[01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:59.940]   We talked about this yesterday or the day before.
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:06.180]   I think we agreed that the likely case is that this representative, it will cost him
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:10.100]   money either cost him a bonus.
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:13.100]   There are every person who cancels on that phone call.
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.060]   So the guy's fighting for his life.
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:16.900]   This is not about Comcast.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:18.940]   This is about money.
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:23.780]   And so whether Comcast is embarrassed whether the guy is poorly trained is not the issue.
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:30.020]   You create this culture by rewarding people for not letting people cancel.
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:34.260]   And one hopes that Comcast will get a better idea thanks to this.
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:35.580]   Somehow I doubt it.
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:37.060]   Anybody's ever spent any time on it.
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:40.040]   The worst thing that happens, and this has happened to me because I've had similar
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:45.860]   conversations, is that you get tagged by the office of the executive at Comcast.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:50.500]   I think it was because I'm a internet broadcaster, radio broadcaster.
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:54.940]   But for some reason, I kept getting calls from them and they're even worse.
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:57.020]   They're supposed to be nice.
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:01.620]   They're supposed to, you know, oh no, but Brian really cares and wants to make sure you're
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:04.260]   happy, but it ends up being worse.
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:07.820]   I end up yelling at her too.
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.820]   So if you're...
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:17.120]   What surprised me though was I had in the past two months, I had two things that I had
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.120]   called AT&T.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.120]   You're dealing with your cell phone.
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:23.400]   You don't normally think this is going to be great, but I had called them because I was
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.880]   trying to check on the new plans.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:30.480]   They'd come out with this new plan for the family plan or whatever.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:35.560]   And it didn't like reducing my bill like $60.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:40.580]   And they put me on it and I was like, yeah, we'll move you over to this is much better.
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:41.680]   You should be on this sort of plan.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:45.320]   And then I went and I got a new phone and they're like, yeah, we're going to give you
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.320]   this new phone.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.320]   I bought the new phone.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.080]   I'm like, oh, I want to pay full price.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.720]   I don't want to be on the contract or whatever.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:54.920]   And then I go, okay, and by the way, we're going to take $100 off because you've been
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:57.080]   a regular customer for so long.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.560]   And I was like, what?
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.160]   I don't understand what's going on here.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:04.240]   And then the other day, a time Warner, this was like last week I get an email from Time
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.640]   Warner because there are cable company here and we don't use cable with my GZN for the
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:09.640]   internet.
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.440]   They're like, we've sped up your internet speed and you just need to order this new
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.800]   thing box and we'll send it to you.
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.200]   So I'm like, oh, okay.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:21.320]   So I get the new box and I plug it in and having some trouble with it.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.840]   And of course I plug it in at like 1 a.m.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:29.440]   And I call and somebody answered the phone right away and they like talked me through
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:34.080]   and I get it all going and I went from like 10 megapixel, whatever to like, you know,
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.320]   to 30.
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.080]   I mean, I have speed like I can't believe.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.560]   And then I was having problems with the router and they sorted all that out.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.880]   And I was like, I'm sorry.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:43.480]   I thought you were like my cable company.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:44.880]   I was supposed to hate you.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:51.960]   I mean, I really, I was like, I was like, you know, so I've been in that kind of situation
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:52.960]   that Ryan's been.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:56.560]   I've gone through that with like Verizon when they kept changing my hotspot and they started
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.720]   charging me for a hotspot.
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:58.720]   They didn't.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:02.920]   I went to the iPhone and suddenly the hotspot that I never got charged for, they started
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:06.560]   charging me $30 a month or even though I paid full price for the iPhone.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:10.480]   And I can't tell you the number of conversations I've had with Verizon where they just go round
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.720]   and round like, well, we don't offer that plan.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:16.200]   And I like, I know you don't offer that plan, but that's what I was paying.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.520]   And that's the reason I paid for the new phone and you're supposed to give me the same thing
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.520]   I had before.
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.680]   So why is it somebody just enabled to do this?
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:25.360]   I got the Nexus 7 connected with those bozos.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:27.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:34.080]   And so, you know, like Jeff's so angry, but in contrast, it is driven me so much in insanity
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:38.480]   with Verizon that I'm seriously thinking about just leaving them entirely.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.240]   I mean, I have three different phone providers because, you know, you go out you because
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.240]   you do it professionally.
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.960]   You want to have every debt work and you can cover this stuff.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:50.560]   And then they're like, and so I look at the Comcast thing and I think, yeah, you know,
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:54.480]   you're maybe going to lose some people because you didn't manage to retain them, but the
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:58.920]   better way to retain us would just be better customer service, even if we want to leave.
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:03.320]   Well, that must be apparent to Comcast at this point because this is this is a huge black
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.320]   market.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.680]   You know, you think it would be apparent to them, but what happened with the whole Comcast
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:10.520]   guy and all that stuff and all these things.
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:15.560]   Oh, you know, how how could you still be having this sort of thing happen now?
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:20.760]   It's a another way because I mean, they also realize that in many cases you don't have
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:21.760]   a choice.
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:22.760]   So I don't have a choice.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:27.720]   I don't have cable TV from Comcast, but what but it does cost you another ways Comcast.
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:31.000]   For instance, I really want Turner classic movies on my Comcast.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.480]   I've gone online and tried to do it.
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:33.560]   You can't.
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:38.440]   And I am not going to call a Comcast representative because I loathe every time I've talked to
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.880]   Comcast, my blood pressure has gone through the roof.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:44.720]   So you've in effect, I want to spend more money with you and I won't because I don't
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.520]   want to talk to you.
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:49.520]   That's not the kind of reputation you want in the world.
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:54.520]   It could affect what it could really affect is Congress can latch on to this now and say
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:58.160]   we're going to let these people merge and become an even bigger cable company.
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:00.000]   This is how they treat customers.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   Exactly.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.560]   That's the real impact here.
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:07.760]   Veronica Belmont and Ryan Block have single handedly blocked the time Warner Comcast merger
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760]   right on.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.760]   We should hope.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:10.760]   We should hope.
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.200]   The other thing is I didn't read the story yet.
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:16.960]   So I'm doing the, you know, the horrible thing of sharing before I read.
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.800]   But I saw a link go by right before we got on the show that part of the reason that Ryan
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:24.960]   wanted to, the two of them wanted to shift was because of Comcast net neutrality stance.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:25.960]   There you go.
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:26.960]   I think I put a link up.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.400]   He says, I, you know, we told him our reasons.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:33.180]   You may think we're being in transit, but we actually told him several times our reasons.
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:36.120]   That was not the reason the representative continued to harass us.
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:39.280]   He just simply did not want to cancel.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:40.280]   Very simply.
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:42.640]   I, I, it wasn't great.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:46.160]   I didn't put up on the, but some, a young girl has already made a song out of it.
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:47.160]   I'm sure there's many.
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:48.160]   Well, it's got to go.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.280]   I hope it goes forever.
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:53.040]   I just live on forever.
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:57.480]   I only wish we'd had the first 10 minutes of Veronica going back to Veronica.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.480]   Well, she's sweet.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.480]   She would not.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:04.360]   But, but, but well, obviously she went, she got so frustrated that he had to take over.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.480]   But it was, it was, his strategy is just brilliant.
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:12.440]   He just says, you know, he keeps the school and just, and I'm glad he recorded it.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.440]   And I'm glad he posted.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:17.120]   By the way, he posted on Sam Cladd and it's really fun to look at all the comments as you
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.120]   go along.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:21.640]   All the people who posted, you know, because he put a little, but he was, he was also great.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:25.720]   He took out the name of the rep and he also went, when Comcast did apologize, he's very
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:28.560]   clear back to them saying, don't fire fire the rep.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.560]   This is a Comcast problem.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.320]   It's not a rep's problem.
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:34.640]   Although that rep probably could do better in another field.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.360]   But you know, but I think, I think you're rightly always said when you, you know, earlier
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.360]   this week is that, is that, is that it could be that this is how they're going to lose
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.120]   money that he gets held to a calendar.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.840]   He could get fired if he loses too many people.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:47.480]   God knows what, what fear they have them under.
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:48.480]   Exactly.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.040]   I don't, I don't necessarily blame him.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.040]   This is like Sheriff.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.040]   What's his name?
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:54.040]   Sheriff of Pio, our Pio.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:58.720]   The, the, the, the guy in Phoenix who puts prisoner, male prisoners in pink underwear.
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.000]   Um, you know, that's how legal is that legal?
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   Hey, I don't know.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   Is that his name?
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   I don't know.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   I don't know.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   Um, but, but cable companies treat us like prisoners.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   They put us in pink underwear.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   Yes.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.240]   Comcast has to stop putting a stamp in gunner wear.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:19.480]   All right.
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.480]   We are going to get your picks the week.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.480]   Yes.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:26.320]   I want a quick, RoarShock test year because while we've been on the show, this has been
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.320]   going all around Twitter.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:28.320]   The Airbnb logo.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.320]   I knew you were going there.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:31.920]   No, I don't, I already read that thing.
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:32.920]   It's stupid.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.160]   We had to even have to have an article about it.
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:35.160]   Jesus.
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.160]   Oh, it's, but it's going all over.
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:38.640]   Now there's tons of it everywhere, Daddy.
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:42.960]   Um, interpretations are, ah, let's go to Airbnb.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.880]   By the way, I did an Airbnb last month.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.600]   I'll never do it again.
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.680]   The, the reason it's not, I don't like it.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:51.680]   I guess I will.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.680]   It's creepy.
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:57.560]   I canceled my, the person came over twice and wanted to check us out.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:01.360]   There was a lot of misrepresentation about who actually owned the place.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:04.560]   I got an email immediately from a guy who owned it, but turns out that was the management
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.800]   company that managed it called Air Envy.
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:11.680]   And then after we stay there and it, by the way, is no cheaper than a hotel and it didn't
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:13.640]   have any curtains on the windows.
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:18.440]   I get an email from the woman who does own it saying, Hey, hey, did you see my Buddha
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.440]   toothbrush holder?
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:20.600]   Cause it's gone.
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:25.480]   She's accusing us of stealing her ugly ass Buddha toothbrush holder.
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.480]   She sent us pictures.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:27.480]   I said, I never saw that.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:28.560]   That wasn't there when we checked.
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:36.240]   And I'm never doing it again, but it may be the new logo, which looks a little bit like
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.200]   an IUD.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.480]   What is that?
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:44.400]   People are, people are putting many sexual interpretations of this.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.400]   Wow.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.400]   That's a Lippie's loop.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:48.240]   I don't know what that is.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.240]   It's an A.
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:51.480]   There is a bit of an odd phallic view.
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:52.480]   There's a vaginal view.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.720]   Well, if you, and if you go, Chad, show my screen.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:59.920]   Cause if you go to the Airbnb website, it rotates, it rotates around a little bit and
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.880]   it kind of, it's lively.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:09.120]   It's a lively and it does seem a little bit, it's a little pointy.
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.120]   Hmm.
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:16.040]   They have made, they have made videos about it explaining it.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.360]   Anyway, I know Airbnb is not for me.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:22.560]   I'm sure it's great for people who like, I don't like regular B and B's.
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:23.560]   Oh God, no.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.320]   It's too intrusive.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.320]   I want anonymity.
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:33.640]   I want somebody who's in the business of, uh, hoteling, not like it's a hobby.
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:34.640]   Where's the mini bar?
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:35.640]   Excuse me.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:36.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.760]   No, mini bar in an Airbnb or maybe there is.
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:41.120]   There was, there was a stove.
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.200]   There was a refrigerator, but there was no microwave.
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.080]   I don't know why.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:47.880]   Uh, all right.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.040]   Enough of that.
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:53.160]   Do you have a, Danny, I don't know if they warned you, but we like to get pics, tips,
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:55.520]   tricks, anything you'd like to share with us?
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:02.200]   I, I got an earlier, I could hear that coming up and so I scrambled, but yes, I do.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:08.240]   If you, if you were to type something into Google like schedule an appointment, uh, you
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:12.880]   will find that now within the search results, you can create an appointment for your Google
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:13.880]   calendar.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.600]   Oh, that's the way to do it.
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:16.600]   That's so genius.
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:20.040]   Japan, which means if I have Google voice turned on.
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:23.440]   Oh, yeah, you might be able to do that as well.
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:27.200]   Schedule an appointment at five o'clock for a dentist.
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:30.760]   Schedule an appointment for four p.m.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:33.320]   With Leo Leport with Leo Leport and Twitter.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.720]   I wonder if I could do that.
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.760]   Now Google's thinking schedule an appointment for four p.m.
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:38.760]   With Leo Leport.
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:43.480]   It's a pity you can't see my screen.
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.480]   It's awesome on my screen.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:45.960]   My screen's doing crap.
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:47.280]   I think I broke Google.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:51.120]   After last week's show, tons of people complained that every time Gina said, okay, let's do
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.120]   it right now.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:54.120]   Okay, Google.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:56.160]   Everybody's things were waking up.
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:59.880]   It's like the, I can't believe that story you're talking about earlier on the Xbox and
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:01.920]   um, uh, what was his name?
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:02.920]   Yeah.
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.120]   Aaron Paul of Breaking Bad.
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:09.400]   Apparently he's got, there's a great Xbox ad he has and he talks to his Xbox.
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:12.480]   Apparently it's getting its people's Xboxes are responding.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.480]   What a world.
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:14.480]   What a world.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.280]   It's one thing I liked about the Moto X.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.280]   It was trained to your voice.
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.280]   Hold on.
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:20.280]   Let's do a little test here.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:23.680]   Okay, Google search for Leo Leport.
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:29.600]   And perks out the Snapdragon processor and that's where Android Wear's bonuses come to
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:30.600]   the forefront.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.600]   Now what are we watching?
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.600]   The screen is on.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:35.080]   All you need to do to initiate questions on the watch is speak to it.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:42.520]   Saying, okay, Google.
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:43.520]   What happened?
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:49.600]   It was a video and in the video he said, okay, Google and then the, that was the screen.
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:52.400]   It was exactly what you're talking about.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.400]   This is the phone.
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:58.280]   Okay, Google, okay, Google jumps in after it pauses the video.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:02.800]   You can watch it pauses the video that's playing so funny and then opens up.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:03.800]   Okay.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:06.160]   And see, there it goes.
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:09.760]   See my watch now does that as well, right?
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.360]   I've had that happen because I do a lot of press interviews.
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:16.440]   And so I've been, there's been times where I'd be like, a press interview is where they're
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:17.840]   asking me questions about Google.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.160]   And so I've had my browser open.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:23.080]   I've had my phone sitting there and I'll be like saying, well, you know, okay, Google.
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:27.160]   And then it just launched up again.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:30.000]   Well, I don't mind.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000]   It's worth it.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.880]   But thank you for the little trick, Danny.
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:33.880]   Let's go.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.880]   I could schedule your appointments through Google.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:35.880]   Jeff, you got a number?
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:36.880]   Yeah, I guess.
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.880]   I don't know how much of it you're allowed to play, but I, we, how can I not go with
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:43.160]   Letterman's top 10 questions about the Google robotic mule?
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:44.840]   There is a Google robotic mule?
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:48.920]   A, there's a Google robotic mule and B, Letterman has 10 questions about it.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.920]   All right, let's hear.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.920]   Mule number 10.
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:55.840]   Well, take away jobs from actual mules.
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:56.840]   Number nine.
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:00.560]   Can I keep him paw number eight?
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.880]   Well, get along with my mechanical yak number seven.
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:07.680]   Does it have that authentic mule smell?
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:08.680]   Number six.
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:09.680]   He's just right himself.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.680]   Like my release number five.
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.160]   Well, I need a new charger number four.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.920]   How soon before it tries to kill me?
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:16.920]   Number three.
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:23.760]   Does it kick better than Brazil's soccer team?
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:27.080]   Frequently asked questions about the robotic mule.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:30.240]   Can it do this?
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:34.280]   Get him off, get him off of there.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:38.200]   And the number one frequently asked questions about the robotic mule.
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:39.200]   Robotic mule.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.480]   You mean John Kerry?
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.000]   You can tell Letterman's retired, can't you?
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.080]   He's basically phoning it in at this point.
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.080]   He doesn't want to read it.
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.080]   Yeah, I know.
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.880]   I've got number eight.
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:54.520]   My pick actually is this watch.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:55.520]   I like it.
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:58.720]   Did you guys get into where he had?
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.080]   You mean from--
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.080]   No, I bought it.
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.080]   You know what?
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:03.880]   It doesn't have as much Google now as I want.
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.320]   Well, I want more, but I've always
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.680]   wanted more Google now, right?
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:10.360]   I know, but it's like I'm getting all these other notifications
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:13.000]   and I want more Google now stuff.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:13.920]   It's got my calendar.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.520]   My Amazon package has been delivered.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:18.320]   I've taken 2,429 steps.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.160]   It's 75 degrees in Petaluma.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.160]   It'll be 81 degrees at the high.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:26.000]   I went with the Samsung one too, which disappointed me
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.760]   because it's got that stupid clasp.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.520]   And so I'm like a Disneyland and it flies--
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:31.280]   Oh, I hate that clasp.
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.880]   --it's going to go all over the place.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:33.240]   Well, go on.
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:34.520]   I'm glad I did the right thing then.
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:36.080]   We bought the LG.
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.040]   Well, the LG looked nice, but then it's kind of--
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.080]   I like the strap better, but it was kind of bland.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:40.560]   All of them.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:41.840]   You're all waiting for the Moto 360.
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:42.320]   All of them.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.760]   And I think Chad had a really good insight, which
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:47.520]   is the technology is basically identical in all of them.
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:49.440]   I mean, yeah, the Samsung has a heartbeat monitor.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:52.040]   But because Google wanted to incent companies
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:55.080]   to add design flair as a differentiator,
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:56.440]   I think that's right on.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.120]   So expect some interesting designs.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.600]   These are just the first.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.600]   I don't know.
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:02.600]   I was not a fan.
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.680]   I've abandoned every watch and device I've had,
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.840]   including the Pebble, which Chad has.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:09.400]   This is a Pebble, but it's a little bit nicer.
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:12.760]   The mean to ask is Chad considering giving up the Pebble?
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:16.680]   I would if I had $200 to drop on it.
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:19.680]   Yeah, I'm still rocking the Pebble and I still love it.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:20.920]   Better battery life on the Pebble.
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:22.240]   These two you have to charge every night.
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:22.760]   Right.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:25.480]   Yeah, this one will last about four days.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:27.840]   The Pebble will.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:31.640]   And the only other thing is that I just cannot wait until I
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:35.880]   get an notification on my wrist and I can just easily say
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.800]   reply and--
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:37.800]   Well, you can do that.
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:39.360]   And I can't do that with the Pebble yet.
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.640]   So that's the thing that I desire.
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:41.120]   I desire--
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.760]   You have to tie it to Hangouts if you want to reply.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:47.360]   Because I've used the SMS app on the HTC One
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:48.680]   and the Verizon SMS app.
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.360]   And in both cases, it refers you to the phone
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:51.240]   if you want to reply.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.600]   But if you use Google Hangouts, which is not my favorite SMS
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:57.520]   application, it will show you the entire context, the entire
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:59.280]   thread, and let you reply, which is--
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.320]   And then I'm still trying to figure out what it's doing
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:03.880]   because, of course, I use Google Voice.
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:04.840]   So then I did that.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.120]   So it texted, but it sent out through Google Hangouts.
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:09.200]   And it went to the right place when I was sending to my wife.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.400]   But then it came up with my not Google Voice number.
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.540]   Because, of course, Google Hangouts can understand Google
[01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:15.720]   Voice and, oh, my God.
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:16.440]   Yeah, there's--
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:20.520]   You know, I have a Galaxy gear and I find myself kind of
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:23.240]   missing having a camera, which I thought was stupid.
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:24.240]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.320]   Yeah, I took a lot of pictures with the gear, too.
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.840]   And they're not bad.
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.880]   I was kind of like, you know, I thought, yeah, you don't need
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:30.840]   a camera on the watch.
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:31.840]   Who cares if it's so stupid.
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.800]   And then there's times I'm kind of like, yeah, it would have
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:37.480]   been nice to just discreetly take my spy photo.
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:40.680]   Can't just be patient because you know when the Moto 360 comes
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:42.360]   out, you're going to be getting this one.
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:43.000]   I'll get that one.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:43.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:47.640]   And that's the other thing is there's too many--
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:49.360]   I assume in September, we're just
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:50.680]   going to see all sorts of stuff.
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:51.800]   And we're going to see an Apple watch.
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:53.400]   We're going to probably see an Apple watch.
[01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.640]   There's a way to find the whole thing.
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.160]   And maybe not like in my bubble.
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:58.440]   No.
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:01.840]   No, you don't think-- you're being sarcastic to any Sullivan.
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.080]   I am.
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:03.400]   I don't know.
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:05.160]   I can't remember who did the post.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.280]   There's been a couple of these where people are kind of like,
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:08.880]   going, yeah, watch who kind of cares.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:10.000]   And I'm like--
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.200]   I was really excited to get the Android Wear watch.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.200]   I've been waiting for it.
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:15.600]   And like I said, I thought, especially because I have
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.680]   Google Now on my wrist, this is going to be awesome.
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.960]   And I'm not getting Google Now on my wrist as much as I wanted.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:23.360]   And if the iPhone watch comes along,
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:25.360]   they don't even have Google Now, right?
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:28.080]   So maybe they'll come up with something that blows me out
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:28.520]   of the water.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.600]   But if it's just I can get more notifications, yeah,
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:32.000]   that's nice.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.920]   I sign up speaking of the grants that you watch
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:35.080]   and not have to pick up your phone.
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:36.480]   It's a little less in point.
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:38.040]   But--
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.560]   I'm actually liking it a bit.
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.800]   But I'm also learning a lot.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.000]   I'm learning the journalistic lessons.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.160]   The New York Times application is just ridiculous.
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:49.000]   Because every morning it tells me, we have 20 new stories.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.560]   We'll know--
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:51.240]   S-H-I.
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.200]   We'd guess that.
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:52.760]   Yes.
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:54.360]   Yeah, of course you do.
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:57.040]   Tell me when you don't.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.200]   Circa does a very good job with alerts.
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.760]   The Guardian does a good job with alerts.
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.480]   They have to be sparing.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:04.440]   Alerts also have to get to your Google Now point.
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.520]   A lot more personal, a lot more relevant to me.
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:07.920]   And they're not at all yet.
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:09.440]   But that's all going to come because--
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.040]   That'll come.
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.280]   We're basically using software that
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:13.240]   didn't even envision the watch.
[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:14.040]   It's kind of--
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:14.560]   Yes.
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.640]   It's like push bullet.
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:18.960]   It's just you're getting the standard stock notifications.
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:23.960]   Presumably they will get better at that.
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:25.040]   Hey, we're at a time.
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.040]   I want to thank you so much, Danny, for filling in for Gina.
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.360]   It's always great to have you on.
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:28.680]   Search Engine--
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:29.640]   What a really good item.
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:30.400]   Yeah, he's just the greatest.
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:31.600]   Good to be here.
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.720]   Marketingengineland.com.
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:34.840]   Anything else you want to plug?
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:37.040]   When are you doing a podcast?
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:37.920]   A podcast.
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:39.160]   I used to do a podcast.
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.320]   Not any time for it anymore.
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:40.840]   Who is time?
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:41.880]   And I do all the stuff.
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:42.960]   I got it right.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:45.280]   All I'll say is that at Marketing Land,
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:47.640]   we want to start a new holiday retailer section
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:49.360]   because it is July.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.160]   And you should be thinking about holiday marketing
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.000]   if you're a marketer.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.400]   It's time.
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.000]   On the one hand, I hate when people
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.360]   start pushing the marketing messages to consumers.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:00.440]   But if you actually are involved in marketing--
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:01.240]   It's your business.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:01.720]   That's right.
[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:02.880]   You need to be planning that stuff now.
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:05.400]   So that's part of a new section we launched.
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:06.480]   Great to have you, Danny.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.360]   Always a pleasure.
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:12.840]   And he's, of course, at Danny Sullivan on the Twitter.
[01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:14.440]   Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.720]   at the City University of New York, CUNY.
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:18.680]   He's also the author of many books, including Public Parts,
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:20.280]   his latest, and Google--
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:22.400]   I mean, Guggenheim the geek.
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:26.960]   I'll get it right one of these days.
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:27.520]   That's a good one.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:29.440]   The other guy.
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:31.760]   I want to say Heisenberg the geek.
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.640]   Wait a minute, don't tell me now.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:35.600]   It's the guy invented the printing press.
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:36.640]   Jeez.
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.400]   You think you're old at 60.
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:40.600]   If my mind's like this now, I'm in deep trouble.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.800]   Three years from now, I'm not even--
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.240]   Gutenberg.
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:45.640]   There you go.
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:47.400]   The chat room told you didn't.
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.200]   No, they didn't.
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:52.600]   I just made it up.
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.640]   And he also blogs at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:58.120]   That's where you can read his comment to the FCC.
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:59.120]   Hey, hey.
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:00.000]   Quick armies.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.160]   Quit army.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:01.680]   Get on it.
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:02.880]   With the Jurassic and Leo.
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:07.760]   Open internet at FCC.gov, or you can go to FCC.gov/comments.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:09.280]   Please, you have to Friday.
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:10.400]   It doesn't have to be an essay.
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.320]   Just do what you have to apply to the extent of it.
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.320]   Do it, do it, do it.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.320]   What would you recommend?
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:18.240]   If they're going to write one line, what would you recommend?
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:21.840]   I believe in a free and open internet, please.
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:24.840]   What?
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:28.920]   Declare ISPs, common carriers, and give us freedom.
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:32.080]   Basically, what I said in mind was it was the Al Franken rule.
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:33.240]   We don't want to change the internet.
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:35.120]   We want to keep the internet from being changed.
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:35.960]   There you go.
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:37.480]   Like it.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:38.800]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:41.280]   We do twig one PM Pacific, four PM Eastern time
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:44.920]   2,000 UTC every Wednesday, right after Windows Weekly.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:46.640]   I'd love it if you'd stop by and watch live.
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:47.640]   We appreciate that.
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.480]   We have people in the live studio audience as well.
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:52.040]   You can email tickets at twit.tv if you want to be here
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:54.320]   for this show on any of our shows.
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:57.280]   You can also get on-demand audio and video after the fact.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:00.080]   Anytime, twit.tv/twig, wherever
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:04.080]   final podcasts are aggregated, iTunes, Xbox, Stitcher,
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:05.200]   all of those places.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:06.120]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:07.760]   We'll see you next time on this weekend.
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:10.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:13.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:16.140]   (upbeat music)
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:18.140]   (acoustic guitar chords)
