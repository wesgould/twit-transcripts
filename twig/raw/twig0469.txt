[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.740]   Guy who sits down next to me who works in a pharmacy when he sees what's going on
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.060]   He happens to have some bassett racin with me and gives it to me
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.660]   I go on meeting at Facebook and they raid the the first aid kit for me only cows

[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.460]   Actually, I've always found that to be true people are people no matter where they are
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:03.300]   I want to have a man come in Brooklyn also in Brooklyn come up grab me and lick the back of my neck
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.340]   Well, there's always the exception the proof in my hand
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.140]   I was like oh
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.540]   Pleasant
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.500]   It's called a Brooklyn. Hello Stacy. You just didn't know that
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.700]   Yeah, that's all it is pretty violent
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:27.460]   That is the most disgusting word of the Bronx cheer. This is the Brooklyn. Hello. Oh, that was unexpected
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.420]   Almost as unexpected as it was for you probably wow. Yeah
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.220]   Yeah, it was it was really startling
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.900]   And I'm gonna say a bit upsetting. Yeah, no, yeah, can I bleach that?
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.420]   Well, it's just his tongue
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.820]   Chess dude. It was a New Yorker. We don't know where that says hey. Hey, hey, who's a Brooklyn night?
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.700]   Hey
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.700]   Yo, yo, all right. So there's
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.380]   contrasting
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.300]   Contrast and compare there you go two different stories about
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.180]   New York. It's kind of like Plaza. Oh, yes
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.580]   Have you introduced Stacy yet? Oh god. No, it's time for Stacy Higabotham
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.860]   She's back home in Austin Stacy's the host of Stacy on IOT
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.180]   Look who's behind her
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.660]   Corgi
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.820]   He's been running around like crazy
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.420]   So he's exhausted because he's really only got little tiny vestigial legs
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.780]   He does he's not a corky. She's not a corky. She has full-sized legs. Okay
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.500]   Much to my daughter Shagrin
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.180]   Stacy got back last night and the dog was very very happy to see her as a June oven celebrated
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.420]   Even the June oven was happy. I have this vision that Stacy walks in the house and all the lights start going off and cheering
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.500]   She's home
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.900]   That used to actually happen. Um, it wasn't quite as dramatic as that
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.100]   But the first time it happened at like one in the morning
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.980]   After I was getting home from the airport and didn't think about it
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.940]   That is the last time it ever happened. I used to have a little
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.220]   Welcome home Stacy on all my sonos is a life switch
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.340]   Yeah
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.980]   That's funny though that you set that up. That's great. You know, I wouldn't you I I've talked about this before I think on the show
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.540]   uh, there was a guy who had a
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:25.060]   Raspberry Pi monitoring the Wi-Fi and when employees came in the door and their devices attached to the company Wi-Fi
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.700]   He played their theme song
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.780]   Cloudflare was that a cloudflare? I believe it was yeah
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.700]   And I always thought it'd be kind of nice to have a theme song play when you came home
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.420]   What would your theme song be Leo?
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.860]   Believe it or not. I'm walking on it the greatest american hero
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.300]   Wow, that's just the first thing that came to mind
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.660]   Yeah, cloudflare did it. Isn't that funny?
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.780]   Uh, that's amazing that you even knew that story Stacy. Wow
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.140]   All right, is it I is it I is it IOT is it IOT is it IOT yet?
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.940]   So the news is in twitter has put Alex Jones on a timeout
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.780]   With a dunce cap in the corner to you
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:17.860]   Um, he so this is the story that's been ongoing since last friday. Uh, in fact the new york times
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.500]   get in a rare
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.380]   Moment of accessibility twitter invited to times reporters to watch their deliberations about
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.660]   whether to ban info wars from twitter as as
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.420]   had already happened on facebook and instagram and
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.860]   Spotify and apple and itunes
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.260]   uh
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.740]   The info wars app is still on the app store both google and uh ios
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:49.140]   And in fact the two reporters came I get I wonder if jack dorsey thought that they would this would be the outcome
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.380]   They they decided not to ban info wars
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.420]   Even though cnn was able to come up with at least seven tweets that clearly violated
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.420]   twitter's rules
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.060]   And twitter said well if he violates the rules will ban him
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.620]   Well now they have except don't know they gave him a timeout. He's off for a week
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.060]   He's in read-only mode for seven days
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:16.260]   Alex jones can still browse twitter posts but can't interact with other users by tweeting retweeting or liking
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.300]   So they're going to scream that his shadow band
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.980]   Wait hold on a second. Um he can tweet but none of us can see it
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.740]   Or only as followers see it. How does I don't know that's interesting. I don't know
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.300]   exactly how this works, but
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:39.060]   You're right the way scene that describes is twitter confirmed tuesday meaning he can browse twitter posts
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.300]   But can't interact with other users by tweeting retweeting or liking posts
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.340]   He also had to delete the offending tweet which included a snippet of video
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.540]   Oh, so he can't tweet. Okay
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.540]   Not clear
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.700]   But uh, I'm guessing he can't tweet. I've never ever been banned. So I don't know
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:04.260]   Uh apparently the the video that finally broke the straw that finally broke the dorsey's back
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.100]   Uh, it's still on periscope
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:15.860]   Uh, oh actually no after cnnet mentioned that the twitter suspended info wars periscope and twitter accounts in the video
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.020]   Jones encouraged viewers to have your battle rifles ready
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:26.020]   Mainstream media is the enemy and now it's time to act on the enemy. That sounds like a clear call
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.860]   To bias. Yeah, I say that once someone's done that I'd say that's kind of out with you forever
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.020]   Like he's got a little lesson from his time out one week seems
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.220]   Less than adequately
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.180]   Yeah
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.180]   And so then we have to wait for the next
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.380]   They will fight over or they don't get all this attention for every tweet he does
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:51.620]   So that we can fight over whether that crosses the line or not until somebody inside twitter decides that crosses the line
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.820]   Then he goes again
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.220]   Well, and that brings us to zanep to fickies piece, which i'm sure
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.860]   I probably read it on your blog read about it on your blog actually uh jeff
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.580]   Uh, I don't know. No
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.820]   Uh, how social let's see let me let me see if I can find this
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.220]   Uh, this is how social media took us. This is not the piece i was going to talk about
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.260]   But we will talk about that. The other one was
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:21.540]   Yeah, it's it's a history of social media. Basically, it's I don't know if it's
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:29.780]   It adds anything to the conversation. She does have a piece and by the way to fickies great, but the lessons of the era
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:36.900]   Which are maybe necessarily as as insightful as some of the conversations. I think we've had here
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:42.660]   But the article I was thinking of which wasn't I guess from her was had was described how
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.460]   So
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:54.980]   Here it is. This is jon donovans uh study with that she did with dana boyd right uh, uh in which basically the conclusion is this it the conclusion is
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:00.180]   This isn't it either no no it was um, it's all the rundown. Um
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:05.380]   The conclusion essentially is that uh
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:11.460]   You that by that
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:22.900]   It doesn't do any that basically that are long time premise that uh, sunlight is a disinfectant that uh free speech
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:30.180]   Uh, there's only good new solution to to to bad speech is more free speech isn't right
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.460]   That because the manipulator is took advantage of that right
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.900]   Right. So that's why they argue for strategic silence
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:42.420]   So the problem is that somebody says something outrageous like as alex jones just did
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.820]   And what happens is it gets amplified by media picking it up
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.860]   By the debunking because they think the media are them enemy. So they're happy about the debunking right
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.420]   It only supports it
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.900]   Yes, and the evidence is that in fact
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.900]   Well, i'm sorry. I'm ill prepared here because I thought the I thought I had pin
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:07.620]   I I had sent to that after npr interviewed the bozo who ran the uh washington
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.620]   Right wing thing. I said I said I tweeted npr
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.380]   invite databoid and jon donovan to washington and then jon
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.860]   tweeted the
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.860]   Link to the advice. Yeah
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.060]   But I can't find um
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.060]   Where did I put it?
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:32.580]   You know, uh, I read a lot of stuff during the week and I always know when I say something case
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.180]   It's in the guardian the case for quarantining the case remissed ideas
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:41.220]   I'll send it to you right now. Oh, that's all right. You've shown me enough to google it
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.620]   Oh, but I thought I was gonna be faster than you
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.580]   Already sent it to you there
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:52.820]   So, uh, this is we've had jon on the show before many times and jon donovan and we're doing that way back. Yes. We are
[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.380]   Uh, do very good work
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.020]   Um, on which they talk about
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:04.820]   All of these issues that we talk about a lot data in society institute. They have a medium manipulation research initiative
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.820]   That's what jon is part of
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:13.700]   And the conclusion from there and this is based on their work their studies, right? This isn't right. This isn't just a opinion
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:20.660]   Newsrooms must understand that even with the best of intentions they can find themselves being used by extremists
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:27.220]   If telling stories didn't change lives journalists would never have started in their careers
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.020]   But we know that words matter and that coverage makes a difference
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.300]   In this era of increasing violence and extremism
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:40.500]   We and that's jon and dana appeal to the editors to choose strategic silence over publishing stories that fuel
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.780]   the radicalization of their leaders
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.620]   So i'm told that a
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:54.660]   Well full disclosure is the new integrity initiative for which I raised money with money from facebook craig new market others
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.140]   funded data in society
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:01.460]   Um, so i'm plugging i'm plugging in something that I quite like so so
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:08.420]   This idea of strategic silence was brought up recently to a bunch of editors and they as they tend to just belched
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.700]   No, no, no, no, no, no, it's our job a more information. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.580]   Yeah, but that comes from that same ground of being that I always came from which is sunlight disinfects
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:23.540]   So another report another journalist in the room said, okay, okay. Don't call it strategic silence call it responsible reporting
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.820]   And she showed the law that's true. I mean I
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:32.180]   There are so many things actually the most recent was a I saw it in the tech world
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:36.980]   Um, everybody tweeting about t-mobile or writing about t-mobiles, uh, silly
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.180]   customer service stuff. It's based on
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.100]   A game board that they sent out and so there's
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:49.940]   tweets about that but the verge did a full story on t-mobiles change and customer service
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:57.220]   I just there are so many stupid things that we just need jerk respond to because other people are talking about it
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:02.580]   And that's that actually was the standard at a couple places that I've been including fortune
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.420]   Are people talking about it? We need to write and it's me. We may not need to yeah
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.260]   Yeah, we may not have to have you know the take that believes it but we have to cover it
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:16.420]   It's also fueled j rosins brought this a lot up a lot to false equivalence the the bringing you know
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:21.540]   Both sides of the story, you know, I say the sky's blue jeff says the sky's green
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.940]   Let's talk between the two of them instead of saying no jeff's wrong. This guy's blue
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.380]   It manifestly is blue
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:34.500]   It also comes from frankly the world we live in where link bait
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.260]   Uh
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:41.060]   It becomes the the mode because traffic becomes the way you make money. Yes
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:45.780]   There is this is a great example of crazy stuff, right?
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:52.420]   Um back in I think it was last year that humans didn't actually see the sky as blue
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.380]   Because they didn't have a word for the color blue
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:03.220]   So this is if you google people don't see our color no color blue. You'll see the articles about it. It was
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.260]   I'm sure they saw it. They just
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.580]   Well, that's the question
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:13.460]   So they taught it's like they didn't see the sky because they didn't have a word for the color and they didn't pay attention
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:21.860]   And they they pulled examples from like homers red wine sea so wine dark sea, but he never used the word blue
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.900]   A philologist lazarus geiger
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:30.820]   Analyzed ancient Icelandic Hindu chinese arabic and hebrew to see if they ever said blue
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.300]   They didn't
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.580]   In fact the first society to have a word for the color blue was the Egyptians
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.780]   And in fact they were the only culture that could produce blue dye
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.900]   Isn't that fascinating you guys?
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.580]   but
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.500]   according to
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.500]   science alert
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.460]   Uh
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.500]   Just because there was no word for blue does that mean our ancestors couldn't see it
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:58.500]   Now this is that this is that famous story where uh, the uh, was it the Aztecs
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.780]   Didn't when uh Cortez sailed up
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.380]   Uh didn't see the ships because they'd never seen a ship
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:10.340]   And they couldn't see it. They didn't have any way. I don't know. I wonder
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:17.460]   Yeah, they saw it. They just didn't have a meaning attached to it. I mean that but that meant that wasn't registered there in the brain
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.700]   See the thing the what the thing no, there's nothing. I don't see a thing because I don't have a way to
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:29.860]   So in 2006 a psychologist from goldsmiths university of london jules davidoff worked with the hymnba tribe from namibia
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:35.220]   In their language, there's no word for blue and no distinction between green and blue
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:41.380]   So he showed members of the tribe a circle with 11 green squares and one obviously blue square
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.100]   In fact, there's a picture
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.300]   The hymnba tribe could not
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.980]   Tell davidoff which of the squares was a different color
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:57.940]   Those who did hazard a guess at which square was different said took a long time to get the right answer and there were a lot of mistakes
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:03.780]   Interestingly the hymnba have lots more words for green than we do so
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.540]   He showed english speakers the same experiment 11 squares
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:12.180]   Of one shade of green and then one odd square of a different shade
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.260]   Okay, look. Can you see let's let me show you this?
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.540]   Can for those of you watching the video and you at home
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.900]   Which one's a different shade?
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.980]   I hate this stuff. I can tell
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:31.140]   I see it. I can tell do you see it. I see it. I think it's this one. This is like that two color dress thing
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.580]   You think it's that one? Yeah, I wouldn't yeah, I guess I can't see it
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:41.380]   You well, maybe because you're watching the stream or something. Let's see if I'm right. Yeah, Stacy. I don't see it was that one
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.900]   Oh
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:48.420]   Goliya, you can kind of tell maybe only I could tell here because I could see the difference, but it's it's a subtle difference
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.980]   huh
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:56.020]   Another study by mit showed that native Russian speakers who have many words for blue, but only
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:01.060]   But don't have one single word for blue, but instead of a word for light blue Goli blue blue blue
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.060]   dark blue sini
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.420]   Can discriminate between light and dark shades of blue much faster than english speakers
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.180]   So the suggestion is that if you have a word for it, you're going to be able to
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.100]   See it more quickly. Hmm. Anyway, that was a total digression
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:18.580]   But I I love when like whenever people say this guy is blue. I'm like actually
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.420]   What would you call it?
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.860]   sini
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.620]   sini
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.620]   So George Lincoln Rockwell. There's a name we don't like to repeat. Oh man. Yeah
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:31.300]   head of the american nazi party in the sixties
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:37.620]   In his autobiography wrote only by forcing the jews to spread our message with their facilities
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.100]   Could we have had any hope of success?
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.820]   In counteracting their left wing race mixing propaganda
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:50.100]   So in other words, this is jones. This is jones and dana's quote right in the beginning of their article
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.940]   In other words, uh, this is well known to the extremes
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.900]   You nobody's going to listen to you by yourself. So you need some amplification
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.260]   Campus by campus from harvard to brown to columbia
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:08.180]   Rockwell would use the violence of his ideas and brawn of his followers to become headline news
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.980]   Rockwell to compel media coverage said he needed one a smashing dramatic approach
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:19.860]   Which could not be ignored without exposing the most blatant pret censorship and two a super tough hard core of young fighting men
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:26.980]   To enable such a dramatic presentation to the public. I remember those pictures too. Don't you jeff? Yeah, yes, I do
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.980]   Uh contemporary jewish
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.460]   Those were the days of pure. I'm sorry contemporary
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:39.300]   Jewish community groups challenged journalists to consider not covering the white supremacist march their ideas
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.180]   They called this strategy quarantine
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.660]   Yep
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.660]   We do the same thing with suicides
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.100]   Yes, and the we agree to do that. Yeah, they're
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.940]   That that if you don't report the method
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:59.060]   Right, it's the opposite here. I say don't report the message report the method
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:04.740]   I've often decided to put pictures and the names up of of mass killers
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:10.900]   That's another common thing that we're like and actually glorify them. They become yes. We do
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.580]   That's their goal. They
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:18.580]   I feel like the one of the recent shootings actually I think it was the time said they weren't going to
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.420]   do a
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.260]   profile on the
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.460]   Shooter
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:29.300]   And that was the argument it was it was actually kind of really interesting that they drew that line the problem is we
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:36.180]   In good for that in this world of a 24 news cycle where there's incredible demand to fill that clock of link baity
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:42.900]   You know sites that that all all websites that make money based on the amount of traffic
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.900]   and
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.900]   now she woke up
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.340]   and
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.500]   You know
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:59.540]   Frankly a certain amount of sensationalism that's embraced even by mainstream outlets like the New York Times
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:04.980]   It's hopeless quarantine is hopeless. There's too much pressure
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.260]   To do it to cover it
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.820]   Yeah, it's a lot of us the business model
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.340]   It is the business model and then what will happen is people will look for
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.300]   Justifications as as your editors at fortune did well, but the people are interested
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.940]   We're just giving them what they want
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:28.180]   Because recently they click on words. Yeah, they click on it. That's so of course we're going to give them what they click on why wouldn't we
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.300]   Now there's here's a good argument for why you might not want
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:36.980]   So yesterday I want to see how you've heard of the startup called civil no yes, I've met the
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.180]   One of the founders cari go in
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.180]   No, okay, uh, Matthew. Matthew
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:49.380]   I'll sort of uh cheese a woman. This is a black chain. It started. Yes, it's a black. Yeah, so watch out
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.460]   Flockchains and you know the gravy that makes any meatloaf tastes good. Yeah
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:58.980]   Um, and I couldn't understand it all. I saw I went over there purposely yesterday saying brainwashed me because I don't get it
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:03.620]   And I don't 100% get it or I'm you know, I'm not gonna fully bet on where it goes
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.620]   But the interesting thing to me was
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.140]   That by using blockchain one thing that enables is to
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.220]   You have a currency you can give people for certain behaviors
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:20.180]   And so imagine where you have a site we have that it's called a dollar
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:24.980]   No, they're doing they did a token sale to give you well. They're about to they have not
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.300]   Or they're about sorry
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:34.020]   To give you credibility so you can vote up and down things now what are you could vote with your dollar?
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.580]   Well, he no Leo. Here's another way to look at it. So so let's say we have a community site
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:43.540]   Let's say you have your let me guess or do you buy these tokens with dollars?
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:48.420]   Yes, you do but give me a minute Leo give me a common Lio give me a
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:55.300]   Fun journalism. I was there too. I've been brainwashed now, but I was there too. Okay, plus it was leaving their offices
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.220]   That I fell so maybe that your brain was then drumbled by whole brain
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:04.340]   But but but imagine you had a community site where you you said you can join by giving me dollars
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:10.020]   Or you can join by giving me labor or you can be rewarded with membership because you're the best peacemaker in the group
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:14.820]   Or you you brought in the best photos or you did something wonderful, right?
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:21.220]   You have a way to get other behaviors with other currencies than just money or access to content
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.420]   That's all we do in the media now is give me money and I'll let you see my content
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:29.460]   uh, but there's there's lots of content out there. I don't really need your content and
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.500]   or
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.180]   Give me your attention and I'll go get advertisers and I'm gonna do everything I can to beat you over
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.780]   They had to get more attention out of you, right?
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:42.020]   So it's the beginning of trying to rethink business models a little bit a little bit. We bet
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:46.740]   I mean we have there are ways we have dollars. We have votes
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.620]   We have attention
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:53.780]   I would submit that because votes especially
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:24:00.420]   Seem to be something people are very hard. We're locked into part with that instead of creating new tokens
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.900]   We just sort of emphasize
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.860]   the tokens we've got dollars votes attention. Let's let's really let's really
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.700]   Focus on that. Why why dilute it with other tokens?
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:18.980]   Well, because then you'd be in a case where uh, well what I'm saying is you're not necessarily giving tokens
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.220]   You could give other other
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.100]   Rewards like membership discounts
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.740]   Other thing. What's the point of the tokens though?
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:33.860]   Oh, you're gonna you you pushed me to my limit already and I hit my head on the ground. So I don't know it funds
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.100]   So I think the token sale helps fund
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:44.420]   Operations for a little bit but also allows you to the way they explained it to me and this was in April
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.420]   So things may have changed is
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:52.260]   That gives you credibility on the site so you can your vote counts more
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.020]   You buy votes you're buying votes literally
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:02.820]   Wrong with that. No, no, no, no, they have a mechanism and place to stop that, but I can't remember. Yes
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.460]   Who gets the money?
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.260]   Sivol the people they pay it out to journalists
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:13.300]   You can join them. They use it to pay for stories
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:21.940]   What's usually actually have dollars? Come on and talk about it. It's a really interesting. Oh, I'm not interested. It will be ill assume be rubles. That's why
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:28.820]   Um, all right, I'm sure it's fine. You guys are smart. I you wouldn't fall for anything silly. I
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:34.900]   Were interested in how it turns out it is a new model. That's exactly the rule. Sounds busy. Well, so
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:41.460]   But see this is why I think that I really wanted to highlight Dana and Jones article because
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.340]   Uh, let's fix the existing model
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:48.660]   But and if and then if you say well, we can't fix it then okay, I'll be I'm going to look at it
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.740]   I don't know if we can fix it. Maybe not
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:57.220]   I think an attention based at model will in this in an abundance based market
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:02.420]   We'll get you in trouble because yeah, you go to abundance you go to honor price and you go up in desperation
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.380]   So you go up in counts and courteous. Yes, that's the formula, right?
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:12.100]   And crazy youtube stunts. That's the same thing that's happening with things. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:17.700]   Yeah, so somebody somebody I know actually got his shows logo tattooed on his back
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.780]   this show
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.300]   This show or his show actually was his butt
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.500]   Oh me. Oh, this is you guys
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.460]   Crazy youtube. Yeah, I did that for dollars
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:35.300]   Charity dollars. Yes. You said you got a network
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.740]   Nations children's fund unicev
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:43.540]   So please tell me that was not for your own revenue because no I wouldn't do that
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:48.660]   That's crazy. I sold bricks for my own revenue. So uh, our
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:54.740]   I have a question for you. I want you to debunk this ap exclusive. Oh
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:27:01.940]   Google wants to know where you go so badly says the ap
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:07.140]   That they record your movements even when you explicitly tell them not to
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.060]   So uh google i'm sorry ap hired
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:16.900]   People they identified as computer science researchers at Princeton. I'm guessing that's ed feltton and crew
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.420]   That's where it's so I think it was a ravi. Hold on. Oh, okay
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:24.500]   Um sultan to verify this
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.860]   Salle sultan salle sultan. Okay
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.740]   because uh
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.060]   So as you all know, uh when you
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:38.500]   Say open google maps, it says we would like permission to access your location
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.460]   And in general on the iphone
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.620]   There are three settings for that no
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.180]   only when the app is open or anytime
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.020]   And you choose and that I believe the iphone enforces that
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.020]   Uh
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.900]   If you agree to let it record your location over time google maps will display that history for you in a timeline
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.020]   I like that. I leave that turned on but some people don't want that
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.900]   here's however
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.980]   Uh
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:08.100]   What google says you can turn off location history at any time
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.660]   With the location history off the places you go are no longer stored
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:17.940]   The ap says that isn't true even with location history paused
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:24.260]   Some google apps automatically stored timestamp location data without asking
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:28.500]   They do point out it's possible all the laborious to delete it
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.700]   I'm not sure how laborious it is
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:35.140]   Um, it's not that laborious, but it is so
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:38.660]   Do you want to let jeff talk about how it's okay?
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:43.140]   You go to my activity at google.com. We've already shown how to how to do that
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:48.740]   I think this is a failure of communication and transparency. It may not be evil
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:54.660]   But this is a perfect example of engineering people or people who are building a system
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:29:00.420]   Not thinking ahead as to how they're communicating with users and how people are going to interpret that
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.180]   so
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.940]   it is
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.140]   I mean you could almost call it a cultural divide in some sense because like
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.700]   People who are technically savvy may be like
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.740]   Well, yeah, that's there. We left that option there
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:17.620]   You know, of course it's going to do this, but most people do not interpret it that way and I I think
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.660]   This is a real problem because
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:25.780]   Google and others are asking for such deeply personal information
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:31.620]   That they have to err on the side of telling people everything because most people are going to click yes
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.980]   Most people are going to be like, oh, yeah, I totally want to leave my location tracking on
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.780]   So you can tell me how long it's going to take me to get to my next appointment
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.780]   So or the weather wherever I am and maybe
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.700]   it would be
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:47.620]   Would have behooved AP to check other map apps because
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:53.460]   What they say is well, even if you have location history turn off the minute you open the maps app it records your location
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.460]   But I betcha
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:59.860]   That's exactly what every map app does. Otherwise it can't tell you how else can it?
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.940]   Yeah, well people don't know that again. They don't know that it's being stored
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:11.220]   You could say hey, give me the location now, but don't keep it don't send it to Google
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:15.300]   And that has to be such a google though. So the maps can do its job
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.660]   Yeah, even for sudden the else will say oh my god when you search for chocolate cookies
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.180]   It knows your location. Yeah, because maybe you're looking for a store that sells them near you
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:27.300]   That's not what the user expects. I agree. I agree
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:31.220]   How do you know and this is what jonith amir the prince to computer scientist who did the
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:35.140]   Work, he's a former technologist for the fcc's enforcement bureau
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:40.340]   He says quote if you're going to allow users to turn off something called location history
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:43.540]   Then all the places where you maintain location history
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:50.340]   Should be turned off that seems like a pretty straightforward position to have google is here's google's response
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.780]   This is an a statement to the ap
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:58.500]   There are a number of different ways that google may use location to improve people's experience including
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:04.660]   Location history web and app activity and through device level location services
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:09.700]   We provide clear descriptions of these tools and robust controls so people can turn them off
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.420]   And on and delete their histories at any time
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:18.580]   So they didn't really address this issue of look I turned off location history
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:25.060]   Why are you saying then you asked for a function that required the location you're implicitly turning it back on is that the
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:31.860]   The view that's kind of yeah, no, but search should not require my I can see why no, I disagree strongly
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.580]   I just I use this example all the time. Sorry my lights off. All right
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:40.740]   Um, I I sorry. I mean you're up those two same. Sorry. I I believe you did though, chup
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.220]   I would say that most people
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.580]   most people when they search for something they like
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:51.940]   They just want to know the information and not just so chocolate chips
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.980]   They don't necessarily want to know the chocolate chips cookies near me
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:32:01.940]   They usually add near me if they want to start adding location, but people are not necessarily aware of how this works
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:09.940]   We are very tech savvy people. We understand me. I give you my example. Yes, please. So if I if I if I right if I right now search for pizza
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:15.220]   There's a good chance I want pizza near me. I'm not gonna say near me because I'm gonna presume google knows
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.420]   That's what I do is I go eat pizza then I probably don't want a pizza recipe
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:24.260]   I probably don't want the history of pizza. I probably don't want blog posts extolling the virtues of pizza
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.860]   I probably want to eat it now
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:32.820]   And so I didn't say near me and so the presumption of locality I bet is far more frequent than we know
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:38.660]   And it's a presumption and so if I if I and and and I can you know go to
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:43.780]   What's the what's the what's the don't know you um browser go
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.660]   No, no, no, no in google. I can go to
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:50.980]   Thank you in concito window and thank you would be my brain
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:59.140]   And i'm gonna get a worse experience and search and until you kind of really do that and see what's happening so that
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:04.100]   Google's trying to give people what they want is presumed that and a lot of times it is local
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.660]   I know I don't know
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.420]   I
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.540]   Get what they're trying to do. That's why I think this is not nefarious
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.900]   I think it's a miscommunication between the engineering staff
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.860]   Yeah, we know I think it's nefarious
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.540]   I do think that they should be more transparent about it
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:26.340]   That's where I think it's nefarious because they they aren't really obviously doing this
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:33.380]   I mean they not so here's what scooter xner chat room says there is a setting on andra and iphone devices
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.380]   uh
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.380]   if if if you
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.460]   disable then re-enable the setting
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.580]   It will tell you this
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.740]   Places you go with your devices
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:48.820]   It will by the way the setting is on by default so you have to turn it off and then on again
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:54.980]   Then you will see a pop up that says places you go with your devices will stop being added to your location and history map
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:57.700]   however
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.460]   uh
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.220]   if if
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:04.260]   But we will from time to time save location information
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.740]   from
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:09.620]   applications like web searches and maps
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.820]   Uh as you use them it it informs you of this but it's not it's hidden
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:19.700]   So by the way google could easily fix this by bringing that it forward a little bit more, right?
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.340]   Yeah, no, no objection to that. I think Stacy and I would agree
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:28.180]   That's where I think it's maybe not nefarious, but it could be an oversight or it could be they'd prefer not to
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:33.620]   Shake anybody up. Yeah, so I would I would kind of look at this. You know how
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:42.900]   Food companies they they love using the word natural which can hide any number of weird sugars or dyes or other beetle parts
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.580]   um
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.580]   This is that kind of
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.100]   Issue where they're like i'm communicating this are they being nefarious or kind of
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.780]   Like the food companies inclusive. Maybe that's a better word. Yeah
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:59.540]   But the problem is again such personal data they're asking of us
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:04.340]   They need to be super transparent because otherwise they're going to lose our trust
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:08.660]   And if they lose our trust they're going to lose access to our data and they're gonna get out
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:15.940]   We're going to end up with crappier experiences. I mean I have turned off various personalization experiences and
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:19.460]   My god, nothing works. It's terrible. Yes
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:25.140]   So washington post just put up a story saying that i haven't read it yet
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.580]   Jack adoresis reconsidering how twitter operates
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.860]   And I mean he hasn't already
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.700]   Yeah
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.700]   Uh, but I saw like a lifelong one going in
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:39.860]   All right. We'll we'll we'll finish this and we'll go check that out. Oh, sorry
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:43.620]   So the ap to demonstrate how powerful these other markers can be
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.500]   uh asked a
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:51.300]   Postdoc at princeton goodness a car. That's the one you were talking about uh stacy
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:55.300]   To carry an android phone with location history off
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:00.660]   Uh, but and then he shared the record of his google account with the ap
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:06.180]   Now even though the phone had location history off didn't have location off. I should point out
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.340]   Maybe that's an important distinction had location history off
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:16.500]   The map included his train commutes on two trips to New York visits to the highline Chelsea market health kitchen
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.580]   central park in harlem where somebody licked his neck to protect his privacy
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:26.340]   The ap didn't plot the most telling and frequent marker his home address, but all that stuff was stored
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.380]   Maybe the distinction is location history
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.100]   versus location information
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.420]   Same was
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.700]   No explained that
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.700]   So he turned off location history
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:44.180]   But also a setting on all on all phones iphone and android is location information period
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:48.180]   Location services now most people don't turn that off
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:54.100]   Because then a lot of what you expect your phone to do stops working maps don't work a lot of things don't work
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:37:01.140]   But in that case you are definitely turning off the location information. I would presume at that point google's not saving it
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:09.300]   So I would too we understand you and I I think understand the distinction between location services and location history
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:13.860]   If location services are turned on the location history is turned off
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.500]   But in the course of events you use
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:21.620]   Apps like maps that must of necessity record your location
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:25.220]   Some stuff is going to be recorded
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.620]   Maybe not I don't know
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:34.580]   I think that's your point stacy, which is that a geek could be expected to understand this but normal people could not right
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:42.740]   All right something to be aware of I think google's
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:52.260]   Best choice at this point would be and I think that probably will do this to respond by being clear about what they're doing
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:56.260]   Yeah, I mean that's that's what everybody should be doing right now. Yeah
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.460]   And you know, I think maybe we've learned this lesson
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.580]   I hope we have
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.740]   Uh be clear
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.900]   Well, and if they're not there
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:14.020]   Then you have to explain I mean if you're not clear then the assumption is going to be oh you are selling my data to the highest bidder
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.180]   Or something yeah, you're intentionally obfuscating. Yeah
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:21.540]   So or google could tell everyone to just chill and take its breeding exercise
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:30.500]   I thought I thought so everyone's reporting this but I feel like I've seen that before or maybe it was just somewhere else
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.580]   Maybe it was another app I've had
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:39.300]   But yes, this is a very responsible. It is responsive. It is the case that uh, iPhones do that
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.540]   So it's just playing catch up
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:46.420]   Actually apple watches. Ah, phones. Well, maybe what iPhones do it do apple watches do this
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:50.980]   I used to have a desire or a desire a device called the spire
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:57.060]   And that would do that whenever it felt that I was getting stressed. I had that yeah, it digs it digs into your waist
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.500]   Oh, I wore it between my my bra so
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:07.300]   But apparently I breathed so slowly that they never I never needed it. He was like dude
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.780]   Your respiration is off the charts low
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:15.460]   Good congratulations. Yeah, I don't know if that's a good thing or not. You're not hyperventilating
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:22.020]   All right, uh jack dorsey says he's rethinking the core actually maybe this is a big deal of how twitter works
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:26.340]   This is the yeah, there's a little bit of it. This is the breaking story that jeff just
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:30.660]   Mentioned. I'm sorry. I don't like you were done with the other story. I am now
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.620]   He's ranking a thing in the core parts of the social media platform
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.580]   So it doesn't enable the spread of hate speed charrisment false news
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:42.020]   Including its conspiracy theories shared by prominent users like alix jones and infill wars
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.900]   This is an interview he did today with the washing and post
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:52.900]   He said twitter's experimenting with features who would promote alternative viewpoints in twitter's timeline to address misinformation reduce echo chambers
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.700]   He also expressed openness to labeling bots
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:02.260]   And redesigning key elements of the social network including the like button in the way twitter displays users following recounts
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.980]   If this if he really is seriously doing this
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:11.460]   Uh, this is kind of a change for twitter they've resisted these things for a long time. They have
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:17.460]   Um, so so one solution twitter's exploring is just around false tweets with factual content
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:24.100]   So that's what phase by what false is right? Yeah, yeah facebook is it does some one of things with the fact checkers
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:27.460]   But that means they got to have a system to identify and determine
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:33.140]   falsity so we they keep on saying and I agree with them. We don't want them to be the arbiters of truth
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.860]   Um, but they're all being pushed in that position because people are purposefully
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:41.060]   In a manipulative way putting up falsity falsehoods
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.700]   And so then they're going to try to put context by giving you something that disagrees with it now
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.340]   We need research to say does that do any good or not?
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.100]   Made with the opposite
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:54.580]   But it's an attempt to address it wait isn't that what we're against in terms of journalist?
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.700]   Which is like silly other side stuff like oh
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:01.860]   I'm just good point. Yep sky is green
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.420]   ah
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.420]   The sky has no color
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:10.260]   The sky is the sky. Hmm. We can't see the sky
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.460]   Um, I it's it's interesting because remember this is
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:17.940]   He's talking to the washington post because he's in washington dc to meet with lawmakers
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:21.700]   So this may be that there's his feet are to the fire
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.020]   maybe
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:26.020]   then they leave
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:29.300]   Surely he's having moments of
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:37.780]   Reflection even even he can't be that that obtuse. Yeah, that's why they hired people they hired academics to work on
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:42.580]   Uh the health of the public conversation their impact on it. It's kind of it's this is another one here
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:46.900]   Which is twitter because someday someday could label automated accounts?
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:52.180]   I think that's a basic and there are good automated accounts. I have an automated account effectively. Yeah, there's good ones
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:57.140]   There's nothing wrong with that. My account mostly is just a notice that it shows about to begin
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.940]   Yeah, but that's automated
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.340]   Make it transparent
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:07.220]   Making a feature. Yeah, I made a nice bot for you. Remember that we we used to be talking about that. Hey, I make bots
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:10.980]   I made you a nice bot
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:15.540]   Do you like it? Well, I have a yeah, I have a bot that tweets out some stuff
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.980]   But the rest of it's me and the bot just tweets out like hey, I just posted this
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.740]   Especially your boss or is your so now what is he gonna label yours?
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.940]   Yeah, I don't know. That's why I'm kind of curious. I'm like, oh dear
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:27.620]   I guess I should have to
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:30.900]   I guess I could do another twitter account. Yeah, I have a leo bot account
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:35.060]   Maybe I should move that the thing is nothing would ever appear on my real account
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:41.460]   Because oh because I don't know what yeah, I rarely tweet
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.020]   So to your point about Washington leo
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:51.140]   Uh, the story says that state legislators in california and federal lawmakers such as mark Warner have proposed making this a requirement of law
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:53.220]   Which i'm not going to be crazy about
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:57.060]   What would the requirement be that you have to label bots?
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.860]   Oh, but just that
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:07.780]   I mean it goes to the thing we've talked about when it came to for example, google's bot customer service
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.420]   You know, should you know that it's a bot?
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:14.260]   On customer service? Yes
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:17.460]   I mean, well if it's going to ask you questions
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:20.260]   What time do you uh open?
[00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:27.700]   All right, let's take a little break. We have such a great sponsor actually all of our sponsors are great

[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:22.180]   You know be in hollywood to learn filmmaking from the best. It's just uh, it's mind boggling how in mirin teaches acting
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:28.020]   Mark jacobs teaches fashion design. This would be a great gift to for a kid or an adult
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:31.060]   Uh, just fascinating great stuff
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:36.660]   Werner Herzog teaching filmmaking that's just got to be fun, right?

[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:11.060]   He's doing it because he wants you to have to learn what he's learned. He had to learn his own
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:13.780]   He doesn't want you to don't disappoint Werner

[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:21.700]   But it's obvious about that no it's parody
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:23.700]   Yeah, yes, yes
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:26.500]   Well, do you know that you have the account nine?
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.900]   No

[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.100]   No
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:08.100]   Example a general reminder about the enemy of the people it's usually the people
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:11.300]   Okay
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:15.620]   All right. I follow kim kirkar deck kirk kirkar - yeah, yeah

[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:23.060]   Oh, it's out my beautiful despair
[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:27.860]   the philosophy of kim kirkar guard dashion
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:31.300]   It's a
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:35.860]   bizarre mashup of kirkar guard and kim kardashian as you might have guessed
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:40.660]   That's harder to say than it is to read and uh, here's nine
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:44.420]   I'm here just here for the degradation of the discourse
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:49.060]   Uh, oh, I get I didn't
[00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:55.620]   A general reminder about the enemy of the people it's usually the people I I didn't see sorry. I did I ruined the gag
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:58.180]   I was so much better to get
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:01.540]   Okay
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:05.220]   Uh, let's talk about breathing breathing baby breathing
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:10.740]   Explain grammar syntax and cynicism walk into a bar bartender. What wouldn't it be?
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.940]   Oh
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.500]   Sorry, that's actually funny
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.020]   So
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:23.620]   This should be actually let's do it. It's time for the google change log
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:27.300]   The google change log
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:32.020]   Decided
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:36.740]   Memories we just wait before stacey joined us and made the show whole again
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:43.220]   We lost of course one of the founding members of the show because not nothing happened to her. She just decided
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:47.780]   She was tired of us of being jeff just as you will someday stacey
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.580]   Um
[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:53.220]   And now I've forgotten her name jina
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.220]   Turbani
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:58.100]   Jupani, I'm sure that was you know age
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:00.340]   No, it wasn't age
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.100]   It was I'm just I'm upset
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:08.820]   So jina did every week the google change log and a number of people have come to me since saying that's the one thing I really miss
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:13.700]   From uh, this week in google the google change log. So let's do the google change log. This is
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:20.020]   These are things new things you can do with google this week and we'll start with the breathing exercise
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:24.820]   So you first you have to search for breathing exercise, right?
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:28.580]   Is this a google search?
[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:29.940]   Let's try it
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:30.980]   Oh, look
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:35.700]   There it is if you search for breathing exercise you get a one-minute breathing exercise. This is in the google search
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:38.420]   bring awareness to your breath
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.380]   Breathe in
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:46.740]   Is there any uh voice in this no breathe out?
[00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:50.180]   Well, I already breathed out
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:54.420]   I don't know how to say okay, so you're you're you're not good about a saying I can't do it. No
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:55:02.020]   So is that it this is it
[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:04.020]   Is it does it keep going forever?
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:09.060]   I think it's a continuation of the nanny state there even telling you when to breathe and they're gonna record your breath
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:11.140]   It's like a minute. It's a minute guys
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:14.020]   Just relax, but you don't need this because
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:18.020]   I can't doesn't make me nervous. Uh-huh. Stacy does this without trying
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:22.260]   I do I am in such a zen state jeff. I'm the anti-jef
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:26.580]   Yes, you are ready for some more google change log bits
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:28.980]   bits and pieces
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:32.900]   Uh, we talked about this on windows weekly if you use google chrome. They're adding
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:38.100]   support for windows tens built in push notifications in the past
[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:43.380]   Uh google chrome would give you notifications, but there'd be some there'd be kind of weird googly
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:49.700]   Notifications now they're going to use windows tens built-in feature. This is out. It's in chrome
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:56.020]   68, but it may not be in yours yet. It just takes a little time sometimes to get activated
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:56:01.460]   also in the google change log did you uh, did you uh,
[00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:04.100]   know that for louis armstrong's birthday?
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:10.340]   They uh, they commissioned an updated recording of tiger wrath
[00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:12.820]   I'm sorry rag
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:14.820]   Wrath is the vernar hertz like version
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:22.020]   Uh 117 years ago louis armstrong was born google arts and culture in the record label douche agramophone
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:24.900]   restored
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:29.220]   The tiger rec should we hear it? Should we hear the tiger rec? This is actually was recorded
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:32.020]   in 1934 in a studio in paris
[00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:38.180]   For uh for a gramophone. Oops. I'm pressed the wrong button. Let me press the right button here
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:42.180]   ladies and gentlemen. I give you the tiger rag
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:55.860]   Okay, that's not so exhausted. That's the opposite of the breathing exercise. I was
[00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:59.700]   Actually, that's a man who has mastered his breathing. Yes
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.100]   Yeah
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.260]   Uh google does this. I didn't know they did this
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:09.620]   but uh, they do a kind of uh zeitgeist weekly zeitgeist
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:17.700]   Of google search trends a trek. Oh, yes through search trends starring popular firms and croc films and crocular shoes
[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:20.340]   Patrick stuart
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:24.100]   We learned last week is going to return to star trek
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:30.020]   searches for crocs going out of business went up 4,700 percent this week
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:36.340]   Signaling that fashion offenders everywhere were in a panic. They eventually breathed the sigh of relief
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:41.140]   After the company confirmed it's here to stay despite closing down a few manufacturing facilities
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.540]   whoo
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:46.660]   Search interest in crocs surpass search interest in ugs

[00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:02.580]   for some reason, uh, oh, I guess because
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:06.340]   A new category was announced for the oscars dedicated to popular film
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:10.260]   A top search question this week. How many oscar categories are there?
[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:17.940]   Bring it on people in georgia, luisiana and dc particularly interested in the nfl's announcement that male cheerleaders
[00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:22.900]   Will be on the sidelines of the los angeles rams in new awnan saints this season
[00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:26.180]   and finally

[00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:01.220]   uh kind of
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:04.820]   To take the place of or as an upgrade to google drive
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:12.580]   As I think it's I think it's gone for new users, which is all that's why I don't have it. Oh, because i'm not a new user
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:15.780]   Here's the google 1
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:18.420]   Soundtrack. No, it says it's still coming soon

[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.980]   Jason has a review and I haven't decided yet. I don't i'm not sure
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:52.500]   I have a google home max which I love and that's probably enough for me
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:56.980]   If you have a love says yeah, the sound is great in the max. He loves his linovo
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:02.260]   No, he loves his linovo. He he says he uses it more than any other device in his home right now
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:07.540]   I was a believer when I got my uh echo show. I like having a screen on so maybe I will get one
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:10.740]   It's not too expensive actually this camera lit that up about how he uses it
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:14.180]   Yes, we just published it today on stacey
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:20.100]   There you go. Welcome. I am a terrible self promoter. I'll be honest, but there you go
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:26.420]   You can now also drill more deeply with news. You can ask the assistant. What's the news on the women's national soccer team?
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:28.420]   What's the latest on nasa?
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:34.020]   Uh, and if you have a smart display like the linovo, it'll also find relevant videos on youtube
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:39.140]   on assistant speakers like google home. It will read out excerpts from news articles from a growing
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:41.860]   list of publishers so
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:45.380]   Good news if you like the news you get all the news
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:48.100]   That's fit to listen to
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.580]   on your google home and that
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:52.900]   Is the google changelog?
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:55.620]   Q
[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:58.900]   I hope you enjoyed this reprise
[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.860]   Let us know if you want us to continue that
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.580]   I think that's useful. I think it is new stuff from
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:11.860]   A lot of stuff. Yeah. Oh, I remember what happened. Jason. Howl got the linovo smarts
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.340]   screen
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:19.220]   Smart display, but his daughters it has no way to restrict youtube access
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:23.380]   And his young daughters just basically used it as an endless supply of
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.940]   questionable youtube content
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:27.940]   Ah
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:30.420]   So he disabled it that makes sense
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.820]   Okay
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:36.980]   Our show today brought to you by wine. Would you like a drink?
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.740]   Yeah
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:42.100]   Uh, it's uh, five o'clock. It's after five o'clock
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:44.900]   Uh most almost
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.900]   My father would say the sun is over the yard arm
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:50.980]   It's over the yard arm. I had a grandfather that said that as well
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:53.540]   Uh
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.380]   Must have been a thing in the breakouts the
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:59.380]   Wink is the best way to discover new wines you will love
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:04.420]   We get our wink box every month for new wines you get to start with the wink palette quiz
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.420]   You go through the palette profile quiz
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:10.100]   Answer some questions about what you like. How do you take your coffee?
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:12.580]   Do you like salt citrus?
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:17.620]   Mushrooms truffles that kind of thing and then they'll customize
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:20.180]   your wink playlist you could choose
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:24.980]   Uh, there are four bottles all red all white or any mix thereof
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:32.420]   Each month new delicious wines, of course in the summer you got to get the insanely popular summer water rosé
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.260]   It's so refreshing and delicious
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:37.460]   Paul tharrat would turn it into a slushy
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:40.740]   If you have a slushy machine try that
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:44.740]   They're uh, they also well i'll show you they partner with local artists for the labels
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:47.860]   This is our box today. This is uh one of the wines
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:50.340]   tempo vero
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:54.020]   It's a 2016 negro amaro salento
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:59.060]   With wild beaches ancient forests and tempting local cuisine
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:00.980]   The increasingly
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:05.700]   Important wine region of salento is nestled in the heel of italy's boot
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.940]   And this is a red
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:10.500]   I love italian reds, but i'd never heard of salento
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:14.340]   So that's the whole point of this. This is a southern italian wine. Let's see what else we've got
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:19.860]   A malbeck we love those probably lisa put that on the list you can you could select wines and repeat wines
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:24.020]   You really love this is from mendoza argentina the home of the best malbecs
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:26.580]   Oh
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:29.620]   I love this. This is an alberino field theory
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:33.380]   One of my favorite labels
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:35.620]   Uh from wink
[01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:39.700]   And i've i've loved every one of these this is uh, and don't you love the bottles they're very beautiful
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:42.500]   This is almost clear. You could see the beautiful color of the wine
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:45.060]   Alberino. There's a 2016 alberino
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:48.900]   alberino, which is an italian style wine, but this one's from low die
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:55.060]   No membership fees you could skip any month. Oh good the one this is the one I keep
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:59.540]   Shipping is covered if you don't like a bottle they'll send you a new one
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:02.500]   You know questions asks you keep the old one too
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:06.660]   Because of course you're not gonna mail that back. These are wines curated to your taste
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:10.020]   By the way, the more wines you try and rate the more personalized they'll get
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:14.740]   This is my favorite. This is I think it's australian blau fronkish
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:19.700]   2016 this is the field theory blau fronkish this this wine
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.380]   Blooming away when I first tasted it's from pestle robles
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:26.180]   Why settle for the same old bottle of wine?
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:27.620]   Go to wink
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:30.100]   You get wine for a couple of meals a month
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:33.140]   A wine to bring friends when you go to dinner
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:37.940]   And maybe a wine to put down in your in your wine cell i start building your collection
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:41.940]   This uh blau fronkish would be fantastic to put down
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:44.260]   Wink

[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.380]   All right now I have to put this wine away because it's not five o'clock here
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:22.660]   And I still have to do a show
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:26.100]   I love so glad I get the blau fronkish that is so good
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:30.820]   I never had tried that before and the alberinio i've always loved
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:38.820]   Uh no okey shards in my box somebody's saying okey shards. Well if you like okey shards, I i'm not a fan of okey
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.420]   Of oak
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:43.860]   So we we but they have some very nice shards that are not okey
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:47.380]   Maybe we should make this the
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:53.540]   Our theme your new music would you like this to be the theme song?
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:56.340]   I'm all for it for this week in google
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:59.940]   I think this would be a great theme
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:03.700]   instead of those flute things
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:10.660]   It's from 1934 I think you could probably
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:19.540]   This should be our theme
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:23.060]   What do you think i'm gonna i'm gonna come in a vote
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:26.180]   The question is on the floor
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:31.460]   Will we make lui armstrong's tiger rag the new theme of this week in google all in favor say I
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:34.580]   Anything's better than what we have. I
[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:37.140]   I'll take that as a yes
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:42.340]   What is our current theme song you haven't heard it? I'm sure I have I just
[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:51.060]   Yes, let's change it. Yeah leo picked it in a moment of weakness
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:59.140]   Google's public I don't care. Their show is gonna last. How many of them is fine jay exactly
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:01.380]   We'll do 10 episodes. It'll be over
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:07.300]   What did I know by the way you like our new galaxy home device the uh, they they call it the galdron
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:09.300]   It's got big speed built in
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:16.420]   No, that's a weber jr. That's not that's kind of looking like it though. It totally looks like it eight dot eight
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:20.100]   Eight what go ahead. I was gonna say kevin calls it the fun du pot
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:25.940]   It kind of looks like a fun. Well, let me show you the galaxy. This is a part of the big note nine announcement
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:31.620]   Uh, I don't think a lot of people really paid much attention to the new watch or the galaxy home
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:34.500]   This is partly because the galaxy home runs big speed
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.300]   Which I don't think anybody
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:40.660]   Really wants because big speed doesn't really do anything in fact
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:48.180]   It's an odd choice because at least up to now big speed really is only giving you commands that work on a phone like open photos
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:53.300]   Oh, but they built smart so they actually that is also a smart things hub
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:59.220]   So so it is a so they could be moving into the smart home. Yeah, that makes sense
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:03.940]   So uh because that's the idea behind apple's home pot as well as it's a hub
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:09.540]   Yeah, but their hub is kind of pointless because it only has bluetooth and Wi-Fi. It doesn't have zig beers
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:13.620]   You wave does this have zig beans you wave. It's it's like a six things smart things. Okay
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:18.340]   Uh, and I and they've said that we are going to put uh more intelligence in bixby
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:21.780]   I I guess I would expect that viv is going to get in there viv is the
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:28.340]   The follow-up to serie when serie was sold apple the serie guys left and started viv.ai then later sold it to sam
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.420]   So it would be my guess
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:32.420]   that bixby 2.0
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:38.820]   Is gonna viv it viv is kind of like a way to approach programming to let you pull apis together
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:41.700]   It's not exactly the same thing. It's not an ai
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:45.300]   Um, it is a way to use ai
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:48.020]   It's it's an ai that recognizes
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:49.300]   Oh
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:52.340]   That ties things to apps. So it's going to recognize your voice command
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:54.500]   Uh, and it does it
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:11:00.900]   Intelligently so an individual doesn't have to program that so you don't have to say when a person when you recognize a statement
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:05.940]   This is what you need to open. It's basically adding a conversational interface to everything
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:08.980]   Yes, it's a pretty ambitious project. Oh
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:15.300]   So I wrote about it way back in the day. Yeah, they're now part of sam's song. So I was wrong. I guess it's not viv
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:18.420]   Uh, but bixby 2.0 is supposedly
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:25.540]   Gonna be uh, you can make able to make restaurant reservations book rides with uber find nearby concerts all stuff bixby doesn't do now
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:29.460]   Yeah, viv lets them scale that so in a way, it's gonna
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:32.580]   See we'll see if actually viv is useful or not viv makes sense
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:36.740]   For the smart home, right because it would give you a voice interface to all the devices in your smart home
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:41.220]   But that would require that those devices enable it and include viv
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:46.820]   Yeah, I think so, but what's viv actually is useful anywhere because it basically
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:49.540]   It it automates the
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:53.860]   Adding of the api's to things. I mean making api calls and bring those things together
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:55.940]   cool
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:57.780]   kill
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:59.780]   8.8.8 is eight
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:05.700]   It's google's public dns 8.8.8.8 is eight years old
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:10.740]   And I probably should have made this part of the change log because google says
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:15.460]   Uh, the anniversary was august 12th at 1230 am utc
[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.460]   which is
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:21.220]   eight years eight months eight days and eight hours since the original announcement. Oh boy
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:24.260]   uh google chose the occasion to
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.300]   uh talk about
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:28.100]   eight
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:33.460]   Dot eight dot eight dot eight ten percent of all internet users use it. It's the largest public dns resolve or wow
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:36.340]   That's pretty amazing
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:42.820]   It's used by google station and indian railway locations isp's in africa and south east asia
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:46.180]   Use it instead of their own dns servers
[01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:52.820]   And everybody in the us uses it so they don't get dns hijacked by their isp right yay
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:57.620]   And this is which to 1.1.1.1 which is another one that's from cloud flare
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:00.100]   I'm sorry. Yeah quad one
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:04.580]   So quad eights, uh, this is a this picture kind of says it all this is uh in turkey
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:07.220]   When the turkish government was shutting down
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:10.020]   internet services right and left
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:17.780]   protesters actually this is something you don't expect to see i've painted on the side of a building dns call an eight dot eight dot eight dot eight
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:21.780]   One way to get through the turkish uh firewall
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:24.660]   Isn't that that's kind of cool
[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:28.420]   Or terribly sad depending on how we look at it or sad
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:31.940]   Or sad
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:38.900]   Hey, yeah, turkey's going through now financial crisis. Thanks to the authoritarian rule of racep
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:45.380]   Erdoğan Erdoğan Erdoğan. I can is that how you say Erdoğan Erdoğan? Yes, okay
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:50.980]   You got it google wants to help your boss spy on you according to
[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:54.180]   the outline
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:59.940]   I'm not going to give this much. It's just a panel. It's this is link bait right exactly
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:02.260]   It is although
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:05.940]   Okay, I don't want my boss to do this, but I would actually like to know
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:09.380]   What helps make me more productive and maybe it's because I work right?
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:14.180]   Exactly. I'm like, yeah, no, I am kind of freaked out in
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:21.940]   Not freaked out. I would be excited because they're talking about using signals from personal devices and things around not just your
[01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:23.940]   computer
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:31.220]   If they can actually pull all that kind of data together that would mean that presumably we've got like a data schema that we can use and all kinds of universal
[01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:35.460]   Things that we don't currently have today. So well and frankly, uh, this
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:38.820]   That's that's a bit of a leap for the outline to say it's for your boss
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:43.300]   It's anybody who wants to make work more efficient to study work patterns workflows
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:48.660]   Not necessarily bad. I mean, how the heck else am I gonna hack my work week?
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:51.780]   Yeah
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:53.780]   Uh, let's see
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:59.300]   Fortnite's android beta now available for non-samh songphones boy. That was a brief exclusive
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:05.700]   Yeah, uh, but unfortunately this is the one that you have to sideload
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:09.140]   Uh, epic says we're not going to offer it on the google play store
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:14.420]   Is that and slowly I we don't we're talked about that part of it. Is it just because epic is cheap? Is it? Yeah
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:17.940]   Said it they don't want to give google their 30%
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:24.100]   They have to they have to there's no choice. There's no sideloading on iPhones
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:25.940]   Oh
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:30.260]   So they're okay because yeah, this whole story confused me and I didn't want to think about it
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:32.340]   I think that yeah by great the
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:35.780]   I don't even think this is an uncharitable way to interpret it
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:39.620]   I think the only interpretation is epic doesn't want to give google
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:43.300]   It's 30% as you know every app on the play store does
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:47.620]   Android does allow you to you know, there's that switch in your security settings
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:52.340]   It turns off the requirement that you download from the play store. It lets you to download from third parties
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:56.660]   uh in recent versions of uh android it switches back on
[01:15:56.660 --> 01:16:01.380]   You switch it off for one download and it switches back on which is a good thing because
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:03.700]   basically epic is
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:10.580]   epics greed is in the face of the security of users because while sideloading from epics is not a bad thing what if
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:15.780]   Some what if some malicious website puts up a fortnight APK
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:18.580]   It says get it here
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:21.140]   And you download it, but it's not for tonight. It's malware
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:24.900]   And this is a bunch of I mean, this is a kids play this game and kid
[01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:27.940]   I mean good lord if you've ever seen like a teenager
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:31.060]   Little school kids computer it is it is not pretty
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:35.140]   Oh, I know I I have a teenager and I have
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:38.180]   And he malwared it many many times
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:44.020]   Um, we actually I think we've kind of got a pretty well locked down now. I haven't had problems in a while
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:45.860]   I just paused your fingers
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:49.620]   It was training it was simply saying michael before you download something
[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:55.140]   You need to check with me really to make sure because some of these sites are getting stuff from we're not safe and he's really good
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:59.620]   He actually now says okay. I want to download five nights at freddy the fan
[01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:05.220]   Fiction version is it okay to get this and i'll go look at the site and make sure it's okay before he that how often is it?
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:07.460]   Is it uh, nowhere?
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:11.140]   You know, it's usually not malware. It's usually adware
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:19.220]   And spyware and stuff like that. It's installs, you know, things like ask toolbar and stuff stuff that you really don't want to
[01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:22.980]   Yes, just because it falls down, but it's not yeah, technically malware
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:30.820]   And yeah, my daughter. I've trained her like back in the minecraft days was a wonderful intro to hey
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:33.860]   Let's talk to me before you download those mods
[01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:40.020]   But that's isn't that the argument for a parent being involved in this and unless it was really important
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:43.700]   Unless it's really unruly then there's other ways around it
[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:50.340]   It's a great thing to do you have the conversation and a good any any normal kid will say well. I want to keep my computer usable
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:53.620]   So they'll ask yeah
[01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:57.060]   Minecraft mods was a big source of problems for michael. Yeah
[01:17:57.060 --> 01:18:00.660]   But it worked right
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:08.260]   It did. I mean, yes and although now whenever any weird box comes up even if it's just like a normal like do you want to load the windows update?
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:14.420]   She she doesn't have windows updates, but it's good for the channell. She's like, I don't mind either
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:19.860]   I just think it's kind of cute well and it helps that you have that rack behind you that you can torture her on
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:23.060]   That is not a torture rack
[01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:25.700]   It's a pilates machine
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:30.740]   This were a different show I would tell you all about the crazy class I took but i'm not going to I have a
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:37.620]   Cadillac reformer at home and you know what I loved you have the springboard so you can jump on it the jumpboard
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:41.940]   Yeah, I love the jumpboard. It's fun so much. I think we talked about that before it's really fun
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.660]   Jeff is like what is happening?
[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:50.500]   Jeff is exactly the person who should be doing pilates by the way. Oh, you should jeff you would love it
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:57.220]   So good for you. It's you can be crazy kinetic like competitive too if you want. It's good for elderly people
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:00.340]   Okay, I wasn't gonna say that
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:04.340]   I include myself in that since we're the same age
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:11.620]   Uh, no, I try because you want to keep balance and flexibility is like starts to go as you get older and this is and you start falling in your head
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:15.300]   That was cruel
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:18.820]   Wow
[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:24.340]   I'm taking my leave because the pain is coming up. Oh, I'm so sorry. God. So you still have a headache from it
[01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:30.420]   No, it's just the pain of the thing. It's been 12 hours. I also banged up my arm and my leg and oh, I'm so sorry
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:32.980]   I'm just a plots. No
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.820]   I'll take a lot of help
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:38.740]   Yeah, I'll find all fine ways to spray in something bloodies
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:45.940]   And this I hear that I hear the native sounds of time. Oh, sorry New York
[01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:55.700]   Google according to a saira pereza tech crunch will lose about 50 million dollars in fees
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:58.660]   with epics move
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:00.260]   in one year
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:02.500]   Let us just note if we may for one moment
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:11.060]   That as you did a moment ago apple does not allow this google does go as a more open system. That's right. That's right
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:14.340]   And google's doing I think a good thing
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:18.180]   Which is when you search for fortnite
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:22.820]   I guess this is good. What do you think it's the first time google's ever done according to tech crunch
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:28.660]   You will get a search result that says fortnite battle royale by epic games is not available on google play
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:32.500]   So don't download what you see. Yeah, this is this is great smart
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:35.140]   Yeah, and then I wonder
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:39.140]   if
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:43.780]   Boy, you know the right thing to do would be to have there have a link to the official download
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:49.220]   I don't know if they'll do that. Well, yeah, I mean, I would I don't know if I would do that either
[01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:51.380]   I'd be like screw you. No, no, no
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:55.860]   I know but the right thing to do would be have that link so that people at least will get it from the official site
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:56.420]   Oh
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:21:01.140]   See see they do the right thing and you say well, it's not enough right. You got to be more right
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:04.660]   There are a company you've got to turn the other cheek and be the person
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:09.540]   Nothing to put that link there and it makes their users more secure cost them 50 million dollars
[01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:13.380]   They already lost the money because it already does it enables the next guy to do the same trick
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:18.820]   Oh, I might encourage people. I guess yeah if other people yeah, what do that? Yeah
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:21.780]   I still think you should think about the users
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:28.900]   Consider the users they are thinking about the users. That's why they put the link in there to explain what's happening
[01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:34.980]   Okay, I mean you can turn the other cheek. You don't have to bake a cake and serve it to them. You know what I'm saying?
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:40.820]   Well, it's a too long for a show title, but very nice. There you go
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:44.420]   um
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:45.780]   so
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:51.380]   I I know jeff is very interested in this story. So I'm not going to frustrate him any longer
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:54.500]   uh campbell brown
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:55.860]   speaking
[01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:59.060]   uh to the australian or ruport mara go and paper in
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:01.620]   oddly enough australia
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:04.500]   uh
[01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.500]   said
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:10.180]   According to the australian mark doesn't care about publishers
[01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:14.020]   But is giving mark doesn't care about publishers
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:17.940]   But it's giving me a lot of leeway and concessions to make these changes
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:21.060]   We will help you revitalize journalism in a few years
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:26.820]   The reverse looks like i'll be holding your hands with your dying business like in a hospice
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:33.940]   We are no longer interested in talking about your traffic or referrals. That is the old world. There's no going back
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:39.780]   So may I yes, I've I've
[01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:43.540]   I've been in the room with campbell, which is basically had similar talks
[01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:45.620]   and
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:49.220]   They were I think they were off the record but fine i'll violate that for the sake of this
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:53.860]   Where uh, and and let's let's first do a little bit of a caveat here
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:57.620]   The australian is owned by mernock mernock goes after the platforms in every possible way
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:01.620]   And when it's hamper says it's be one of those ways
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:06.900]   Yeah, and so when campbell says these things she she does tough love and she tells the
[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:08.820]   Publishers
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:14.420]   You all you want to care about is getting clicks and links those days are over. Sorry. That's just over for everything. We're going for
[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:16.020]   um
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:17.620]   What's it called? Uh
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:23.380]   meaningful engagements between people and we're not going to care about those metrics anymore and you're going to keep trying to
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.460]   To manipulate and that's over
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:28.100]   That's tough love and she'll say
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:33.700]   Because she does I care about journalism. I I I want you to succeed
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:39.540]   Uh, and what I fear is that i'm going to end up sitting there. I presume this is when she said it
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:42.340]   Uh, you know holding your hand in the hospice
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:49.060]   Because if you don't wise up just like richard jingress from google can be very tough on publishers and say get your damn
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:54.100]   Dax together and I as a journalism professor i'm tough on publishers saying get your damn Dax together
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:58.260]   She sometimes says get your damn exact x together. I'm also going to find myself
[01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:00.820]   nursing you in the hospice
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:04.180]   This uh, even my friend j rosen who can be critical of facebook
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:10.260]   He also understands the australian media market and on twitter he was saying he ain't buying this story. Yeah
[01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:13.540]   well
[01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:18.660]   Here's the other shoe from new york magazine. They're a select all page
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:20.820]   seo is back
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:22.660]   thank god
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:25.620]   And I thought this was quite well said by brian felman
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:33.540]   uh referring to this meeting with the australian his response is great that old world absolutely sucked
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:36.500]   And it made the internet ecosystem a discernibly
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:42.900]   Worse place sometime around 2012 the ecology of digital publishing underwent an apical shift
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:46.980]   facebook overtook google as the top traffic source on the web
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:50.180]   And so as a result you got link bait
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:55.380]   You got garbage that was designed to drive traffic from facebook instead of
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:58.660]   What we had before which was search engine optimization?
[01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:03.860]   Formatting web content so it would rank highly within search engines. He submits
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:08.180]   That that's a better way of doing it that this whole link bait thing
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:11.620]   21 pictures that will restore your faith in humanity
[01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:15.220]   Was really all about getting facebook clicks
[01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:19.060]   And really wasn't about providing what people want now he points out
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:26.180]   You know the problem with seo is you know, you're gonna have you're gonna title your article what time is the super bowl
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:29.380]   Because that's what people are gonna search
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:33.940]   But that's not so bad because in fact that's the answer to a question a lot of people are searching for
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:37.380]   What do you think?
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:39.940]   Yeah, I think that the
[01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:43.780]   Clickbait the attention based advertising model corrupt assault
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:48.020]   Yeah, we started it media and and on a scaled market as I said earlier
[01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:50.500]   abundance
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:53.380]   Volume goes up price goes down desperation goes up
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:57.060]   And that's where we are we've got to come up with new models based on
[01:25:57.060 --> 01:26:01.140]   Value yeah and seo is closer to that
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:07.140]   He says the mechanics of seo are clean are clear for more than the mechanics of human emotions
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:12.660]   far better or worse seo forced publishers to focus on providing their readers with relevant information
[01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:16.100]   Social optimization from platforms like facebook
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:21.620]   force publishers to make their content evocative in cindy area and interactive
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:25.540]   Is there another way because like
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:32.660]   Why do you why are you a journalist one service right you do want to give people information
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:37.700]   But two you want to tell stories that matter and that affect either
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:42.260]   Maybe as local maybe you want to draw attention to something like civil forfeiture
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:44.500]   so
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.740]   I would argue
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:53.620]   That we don't have a way the evocative stories those kinds of headlines can drive you to things like
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:59.060]   Babies dying in the hospital because poor hair
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:04.180]   So i'm not i'm not saying that I love listicles believe me, but I think it's a little bit
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:07.860]   It's more subtle and I used to hate doing cheesy headlines
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:10.180]   That's why I was like, oh, I don't want to do another cheesy headline
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:14.420]   But I was like, you know what if I stand behind my story and I really want to people people to read it
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:16.980]   I'm gonna have to go with the dead baby
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:22.100]   And there's more reasons to do link bait than just generating revenue and traffic
[01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:26.820]   It's also yeah, I mean, I so I wrote a piece for the Atlantic arguing that the platforms are not
[01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:30.260]   Publishers and they have put on a rather flowery
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:35.860]   Headline about the internet is wonderful for democracy. It comes out. I said why can't we be blunter
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:40.020]   Can we just be similar say what i'm actually saying and so now it's platforms are not publishers
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:43.220]   Right, it's more provocative and it's also more accurate to what i'm saying
[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:45.620]   Yeah, but you might have more hits the other way
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:48.100]   No, the other one was too flowery. It was boring
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:51.940]   There's also a simple yeah
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:55.140]   There's also the issue that a lot of journalists don't
[01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:57.940]   Write their headlines very well
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:00.100]   So or or don't write the headlines at all
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:05.540]   Well, a lot of bloggers have to write there. Yeah more and more they do
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:07.860]   Yeah, and some people are terrible at it
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:10.820]   What the lead is dead
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:15.940]   Right now with with all of the space with ultimate space people are going on
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:22.900]   And on and on and on before they get the damn point what happened to the nut graph
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:28.340]   Oh, actually let me read the first sentence of your article platforms are not publishers
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:31.460]   Google facebook twitter and the internet are not media
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:36.420]   There's something new we do not yet fully understand well said you ought to teach journalism
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:39.140]   Thank
[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:43.700]   That's the nut plug in here. That's the nut right right there. That's the lead in the nut
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:45.780]   The lead is yeah
[01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:52.500]   And all the rest when I would I mean yeah when I was editing our new writers. I was constantly like let me explain this concept to you
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:54.340]   But you know
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:59.700]   It's actually I think there's an answer to both which is consider the reader
[01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:01.620]   period
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:03.620]   Yes
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:07.860]   Uh, you want to give the reader something they're looking for you want to engage the reader
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:11.780]   With with something, you know that engages them
[01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:17.060]   Consider their time don't compel them read 1500 words to figure out what the hell you're talking about
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:20.340]   Consider the reader serve the reader
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:23.940]   That's you know, it's funny because that was always
[01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:29.220]   What I told people in in broadcasting and in podcasting
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:32.100]   serve your audience
[01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:37.540]   Think about your audience give them what they want what they need and inevitably successful follow
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:40.740]   I don't mean chasing. I don't mean chasing
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:43.540]   Hits that's different
[01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:50.340]   Well, my audience might want naked pictures of Jennifer Lawrence, but I'm not going to give it to them. Well, but what would serve them
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:52.900]   Well
[01:29:52.900 --> 01:29:57.220]   I don't mean pander to their first. I don't mean pander to their lower
[01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:59.540]   Urges
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:05.540]   I mean, what's gonna really serve them fill them give you know, that's why I started a whole degree in social journalism
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:11.940]   So we listen to the community first. We understand their needs. We reflect their needs and then we can figure out what journalism is not that complicated actually
[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:14.020]   No, but we're very about it listening
[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:15.860]   Well
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:22.100]   Humans are because humans listen to themselves first, you know, we're the we're the first customer. What did you say? Huh?
[01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:24.980]   What'd you say you talking to me?
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:32.020]   Why is lead spelled led and not led?
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:37.300]   I think it has to do with the printing machines. Jeff. Yes, you're right. That's true. Ha ha
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:39.860]   I win the journalism surprise
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:41.860]   Nothing would you?
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:43.860]   Nothing. That's the journalism prize
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:45.220]   Nothing
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:50.260]   Is it that's why you don't you put in the things that otherwise wouldn't be in there so you know they're wrong like tk for to come
[01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:53.140]   I knew that oh, so you know they're wrong
[01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:56.100]   So you know they're wrong. I never knew it tk. I knew what to do
[01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:58.100]   I knew to do tk, but I never knew what it meant
[01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:04.180]   It means to come but you own white to come because you spell checker when you're programming and you are creating
[01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:08.500]   A list of things that you need to work on you put three power three bangs bang bang bang
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:13.300]   And then it's easy to search for because it's not uh-huh programming tk might be
[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:16.180]   In fact, but bang bang bangs not
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:22.100]   We'll read is this intentionally misspelled so that well that it's specific to one of those. Yeah, it is
[01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:27.300]   Well, it's not a set stands out because the print the press was made out of lead
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:32.420]   Yeah, but there's there's some hold on now. I got no don't look at that, please
[01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:38.100]   I'm going I'm going crazy now. So I'm I'm really going full gutenberg now. I'm reading
[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:44.660]   About a wonderful book about aldis minutius bound in venice. Oh minutius was the
[01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:49.700]   Was the the greatest artist a book pretty right after gutenberg. We know his name
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:52.180]   You know why we know his name?
[01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:56.020]   Why don't we know his name because page maker which was the very first
[01:31:56.980 --> 01:32:04.020]   uh desktop pro publishing program widely used on mac and tusches with laser radars was from a company called aldis
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:07.140]   And that was named after him. Yeah
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:12.260]   Oh cool. I know and the new word press is called gutenberg
[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:16.260]   Wow. Oh, yeah, I didn't know that
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:19.620]   Yeah
[01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:26.820]   I feel good. Oh, it is a it is a uh deliberate misspelling
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:32.420]   Yeah, that makes oh wait. There's two versions. No, no, there's two versions of the etymology you guys
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:34.980]   Wow
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:36.340]   vd wow
[01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:37.540]   vd
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:40.900]   The leady has been rewritten and the headline changed. It's an all
[01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:44.980]   Alteration of lead lead not led lead
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:49.940]   Well, look at by the way, sorry to say the declining use
[01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:53.140]   over time of the word lead
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:56.420]   Yeah, I know. Yeah, see I told you it's dying stacy
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:33:03.700]   Uh, there you go and maryam webster answers the question. Why do we bury the lead?
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:06.820]   Mm
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:10.500]   Because journalists are wordy and don't know what they want to say you always wear the lead when you
[01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:13.540]   When you don't actually know what you're writing about
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:21.460]   Okay
[01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:25.940]   So did I did I do that conversation stopper? I said so I just went right down a rat hole
[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:27.940]   That's where I was and I was looking at this is well
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:33.460]   How did leo say he was going to react when the show stopped? He doesn't have another change log. I did the change log already. No
[01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:36.020]   Damn it. This is
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:38.340]   This is when we play our ragtime our fox
[01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:44.420]   Yeah, luley armstrong. Honestly, that is definitely karsten make it so
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:50.980]   Except are there are there are there might be some rights issues rice issues. It is 1934. It's post mickey mouse
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:55.140]   Tiger rag
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:34:00.980]   Tiger rag that's what it was. Okay. Well, what other tech news do we have?
[01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:12.100]   I think that would be such a good show open. Why don't you think so john john slinging a jammer be shaking his head no
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:20.900]   Maybe he's worried about you dancing. He says you can't change his name people get used to it over
[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:23.620]   Time our theme is so god awful
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:27.060]   John apparently
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:31.780]   Let me hear the end because we could end the show with it too
[01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:39.540]   Let's stay so you get excited about some awesome
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:42.660]   No, oh, oh, oh
[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:49.780]   All right, that's our theme that's done facebook by buys vid pressos team and tech
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:52.420]   to make video interactive
[01:34:52.420 --> 01:35:00.900]   The press was used actually by local tv stations to put polls up on the screen
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:03.060]   um
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:06.500]   to put interactivity into television shows
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:10.020]   Clients include ktxl. I think that's salt lake
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:15.940]   Univision buzzfeed turner sports nazdak ted nbc and others
[01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:20.580]   Uh, so get ready for polls in facebook video
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:27.220]   This is we're gonna we got a hot war going on because youtube is now offering money
[01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:32.180]   If uh to its youtube stars if they promise
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:38.500]   to promote and use new features including paid memberships and in the enhanced chat and
[01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:42.820]   Put their videos on youtube first and don't mention those other people
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:50.900]   Uh kasey nystat who is a major youtuber with millions of fans
[01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:55.940]   Said if youtube's not scared of twitch they should be now
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:36:01.700]   That's because uh twitch and patreon both offer
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:06.100]   Uh to subscription selling to a fans who want you know
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:09.540]   Selling subscriptions to fans who want early access to programming
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:13.700]   kasey's still on youtube though. He said that back in may, but he's still on youtube
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:17.060]   Use tube is making it easier for creators to sell merch
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:22.180]   I this feels like something they should have announced a vidcon, but it's just coming out now. Yeah, exactly
[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:29.140]   Well, merge the merch stuff. I think that they might have the super chat. They did announce it vidcon. I believe
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:34.340]   Uh, it's a lot of you know twitch has twitch chat turns out to be it's
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:40.340]   It's secret sauce because that's you can be in chat and donate and stuff like that directly into chat
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:43.060]   And it really gives
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:46.260]   It's funny because we've had chat since 1994
[01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:51.460]   During all our live programming and I always knew I didn't have any of those fancy features
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:55.780]   But I always knew that having a live audience be able to give direct feedback to the
[01:36:55.780 --> 01:36:58.420]   content creators was valuable
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:03.780]   YouTube has in the past a 4 at tech tv no on the radio
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:07.940]   Uh radio show is to do a kg on san francisco. I had a live chat room
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:12.260]   Uh the the original moderator of that was a guy who was at the time
[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:13.700]   working
[01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:16.820]   in uh magazines named robert scoble
[01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:19.780]   Really? Yeah
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:26.260]   He was my oh my how things have changed now. He's driving a model three across united states trying to flee
[01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:31.380]   His past his past yes
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:37.380]   Did you see the story about um
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:39.860]   messenger of kids and
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:46.100]   I don't really care about the past fate phrase stuff, but I was surprised that they had had such an increase in downloads
[01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:49.780]   So I thought facebook was discontinuing it
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:53.220]   I guess not
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:38:00.500]   So this this tech registry says according to data from sensor tower messenger kids saw a sizable increase in installs at the beginning of early june
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:04.740]   In just his now past 1.4 million downloads across ios and android
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:08.740]   And it's daily downloads are around three x's they were at the end of may
[01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:16.020]   And now they're making it easier for kids to add their friends by creating these four word past phrases like
[01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:19.060]   Oh and they're there to be the friend you have to know it
[01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:21.780]   Yeah
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:24.740]   Yeah
[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:30.660]   I don't know why I thought that they were that they they admitted that it was a bad idea, but I guess not
[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:34.020]   messenger kids is bigger than ever it sounds like
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:38.340]   Well, I don't know if it's bigger than ever. It's 1.3 million
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:42.340]   But you could be six years old and use it. That's 1.3 million little kids
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:45.060]   Yeah, well in
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:47.780]   They're saying that parents like this because you can
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:54.100]   monitor your kids conversation and control approvals, but I don't know
[01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:58.420]   MIT technology reviews says facebook's app for kids should freak parents out
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:04.100]   I don't like it. Yeah, I mean my daughter does talk on hangouts with her friends
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:07.620]   So it's not that different, but I don't want my kid on facebook
[01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:12.660]   If they don't like I just don't want them to be associated with facebook forever really
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:16.820]   Well, I think it avoid that as long as possible go for it
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:23.780]   Yeah, technically you can of course if you're under 13 you can't sign up for facebook, but uh according to a poll
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:26.660]   By facebook and the national pta
[01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:32.900]   Three out of five american parents said they're under 13 year olds use messaging apps social media or both
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:36.660]   And that's facebook use that as justification to create messenger kids
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:40.820]   Look, they're gonna do it. We should give them a safe space to do it
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:47.380]   Right and I I tend to agree with I mean I had to explain to my daughter that she could call her friend while we were in
[01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:49.460]   Seattle for a month on the phone
[01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:52.580]   She was that
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:54.420]   What's a phone?
[01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:59.620]   Well, you go down to the corner by the bodega. There's a booth there. Here's three quarters
[01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:07.300]   But yeah, she doesn't her friend doesn't have her own cell phone yet. My daughter doesn't even like her cell phone
[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:10.900]   Right. So I don't like to make phone calls. I kind of understand
[01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:13.780]   I get it. I'm just kind of like
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:22.020]   I think back to how many hours as it her age that I spent on the phone talking to my friends doing three way calls with my friends
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:25.860]   You know, just ridiculous ridiculous amounts of time
[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:35.060]   Uh def con and black hat were this past weekend in 11 year old changed the result of florida's presidential vote
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:40.580]   With the florida secretary of states website
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:45.380]   Apparently not too hard to hack my favorite though is rachel tobax video
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:47.940]   Let me see if I can find this
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:48.820]   of
[01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:50.820]   Hacking a voter machine
[01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:54.100]   That is still to used in 18 states
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.740]   Uh
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:58.740]   Here's a here's her tweet
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:04.420]   A def con hacking conference just learned how easy it is to physically gain admin access on a voting machine
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:06.740]   Used in 18 states
[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:14.100]   Uh, this just takes a couple of minutes. So what i'm very concerned for upcoming election because this voting machine is used in 18 different states
[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:17.940]   And it's extremely easy to get admin access on this machine
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:22.900]   So let me show you how quick it is about a little under two minutes. We should point out. This is the machine in the booth
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:28.660]   So she's in a voting booth right now and so anybody in a voting booth, which of course is invisible
[01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:31.940]   You know two people because you're privately voting can do this
[01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:38.100]   To do this bad actor would be to open up this machine by pressing this button right here when it's off
[01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:43.540]   Removing the card reader remove the card reader removing this you don't need any tools to do this
[01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:47.780]   Unplugging this again. You don't need any tools to do
[01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:49.780]   Unplug that
[01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:54.820]   Turning it on all you have to do is pick this lock here with a ballpoint pen
[01:41:54.820 --> 01:42:01.460]   There is a lock but apparently not too hard to unwrap the red button. So she's now rebooted the voting machine
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:04.100]   here
[01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:06.100]   This is what takes the longest by the way
[01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:12.100]   This is a premier election systems voting machine
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:14.100]   and
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:27.060]   You know unfortunately a lot of these machines, I don't know about this particular one don't have it's loading with what they call a secure voting terminal right now paper trails
[01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:38.500]   And when she says bad actor she doesn't mean nicholas kate she means somebody probably russian
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.980]   bad guy
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:46.900]   And here we're going to see a couple of error messages and all you have to do to bypass those error messages is just quick
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:54.660]   Cancel this is the best part and okay cancel and okay and now she's in in the admin settings
[01:42:54.660 --> 01:43:01.220]   You can change votes add votes subtract votes. Oh jeez jeez l'ouise
[01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:06.500]   That was voting village at defcon. They had a bunch of voting machines
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:12.500]   And they let the hackers have at it. What fun there was a cyber attack in california against
[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:17.220]   The secretary of state or the the voting issue
[01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:19.940]   a
[01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:23.620]   Documents reveal successful cyber attack in california congressional race the um
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:30.420]   What's his name dinner ror bacher, you know, rook. Okay. This is political. I apologize, but ror bacher
[01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:36.980]   Is a caveman? I don't understand how he keeps getting elected and the guy basically is a fan
[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:41.300]   of poutin. I mean he's a russian. He's a russian agent. It's like obvious
[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:44.260]   Now I understand how he got elected
[01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:47.140]   Ugh
[01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:49.140]   I'm glad I bought my e-bike
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:52.260]   Last week and if you haven't bought your e-bike yet august 23rd
[01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:55.460]   25% tariffs will take effect
[01:43:55.460 --> 01:44:01.780]   On the motors from china the the boffang motors are very widely used, but there's others i presume
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:04.660]   25 more after august 23rd
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:07.140]   Yeah, there you go. That'll stick it to them
[01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:18.260]   Tell us about the uh 5g home internet launch from verizon stacy
[01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:20.980]   Is this really 5g?
[01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:24.900]   Um, it is it's fixed mobile broadband or yeah fixed
[01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:32.340]   Fixed mobile. Yes fixed wireless. Sorry fixed wireless broadband. That means it's not for mobile phones. It's for your house
[01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:37.700]   Um, it also means that it's not for something that roves around right anything that runs
[01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:44.260]   It's designed to hit something and provide broadband over a wireless connection to something that is stays in one location
[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:46.820]   So stacy can I ask a question first?
[01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:53.380]   Yeah, so i'm presuming this is like a first phase so they can test it out, but eventually 5g will of course be for all mobile things
[01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:57.220]   Yes, this is just a way to yeah to achieve variations of 5g
[01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:02.900]   So 5g can mean a lot of different things. There is a 3g pp standard
[01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:05.940]   That is for mobile phones verizon's going to launch that too
[01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:08.660]   And there is also this
[01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:10.820]   Uh, there is also a standard for fixed
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:15.540]   So there are actually two there are two different technologies at play they're related
[01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:17.620]   They're just two different technologies
[01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:21.460]   And then the fc fcc when they talk about 5g they're actually talking about
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:27.220]   Specific swaths of spectrum. So they're usually talking about I think it's the 24 28 30
[01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:31.780]   something gigahertz any bands
[01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:34.660]   So
[01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:36.660]   Yes with fixed and mobile
[01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:39.300]   So this is uh, this is what's interesting is this is
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:44.100]   The first commercial rollout of the fixed version of this houston
[01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:48.260]   Sacramento, los angeles and indianapolis those are the four launch markets
[01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:50.900]   It'll be later this year
[01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:56.020]   Customers who sign up could choose to receive a free subscription to youtube tv. There's your locals
[01:45:56.020 --> 01:45:58.660]   or an apple
[01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:05.780]   tv 4k device not both so so what's interesting there is that is like a net neutrality violation
[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:10.820]   I know we don't have net neutrality, but it's zero rated right it's zero rating
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:12.740]   um
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:16.180]   And again, it's it's not wireline
[01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:20.420]   So maybe the rules wouldn't have applied because we don't care about wireless
[01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:26.260]   Is much from a net neutrality perspective horizon picking a winner if you were so these playstation view
[01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:29.220]   Lulu or sling tv you might be a little bit
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:36.420]   Or you know Comcast their rival. Oh, yeah. Oh, that'd be interesting if net neutrality
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:42.340]   If non net neutrality is used against Comcast then how now how do you feel?
[01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:45.940]   Yeah, so
[01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:50.740]   Did they show pricing because I was very curious how they were gonna price this? No, I don't see it here
[01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:51.620]   Okay
[01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:57.780]   You'll also get content from the nfl NBA and oh, so here's a real net neutrality violation
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:01.140]   news from verizon's own media network oath
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:03.940]   Oh
[01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:08.660]   Oh, you get tech crunch for free free tech crunch
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:13.540]   Uh horizon will be this this will be the first telecom to launch 5g in the us
[01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:18.980]   And i've often thought that what t mobile and verizon and atnt here talking about when they say 5g
[01:47:19.380 --> 01:47:24.580]   At least in the mobile space. Maybe not in the fixed space isn't really 5g. It's just very fast lte
[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:27.060]   But is it is it um
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:33.460]   Um verizon is actually talking about 5g tmo. I don't know if they are I need to talk to tmo about it. I
[01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:37.940]   That's my brain going. Uh, I think they're doing lte advanced
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:41.540]   We saw this, you know, they did this before with hspa plus
[01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:47.060]   You know, we've seen right all the companies. It's not just t mobile, but they're you know, they always you know, they kind of
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:50.820]   But partly that's not their fault. I mean, what is the definition of 5g?
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:53.540]   What is the definition of lte was a definition of 3g?
[01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:55.940]   All of these are kind of fuzzy and I think intentionally
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:59.060]   lte
[01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:06.580]   Was not fuzzy lte is actually a 3g pp standard. So that's the people in the standard. Okay. There is there is
[01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:12.260]   Leo I have read the standards. That's why oh, that's right. That's why they called it 4g not lte
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:17.060]   Yes, so they used to call it in, you know, broad broad comp. Yes, broad comp used to call
[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:23.940]   Wi-Fi they they were talking about Wi-Fi ac being 5g, right? So there's
[01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:26.100]   There's an end
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:31.140]   um somebody tweeted actually one of my analyst friends tweeted he's like, you know, a lot of people
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:34.900]   Talk about their what they label their Wi-Fi networks like, you know
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:42.180]   Blah blah network 5g and 2.4g and people are going to look at that and they're going to be like, oh, I'm already using 5g
[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:43.620]   but that's really
[01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:49.700]   Talking about what ban you're on but normal people are not going to think that way and why should they Jason hell of all about andrea
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:56.340]   Got the new motorola z3 later this year verizon if you get it from verizon promises a modo mod
[01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:59.860]   Those are the clip-on backs that supports 5g on this phone
[01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:03.140]   Right, so that's interesting
[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:10.900]   That'll support mobile 5g mobile and again. I don't know what you got to go stand in one place
[01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:12.900]   Yeah
[01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:14.900]   uh verizon
[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:16.900]   I don't know what their plans are
[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:22.900]   You know, they said 5g would roll out in those four cities, but it turns out that's fixed right?
[01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:31.140]   So I don't that if it's for home. It's presumably fixed right because with fixed what happens is it's it's kind of like satellite
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:33.620]   Except it's not coming from a satellite. It's coming from a
[01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:39.140]   Tower somewhere within line of sight of a
[01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:45.460]   Device on the roof of your house and that'll come in and yeah and
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:48.740]   um
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:53.540]   I think we have said everything that means i think we've done it
[01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:57.940]   There's one other story. I maybe could have put this in the change log except it's not an official announcement of google
[01:49:57.940 --> 01:50:04.020]   So maybe it will be a change log item later, but according to xda developers
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:07.860]   uh, there is a google project campfire
[01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:10.740]   to get windows 10
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:13.380]   running on chrome books
[01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:20.500]   A sacrilege. Yeah, and we were talking about it on windows weekly paul throtts said well, why would you want to do that?
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:24.340]   Kevin is excited about it you guys. Well, he's he wrote a post
[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:28.500]   He likes the idea of linux on a chrome book, but why would you want windows on a chrome book?
[01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:31.220]   I'll point at buying a chrome book because so you don't have to use windows
[01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:38.580]   I didn't read his post. I'm sorry. I'll uh, I'll ask kevin why it kevin, of course
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:39.540]   is
[01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:45.860]   Kevin toful stacy's co-host on the iot podcast, but he also has a very good chrome book site
[01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:48.820]   um, oh
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:53.460]   Here it comes why windows on chrome book is a great idea. Oh there you go
[01:50:53.460 --> 01:51:00.260]   What is a chrome book central? What's the name of his I can't remember about chrome book stock. I don't know why i'm ever let's see
[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:07.620]   A mental block. Yeah, there's something about about chrome books that I just can't remember for some reason, but I will
[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:12.020]   Couldn't be simpler. I know but I know he had the story google one cloud storage is available for all the day
[01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:15.940]   So I will have to off to read that as well. Nothing but upside he says
[01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:22.340]   We already knew that this was coming when we now have confirmation from xda developers about project campfire
[01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:26.340]   In the xda developers they say it's a terrible idea
[01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:30.340]   Uh, but uh, I couldn't disagree more right off the bat
[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:34.420]   It will boost the number of available chrome books with improved hardware. Well, that's true
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:40.020]   Right because you do need a certain amount of performance and hard and hard drive and memory to run windows
[01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:48.180]   He uh, he also says and I think this is the only use case I can think of it will bring a broader range of software to choose from
[01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:49.780]   I think that
[01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:52.580]   If google is doing this the one excuse would be perhaps
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:58.340]   They want to get people to buy chrome books, but maybe there's just that one application a school has to use for instance
[01:51:58.340 --> 01:52:03.780]   Or a realtor or something that's just only available on windows if you could run that one application
[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:10.580]   On yeah, then the crumble could be maybe for you Skype. How about how about Skype? Yeah?
[01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:13.540]   Yeah, then maybe that much is what it's gonna cost me
[01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:17.140]   It's 80 or 90 bucks not super expensive. Okay
[01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:21.860]   Okay, well, we'll see we'll see we'll watch with interest
[01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:24.740]   I have found how's the um
[01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:27.060]   Skype for uh, Linux
[01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:28.580]   Terrible
[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:32.500]   Terrible, but hey, Skype is not great anymore for anything
[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:34.500]   Yeah
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:40.020]   Yeah, scot if that makes you feeling better Skype's gotten bad everywhere. Thank you. No. Yeah, thank you
[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:42.100]   Microsoft Microsoft
[01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:44.100]   And here's the good news. I have found a
[01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:48.660]   1918 recording of the tiger rag
[01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:54.420]   Which is which is so ancient that it is in fact in public domain
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:53:00.260]   Okay, it ain't no luion strong
[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:03.700]   It's not luion. I kind of like luies better
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:14.500]   This makes it sound like you're bad to hear an old Mickey Mouse steamboat willy cartoon or something
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:17.220]   But we're gonna just do stuff
[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:24.180]   Steamboat willy time on the street falling here's one from 1900. Let's see that can't be right

[01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:52.980]   Okay, since I have been out I have not been able to test many physical devices, but I did read a good book
[01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:57.460]   And I'm gonna share that with you. Yeah, um, this is this apparently came out a while ago
[01:56:57.460 --> 01:57:01.620]   I had no idea. It just my library was like you might enjoy this and I was like, let me try it
[01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:07.940]   This is the feather thief. It is a nonfiction book that I didn't even realize was nonfiction until like
[01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:12.100]   a chapter or two in and it starts out with a
[01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:17.460]   museum robbery of these bird feathers and it goes into the history of like
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:25.940]   This is silly feathers for use of adornment and on hats and the extinction of birds and also in the uh
[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:30.420]   Use of fly fishing. There's a whole thing normally many of these things
[01:57:31.220 --> 01:57:37.300]   I would be like fly fishing. I now know way more about fly fishing and I read the new yorker and they do a lot of fly fishing coverage
[01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:39.620]   but
[01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:42.500]   It's it's a really good book and it's it's
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:47.380]   I'm adding it to my wishlist. It's on audible too, which is great. I need books for our trip
[01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:50.020]   Yeah, so I mean
[01:57:50.020 --> 01:57:55.220]   It's not tech related at all, but it was an entertaining read and now I know a lot more about flies
[01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:58.660]   I am and I love I am fascinated
[01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:02.740]   By these kind of monograms on sink like salt
[01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:07.780]   Right mark. What is this is new one milk is his new one
[01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:13.380]   Yeah, I I'm just fasting and I really it started. I guess with jessica mittford right who would
[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:16.980]   Take a particular area. She wrote the american way of death
[01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:22.500]   And which was blew the lid off of uh, mortuaries and uh undertakers

[01:58:27.860 --> 01:58:31.300]   So this is a this is kind of an interesting uh, I think category
[01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:34.180]   the um, this very specific
[01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:37.300]   She did the bonk, which I really quite
[01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:42.980]   Joy slarys. Yes, and she wrote kind of following and jessica mittford stiff
[01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:47.380]   And which is about human cadavers and gulp
[01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:50.260]   Which is the elementary canal
[01:58:50.260 --> 01:58:55.140]   These are all I love this so i'm gonna read about feathers next yeah, nice
[01:58:55.460 --> 01:59:02.020]   And this is this is kind of more there's a lot of about feathers, but it's also a true crime book if you think of it that
[01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:05.060]   There is an element of mystery. Oh
[01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:11.620]   The feather thief beauty obsession and the natural history heist of the century

[02:01:56.020 --> 02:02:00.820]   Hmm
