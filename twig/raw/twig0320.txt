[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.400]   Wait.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.040]   He's of course a maker and you working NetApp still?
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.840]   Yep, just checking it up.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.840]   I don't know.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.840]   I should always ask.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.840]   Thanks to NetApp for letting me come do this.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.840]   Thank you NetApp.

[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.680]   It's on Floss Weekly this morning.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.680]   Many of our shows.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.680]   Who are you interviewing this morning?
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.800]   This morning we were doing, where's John?
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   I can't remember the name of it.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.640]   It's a Kickstarter rival and they've got some interesting products.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.080]   I'll talk about those too later.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.080]   Cool.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.080]   Pretty cool.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.080]   Cool.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.320]   Also with us from Canada, it's our good friend Matthew Ingram also from fortune.com.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.720]   Good to see you Matthew.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.320]   Welcome back.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.320]   Thanks.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.320]   And get this.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.320]   Yes, Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.160]   But he's not here here.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.680]   He's in, I wish we could do a guessing game, but no one would ever guess where you are.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.920]   Unless they saw that picture over your left shoulder.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.920]   There we go.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.920]   There's the picture.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.440]   But that picture even is not what you think it is.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.280]   Yes, Jeff Jarvis is in Medellin, Colombia.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.480]   Which in, how do they pronounce it?
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.480]   Well, some say Medellin, some say Medellin.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.480]   Medellin.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.800]   And you're there, why?
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:32.880]   I spoke last night at the foundation that honors Gabriel Garcia Marquez as the awards every
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.040]   year for the best in journalism throughout Spanish speaking in the world.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.920]   And so it's people all over the world are here in Medellin.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.480]   And I got to speak about future journalism in my usual song in advance.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.280]   And as you know, on the show, A is Studio de West Pagnole.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.760]   They're those maces.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.760]   Wow, two months.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.760]   And two months.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.360]   And Gordon Pimsler, I'll just say Trebian.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.920]   It gets confusing, you know, too many languages.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.400]   That's good.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.000]   And so I'm picking up about it once every 10 words.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.560]   But it's kind of thrilling to pick up a few words now and make it kind of worthwhile.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.960]   And so I got to keep going with my study.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.000]   There's 150 days total.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.520]   So I've got, um, I need days to go.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.200]   And there's no better way to learn than to be in the country and talking to people.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.160]   And I mean, immersion is really the best way to learn.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.160]   It's so grab it today.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.720]   I was at a, I went to the mall just to get out of here.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.600]   And this guy stopped me and I thought, you know, he's a panhandler or something.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   I have no idea.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   It turns out he was at the event last night.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   Oh, congratulations.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   He's going to bed last night.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   He's full hardly English.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   I speak hardly Spanish.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.680]   And it was, it was, he was a radio executive.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.160]   It was much fun to go back and forth.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.160]   So yeah, this is neat.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.800]   It's thrilling when I can read a headline or a sign and get it.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   But this is a great conference.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:59.880]   Um, uh, hashtag, uh, primiose, primiose, GGM, um, for the Gable Garcia Marquez prize.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.440]   So primiose.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.640]   And, uh, they give the awards tonight and then I fly back on a five o'clock play tomorrow.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.320]   What a fun, uh, what a fun assignment.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.320]   I like that.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.200]   And of course, Marquez is one of my favorite author.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   And I love in the time of color is, is, and a hundred users solitude too, just two of
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   my favorite titles.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.320]   And importantly, he wasn't just a novelist.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.600]   He was a journalist, a major note.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.280]   And that's why he started this foundation.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.120]   Good for him.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.480]   Where was he a journalist?
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.480]   Was it Mexico?
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.680]   Uh, in Columbia and then I think in Venezuela.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.000]   And then I think in Mexico.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   So you're going to have to, uh, help me because, uh, like many of us, I've been watching Narcos,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.200]   which is all about the Medellin drug cartel.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.760]   That's, that's over.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.760]   Right?
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.760]   It's not.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.760]   Yes, it's well over.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.720]   And it's actually an extremely exciting time to be here for a few reasons.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.760]   One is that the government just announced, uh, some real huge steps in the negotiations
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:02.600]   with FARC and peace negotiations after decades and decades of war here, uh, guerrilla war.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.840]   And so it's a, it's a very exciting time that, that they're finally making progress on that.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.080]   And the narco wars here are Medellin and well over.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.040]   Uh, and the city has rebuilt itself phenomenally.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.000]   They've used, they built a metro so that brought the poor people down into the city more.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.560]   The irony of Medellin is the rich people are down in the valley and the poor people have
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.240]   abused the mountain up, um, and surrounded by mountains.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.680]   And it's quite, quite an amazing setting.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.400]   And they've used arts and culture and events like this to really, uh, do an amazing, amazing
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.800]   job of making Medellin a tourist attraction in a safe city and it's really come back.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.040]   And you know, I said stories about, I said a story from El Pais about this too.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.120]   A foundation I work with in New Jersey.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.280]   You know, if you look at cities like Newark and Camden, uh, Medellin is kind of a model.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.760]   You know, don't give up on the city.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.280]   There's a chance, there's this proves there's a chance to really rebuild it.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.280]   How exciting.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.640]   And how much is the internet a part of what's going on there?
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.640]   Are they?
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   Oh.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.640]   Go ahead.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.640]   Hugely.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.760]   And the media businesses, you know, are still trying to hold on to print and there's the same
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.520]   exact debate that's going on just a little bit later than where we are.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.200]   Uh, but of course it's all mobile and mobile phones and I love walking around the streets
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.760]   where they're selling minutes for, you know, a hundred pesos, 150 pesos.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.760]   Just to get online.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:26.720]   Well, uh, were you able to get online yesterday and see the Google announcement?
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.880]   Not only that, but I was afraid that because I was in Columbia, I'd be restricted from
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.040]   buying, but no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.040]   I bought one.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.040]   Bought one.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   What?
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.520]   I got the P, the six P, I got the 64.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.520]   I mean, I, I, I, that's what I got to.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   No, 64.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:50.600]   Now that everybody streams, most content and I think I bought 128 gig iPhone, but that
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.480]   was because of, I was a little worried because of 4K video and the live photos that I might
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.840]   be using an extraordinary amount of data.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.920]   In fact, I am after I put everything that I want, like putting all my music on here
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.400]   is still only 70 gigs.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.520]   So 64, I think that's fine for any sense.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.480]   Did you buy the warranty period or are you holding a phone for such a brief period?
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.480]   I don't imagine.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.480]   I never buy the warranty.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.480]   Although it seems like a pretty good deal.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.640]   Actually, let's talk about what Google announced.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.040]   I'm, I'm going to apologize in advance to Matthew Ingram because I don't think you can
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.600]   buy any of this in Canada.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   No, none of it.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.040]   You can buy it like Ireland and I mean, but not in Canada of all places.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.520]   Crazy.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.680]   So we covered it live.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.560]   You can watch it on our Twit Live specials.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.560]   It was me.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.920]   Gina Trapani was with us.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.920]   Russell Holly.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.920]   It was really a fun couple of hours to spend with those two talking about what Google
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.920]   had announced.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.240]   And I thought, A, Google did a great job.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.440]   It was fast paced.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.680]   It worked well.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.640]   They brought a big number of people up on stage.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.840]   And I think demonstrate, including a lot of women, there's a lot of diversity, but
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:01.320]   I think that it wasn't so much that is just to demonstrate that it's a team.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.600]   Sundar Pichai was on the stage for a minute and then handed it off and everybody else
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.600]   got to talk.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.320]   And I thought that that I liked that.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.880]   It made me feel like Google is a company that is, which is, and this is true of Apple
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.000]   too, it's true of all tech companies, made up of a lot of people.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.920]   And to see more of them, I think is great.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.720]   So Mike Elgin, our news director was there and he came home with swag.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.200]   I can do it.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   I watched.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   It sent me one of those bad ones.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   I appreciate it.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.560]   Well, you guys can fight over it.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.280]   I at least can touch it.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.280]   I can touch it.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.080]   I'm just going to put it out in the middle and just let you guys fight over it.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.360]   I want it so badly.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.400]   So the swag bag is actually quite beautiful.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.520]   It's from a company called Rick Shaw.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.200]   It's a tweed herringbone.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.520]   The waterproof, you just got, you know, sounds like you're doing a fashion show, Leo.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.520]   Yes.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.560]   It's a lovely tweed.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.080]   Fresh bags made daily in San Francisco with the new Google logo, I might point out the
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.200]   new, which is also killing me because all my swag is no out of date.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.600]   Well, they do that.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.200]   So you'll buy new swag.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.000]   And it's full of goodies.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.800]   So what do we get here?
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.240]   And I'll open these in a little bit.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.120]   The Chromecast audio.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.440]   As we talk about them, I'll open them up.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.480]   The new Chromecast itself.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.400]   And then I was really, when I saw this box, I was going, "There's a phone.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.400]   Is there a phone in there?"
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.480]   But no, sorry to say, this is the Huawei Watch.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.880]   Which is still nice though.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.240]   I mean, it's a four or $500 watch.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   Absolutely.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.240]   It's a cheap watch.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.240]   I don't know.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.520]   It's going to say it's probably what our ethics policy will allow in terms of keeping this, Mr.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.080]   Colgan, but I've played with the Huawei Watch.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.840]   We had a review unit as well.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.880]   So let me just open up that because it really isn't a big part of the announcement.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.800]   Although it's one of the prettiest watches, although as Russell-- oh, that's pretty.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:03.560]   As Russell Holly pointed out, everybody but everybody on the Google side on stage was
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.560]   wearing Moto 360s.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.240]   Some old, some new.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   The Huawei--
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.760]   Because they get their choices at Christmas, right?
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.760]   Oh, is that it?
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.760]   Is that why?
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.760]   Maybe that's it.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.200]   I can pick one thing, pick one phone and one note watch or something like that.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.200]   Compare this.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.840]   I'm also wearing-- it's funny because this is the Huawei version of a Melanie's Loop.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.760]   Compare it in size and styling to the Apple Watch.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.160]   I like round, I have to say.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.000]   I'm going to see if we can turn it on.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.920]   I don't think there's a flat tire on this one.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.440]   I think that's one of the things.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.240]   But it's awfully thick.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.280]   I just have to say that's-- to me, that's a little bit discouraging.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.440]   But you know, I see these guys with these wildly expensive show-off watches.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.440]   Yeah, and they're just thick.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.800]   I guess I can't turn it on.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.080]   The other thing that people have said they don't like about this is it's not wireless
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.080]   charging like the Moto.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.000]   It has pogo pins and you have to dock, you know, connect it into it.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.120]   But OLED screen, which is really nice.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.080]   I mean, one of the things I don't like about the Moto 360-- I don't know if there's plastic
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.080]   on here or not.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.080]   I guess not.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:11.260]   I don't like about the Moto 360 is the LCD screen is not quite as nice as the OLED screen
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260]   that the LG and others have.
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.260]   That's interesting.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.640]   Do the other watches have a make her logo come up?
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.840]   That's the first I've seen of that.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.980]   Yeah, me too.
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.800]   But this is now the standard Android Wear boots.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.200]   This takes a while too as I remember.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.880]   I kind of like Android Wear.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:36.460]   Having-- you know, I got the new iPhone and so I, you know, dug the Apple watch out of
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.700]   retirement and put it on and wearing it again reminds me that it's just-- it's hard to
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.800]   use and it isn't particularly more functional than Android Wear.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:50.880]   You can place and receive calls with it, which is about the biggest difference.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.680]   And one thing that it's missed that Android Wear has is missing is the ambient watch mode.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.760]   This isn't even a very good watch because it's off unless you specifically flick it up to
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.840]   save battery life.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.240]   Most of the time it just looks like that.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.600]   It looks like a black junk, which makes it a not very good watch.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.000]   But I think also Apple really didn't figure out the UI.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.660]   I mean, there's two buttons, there's force touches, all these different fiddly bits.
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.460]   Android Wear is considerably simpler.
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.180]   This button doesn't really do anything.
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.100]   By the way, no word is on the kind of on the outside.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.100]   I think it has to be a lot.
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.660]   Because otherwise I dig into your skin because it's so big.
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.060]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.940]   We'll put it in English.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.020]   Oh, now we have to charge it before we can go on.
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.940]   I think it's fairly attractive.
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.300]   The only negative I've heard about this is the charging methodology.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.320]   It's not a big deal.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.320]   Not really.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.280]   We'll get a review of this.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.480]   I think Jason Hal's been reviewing it for you by he has one.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.360]   So we'll get a review on that.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.880]   But that is not even one of Google's announcements.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.680]   They just I think it was just a little spiff.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.000]   They gave the journal.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.080]   What is the policy?
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.920]   Jeff, if you were working for a magazine--
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.400]   I wonder that you wouldn't take it now.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.320]   You shouldn't take anything.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.320]   The policy everywhere I've ever worked is you can't accept anything
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.920]   beyond a cup of coffee.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.920]   Right.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.040]   That's appropriate.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.960]   So what we used to do with review stuff, if they didn't want it back,
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.000]   let's say it was a game or something like that, then at the newspaper
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.720]   we would have a raffle or we donated charity or something like that.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.760]   Yeah, I think that's actually appropriate.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.960]   Oh, it's kind of a demo mode.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.040]   So there's a demo mode.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.080]   So that's kind of cool.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.760]   Yeah, so I think that's what we'll do with this.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.880]   Mike, not me too.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.360]   I think--
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.760]   I actually really like--
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.160]   let's see if it does that thing.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:49.680]   Yeah, it does.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.000]   The new tilted forward thing.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.520]   OK, Google.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.440]   I like the circle shape, I got to say.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.720]   Circle's so much better.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   Yeah, I like circle.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.600]   I think Android Wear has parity with the Apple Watch.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.600]   Can you pay with it?
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.280]   Not with it.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.360]   Of course, you can pay with your phone, but you can't pay with it.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.480]   You're right, that's another feature of Apple Wear.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.880]   Apple, whatever Apple calls it, Apple Watch.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.240]   That's unique to Apple Watch.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.480]   I don't do it that often.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:24.440]   In fact, I'm a little disappointed by the whole pay process.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.280]   In some cases, I still have to sign.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.240]   Just like, wait a minute.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.000]   This is so much more secure.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.520]   You're validating my identity by signing?
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.480]   Right.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.960]   What the hell?
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.320]   You probably don't have that problem in Canada, Matthew.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.600]   But here in the States, in fact, this
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.520]   is the week that chip and sign becomes official.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.000]   Well, we've had chip cards for, geez, two, three years,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.120]   at least.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.680]   It's one of the first things that cards for the US.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.520]   But Matthew, do yours come with pin numbers?
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.840]   Because our stupid cards don't.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.840]   No, they do.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.340]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.720]   We're not chip and pin here.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.640]   So this all came about because Visa and MasterCard finally
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.520]   had it after the target break-in.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.000]   And then they finally said, you know what?
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.360]   You retailers, you're going to have
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.960]   to face your share of the financial cost of this stuff.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.680]   So they decreed that starting Thursday--
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.920]   and they've given everybody a year to do it--
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.160]   that whoever has the worst security pays.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:27.040]   And if the retailer doesn't put in a pin terminal,
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.040]   then they'll be liable for fraud and losses due to fraud.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.280]   So all the-- this is, of course, stimulated Apple Pay,
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:40.640]   Android Pay, Samsung Monday shipped to its version of pay
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.320]   on its existing Samsung phones.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:48.160]   But in the United States, I guess they didn't want to move too fast.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.360]   Ooh, we don't want to scare away users.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.360]   So they don't do pins.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.560]   It's chip and sign.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.520]   That's pretty dumb.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.920]   That's really dumb.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.160]   I let my kids sign.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:16:59.840]   I'm like, go ahead.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.160]   You know, if Lisa just does a thing,
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.040]   she doesn't do a signature.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.920]   I said, Lisa, that's not your signature.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.880]   She says, you don't have to sign it.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.000]   You can put it next.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.840]   No one checks it.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.560]   No one checks it.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.200]   Do you have the tap and pay cards?
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.560]   Do the ones where--
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.000]   I don't think you tap.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.040]   The new terminals, you stick the card
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.240]   in far enough so the chip goes in.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.960]   And by the way, it is a slower process and a swipe.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.000]   Takes a few seconds to read the chip.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.360]   What's going on in there is the chip
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.240]   is actually generating a unique ID, which
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.440]   is then sent to the bank.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.080]   The bank verifies based on who they think you are
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.320]   and the time that--
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.960]   No credit cards, right?
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.880]   Pardon me?
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.560]   That's credit cards, right?
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.320]   Yeah, I don't know how ATM works.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.200]   Those are--
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.880]   Because our ATM cards or debit cards,
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.280]   a lot of them have tap and pay.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.000]   So you don't have to swipe or insert the money.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.440]   No, I don't think we have tap or nothing.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.320]   Unless you're using Android Pay or--
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.720]   Ah, we got something you don't.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.680]   You got lots of things.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.440]   You got Rob Ford.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.440]   You got lots of things we don't have.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.400]   Anyway, let's talk about something more interesting.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.800]   Maybe not more interesting.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.440]   More Upper Po.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.000]   I'm sure Tuesday night, this was covered heavily
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.480]   on all about Android, but new phones.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.960]   Nexus 6P, a 5.7 inch.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.880]   Beautiful from what I've seen aluminum phone made by Huawei.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.920]   This is the premium.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.560]   That's what the P stands for, the premium Nexus.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:38.720]   And it has a Snapdragon 810 and it has a 12 plus megapixel
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.360]   camera with laser focusing and all sorts of super duper
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.480]   features, including, as far as I can tell,
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:51.640]   the largest pixel size on any flagship phone, 1.55 microns,
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.120]   bigger than Apple.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.280]   And that should help in low light.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:59.440]   Does not have optical image stabilization, which surprises
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.480]   me a little bit, but they tried to rationalize that away.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.040]   I said, no, no, you don't need it.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.800]   It's so good.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.880]   Look how nice that looks though.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.600]   Fingerprint reader on the back, the dimple where you find it.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.480]   We don't have a big hub that everybody thought it was going
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.200]   to have.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:13.760]   No.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.720]   And it has a port hole kind of.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.680]   You see that?
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.040]   But it's not too humpy.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:22.680]   Not too humpy.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.800]   It's only a little bit humpy.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.000]   I think the 5 is humpier.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.280]   Yeah, it looks good.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.200]   I think this is probably the nicest looking Nexus device,
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.600]   hands down, that they've ever put out.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.120]   Or not Google.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.440]   That looks bigger than the Android.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.320]   That the manufacturers--
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.600]   It does look big in the hand.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.720]   Although they say very narrow bezels
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.120]   mean it's not a very big phone.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.800]   And Samsung did the same thing with the Note 5.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.040]   This is the Note 5 size.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.240]   And the Note 5 does not feel that big.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.560]   The Apple iPhone is bigger.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.920]   In fact, Google took a little shot at that
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.320]   by showing an iPhone and how big the bezels are.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:58.200]   iPhone has a smaller screen and a bigger form factor.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.760]   Battery life is going to be the big question.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.320]   Now, this thing has a big battery.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.800]   3,450 milliamp hours.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.400]   And--
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.120]   How big is that versus the Nexus 6?
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.120]   You know, the old one?
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.480]   I would bet the Nexus 6 is 3,000 or less.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.520]   But let me look up.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.240]   Yeah, I don't remember.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:13.720]   I think it's the most--
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.920]   General will tell us.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.760]   So typical-- 3,000 is big.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.840]   Note 5 has 3,000.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.800]   I think 3,000.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.200]   OK, somebody's saying the Nexus 6 is 32.20.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.840]   So it's bigger than that.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.040]   It also, because of Marshmallow--
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.880]   and I talked to a number of people,
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.600]   including Russell Holly, who have been using Marshmallow,
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.800]   who say there is significantly better battery life.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.520]   Google claimed 30% battery life from Marshmallow alone.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.400]   That's good.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.800]   So this could be a battery beast.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.160]   And I--
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:40.660]   Wonderful.
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:41.660]   That would be wonderful.
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.380]   It would be wonderful.
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:47.260]   But the manufacturers generally don't put bigger batteries in.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.960]   They design these things to be as small, thin as possible.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.580]   They put the battery in that they think,
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.500]   well, we'll last a certain amount of time.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.160]   They aren't usually generous, overly generous,
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.620]   with batteries, because they want to keep the phones thin
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.120]   and small.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.140]   So it'll be really interesting to see if you can go more than a day.
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.180]   I mean, I know my Nexus 6--
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.300]   why do I call it now?
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:07.800]   Regular?
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.300]   Standard?
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.340]   No letters?
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.300]   The giant thing?
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.580]   Yeah, the Nexus 6--
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.260]   I mean, it goes out the whole day.
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.740]   It goes the whole day.
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.220]   I did not experience that.
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:16.660]   Really?
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.260]   Yeah.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.260]   I never get through the day.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:18.740]   No, maybe.
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:19.980]   I never got to say.
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.460]   I never put up another country searching for--
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:22.960]   Right.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.500]   --titles all the time.
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.340]   That's one reason why it's hard to--
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.860]   dinner time is-- and by the way, no other phone,
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.140]   except the 1 plus 1 from last year,
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.460]   goes past dinner time either.
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.580]   And the way they handle that is with fast charging.
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.220]   I don't know if this is going to have fast charging.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.820]   It's not going to have wireless charging,
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:40.860]   it's a little bit of a disappointment.
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.500]   Although apparently that's because it's a metal casey.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.540]   It would be very difficult to do that.
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.660]   But it will have this giant battery.
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.100]   Type C connector-- I don't know if it's a USB 3.1 connector
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.980]   or 2.0, but it is the Type C physically,
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.100]   as will the other phone, the 5X.
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.820]   I'm glad to hear that.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.980]   The camera sounds comparable to Apple's.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:08.980]   F2, 4K video recording, 240 frames per second, slow-mo,
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.700]   30 frames per second burst mode.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.500]   That's something Apple does.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.420]   Well, it's nice and it's not nice,
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.940]   because if you forget and you hold the button,
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.660]   all of a sudden you've got a lot of images.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.300]   But as Gina Trapani pointed out, it'll
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.860]   be very nice for Google's Auto Awesome.
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:29.260]   You get some of those nice animated GIFs.
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:34.100]   515 pixels per inch on the 5.7-inch quad HD display.
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.540]   It's AMOLED-- that's AMOLED, isn't it?
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.500]   The Nexus 6--
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.140]   I like AMOLED displays.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.620]   The updated 8.10, 3 gigs of RAM, I would like to see 4.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:51.860]   Android Sensor Hub, which is something Motorola debuted
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.940]   in 2013 with its Moto X. Remember,
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.780]   it had a separate co-processor that was--
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:56.860]   Oh, yes.
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.700]   --that's what was always listening.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.540]   Otherwise, you kill the battery by having the main processor
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.100]   fired up.
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.020]   So step down.
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.020]   Apple does it now too.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.100]   They call it their motion processor.
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.180]   So this is going to be eventually industry-wide.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.740]   The whole idea of a slower processor
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:19.380]   that's just dedicated to listening for the Q words,
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.180]   the accelerometer, things like that.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.180]   All the background stuff.
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.580]   Yeah.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.300]   The ambient display.
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.700]   It'll know when you pick up the phone, things like that.
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.580]   Fingerprint reading is a must.
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.300]   It wouldn't buy a phone that didn't have a fingerprint
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.340]   reader at this point.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.540]   It really wouldn't.
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.340]   You don't know yet.
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:37.820]   You will.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:38.980]   OK.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.180]   Once you go that way, it's just you don't never want to stop.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.580]   As long as it's effective and fast, Marshmallow looks good.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.580]   I can't wait to do the-- what is it now to tap, tap me now?
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.100]   Tip, tap me.
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:52.620]   What does it call--
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.340]   Milio, I was just going to say about fingerprints.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.500]   I'm pretty sure unless I'm mistaken
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.980]   that if you have a pin code to unlock your phone,
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.100]   the police cannot force you to unlock it.
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.100]   That's right.
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.100]   But if it's a fingerprint, they can.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.500]   Yeah, I don't know what it is in Canada,
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.380]   but that's true in the States.
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.660]   And the reason is it's something in your head
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.820]   is protected by the Fifth Amendment.
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.700]   But something physical-- and this goes back to hair samples,
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.660]   fingerprints themselves.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.020]   They can compel somebody who's been arrested, not even convicted,
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.620]   but arrested to give up a fingerprint.
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.020]   You can't refuse.
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.460]   Supreme Court has held that.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.780]   So your fingerprint on a phone is considered not protected
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:36.540]   by the Fifth Amendment.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.180]   So that's very important.
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.260]   It's not considered that you're self-incriminating
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.980]   if they just put your finger on there.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.100]   Is that true in Canada as well?
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.620]   That's a good question, actually.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:50.620]   I'm pretty sure we don't have as much protection for those
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.580]   sorts of things.
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:54.900]   I'm pretty sure they can look at whatever they want and take
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.300]   whatever they want out of your phone.
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.260]   They're about as far as you trust them.
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.260]   Both of them out East.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.180]   We're very trusting.
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:04.380]   You know, maybe because of Dudley Dubre.
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.900]   But I always thought Mounties are like really true blue,
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.500]   straight arrow, kind of like eagle scouts.
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.980]   And then when I started going to Canada,
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.780]   I heard so many horror stories.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:20.300]   They're like-- no, God, I don't want to say this out loud.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.020]   Sorry, if you're a Mountie, I love you.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:28.020]   But apparently the RCMP is considered to be kind of rough.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:28.820]   Rough.
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.300]   You mean tough.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.380]   Rough like hell.
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:36.780]   Like-- they don't take no crap.
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.540]   Well, you know, they are the best of the best.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.620]   They're like the Marines, you know?
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.780]   OK.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.220]   I like that, the best of the best.
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.380]   That's good.
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:48.260]   Theoretically.
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.460]   I can never go to Canada again.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.780]   You're going to pull over.
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.020]   Texas Aggie 93 in the chatroom says,
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:57.060]   they're the Queen's cowboys.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.060]   Who?
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.060]   I don't know what that means.
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:06.660]   Order now, and you will get the 6P in November.
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.300]   If you ordered really, really quickly,
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.380]   you might have been able to get it this first October.
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.380]   Huh?
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.020]   Was it the first report that was going to be October?
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.980]   They say it'll ship in October.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:17.460]   Uh-oh.
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.980]   But maybe there was only a dozen of them.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:19.340]   I don't know.
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.980]   Because I ordered it all-- as soon as the store--
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.980]   you know, what we were doing, the event.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.780]   Gina and Russell and I are doing the event.
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.060]   The chatroom-- excuse me, a link.
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.660]   It's not even on the front page of the store.
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.140]   There's a deep link into the store.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:30.620]   I go.
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.460]   I order it November 4th.
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.420]   Wow.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.140]   So I don't know who got it in October.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.180]   I'm like the 15th.
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.380]   What did-- what did Gina order?
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.420]   Did she?
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.860]   Uh, yes, she ordered the 6P.
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.660]   Everybody ordered the 6P.
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.420]   That's the one you want.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.180]   If I don't even know why they make the 5X.
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:45.820]   But we'll get--
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:46.940]   Other countries.
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.660]   Other countries, I think.
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.300]   Maybe one of the things--
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.060]   I think Senator Pichai announced-- 1.4 billion
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:59.140]   monthly active Android devices.
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.180]   1.4 billion.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.700]   Most of those are $25 phones in developing nations.
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.180]   But still--
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.180]   Does that count to a Chromecast?
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.220]   No.
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.420]   No Android devices.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.700]   And I think the Android TV devices can't be a tiny fraction
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:18.020]   of that.
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.500]   It's phones.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.780]   It's amazing.
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.940]   The-- if you purchase a new phone,
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.500]   you get a 90-day free subscription to Google Music.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.860]   Is that the family or just individual?
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:30.580]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.140]   They did announce a family plan for $15 that--
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.180]   I'm really excited about it.
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.020]   Great deal.
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.540]   You needed that because unlike all the other music stores,
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.260]   you couldn't share your password on Google Music
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.340]   because it was your Google account.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.140]   So if I wanted to give my wife, you know, hey,
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.660]   you want to listen to my music, I mean, I couldn't
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.740]   because I'd have to give her my Google credentials.
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.540]   So they needed a family plan.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.940]   I hope they implement it nicely.
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:54.700]   We'll see.
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:55.860]   We don't know yet.
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.460]   You also get a $50 credit to the Google Play Store.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.140]   Presumably, to pay for all the apps
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:04.260]   you'll be giving up when you leave iPhone.
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:04.860]   I don't know.
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.820]   And this is only available in the Google Play Store, right?
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:08.740]   The carriers aren't--
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.660]   In the US Store only, they did say that internationally,
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.420]   they were doing deals with carriers in other stores.
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.620]   But in the US, at least for now, you
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.700]   have to go to storegotgoogle.com.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:26.020]   And as you mentioned, Jeff, they announced a Nexus Protect
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:30.260]   Extended Warranty that is much like the Apple Care Plus.
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:31.700]   It's two years.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.580]   The normal warranty is one year, but it does
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.180]   add accidental damage protection.
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.260]   It's $89 for the 6P.
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.140]   And if you drop it, they'll replace it.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.700]   There's a $79 deductible.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.740]   And you can have up to two incidents a year.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.540]   I mean, in the life of the thing.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.380]   That's not bad.
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.340]   It's very similar to Apple.
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.380]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.660]   Of course, it's rated Apple, $79.
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.460]   Yeah.
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.380]   As soon as my son could attest.
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:58.460]   It's really interesting.
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.340]   I mean, even during this event, it's really clear.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.860]   This is all targeted at Apple.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.940]   They showed the new Google Photos sharing, which
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.300]   looked really great.
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.340]   And the name of the album was Apple Picking.
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:13.340]   Now, of course--
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.500]   Poor choice of words.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.380]   Ostensibly, Apple Tree, Apple Picking.
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:21.140]   But they kept saying Apple Picking, Apple Picking.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.180]   I can't think that was an accident.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.860]   It was just a happy coincidence.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:32.980]   I would be very interested to get this phone.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:38.180]   All it needs for me to go back to Android is all day battery life.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:38.980]   You get all day?
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.420]   I get all day, yeah.
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.940]   Unless I have a runaway app, I recently
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.700]   my app that I use for my business email
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.420]   was suddenly just taking up 30% of my battery, got rid of that,
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.500]   and I'm back to all day.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.060]   I unplug it when I get up in the morning.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.900]   It's 8 o'clock.
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.580]   And then sometimes I'll go all day,
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.020]   and I won't plug it until I go to bed.
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:02.580]   And if I do that, it is down to getting the warning 7% or something.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.020]   But I can make it all day.
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.740]   I think my problem is Twitter.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:07.460]   I don't know that.
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:08.460]   But--
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.420]   Well, you could tell.
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.100]   I mean, you can look at these.
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.100]   Yeah.
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.100]   It's the number one biggest resource hog.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.220]   And I mean every time I repress.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.380]   And I find I'm using-- because the 6 is larger,
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.780]   I find I'm using it a lot more than my iPad.
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.260]   Right.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.940]   Yeah, me too.
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:32.180]   Of course, you could eliminate apps, take all that stuff off.
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.380]   You could turn off GPS.
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:34.980]   You could turn off all this stuff.
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.420]   And you could improve the battery life.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.780]   But I really want to try it with everything that I want to use.
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.060]   I want it to be a full-featured phone and get through the day.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.660]   And you don't want to have to keep fiddling with it.
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.140]   Oh, I'm going to turn the Wi-Fi off.
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.140]   Then, oh, I'm back home.
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.820]   I'm going to turn the Wi-Fi back on.
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:48.820]   I know you can use--
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.540]   Well, more apps are always going to--
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.620]   It's harder about what do things to sleep, right?
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.260]   We want one of the mistakes is I have
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.220]   to leave ways on when I get to the garage.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:56.720]   Right.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.020]   To forget to turn them on.
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:58.540]   Right.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.660]   That'll drain a battery so quickly.
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.660]   They really should have some fix for that.
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:04.700]   I don't know what it would be.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.060]   I mean, Maps doesn't do that.
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.260]   Yeah, I guess Waze is just pinging all the time.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.260]   You know, pinging the network.
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:18.020]   Nexus 5X is the affordable.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.780]   And the X apparently stands for Nexus.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.780]   The X in Nexus.
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.580]   Wasn't there a rumor that they weren't going to do these
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:24.940]   anymore?
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.740]   These Nexus phones, what happened?
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:27.220]   Mm-hmm.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.060]   Yeah, I read that.
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:31.460]   That was going to be with Silver.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.660]   They were just not going to do phones anymore.
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:34.260]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.620]   I'm glad they are.
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.540]   Well, it's interesting because I think what they finally
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.220]   said is, oh, screw the other guys.
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.020]   We're just going to--
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.780]   because this is-- you know, you could say--
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.540]   you could make the case that the 6 was a developer--
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.700]   the 6-- your 6, the last year's 6,
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.860]   was a little expensive for a developer phone.
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.060]   But it was-- but really was just aimed at developers
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.300]   and not really aimed at taking any segment of the market
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:56.380]   because it's so big.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:01.900]   And it just-- it wasn't that compelling of a phone.
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.740]   These phones are compelling, I feel like.
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.660]   They compete right dead against--
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.220]   you know, Samsungs and the HTCs,
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.740]   maybe better in every respect.
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.700]   So the 5X will be a little bit less
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.060]   processor, the 808, which is actually--
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.340]   I have 808 on a number of phones.
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.740]   It's fine.
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:23.820]   1080p display, not the quad HD.
[00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.460]   Same exact camera, though.
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.780]   I think that's really interesting.
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.100]   No compromise on the camera.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:29.820]   Well, of course, you're saying it's
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.140]   coming from two different manufacturers.
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.540]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:36.580]   It's a Sony camera in there.
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:37.980]   And the USB-C charging--
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.540]   fingerprint sensor on the back.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.580]   Google, I think, is saying that's a requirement now.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.580]   I really feel like--
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.700]   not for all phones, not for a $25 phone,
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.020]   but for the US market, I think the fingerprint reader,
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:54.580]   especially--
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.940]   Are they going to require the extra antennas for Google 5?
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.020]   Yes, it will be Google 5 compatible.
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:01.460]   No, no, no.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.540]   Will they require that for other manufacturers?
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.220]   Oh.
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.940]   I don't know.
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:09.980]   That's an interesting question.
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:14.300]   What color did you get by the way of the P graphite?
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:14.980]   So did I.
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.020]   Black is black.
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.340]   Man of taste.
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:23.620]   That turquoise 5x is a little weird.
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:27.140]   Yeah, it looks like that mint--
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:27.940]   Kickstarter phone.
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.220]   I can remember the name of it.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.460]   Looks like several refrigerators
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.140]   that I got rid of 30 years ago.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.420]   It's refreshing.
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.940]   Now on tap, that's the thing I want.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.340]   What do you think about the back?
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.220]   The back, the back, the back, the placement of the figure,
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:41.700]   per thing.
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.140]   I like it.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.140]   I think that's going to work.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.180]   I'm convinced.
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:51.820]   So Samsung and Apple and OnePlus all put it on the home button.
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.060]   And I don't think that's good.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.420]   I think that that's double-- that's
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.940]   overloading the function of the home button in a way
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.260]   that I don't want to do that.
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.740]   For instance, I'll give you an example.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.620]   It's, by the way, this is the iPhone 6S Plus.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.180]   It's so fast now that you can't turn on the phone.
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.020]   If you wanted to see what your notifications were
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.780]   or what time it is, you want to turn on the phone
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:08.780]   with the home button.
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.580]   It just unlocks it instantly.
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.860]   So you can't do that.
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.260]   It's better to have it separate.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.660]   Now there is a phone, the new Sony's,
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.740]   when they come out, the experience that will have
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.380]   the fingerprint reader on the on/off switch.
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.260]   That sounds pretty sensible.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.620]   But you do hold the phone.
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.860]   I mean, I don't think it's--
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:24.940]   they've always had that dimple.
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.780]   Motorola has always put that dimple on the back.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.700]   And you do hold the phone that way.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.700]   I think that's not going to be hard to get used to.
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:33.300]   We shall see.
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.540]   So I interrupted you.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.860]   The thing you really can't wait for is the--
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:37.700]   Now what's that?
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.660]   Now what's that?
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.820]   Now what's that?
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.140]   That's where you're in an app.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:43.180]   The app has to be now aware.
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:46.860]   And you can get now to help you out in some ways with the app.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.580]   And that's a dandy Marshmallow phone.
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:49.060]   Yes.
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:49.660]   Yes.
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:52.380]   That's Marshmallow.
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:55.420]   That's Marshmallow.
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.340]   That would be handy.
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.180]   Yeah.
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.980]   Yeah.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.340]   Double tap the power button to activate the camera like that.
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:10.860]   They're going to have in the XA 2700 milliamp hour battery,
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.900]   which is probably comparable to the 3450,
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.300]   given that you only have a 1080p screen.
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.980]   Two gigs of memory.
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:18.620]   Not three.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:20.340]   I think more memory makes a big difference.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:24.660]   The Note 5 with exactly the same touch was crapware,
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.700]   as the S6 does handles it much better.
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.740]   The S6 has it takes all the time.
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.060]   It only has three gigs of RAM.
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.980]   I think putting four is a good idea.
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.260]   But Google, maybe they know better.
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:38.100]   16 giga-- by the way, the Nexus 5X
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.500]   has different memory storage configurations, 16 and 32.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:51.340]   So the 16 starts at $379, compared with the 32.6P at $499.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:52.620]   These are awfully close.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.900]   I don't feel like one is a low-cost phone and one isn't.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.900]   No.
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.500]   Some people just like smaller phones.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:01.580]   It could be just the size.
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.500]   Yeah, this is a 5.2.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.620]   That's what I'm saying before the--
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.580]   before the show got started, I was saying that my wife prefers
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:08.300]   a smaller phone.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.700]   She doesn't want the 6-inch phone.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.860]   Close my family.
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.100]   So I think that's why they're still doing it.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.980]   People still want a smaller phone.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.580]   And they want to capture that segment of the population
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.660]   that wants a smaller phone.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.860]   But you're right, when you look at the price
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.900]   and the features of the phone, you
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.100]   would go for the 6.
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.300]   If you're just looking for features,
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.500]   and you don't care necessarily about a smaller phone.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.540]   It's not that big either.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:34.020]   It's not as big as your 6.5.7 inches.
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.580]   16 to 32 gig memory configurations.
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.540]   It comes in carbon, vanilla--
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.460]   I don't know, what do they call the white--
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:47.300]   quartz and minty fresh ice.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.420]   They also announced this is going to be interesting.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:51.500]   New Chromecast.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.660]   I don't think the new Chromecast are particularly different.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.740]   They did announce now that they'll
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.100]   have broader support for Chromecast.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.660]   Still no Amazon streaming.
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.260]   That may never happen.
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.700]   But Spotify support.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:05.700]   Spotify.
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.460]   Love that.
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.220]   Let me open it up.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.100]   A little unboxing here.
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:13.220]   This is a lemon yellow Chromecast.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:16.780]   They did add Showtime, by the way,
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.700]   as one of the Chromecastists.
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.260]   So they now Chromecast Showtime, which is good.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.260]   As well as Netflix, of course, in Hulu and Pandora, HBO,
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:30.740]   Go, YouTube, CBS, iHeart, radio, Google Play music.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.740]   I think I get three of those.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.740]   I ordered four.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:36.740]   I ordered four.
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.100]   No, I only ordered two of these.
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.740]   Actually, I ordered four of the other one.
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:40.740]   So here's what it looks like.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.740]   No, I got three of those services.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.740]   All three of those services.
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.740]   Yeah, so what they've done in--
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:46.740]   What a bit.
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.740]   The old Chromecast had the HDMI port right in there.
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:50.740]   And so you would jam it in there.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.740]   But if you didn't have room, they did have a little extender USB
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:54.740]   thing.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.740]   And especially if you're sticking it behind an AV receiver,
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:57.740]   that was my hand.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:00.240]   Yeah, they always shipped it with a little extra dong
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.240]   or an extender.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.240]   You could put it in there.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.240]   It makes sense.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.240]   Someone did a cost-benefit analysis on this and said,
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.240]   "You know what?
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.240]   If we just make this thing flexible from the Git guy,
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.240]   we'll be all set."
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.240]   They ship it now with a power adapter, which they didn't use to,
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.240]   but they always have the USB cable.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.240]   So you still need to external power.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:21.240]   And that's just really because the MHC HDMI that powers is so rarely
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.240]   found anywhere.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.240]   They can't count on you getting power from the HDMI port.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.240]   So better Wi-Fi.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:32.240]   And in fact, being forming Wi-Fi, which is interesting,
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:37.240]   the antennas will tune toward your Wi-Fi access point.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.240]   At least that's what they said.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.240]   Maybe that's why it's bigger.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.240]   Yeah, bigger antenna.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.240]   802.11.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.240]   So what do you see?
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.240]   Differently with the new Google router.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.240]   It probably has some on-hub features.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.240]   They didn't mention that.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.240]   They didn't mention the router at all.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:58.240]   Still 35 bucks.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.240]   Do you guys have trouble with Wi-Fi and Chromecast?
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.240]   No.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.240]   Yes.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.240]   I have.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.240]   You do.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.240]   This is also a 5 gigahertz.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   I don't know if it's dual band or just 5 gigahertz,
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:13.240]   but it will at least do 5 gigahertz, which is usually better
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.240]   if you have Wi-Fi or some of these things.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:20.240]   Mine sometimes forgets the network in the middle of streaming.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.240]   That's terrible.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:25.240]   Or it has problems connecting to it even though I'm using the
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.240]   password, the correct password.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.240]   I sometimes have to reboot the router.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.240]   So that could be my sort of janky network setup.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:37.240]   Mine has problems with the, I've got a, in the makerspace,
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:42.240]   actually, we've got a Chromecast router for business.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.240]   And for whatever reason, it won't connect to that router.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   So I have to have a second router that's attached to the main
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.240]   router that it connects to.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:52.240]   It's a known bug, but yeah.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.240]   Do we know what everybody has crappy Wi-Fi?
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.240]   Don't blame your sets.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.240]   That's true.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.240]   That's true.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.240]   Has issues of some sort or other.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.240]   Do we know what the new Chromecast app is coming up?
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.240]   I would say soon, because this is already arriving at people's
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.240]   houses in a Chromecast.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.240]   So I would say very soon.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:14.240]   And I am, you know, up to now the Chromecast app only did one thing.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.240]   You used it to configure a Chromecast and then you were done.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.240]   You never used it again.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.240]   Now it actually is a discovery tool.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:25.240]   It shows all the different apps that you have, what you can watch
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.240]   about those apps.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.240]   So it lasted about three weeks.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.240]   I think I love Chromecast.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.240]   I do too.
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.240]   I do too.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.240]   It works great.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.240]   Sometimes people complain because they have to use their smartphone
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.240]   as the remote and they have to fire up.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.240]   I like doing that.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.240]   I prefer that.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.240]   I find the interface on the smartphone.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.240]   If I'm going to search for a movie on Netflix, which is easier,
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:47.240]   doing it with a remote control on your TV or on your phone.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.240]   Plus it makes this so much cheaper.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.240]   35 bucks.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:58.240]   See, I've got, since I can't get Hulu and our Netflix is crap and
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.240]   a bunch of other stuff that I won't go into.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:06.240]   I've got a lot of stuff that I stream and movies and content
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.240]   through Plex.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.240]   And so Plex has Chromecast support built in.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.240]   So I've got a Plex server.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.240]   I just stream it through the Chromecast, like through my phone
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.240]   to the Chromecast works great.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:20.240]   Yeah, there's so many good uses for the Chromecast.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.240]   And now Chromecast audio.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.240]   And if I were Sonos, I'd be worried.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.240]   I'm interested in that.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.240]   So right now you can get Sonos.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:35.240]   They just announced an updated Play Five speaker with better audio.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.240]   But most people the way they buy Sonos is they buy the speaker.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.240]   It uses the Wi-Fi to configure its own mesh network,
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:46.240]   usually for sharing music, so that the party mode is flawless on Sonos.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.240]   It means that there's no echo, no latency.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.240]   Everything's in the sync up, no matter how many Sonos speakers you have.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.240]   But it's really, really pricey.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:57.240]   There is also a Sonos Connect that's somewhat like this new Chromecast audio.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:02.240]   You can use it to connect your existing speakers to your Sonos network.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.240]   And I like that.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:09.240]   But now Google is moving into this business with the Chromecast audio.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:13.240]   This is an audio-only version of Chromecast.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:17.240]   Similar form factor, a little smaller, and yeah, they pointed out it has grooves.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.240]   Like a little vinyl record.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.240]   It's a nice touch.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.240]   Yeah, it is.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.240]   There is a button on it.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.240]   There must be a pairing button.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.240]   That's interesting.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:32.240]   It comes with an analog cable, but they did say, and I don't see where it is,
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:36.240]   that it also supports, didn't they say it supports optical and RCA?
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.240]   Where?
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.240]   Maybe there's something in here.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:41.240]   Maybe there's an adapter.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.240]   Hmm.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.240]   Hmm.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.240]   Maybe there's a aftermarket adapter.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.240]   I don't know.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.240]   Still needs power.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:55.240]   So, you know, but the idea is now you can do audio into any speaker.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:02.240]   So if you have a standalone powered speaker or a stereo system, you can use this to stream audio to it.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:06.240]   I guess a lot of people now have powered speakers.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.240]   Computer speakers are powered speakers.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:16.240]   I was pretty close to getting a Sonos or at least one or two, and that's going to be like 600 bucks.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.240]   Right.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:20.240]   Whereas I could just get one of those or two of those.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   These are 35 bucks also.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.240]   2.4 and 5 GHz Wi-Fi.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:30.240]   Also the adaptive antenna system.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.240]   Wireless control from your home, high fidelity stream.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.240]   We'll have to see what the fidelity is on these.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.240]   That may not be good.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.240]   I don't know.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:45.240]   And they say it says on the box, it says optical and RCA as well as mini jack, but I don't know how.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.240]   How you do that?
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.240]   It just has the eighth inch.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.240]   So it's got to be some sort of adapter.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.240]   Mm-hmm.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   But it doesn't come in the box.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.240]   But it won't sink though.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.240]   This won't sink your audio across your whole house.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.240]   They said it would be coming soon.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.240]   Oh.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.240]   So it doesn't have the box.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.240]   It doesn't have the box.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.240]   Yeah, but you don't want to do that in software.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.240]   So they say they're going to have a firmware update that will support that.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.240]   That's the secret sauce for Sonos.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.240]   People don't really understand the biggest thing.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.240]   You could do exactly as you say.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.240]   You could, you know, there's lots of ways to have speakers all play the same music in the house.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.240]   Right.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.240]   But getting them synced is very difficult.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.240]   At the same time, very difficult.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.240]   Very difficult.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.240]   And then it's really not pleasant.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.240]   There's some phasing and echo.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.240]   You can do it with radio.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.240]   I've looked at this for the past.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.240]   Since 2006, I started looking at songs.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.240]   Trying to figure out how they do this.
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.240]   And it is not easy.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.240]   It is not easy.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:38.240]   The easiest way to do it is to set radio, cook radios up to all the speakers that you want
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.240]   and broadcast your own radio station with your own music.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.240]   Because that's real time.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.240]   You can do that.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.240]   But then it's still the reception is kind of crappy.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.240]   It's not high fidelity.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:51.240]   And I've got some little 2.4 gigahertz transceivers I'm playing with to see if I can get this to work.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:55.240]   But if they can make this sync audio on these little things, they're going to sell.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.240]   That would be huge.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.240]   They're going to sell a crap ton of these little devices.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:03.240]   If they can sync music to different speakers in different parts of the house at the same
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.240]   time.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:08.760]   Do you guys think that lots of people have powered speakers?
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.920]   I mean, that's a common thing.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.760]   It's certainly common in most people I know.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.760]   All right.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:15.960]   Plus it has an advantage over Sonos.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.720]   You can determine how good you want your speakers to be.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.600]   And for instance, I got four of these.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.600]   But two of them are going to go on.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.120]   I have two stereo systems.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.960]   They're going to go in the back, I'm hoping via optical, although I don't know how.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.840]   Maybe there's a USB adapter or something.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:35.760]   But they're going to go in the back.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.880]   And that will be awesome.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:43.440]   Because if this is the big question mark, where's the music coming from?
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.920]   Is it coming from your phone?
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.880]   Or is this like the video Chromecast where it makes its own connection?
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.880]   Right.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.400]   Because if it's coming from the phone, that's not going to be good.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:56.720]   But I would guess this is making its own connection, which means this could be very
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:57.720]   high quality.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:05.000]   Because from the Wi-Fi, once you do the A to D conversion or if using an optical cable,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.800]   you don't do any conversion in the D to A. So this could be very high fidelity depending
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.120]   on what you're streaming from.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.360]   So the chat room says the 3 millimeter I would also have.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.960]   You need to buy a cable.
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.720]   I think that's right.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.720]   I think that's what it is.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:27.440]   I guess you could also buy a RCA adapter.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.440]   Here we go.
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.440]   Thank you, Virgil, in the chat room.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.840]   He's got a link to the Google page.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.640]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:38.080]   Because you can get optical 3.5 millimeter optical cables.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:40.280]   Here's compatible cables and plugs.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:43.400]   That's the one that comes with the analog cable.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:48.080]   And then there's a RCA adapter not included, but you could buy in a TOS link adapter.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:54.120]   I have, I think, one of these that's a 3.5 millimeter TOS link.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:58.920]   It's mini TOS link.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:59.920]   That would be the way to do it.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:04.400]   That's going to be cool when we get that in a couple of years.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.640]   Oh, Canada.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.640]   Oh.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:15.800]   Now, did this come out of the Chromecast team or did it come out of the Nexus Q team?
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.240]   That's what I want to know.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.840]   We may never know the answer to that question.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.840]   Maybe it's old Qs.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:23.840]   They took them apart.
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:24.840]   Yeah, they took them apart.
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:25.840]   Just took the essential components out.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.880]   Who means that big ball?
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.800]   Yeah, I don't need new Chromecast.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:34.400]   I don't see a huge difference in the Chromecast video, but I bought a bunch of, like, four
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.400]   Chromecast audios.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.240]   I feel like that is very exciting.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.240]   And I am a, I'm all in on Sonos.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.520]   I don't want to count how many Sonos speakers I have, because then I'll start thinking about
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.160]   how much I've spent.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.160]   They're really expert.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.160]   They really add up.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:52.320]   But the way you do it and the way they get you is you do it one room at a time.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.120]   And before you know it, you spend five years and three hours.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.120]   They're great.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.120]   I mean, they are great.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.120]   And I love my Sonos.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:04.320]   You support for just about every kind of streaming audio thing you can imagine.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.960]   And let's, we'll say it again as soon as they get some sort of, as soon as they get Google
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:11.240]   Now on this stuff, that's when it's going to take off.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:14.520]   I guess it sort of is because Google Now is in your phone.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.520]   So you could do use your phone.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.520]   And you can call out your phone and say, that would be cool.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:24.240]   Pull out your phone and say, okay, Google, play Rolling Stones in the living room.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.800]   And it just starts playing in the living room.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.800]   Out of here.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:27.800]   That would be cool.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.800]   Right.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:29.800]   That couldn't be that hard.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.240]   No, it wouldn't be hard at all.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.240]   No.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:36.640]   I say that not knowing anything about how that works.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.640]   It's magic.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.640]   I mean, how hard could it be?
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.200]   Logic is already there, right?
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:45.160]   I mean, yeah, of course it's just adding that last little bit of logic in the living room
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.160]   so that it understands.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.360]   Oh, yeah, I know I'm connected to the living room.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:49.560]   I know what that means.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.320]   Audio, whatever it's called.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:56.680]   Chromecast audio and then play there.
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:57.960]   So what do we think?
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.640]   Pretty good announcement for Google.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.680]   Some good stuff.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.360]   Very good stuff.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.360]   There's war.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.080]   But wait, wait, wait.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.960]   In fact, the biggest story is yet to come, but we're going to take a break and talk about
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.560]   that.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.400]   The one more thing.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:18.640]   I feel bad for Google because there was absolutely nothing that we didn't already know, right?
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.640]   Right.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:21.640]   Was that on purpose?
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:22.640]   No.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:28.400]   If you think about the bang that Apple gets from the secrecy versus the kind of wet fire
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.680]   cracker that the Google announcement was.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.400]   Google has partners.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.400]   Partners.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.600]   And they don't have the, I think they don't have the DNA for like really keeping some secret.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   No.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.240]   They don't cut people off either.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.240]   Right.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:46.640]   You're not going to get fired at Google for what maybe you will.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:47.640]   Maybe you will.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.640]   Apple will cut you off.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:49.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.640]   They know that you blabbed.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.920]   You will never get anything from Apple.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:54.920]   I didn't blab.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:55.920]   That's not why I get nothing from Apple.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.240]   I just want you to know.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:02.680]   I don't do NDAs or any of that stuff just because I know I would blab because I have
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:05.080]   no, I don't remember anything.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.080]   Did I tell them I wouldn't say that?
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.240]   I don't remember that.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:13.240]   I did actually once many years ago, breaking NDA by accident.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.520]   I felt terrible about it.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:18.280]   I was only by a day, but I felt terrible about it.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:22.320]   And that was the last time I signed an NDA because I just don't have the brain cells to
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.960]   remember what I know and don't know.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.240]   It's like lying.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.880]   You know, it's like, oh, I don't know that.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.360]   Our show today brought you by Blue Apron.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:37.920]   Really glad to have Matthew Ingram here, Aaron Newcomb, Jeff Jarvis from Medellin, where he's
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.000]   making a little drug run for us.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   Little tip.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Don't swallow those balloons.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.280]   Just kidding.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.080]   Just kidding.
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.400]   Jeff the Mule Jarvis.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:52.080]   You can't go to Canada or Columbia now or I can't go anywhere.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:55.360]   I can't go to Apple on any either.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.360]   It's just a, I'm joking.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:59.960]   It's comedy.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.880]   Our show today, by the way, Jeff wasn't sitting there.
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:03.320]   So don't tell them what I said.
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:05.080]   Our show today brought to you by Blue Apron.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:10.840]   Blue Apron will send you all the ingredients to cook fresh, yummy meals right in your home.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.720]   You know, I think we all work pretty hard.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.320]   We get to the end of the day.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.840]   The last thing you want to do is go to the grocery store and pick up the ingredients
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:17.840]   to make a great meal.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:22.240]   If you go to the grocery store, it's hot dogs, buns, and a pack of frozen french fries most
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.240]   of the time.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:31.200]   But wouldn't it be nice to make a lovely meal for your loved one or ones Blue Apron?
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.760]   When you get home, you got the Blue Apron box sitting right there.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.360]   Fresh, delicious ingredients.
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:41.000]   This is Jason Howell making something so amazing with his Blue Apron.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.920]   What's neat is all the ingredients are perfectly proportioned.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:44.920]   There's no waste.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.000]   So you see those spices?
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   That's the packet.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.600]   You use it up.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:51.880]   You get, you know, just what you need and nothing more.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:54.160]   The produce is fresh from local producers.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.480]   The meat and fish are always fresh, never frozen.
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.880]   It's the kind of stuff you'd buy if you went out to buy it.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:02.600]   And then you get this great recipe card that explains how to make it.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.200]   And they're unusual recipes.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.520]   That's what's fun about it.
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:07.920]   You're learning new techniques.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:14.120]   In fact, they even have free videos on the website you can visit and learn a little more.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:18.320]   I've gotten such great cooking ideas, found new ingredients.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:24.120]   And my confidence level has increased thanks to Blue Apron for less than 10 bucks a meal.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:27.240]   By the way, they have a family plan too where they'll give you a kid-friendly ingredient
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:31.640]   so the whole family can eat well and have fun learning to cook.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:37.400]   Man, if you could give one thing to your kids, it'd probably be a love for cooking and great
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:38.400]   food.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.800]   Each balanced meal is five to 700 calories per serving.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:42.800]   Very yummy.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.800]   Look at that.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:44.800]   Oh man.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.160]   Jason made that.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.320]   Cooking takes about half an hour, although I'm a little slower, but that's fine.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:53.240]   You know, you basically can move as fast or slow as you want.
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.040]   Because it's your kitchen now.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.040]   Shipping is free.
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:57.040]   And the menus are always new.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:58.280]   You won't get the same meal twice, which is nice.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.840]   No repetition.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:04.440]   Although once you learn how to cook, you know, crispy cage and catfish with dirty rice and
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:08.400]   spicy remelade, you will know how to do it next time.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.480]   And then you're ready.
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:10.480]   You feel confident.
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:14.000]   Oh, look at that.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:20.400]   Thai chicken meatballs, crispy tofu and euchoy red curry with jasmine rice, Thai basil and
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:21.640]   cashews.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:23.600]   The Asian stuff is great.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.520]   The flavors just perfuse the house.
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:30.680]   Your mouth is watering, people come in and they're so impressed.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:31.680]   You made that?
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.960]   Yes, I did.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:34.960]   Check out this week's menu.

[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:51.000]   You are going to get marshmallow by the way on that Nexus 6 effect.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.440]   All the late model Nexus is we'll get it next week.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:55.440]   Yep.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.800]   The thing that they fix, the Android pay bug.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:59.800]   It's not a bug.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   It's not a bug.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.960]   I shouldn't say that.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.360]   There's an issue with Android pay.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:07.800]   If you're rooted, if you rooted your phone, then it's considered a security risk.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:11.040]   And when they go through and do all their checks, they say, "Nope, sorry.
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.040]   You can't use the Samsung."
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:13.040]   Samsung does that too.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:17.800]   If you have rooted a Samsung device, you can't use Nox, but that makes sense because you've
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.800]   now made it insecure.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.240]   You've made it insecure, but you know what?
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.480]   I'm willing to take that risk.
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:22.880]   I feel I should be able to do that.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:23.880]   You know what?
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:24.880]   They're never going to do that.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:25.880]   It's not a bug.
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:26.880]   They're not going to fix that.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:27.880]   Man, we'll see.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:28.880]   I promise.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.880]   I promise.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:30.880]   It'll be a workaround.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:34.360]   They may not fix it, but I'll run it because they did that with Google Wallet too when I
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:35.360]   got around it.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.920]   They also do it with Netflix and stuff so that you can't steal movies.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:41.640]   I'd be surprised.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:42.640]   It's not Google.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:43.640]   It's the credit card happening.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.640]   Right.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.200]   And like I said, it's not a bug.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.200]   It's a feature.
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.200]   And it is a security feature.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.360]   But it just pains me because I actually do love to use the Tapp and Pay on my phone.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.360]   I can't right now.
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:55:00.680]   But as soon as you root your phone, you have broken the security model and they can't trust
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:01.680]   it anymore.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:05.320]   Especially because now with Android Pay, it runs all the time as long as your phone is
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.320]   unlocked.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:07.320]   Oh, interesting.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:10.160]   Which is different than Google Wallet, which only so when I used to go up to McDonald's
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:14.920]   and scan on the little thing, I would put my pin in then.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.360]   So Google Wallet would come to the forefront of the phone and I would put my pin in.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:21.160]   Now it's tied to the security of your phone.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:24.160]   So it's always, whenever your phone is unlocked, it's always available.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:28.000]   And so the security model has changed.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   I don't know.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.960]   I kind of wish there was at least an option to go back to that Google Wallet model and
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.440]   be able to use it on my rooted phone.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.440]   But we'll see.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:40.920]   I would be shocked if they did something, anything sanctioned to make that work.
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.360]   I just can't imagine.
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:46.000]   So let's talk about the Pixel C again.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.480]   This one rumored, but the rumor broke just before, you know, the day before the event.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.440]   So we didn't have time to really talk about it.
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:54.760]   You sound excited, Jeff.
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:55.760]   Well, you know me.
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:59.160]   I'll go nuts for any of this stuff.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:03.160]   And I'm speaking to you right now, of course, from my Chromebook Pixel.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:07.800]   So a Pixel C, it just has a Pavolavian response from me.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:09.800]   I don't know what I'm going to feel.
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.160]   The problem is it's a 10-inch tablet.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:13.080]   I hate tablets that big.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:16.720]   Unless it really is basically just a laptop, in which case, is that going to be a better
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:17.720]   laptop than the one I'm on?
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:22.160]   It'll be smaller, is Android really ready to be my primary machine?
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.800]   I'm not too sure.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:24.800]   I don't think so.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:27.480]   What you should point out, 10 inches is iPad size.
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.280]   It's not massive.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:32.440]   I like the 10-inch.
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:36.080]   Well, and I really am impressed by the keyboard.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:39.800]   And the magnetic mechanism was very impressive.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:44.240]   In fact, I had to think that Microsoft, because these, you know, these are just basically
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.360]   like the surface.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.640]   You know, they were the first to kind of do these.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.080]   Maybe now, actually, you know what?
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:54.600]   Lenovo with the Yoga and a few other companies were the first to do these convertibles.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:57:01.440]   But this magnetic latching system where the keyboard is the cover, and then as you flip
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:09.680]   it around, it catches with the magnet and becomes a kickstand keyboard combo is brilliant.
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.800]   It is the best way of doing this I've ever seen.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:17.040]   And the surface you've got, you know, Pogo pins, and it's, this is just brilliant.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.840]   What if you want to just use it as a tablet that you have to keyboard with you?
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.160]   Is that become extra back?
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.160]   Well, the keyboard is extra.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.840]   So you don't have to buy the keyboard.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.840]   No, no, no, no.
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:25.840]   I'm not even asking if they're different.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:29.680]   So you walk around with two things, but you want to watch a movie now.
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:30.880]   Yeah, the keyboard is a cover.
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:34.520]   And I presume you could just take it off or flip it around.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.840]   But it's flipping around.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:36.840]   Right.
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.880]   Yeah, you don't want your keys on the table, right?
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:43.360]   It's a new processor, the Nvidia Tegra X1.
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.120]   These are the K1 was in the shield.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.120]   Amazing processor.
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.120]   Very good.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.520]   Still, still really fast.
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:51.520]   I don't know anything about the X1 by the way.
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:52.520]   Quad core.
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:53.520]   So millimeters.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:54.520]   How much?
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:55.520]   Seven millimeters.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:58.680]   It says that's pretty for a 10 inch tablet.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:57:59.680]   Thick.
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:01.680]   Very thin.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.240]   Yeah, very thin.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.600]   It starts at $4.99.
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:07.280]   The keyboard's $1.49.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.960]   So now we're saying it's a lap.
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.840]   It's cost about the same as a laptop screen.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:16.040]   So Mike Elgin played with it on the demo floor.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:20.480]   He said the keyboard is almost identical to your Chromebook pixel keyboard, which is
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.160]   in other words, you love that, right, Jeff?
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.160]   It's good keyboard.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.160]   Love it.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.160]   Love it.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.160]   So that means it's better than the surface type keyboard.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.680]   And it got to be a lot better than that crap Apple keyboard.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:32.640]   They're selling for the iPad Pro.
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:33.640]   That thing really doesn't really--
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.200]   We don't want to do these.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.440]   But in terms of how I use it, it all saves us.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:41.240]   Here in Medellin, I'm hauling around my Chromebook pixel.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.280]   Today, because I've do with the show, I went out to see Medellin, the city.
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.440]   I'm carrying my briefcase.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.480]   I got the heavy laptop in it.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.040]   So something lighter would be wonderful.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.680]   But again, I don't know if it's going to be robust.
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:52.960]   Would it be robust up to the show?
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:54.120]   It could do Skype.
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:57.360]   Finally, you'd be able to do Skype.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:02.240]   I actually wish I just got a new iPad, Air, the 10 inch.
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:05.040]   And if I hadn't just got one, I would be thinking about getting this.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.040]   It's very--
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:08.920]   There's a camera on the long end or the short end.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.720]   Let me see if I can tell.
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:13.520]   Because as the tablet you put it--
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:14.520]   As the tablet you put it.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.520]   From facing camera--
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.520]   There it is.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:17.520]   --as on the long end.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:22.000]   Yeah, it's exactly where you would expect it on the laptops, the top center.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:29.960]   It is Android, but I think it's interesting that you chose to do this as an Android device.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.400]   I can see why it's not a Chrome OS device.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.400]   Well, it's a tablet.
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.400]   It is a tablet.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:38.280]   And I think I said this before, last time I was here the time before.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:39.280]   I don't know.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.280]   I get them all confused now.
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:43.280]   But I ran Android as a desktop.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.320]   I plugged it into my big monitor.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.160]   I had the keyboard set up and everything.
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.160]   And I ran it.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:51.720]   I had no problem with it as a daily driver.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:53.920]   I totally could have done it as a daily driver.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.000]   And there was a lot of things that I liked better.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.200]   Maybe because I was used to using my phone.
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.200]   I don't know.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.200]   But I really enjoyed it.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:06.480]   I had no problem at all using it as a regular device, as a laptop type device.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.480]   In this case, it was--
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.480]   So you got a point.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:12.720]   Because the other thing is that I carry my Chromebook Pixel and my Nexus 7 and my Nexus
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.720]   7.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.720]   That's crazy.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:19.120]   If I carry that, yes, it's bigger than the tablet that I want.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.120]   But it's more on airplanes and such.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.120]   It would be damn nice.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.120]   It's cool.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.800]   Battery light is going to be a question I think because it's screened that way.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.560]   They didn't really say what the battery life would be.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.400]   But this should have a 10 hour.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.400]   I would think so.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.840]   I actually think you could do without your laptop altogether.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:35.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:36.840]   Be retically.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:37.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.840]   It's so hard for--
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:44.920]   It's so hard for us to think of Android as a desktop operating system.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.040]   But I can't think of why it isn't.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.040]   It works great.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.760]   All the apps, there's a file system.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:56.920]   I mean, it actually is probably more of an operating system than Chromebook, which I
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.640]   don't have a file system earlier.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.960]   I think it's not quite as smooth as Docs on the Chromebook.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:07.480]   It's pretty damn easy to store your Docs and that kind of stuff and find the phones.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.480]   It's impossible.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:15.240]   Well, actually, I guess you could run Chrome on your Pixel C and it'd be a Chromebook.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.400]   If you think about it, right?
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.600]   Yeah, just access your Docs.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:23.240]   Just don't ever leave Chrome and you'll feel quite at home.
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.240]   Look at this magnet.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.240]   Look at this magnet.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.480]   This is so awesome.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:30.920]   This thing must be some rare earth neodymium.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.360]   They swing in the thing around.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.920]   It's holding the tablet via the magnet.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.520]   And it really seems like a--
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.520]   It's a charge.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.240]   --of the keyboard.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.240]   That's another cool thing.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.800]   But the duct is charging.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.600]   There's no pogo pins.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:50.000]   It charges the keyboard from the tablet via basically wireless charging.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   Wow.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.080]   And of course, these keyboards aren't.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.880]   They don't use much power.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.640]   But that means your keyboard would never be dead.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:58.640]   You just keep the--
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.640]   Right.
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.640]   Right.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:01.640]   Keep the tablet charges.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:02.640]   Your only responsibility.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.040]   What kind of battery life does it go?
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.960]   I don't think they say.
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:07.960]   Did they say?
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:15.520]   Chatroom, did they say?
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.520]   It's not a--
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:19.880]   OK, so somebody's saying, well, how do you know how the iPad keyboard is?
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.680]   But I don't like it that it's fabric covers.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:22.680]   Yes.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.760]   I think right there, that's a problem.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.760]   But you're right.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.880]   I haven't tried it yet.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.640]   I have tried the key mechanisms.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.160]   Those keys are on the MacBook.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.640]   And it's a very poor experience on the MacBook.
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.000]   I love the MacBook.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.680]   The hardest thing about getting used to MacBook is getting used to the short travel
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:40.680]   keys.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.040]   They're just very hard to type accurately on.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.320]   And according to Mike, who tried this keyboard, this is as good as the--
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:52.720]   In fact, it seems to be very similar to, except for some slight changes in pitch, the
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.720]   Chromebook Pixel's keyboard, which is a very good keyboard.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:01.720]   But it makes you wonder, you know, we're talking about Android versus Chrome OS.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:06.960]   I mean, it kind of brings up the question, why do they have two things?
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.960]   Like, why if Android's robust enough to run?
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.960]   It's very interesting, isn't it?
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.960]   A workplace tablet.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.400]   Why do you need this whole separate OS for the Chromebook?
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.080]   Is Chrome OS going to be the education OS?
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.080]   What is the--
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.080]   Apple, Apple, Apple just--
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.080]   I think that's exactly what it is.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.320]   Apple just said they're not going to combine the two OS's either.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.320]   Right.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:31.880]   I think that Google says that very soon they'll have more Chromebooks in schools than all
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.040]   other devices combined.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.560]   Some people said this is the death of the Chromebook.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.560]   I just don't believe that.
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.640]   I think the Chromebook has its role.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:44.600]   And I think why they even actually grow in a business sense.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:50.080]   And it is more limited, easier to maintain for IT.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.040]   It is easier to find files and things.
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.120]   It just works better as an operating system.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:57.920]   Could you imagine having designed two versions of the operating system for the get go?
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.280]   Yeah, but that's where we are.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:02.280]   We're both iOS and Android.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.280]   I don't know.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:10.120]   I think-- I never have understood why they do the Chromebooks.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.120]   I mean, I don't understand why you Chrome OS.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.120]   I just--
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.600]   I got in this debate with Sundar Pichai himself when he was running Chrome OS.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:17.600]   So he wants this.
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.600]   Well, he has to defend the can, right?
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:19.600]   But now maybe he's--
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.600]   Well, yeah.
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.920]   And I have come around in the Chromebook.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.640]   Like Jeff, I use the Pixel and I really feel like this is a full computer system.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:27.640]   There's nothing I--
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:28.640]   It absolutely is.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.640]   It's the best thing going.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.640]   I would never go back.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:32.640]   It's so lovely.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.640]   I mean, this is the cloud, folks.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.640]   You know, get used to it.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.640]   This is the world we're in.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:41.760]   And I don't need all that cross and crap locally.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:42.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.760]   But I will say this.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:44.760]   My dad has one.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.280]   And he's never called me once for tech support.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.280]   Big go.
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.280]   Big go.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:53.660]   And everything they call me all the time for the Chromebook.
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:54.660]   Yeah.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:55.660]   Never.
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:56.660]   Never a call after I got it set up for him.
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:57.660]   He's fine.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:58.660]   Mike.
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:01.320]   They were handing them out where my mom lives retirement.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.160]   So he never basically handing them out and getting people to use them.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.980]   And they're great in schools.
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:07.980]   Kids love them.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.520]   Are you guys calling me a retiree?
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.920]   Yeah, Jeff, you're the hardest working man in show business.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.920]   Retired.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.220]   Hell, 20 year old would have a hard time tipping your skids.
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:25.120]   By the way, I found a few resources on the Pixel C that say 10 hour battery life.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.600]   I'm sure that's it.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.600]   I'm sure that's it.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:31.760]   And Mashable has said twice in their review has great battery life.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:32.760]   Whatever that means.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:33.760]   Well, that's Google's words.
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.160]   But you could also recharge it from a portable battery pack.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.840]   Unless that's a laptop.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:40.840]   Yes.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.840]   I have tried.
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:42.840]   Oh, good point.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.840]   Yep.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.840]   Good point.
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:48.040]   I do use charging things on my-- because now that I have a C on the Chromebook Pixelware.
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.420]   I tried to use a big battery.
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:50.420]   No, it goes in charge.
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.900]   I don't know if it maintains it or not, but it does not charge.
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:59.220]   Compare this is the Huawei compared to the-- whoops, it's setting off the Apple Watch.
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.220]   Can you see where is that?
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:01.220]   There it is.
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:04.540]   I think the Huawei is actually as pretty as the Apple Watch.
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:05.540]   It is.
[01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:06.540]   As thick as it is, it's still pretty.
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:08.060]   And look how it's always on.
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:09.060]   That's not the ambient mode.
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:10.060]   It goes a little bit darker.
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.060]   This color goes off.
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.540]   But it's basically-- that's the screen.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:15.140]   Yeah, it's nice.
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:16.140]   I'm a driver.
[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:17.140]   A little heavy.
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.640]   I think it's-- I want to say $4.99 or $3.99.
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:21.640]   That was $3.99.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.400]   $3.99, all right.
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.400]   You could be--
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:28.160]   The thing is, I don't see a reason right now to replace my Moto 360.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.480]   No, and I think the 360 is good too.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:36.080]   But this is a $750 Apple Watch compared to a $400.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.440]   It's not really that much thicker.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:43.760]   I guess really the determination is which platform you use it.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.080]   I wouldn't use an Android Wear watch on an Apple, and I wouldn't use it-- you can't
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.900]   use an iPhone or Apple Watch.
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:49.900]   I thought you would try it.
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.700]   We're watching you know about an Apple.
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.500]   Yeah, I think Megan did.
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:54.500]   You know, it works.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:55.500]   Some notification.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:56.900]   It's just not as full-featured.
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.740]   It just makes sense to get the watch that goes with the operating system.
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:00.740]   Yeah, of course.
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:01.740]   Your use, frankly.
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:02.740]   The steel link band is $4.49.
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:06.740]   Oh, it doesn't come-- oh, the whole thing is $4.49.
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:07.740]   Right, right.
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:09.740]   You can get a leather one for $3.49.
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:10.740]   Okay.
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:12.940]   Hey, babe.
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.740]   I like the ladies' screen.
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.740]   Are you having a party in there?
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:17.740]   What's going on?
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:18.740]   Sorry, they're all working.
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:19.740]   I mean, they're working.
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:21.240]   I mean, they're doing all the social media.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.480]   Oh, that's what it is.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.240]   It's social media.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.520]   So Mike Galgan made an interesting observation.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:32.240]   I think of good insight on the Pixel C, this tablet.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.960]   They pointed out it has an array mic.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:38.120]   Effectively, it has an array mic on the side.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.120]   Multiple microphones.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:42.160]   I can't remember how many they said, but quite a few.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:46.420]   Those are typically used sound pressure microphones, that kind of thing, in an environment where
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.380]   you want to pick up what's going on in the room.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:49.540]   Mike said, there it is.
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.380]   That's the array mic.
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:57.660]   Mike said, this could be the echo killer.
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:01.740]   You talk to your Pixel C from across the room.
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:06.940]   Oh, interesting idea.
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:11.300]   Mike and I, along with a lot of people and kind of tech enthusiasts, love the Amazon
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.200]   Echo.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:19.200]   And I would be very interested in the idea of empowering your home to listen to you and
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.200]   respond is pretty cool.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.200]   Well, I think we'll know.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.560]   I think we'll know it's already so useful.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.560]   It is.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.560]   It's so much more useful than any other.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.560]   Because it knows so much about you.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:29.560]   Yes.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.560]   Like a note for Cal in there.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.560]   It knows what photos you took.
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:36.480]   I mean, imagine that except voice controlled.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.480]   Love it.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.780]   I love the idea.
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:45.060]   So maybe, and we were talking about surface earlier on Windows Weekly, Richard Campbell,
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.980]   one of our guests said, you know, a tablet really is a coffee table device.
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.380]   It doesn't belong to any one person.
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:55.140]   It's something you leave on the coffee table in front of the TV.
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:58.340]   That'd be perfect place for a listening device to sit.
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:08:59.340]   So I'll be very interested.
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:02.980]   The other thing that's different about the Android ecosystem and the Chrome ecosystem
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:08.200]   is much more vibrant there are how many more than a million apps.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.900]   There are not a million Chrome extensions.
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:12.580]   Apps can do so much more in Android.
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:14.340]   Really this makes sense, frankly, to be.
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:15.740]   I would prefer to have an Android.
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:16.740]   Can I order it?
[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:17.740]   Can I order it?
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:23.140]   They said it's not available yet, even for preorder.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:26.060]   I'm guessing Christmas.
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:28.900]   We'll put this under your tree.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:31.620]   All right.
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:34.860]   Now we have covered everything.
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:35.860]   Google.
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:36.860]   Everything.
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:37.860]   Everything.
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:38.860]   Google announced yesterday.
[01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:39.860]   Everything.
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:42.100]   We're going to take a break and talk more.
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:43.700]   Is Android a monopoly?
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:46.660]   Apparently Google's under antitrust scrutiny.
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:53.580]   This just frosts my knickers.
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:56.220]   You try to do something good.
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.780]   You try to do something good for the world.
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:00.460]   Like making an operating system open source.
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:04.100]   It's hugely successful and they say, now you got a monopoly.
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.100]   Ridiculous.
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:10.460]   Meanwhile, Apple, with its completely closed operating system, that only it can use and
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:13.340]   only it can sell and it controls completely tightly.
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:15.420]   Well, they're not a monopoly.
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:21.020]   There is no way that Android meets any kind of reasonable definition of a monopoly.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:22.500]   It's the opposite of a monopoly.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.500]   No pricing power.
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:27.580]   There's no anti-competitive practices.
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:28.580]   It's farcical.
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:29.860]   It's the opposite.
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:35.900]   However, I will try to argue the point that it is a monopoly because that's my job.
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.580]   But we'll do that in just a little bit.
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:41.860]   I want to talk about my little bits.
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:42.860]   Little bits are great.
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:44.860]   They're not that little.
[01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:46.260]   Yes, little bits are great.
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:47.260]   And you're a maker.
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:48.260]   You know.
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.260]   Little bits.
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:51.180]   Was this a Kickstarter when it started?
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:53.180]   I can't remember how little bits got started.
[01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:54.180]   I think it was.
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:55.700]   They've gotten better and better.
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:59.820]   I think it was too because I think I got the Kickstarter kit way back when they're
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:03.780]   electronics building blocks.
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:05.700]   They snap together with magnets.
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:06.700]   So there's no soldering.
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:10.900]   But in every other respect, it's just like an electronics project.
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:17.020]   Resisters, capacitors, little units that do different things, motors, switches.
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:18.700]   There's a little potentiometer.
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:24.340]   They call it the slide dimmer, the I5 slide dimmer.
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:26.540]   And you snap these things together.
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:31.380]   You can't do it wrong because the magnets will repel if you try to do it the wrong way,
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:33.340]   which is pretty darn awesome.
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:37.900]   A great toy for parents to build things with their kids.
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:41.220]   And this, because of the way this is set up, they can be pretty little.
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:44.060]   It doesn't have to be a 12-year-old.
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:47.420]   You could do this with an 8-year-old and have so much fun.
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:54.380]   Actually, I'll confess I sometimes do this all by myself in the privacy of my own home.
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:12:00.700]   These levels range from very simple like powers and sensors and LEDs to wireless programmable.
[01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:04.020]   Yes, you can do programs with it.
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.820]   You could build a robot with it.
[01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:10.380]   The little bits kits come with everything you need to do a variety of projects.
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:12.620]   This is the project manual.
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:15.100]   This is the little bit space kit.
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:22.140]   So there are 1 million combinations, 10 activities created with the NASA Goddard Flight Center.
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:29.140]   So if you want to become a space scientist and teach your kids to become a space scientist,
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.380]   this is so cool.
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:33.140]   They have the base kits, the deluxe kits.
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:36.140]   This is the space kit, the Arduino coding kit.
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:40.420]   If you want to really get hardcore serious program, Arduino is sometimes hard for people
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.500]   to get into from scratch.
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:46.420]   Get the little bits kit, you got everything you need and a really great walk-through and
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:47.420]   a step-by-step.
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:52.420]   For the tinkerer, the deluxe kit has 18 modules that snap together to make billions of different
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:55.700]   circuits and again, no wiring, no soldering.
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:13:02.140]   What would take days to make with real, off-the-shelf components you could do in seconds.
[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:03.140]   Are you a musician?
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:04.380]   You have a budding musician in the family?
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.300]   How about the synth kit?
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:10.820]   You can build a modular analog synthesizer.
[01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:16.420]   You get oscillators, filters, envelopes, keyboards, a micro-sequencer, speakers, everything.
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:23.580]   The Arduino Coder kit lets you manipulate what's on the screen using little bits inputs.
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:24.580]   Look at the...
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:30.060]   Let's see, these are some circuits we could build, control modules from across the room,
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:31.660]   electromagnetic energy.
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:33.220]   What is energy?
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:43.260]   This is a stem curriculum in a toy, which is fabulous, wave generator, energy meter,
[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:44.980]   make a spectrum.
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:46.820]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:47.820]   This is fun.
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:48.820]   It is fun.
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:49.820]   And it's nice that it's all color-coded.
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:51.580]   Yeah, yeah, you can't go wrong.
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:53.300]   It's really pretty straightforward.
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:57.780]   The truth is, that's not for the kids, that's for the grown-ups.
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:59.020]   The grown-ups need a little help.
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:01.300]   You don't want to look like, "I don't know what's going on.
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:03.060]   I've done these kids."
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:07.940]   And really, you don't want to be the one going, "I don't know, Michael.
[01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:10.140]   Let me figure out how this works."
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:11.700]   You want to look like you know what you're doing.
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:14.940]   And you will, satellite dish data communications.
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:17.460]   Wow, so cool.
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:18.460]   So here's the deal.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.820]   20 bucks off your first kit.
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:24.600]   Go to littlebits.highfriendsofthisweekingoogle.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.400]   Littlebits.com/twig.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:29.140]   That also includes free shipping in the US.
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:30.140]   20 bucks off.
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:32.540]   Just use the offer code TWIG at checkout.
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:35.700]   And if you make something, would you Instagram me?
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:41.660]   Just go @Mr_loport and I'd love to show some of the things.
[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:44.300]   You built with your new little bits.
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:48.980]   You and your kids or your friends or your parents.
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:53.140]   Littlebits.com/twig.
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:54.540]   I just love our sponsors.
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:55.740]   I'm so glad they're a sponsor.
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:56.740]   Isn't that great?
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:57.740]   That's a great product.
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:59.420]   Everybody should go check that out.
[01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:03.580]   Especially if you have kids and you want to teach them electronics at an early age,
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:04.820]   like you said, you can't go wrong.
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:05.820]   No.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.300]   And not every kid wants to become a maker.
[01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:10.380]   You know, every kid wants to do the kinds of crazy stuff you do.
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:11.380]   Yep.
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:15.580]   I really think every kid should have at least the experience of how stuff fits together.
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:16.580]   Right.
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:17.580]   So they can understand it.
[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:18.580]   What we don't want is kids to be consumers.
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:21.860]   What kids to understand the, you know, don't just buy a tablet.
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:24.660]   I understand how a tablet works.
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:28.260]   And so even if the kid isn't going to be, you know, getting deep into it, not every
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:31.740]   kid wants to be a maker, they'll at least have that experience.
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:33.380]   And the joy of putting something together.
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:38.740]   And when the light comes on or the fan spins, it's so great.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.740]   Yep.
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:41.740]   Mm hmm.
[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:45.140]   This Chromecast coming to Spotify, Showtime, Sling TV.
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.140]   I am an NBA.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:53.300]   I've been able to, with my Spotify on Android, send it to my Sonos.
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:54.300]   Weirdly enough.
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:59.060]   And I think I have, I don't know what the new Spotify capabilities are, but anyway, they
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:00.060]   said something.
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:06.740]   So Android is in use by 1.4 billion people.
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:10.580]   Clearly it's a monopoly.
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.580]   It's a high.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.980]   Courtney, according to Bloomberg.
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:20.140]   Now I should also point out that in the past, we've seen maybe over statements about what
[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:26.700]   the US government is investigating and whether it's a criminal investigation or even a serious
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:28.020]   investigation.
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:33.700]   But the Federal Trade Commission apparently is reaching according to Bloomberg is reaching
[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:39.420]   agreement with the Justice Department to lead an investigation on Google's Android business
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:46.540]   according to people familiar to people to people familiar with the matter.
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:50.540]   Did Google's stifle competitors access to Android?
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:57.020]   Now on the face of it, this would seem absurd since you can go and download from GitHub the
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:03.340]   entire Android code set except for the Google bits and put it on a phone and you don't even
[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:04.340]   have to ask Google, right?
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:05.700]   You don't even have to contact Google.
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:10.660]   You just make an AOSP handset and you sell it for 25 bucks.
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:16.500]   You can use it on a lot of devices have Android on because it's open source and free.
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.420]   So really that can't be the question.
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:29.020]   The question it must be is Google using its market cloud to force people to use to put
[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:31.220]   the Google services on Android?
[01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:32.220]   Yeah.
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.500]   I mean, we have like how about Android without Google?
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:35.700]   It's a bundling argument.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:38.740]   So it's because that's what works with Microsoft.
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:43.900]   So the argument is they control to some extent the Android platform.
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:49.660]   It's therefore they can push their Google apps and services on people and effectively
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:53.300]   give themselves a head start compared to other services.
[01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:57.700]   Yeah, and that works so well with Microsoft by the time the government had finished its
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:05.220]   multi-year investigation and prosecution, hundreds and hundreds of hours of boring depositions,
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.100]   millions of dollars down the tubes.
[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:09.060]   What did they achieve?
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:15.220]   I could name a million things but I do want to go from like bad hotel Wi-Fi, like bad
[01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:19.700]   airline, behavior, like, name it.
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:20.700]   There's tons of things.
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:24.060]   This is not consumer protection in any possible universe.
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:25.060]   Who the hell could play?
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:26.060]   The competitor.
[01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:28.060]   It must be, right?
[01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:29.300]   Yeah, it's absurd.
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:36.500]   It must be Samsung or Apple or somebody said, "Hmm."
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:41.060]   You use doing the same thing.
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:45.580]   Fairsearch.org must be a nonprofit, right?
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:47.580]   Because it's got the .org.
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:48.580]   Well, yeah.
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:49.580]   They said.
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:54.980]   It's pretty sure it is.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:55.980]   Fairsearch.
[01:18:55.980 --> 01:19:09.100]   You know, it's really sad that if you can't compete, you just try to win by suing or encouraging
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:11.380]   antitrust action against your competitors.
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:13.420]   That's just sad.
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:14.980]   Make a better product.
[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:15.980]   By the way, if you go to...
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:16.980]   I love this.
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:17.980]   I love this, right?
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:19.980]   The first company listed is Nokia at Microsoft.
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:20.980]   Yeah.
[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:21.980]   Who owns Nokia?
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:22.980]   Who owns Expedia?
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.980]   Who started...
[01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:28.980]   It's sort of Twinga, found him who's been going after Google.
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:29.980]   Oracle.
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:30.980]   Oh, yes, we know how abstaining they are.
[01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:32.980]   Allegro, who the heck is that?
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.980]   Buscape, who's that?
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:35.980]   Marketplace, I'm sure.
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:36.980]   A span of...
[01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:38.980]   A couple of these guys just threw in a couple of bucks.
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:40.980]   Who threw in the big bucks is the question.
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:42.980]   Oh, the last one listed.
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:43.980]   Microsoft.
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:44.980]   Yeah.
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:45.980]   Yeah.
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:46.980]   Better.
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:47.980]   So here's what fairsearch.org says.
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:52.940]   Google has used a range of anti-competitive tactics carrying on a troubling pattern of conduct.
[01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:59.500]   It has made it more difficult and expensive for fresh, innovative companies like Microsoft.
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:02.940]   I added the like Microsoft to reach the market.
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:04.580]   Google's playbook is simple.
[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:08.940]   It says, first you do open, then you dominate, and then you close.
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:09.940]   Hmm.
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:11.940]   Well, that's...
[01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:12.940]   Yeah.
[01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:13.940]   So, okay, you can make that argument.
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:14.940]   Like Microsoft, I understand.
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:15.940]   Yeah.
[01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:16.940]   But, is it happened?
[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:19.940]   Just because it could happen doesn't mean it's going to happen, because it doesn't mean it's not...
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:20.940]   Well, that's what they're investigating.
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:21.940]   Has it happened?
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:22.940]   That's ridiculous.
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:28.940]   Google, Android counts for 59% of the smartphone market in the second quarter compared to Apple's
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:31.940]   38% and Microsoft's 2.35%.
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:37.940]   But, but success in the marketplace doesn't mean you're a monopoly.
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:40.940]   And it's not even monopoly level.
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:41.940]   Right.
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:42.940]   Exactly.
[01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:43.940]   That would be my point.
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:44.940]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.940]   In the US, the monopoly, it's not illegal to have a monopoly.
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:48.940]   Right.
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:52.940]   A lot of people are under the misapprehension that it's illegal to have a monopoly.
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:53.940]   It's not.
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:21:02.220]   It's illegal to gain a monopoly through anti-competitive practices, and it's illegal to use your monopoly
[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:03.780]   in anti-competitive ways.
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:12.060]   But, but so far at least the courts have only ruled against monopolies if they impact consumers
[01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:13.060]   negatively.
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:14.060]   Right.
[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:16.060]   So, if, for example, if prices rise or...
[01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:17.060]   Right.
[01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:19.060]   There has to be a damage.
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:20.060]   Right.
[01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:21.060]   So, where is the damage?
[01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:24.060]   The damage is you get a lot of great apps for free.
[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:28.380]   So, it's hard to prove that anybody's being, you know, hard done by.
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:33.300]   Well, and as Microsoft knew when it was being attacked by the Department of Justice, you
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:37.420]   prop up the competitors, Apple in that case.
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:41.460]   And, and, and Apple had a few percentage points of market share.
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:42.900]   But, Microsoft said, "No, no, no.
[01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:43.900]   There's competition.
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:45.060]   See, we got Apple."
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:51.660]   Apple is 38% of the market, and one could absolutely argue is dominant and forces all
[01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:54.420]   sorts of concessions from other industries.
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:59.940]   And, and this is the key, by the way, in antitrust regulation uses its market dominance
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:03.940]   to enter new markets and dominate those markets.
[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:06.860]   That's the thing that is illegal.
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:07.860]   And what is Apple doing?
[01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:10.620]   I mean, what is Apple music all about?
[01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:14.420]   You know, Apple's trying to become big in cloud services.
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:21.300]   And, and Apple is far worse about compelling you to use its products to either make it
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:26.060]   impossible in some places, or at least very hard to use things that are not part of that
[01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:27.060]   ecosystem.
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.340]   Google is much more open when it comes to that stuff.
[01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:32.740]   That's half of the reason I moved from, from my phone to Android in the first place.
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:39.340]   In fact, Google allows Apple to put an application on the Google Play store called Move to iOS.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:43.420]   Apple then allows Google to put a Move to Android app on its store.
[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:53.020]   Oh, well, one presumes that the FTC will look at this and go, yeah, no.
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:56.860]   I'm really trying, it's hard for me to play devil's advocate on this one because, so,
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:59.020]   okay, here, let's see what the case could be.
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:04.420]   So Google gives away Android, but really no consumer wants plain Android.
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:09.180]   They want Google store, Google Maps, hang out, say, what's the argument?
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:13.020]   The argument will be Google gives away Android, so it can force these applications on you.
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:17.020]   And so show me the consumers who feel they're forced.
[01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:19.900]   They're all going to be from a place called Redmond, Washington.
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:24.140]   Everybody who buys an Android, you'd be furious if you bought an Android phone, it didn't
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:26.180]   have the Play store on it.
[01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:29.780]   That's precisely why I will not buy a fire.
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:30.780]   Fire.
[01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:31.780]   Yeah.
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:35.460]   But witness, Google didn't force them to take it.
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:36.460]   No.
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:41.220]   Ambism on the competitor was perfectly free to take this operating system, saved to fortune,
[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:43.220]   that's the updates has the value.
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:45.580]   Yeah, that's a great example.
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:46.580]   That's a great example.
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:49.580]   I would use that as an example.
[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:52.580]   Google has been much more lenient.
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:53.580]   No, no, no.
[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:55.220]   But just try doing that to Apple.
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:56.700]   Just try doing that to Apple.
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:24:00.900]   What I guess you have WebKit, but that's the top.
[01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:06.300]   Remember how pissed off people were, especially the Wall Street Journal, when the FTC decided
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:12.700]   not to go after Google on search rankings, they voted five to nothing, not to go after
[01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:17.420]   the FTC protects servers and there was no violation of consumer approval.
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:22.260]   Consumer harm is the number one.
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:27.980]   And the memo that was accidentally given out was a different division of the FTC that
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.380]   doesn't do that.
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:33.860]   But at the end of the commissioners, all included the Republican said, "No."
[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:42.340]   It's funny because according to this article, Google lobbied the FTC to mount a more spirited
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:45.580]   defense of its decision to drop the case.
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:49.540]   Can you guys just make a bit more noise?
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:50.620]   No, really.
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:52.060]   We didn't think there was a case.
[01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:54.980]   Really, there wasn't.
[01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:59.140]   They said that Google's competitors were using those leaked documents to, quote, "so
[01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:02.220]   confusion and undermine the FCC's conclusions."
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:06.980]   I think that's a reasonable assertion, actually.
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:07.980]   It's Gary Reebach.
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:10.580]   Where do we know that name from?
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:17.860]   A lawyer with a car, Farrell, said, "The FTC comes to this with a lot of baggage."
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:23.780]   When we re-back, what was his role in the DOJ case?
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:25.540]   He defended Microsoft, right?
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:26.540]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:28.900]   I can't remember him.
[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:31.900]   When we say we're concerned, it's not only because they didn't do a good investigation
[01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:36.900]   talking about the FTC, the first time around, and the fact they didn't protect the confidentiality
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:41.620]   of people who complained, but also they were taking directions for, they seem to be taking
[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:49.060]   directions from Google.
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:54.220]   Gary Reebach, "Hired gun.
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:56.580]   Have re-back with challenge."
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:57.580]   All right.
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:01.900]   I don't know what to say about that.
[01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:03.380]   Preach into the choir here.
[01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:05.780]   1.4 billion users is pretty amazing.
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:12.740]   By the way, interesting coast that 1.4 billion people using Android, 1 billion people using
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:21.180]   Google Play, which means that 400 million of those Android users are not using Google
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:22.180]   services.
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:24.540]   And they're by not being forced in any way to do anything.
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:26.580]   They're on the open version of Android.
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:28.780]   They paid nothing for the operating system.
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:30.620]   There's your proof point right there.
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:34.300]   400-- there's got to be reason that Google used that stat.
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:39.660]   400 million people, not using Google services.
[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:41.940]   They get it for free.
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:43.540]   That's impressive.
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:48.900]   900 million people signed up to use Gmail.
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:50.740]   That's impressive.
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:55.900]   These numbers are getting so huge.
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:27:02.500]   It's just crazy to think that percentage of the population of all the people in the world
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:03.500]   are using Android.
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:04.500]   It's just crazy.
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:07.620]   And then to think of the billions of people that sign up every month.
[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:11.820]   So what's happening to all of the-- this is where I get confused is in the numbers.
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.980]   What it was at a billion people a month?
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:15.580]   They're signing up or something.
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:19.340]   It's these numbers get so big it's hard to wrap your mind around.
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:22.700]   Where are all these phones going or all these devices going?
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:27.340]   If there's only 1.4 million active users or 1.6 million-- see, I did it again-- 1.4 billion
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:28.340]   active users.
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:29.340]   All right.
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:30.820]   We got to run because Jeff has to run.
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:36.060]   But we're going to get to our end of the back of the book in just a bit.
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:40.020]   But one more little public service announcement.
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:44.420]   Facebook is not going to charge you to keep your stuff private.
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:48.220]   You do not need to put a copyright notice on your Facebook timeline.
[01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:49.220]   When it starts doing that.
[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:54.180]   And if you do, you just look foolish because it's your own.
[01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:55.180]   You're an affiliate.
[01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:57.580]   And you don't deserve Facebook.
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:02.060]   Somebody said that that policy posting was actually very useful because it showed you
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:06.500]   who you should unfollow.
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:09.620]   My college roommate posted it.
[01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:11.940]   And I felt I didn't know what to do.
[01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:14.780]   I didn't want to say, oh dude, dude.
[01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:15.780]   You mediate them.
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:16.780]   I didn't want to.
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:21.300]   Facebook is not going to make you pay $6 to keep your status private.
[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:24.700]   This comes up every year.
[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:31.620]   And it's a testament to the viral nature of the Facebook news feed.
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:35.100]   Facebook said it's trying to beat this last January.
[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:40.220]   They said they were tweaking the news feed algorithm to crack down on these stories.
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:43.660]   I guess it looks too self-serving if they actually stop that story.
[01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:45.660]   So maybe they're stopping other stories.
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:47.740]   I know you have to go, Jeff.
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:49.540]   Do you want to go now?
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.980]   Yeah, I'll do my number first then I'll do it.
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:55.180]   OK, so I'm going to do an ad if you have time.
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:56.540]   Or should I give you the ad?
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:57.820]   Do the-- you don't mind?
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:00.100]   It's an ad that you're going to be interested in because I know you're not getting much
[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:03.060]   sleep this week.
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:04.980]   So you need a Casper mattress, my friend.
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:05.500]   When you--
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:06.420]   You're chipped one down the bed.
[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:08.180]   I should.
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:10.060]   I know I feel better when I sleep on a Casper.
[01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:11.580]   It's beautiful.
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:17.500]   Engineered, obsessively engineered to give you support and comfort made in the USA sold
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:22.980]   direct to you, which means you cut the cost of dealing with resellers and showrooms.
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:23.980]   There's no markup.
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:28.100]   It's just-- it's a great price for a great mattress.
[01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:32.020]   And I know when I say that, people say, but I want to try before I buy how to-- how can
[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:33.020]   I do that?
[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:34.020]   Just get it.
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:36.220]   You have 100 days to return it and it will cost you nothing.
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:37.220]   Shipping is free.
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:40.020]   If you decide you don't want it, the return is painless.
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:41.340]   They will refund you every penny.
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:42.740]   You'll pay nothing.
[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:45.940]   But 100 days, that's the best way to try a mattress.
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:46.940]   Look at that, too.
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:48.780]   It comes in this great convenient box.
[01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:49.940]   That was a queen-sized mattress.
[01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:55.740]   It came in a box the size of a small-- I don't know what-- small.
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:56.900]   It's what I sent to my son.
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:58.540]   He's the three-floor walk up in college.
[01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:01.020]   It was perfect for him.
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:03.260]   You will love your Casper mattress.
[01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:06.100]   They're cool in the summer.
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:08.500]   They keep you warm in the winter.
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:14.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:22.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.

[01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:57.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:05.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:11.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:15.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:19.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:25.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:29.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:33.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:35.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:39.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:41.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:43.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:47.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:49.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:50.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:54.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:58.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:00.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:02.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:04.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:08.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:10.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:16.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:18.500]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.500]   There's always something going on.
[01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:22.500]   It's a drama factory.
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:24.500]   It sounds like Jack Dorsey's probably going to be
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:26.500]   the CEO soon.
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.500]   I thought he said he wouldn't be the CEO
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.500]   if he couldn't continue to run square.
[01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:33.500]   The boy said, "No, you have to vote 100% of your time to Twitter.
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:35.500]   How did they resolve that?"
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.500]   Most of those things happened.
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:40.500]   What's probably going to happen is the board will say,
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:45.500]   "It turns out we changed our mind and he can run both companies."
[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:48.500]   That whole thing we put out saying that wasn't going to happen.
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:49.500]   No, we take it back.
[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:50.500]   It's going to happen.
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:52.500]   At least that's what I'm hearing anyway.
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:57.500]   It sounds like there's a -- basically there's been a full court press
[01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:02.500]   from a bunch of different insiders and board members and investors
[01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:05.500]   that Jack needs to be the CEO.
[01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:09.500]   It's going to be very interesting to watch how he handles that
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.500]   because Square is going public.
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:13.500]   He's going to be CEO of that as well.
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:18.500]   A brand new public company with a lot of pressure on it
[01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:21.500]   and Twitter, which needs a lot of help.
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:28.500]   Either one of those would be enough for one sort of normal person.
[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:34.500]   People are pointing out, "Well, Elon Musk runs SpaceX and not a Tesla."
[01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:36.500]   He doesn't run SpaceX.
[01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:38.500]   He doesn't run SpaceX.
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.500]   No, he doesn't really run it.
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:44.500]   Jobs ran Pixar sort of and Apple.
[01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:47.500]   But the examples are very few.
[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:48.500]   Steve Jobs.
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.500]   When someone's been able to do that.
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:54.500]   And Twitter isn't just, "Hey, I'll come in for some board meetings
[01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:56.500]   and sign some papers and stuff.
[01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:58.500]   I'm going to need serious help."
[01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:01.500]   And he's done this before and it didn't work so well.
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:03.500]   Even though Square is just across the Square,
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.500]   he can run -- he can walk back and forth.
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:06.500]   Yeah, at least they're close.
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:08.500]   But the history of that company,
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:12.500]   Jack has been ousted many times.
[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:14.500]   Like two or three times I've lost count.
[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:17.500]   And so, you know, it's not as though he can --
[01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:18.500]   I love it.
[01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:22.500]   Twitter is opera.
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:23.500]   It is.
[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:24.500]   It's drama.
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:25.500]   It's direct.
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:27.500]   So try a picture of the board meetings there.
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:32.500]   As William O'Founder, who ousted Jack, is on the board.
[01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:37.500]   Jack, the chairman and sort of interim CEO who was ousted by F,
[01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:38.500]   is on the board.
[01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:43.500]   To Costello, CEO who ousted F, a CEO, is on the board.
[01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:48.500]   I mean, board meetings have got to be like, you know, I don't know.
[01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:49.500]   I can't think of anything.
[01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:53.500]   But can't we just -- Twitter is not like losing money.
[01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.500]   They're not going bankrupt.
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:56.500]   Maybe -- No, no, no.
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:59.500]   In fact, they're making -- money is not the problem.
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:01.500]   Making money is not the problem.
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.500]   Growth is the problem.
[01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:06.500]   Well, only because the stock market wants to see them grow.
[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:09.500]   But what if you just said, hey, we're doing fine.
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:11.500]   Let's just keep on keeping on.
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.500]   Let's not go crazy trying to monetize.
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.500]   We're making enough money.
[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:17.500]   It's a public service.
[01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:18.500]   The stock will take.
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:19.500]   The stock will take.
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:20.500]   And then what?
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:23.500]   Well, and then when you become takeover.
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.500]   A hostile takeover.
[01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:26.500]   Yeah.
[01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:32.500]   So Google's been, you know, mooted as a potential, you know, especially since it feels like they're
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:37.500]   giving up on Google+, Twitter, they're integrating Twitter quite a lot in search.
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:40.500]   They really love that real-time data.
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:42.500]   Twitter has it like nobody else.
[01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:44.500]   And so there's a fit there.
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:51.500]   You know, the price is just a little too high, I think.
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:53.500]   Anyway, it'll be fun to watch.
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:54.500]   Yeah.
[01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:56.500]   It's a shame they went public.
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:58.500]   It is kind of a shame.
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:01.500]   Someone, I forget who it was, might have been Sarah Lacey said.
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:08.500]   Twitter's biggest challenge or the thing that has acted against it the most is it went public
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.500]   in the age of Facebook.
[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:13.500]   So everyone expects it to be Facebook.
[01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:15.500]   Why don't you have a billion users?
[01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:19.500]   Why aren't you worth $250 billion?
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.500]   Because it's a very, very different service.
[01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:26.500]   And yet, so if Twitter was all by itself and there was no Facebook, it would look pretty good.
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:27.500]   Probably.
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:28.500]   Yeah.
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:29.500]   Yeah.
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:31.500]   I mean, they're a public utility.
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:35.500]   They're a public service.
[01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:39.500]   You can't watch a TV show without seeing the hashtag.
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:42.500]   They make money.
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:43.500]   They even make money.
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:44.500]   Yeah.
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:49.500]   It will be interesting once their new project lightning sort of curates the news thing.
[01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:50.500]   Yeah.
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:51.500]   Product.
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:52.500]   That'll be interesting to see.
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:54.500]   Because it's such a huge news platform.
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:57.500]   I mean, that's why I'm on it, you know, 18 hours a day.
[01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:03.500]   I just, it's just they need, it needs to be a little easier for people who aren't kind
[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:10.500]   of obsessive nerds like me or who haven't spent four years trying to curate lists of
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:12.500]   people who follow.
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:19.500]   Maybe, maybe, maybe if Jack does come in, he's job one should be to buy the stock back
[01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:22.500]   and go private and then just coast.
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:23.500]   Yeah.
[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:24.500]   They wouldn't have to run it.
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:25.500]   Just coast.
[01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:28.500]   That would take a significant amount of money.
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.500]   They're worth a lot, huh?
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:31.500]   Oh, well.
[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:33.500]   I'm going to let you go, Matthew.
[01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:34.500]   Thank you so much.
[01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:35.500]   We're going to do a little maker demo here.
[01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:36.500]   More projects.
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:37.500]   Yeah.
[01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:38.500]   I think this will be kind of fun.
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:40.500]   Matthew Ingram is at fortune.com.
[01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:46.500]   Read his coverage of the Twitter boardroom brawls and ongoing coverage of the drama.
[01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:47.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:48.500]   At fortune.com.
[01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:49.500]   Thank you, Matthew.
[01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:50.500]   Great to have you.
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:51.500]   Thanks for having me.
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:52.500]   See you later.
[01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:54.500]   Aaron Newcomb brought toys.
[01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:58.500]   So I thought, you know, we just kind of do a little extra at the end of the show.
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:00.500]   We'll call it Aaron's Toys.
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:01.500]   Aaron's Toy Box.
[01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:03.500]   What did you bring us today, Aaron?
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:04.500]   What did you bring us today, Aaron?
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:05.500]   Hey, Aaron.
[01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:06.500]   Oh, Lord.
[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:07.500]   Let's reach out.
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:08.500]   It's a good segment.
[01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:09.500]   It would be.
[01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:11.500]   So I like to bring a project for you.
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:17.500]   And this is actually the, our maker space is mega doorbell.
[01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:20.500]   So I thought it was mega doorbell.
[01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:22.500]   This is why you don't ever throw anything away.
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:26.500]   Either keep it and take it apart or you bring it to your local maker space.
[01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:27.500]   They'll take it.
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:29.500]   They'll find something to do with it.
[01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:32.500]   Oh, John, when we need to get rid of this stuff in the basement.
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:33.500]   Oh, there we go.
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:34.500]   Bring it to a maker space.
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:35.500]   Absolutely.
[01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:36.500]   Find a maker space.
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:37.500]   We got a lot of toys.
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:38.500]   Find a maker space.
[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.500]   I don't think I have a video on my side.
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:41.500]   I don't think this is.
[01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:42.500]   Do you need an HDMI port?
[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:43.500]   No, I don't.
[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:44.500]   Actually, I need an overhead camera.
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:45.500]   I don't think there is one set up.
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:50.500]   Do we have an overhead camera or should he slide over to my overhead camera?
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:53.500]   Do you think there is a particular jumping and ladders or?
[01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:54.500]   Going through hoops.
[01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:55.500]   Let's talk about it for a little bit.
[01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:56.500]   We'll see what they can do.
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:57.500]   What did you do?
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:58.500]   So a couple of things, right?
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:01.500]   So this is using some really cool technology from Adafruit.
[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:02.500]   You know, Adafruit.
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:04.500]   We were just talking about Adafruit and Lady Ada.
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:07.500]   This is a little thing they call the sound FX.
[01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:08.500]   Oh, wait.
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:09.500]   Look at that.
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:10.500]   Where am I?
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:11.500]   Over here.
[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:12.500]   Look at that.
[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:13.500]   That kind of.
[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:14.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:15.500]   Nice.
[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:16.500]   Is that a good?
[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:17.500]   Tell us when we got a good place for you.
[01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:18.500]   That'll work.
[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:19.500]   We can make that work.
[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:25.180]   hinge by maybe two inches. And it's called the sound effects, I think it's like 20 bucks
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:28.780]   or something like this. Basically, what it does is it gives you the opportunity to load
[01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:32.920]   some sound files onto the board, and then they've got these pins, and you can connect
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:36.260]   it to buttons and all sorts of things. So if you're building something and you don't
[01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:39.740]   incorporate sound and you want to do it in a really easy way, this is a great way to
[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:40.740]   do it.
[01:42:40.740 --> 01:42:47.180]   It's not like a raspberry pi. It's not a raspberry pi. It's just a little circuit board. It has
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:51.740]   two megs of memory, not much, so you have to keep the sound files small. They also have
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:55.540]   a 16 meg version which can handle larger files. But it has to fit in there. But it has to
[01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:59.500]   fit in the bags is enough for a doorbell. They've made this thing super exactly. They've made
[01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:04.460]   this thing super easy to use. Basically, when you hook up to your computer, it will it'll
[01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:08.940]   show up on your computer as a mass storage device, you load your sound files on there.
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:13.180]   When you're done putting your sound files on, you hook it up to like just a just a wall
[01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:19.340]   board on the wall. Then that turns on the music making magic. So the micro USB port can both
[01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:23.820]   be a data port which used copy stuff over and a power supply. And a power supply, right?
[01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:28.020]   And when it sees the data connection, it turns the mass storage on. When it doesn't see the
[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:32.420]   data connection, yep, there you go. I'm not watching what I'm doing. This will help.
[01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:36.700]   When it doesn't see the data connection, it's just power. It just draws power. And then
[01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:42.540]   the cool thing they did is based on what you name the sound files, it will actually do
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:46.540]   different things. So for example, if I hook up these two pins and I have a sound file called
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:52.260]   Rand or several sound file called Rand, it'll actually do random sound files. If you have
[01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:57.340]   it called next, it'll just play them in order. And if you just have one sound file there called
[01:43:57.340 --> 01:44:02.340]   this pin dot aug or dot wave, it'll just play that one when you trigger that connection.
[01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:05.660]   And how many pins are there? There's 10 pins. So you get 10 different sounds.
[01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:09.180]   So you can have more than 10 sounds because on some of them, you could have random sounds.
[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:14.900]   And some of them, you could have a hundred sounds that were randomly played. If you had
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:17.540]   enough room, there's only like you're never going to be able to get that many files on
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:24.660]   here. And so funny because I built a dial a song for they might be giants probably in
[01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:30.260]   2000, maybe 1999. I had to build a Linux machine with a hard drive. Did pretty much
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:34.700]   exactly that. Yeah. Yeah. It just played the next song on the hard drive down the phone
[01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:38.380]   line. This would have made it so much easier. And you know, it is October. Is it October
[01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:41.420]   or is October tomorrow? It will be tomorrow. Tomorrow's October. Okay. I don't know what
[01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:44.780]   day it is. Tomorrow's October. That means Halloween's coming up. Yeah. You're going to
[01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:48.660]   be wanting to build some Halloween costumes. This is an easy way to integrate sound into
[01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:53.420]   your Halloween costume. So that's this is level one. I've got this little speaker hooked
[01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:56.900]   up to it, right? It's a little, I don't know, two watt. So this one is suitable for a costume.
[01:44:56.900 --> 01:45:00.780]   You can put this in a costume. You can put it in your hat. It's very small. Right? Let's
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:05.260]   hear this. So let's let me make sure this is the big ones turned off. Yeah. Here's the
[01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:11.180]   little. Here's the little. Let me get closer. Here's the little. I don't know if you could
[01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:14.460]   hear that. That's actually pretty good. So you hear that Brian? Yeah. Let me do it. So
[01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:18.260]   it's got some random sounds on here. I'll play the next one once this is actually done playing.
[01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:26.860]   Come on. Are you triggering it by? I'm just pushing the button. That is the dying battery
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:31.660]   on an electronic doorbell sound. Let's do one more. Let's do one more just for fun. I've
[01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:35.860]   got nine or 10 of these on here. We won't go through all of them. Long, long, big bells
[01:45:35.860 --> 01:45:39.380]   there. Okay. So that's level one. That's format of the sounds of they have to be waves.
[01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:43.660]   They have to be wave or aug and aug is great because it's compressed. Yep. So you want
[01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:46.860]   to use aug if you're using it, especially if you're using the two meg version. Okay. So
[01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:50.540]   that's all good. Well and good. Now I've got a doorbell to maker space, but even as you
[01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:54.340]   know, nice as this little speaker is no one can hear it. How much power could we have?
[01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:58.660]   Well, it has a built in amp. It's like a, I think a two watt an emperor. Okay. It's pretty
[01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:02.460]   small. It's tiny, but you could then power a bigger speaker. You could, yeah, you can
[01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:07.000]   definitely hook up. So here's the deal, right? At the maker space, previous tenants were
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:13.260]   kind enough to give us this. Is it a megaphone? What is that? No, it's a it's a Valcom paging
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:18.980]   speaker. And you know, 43 your pizza is ready. Exactly. So you know, when you go to the, you
[01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:23.420]   know, when you go to the car dealership and they page out, you know, track, you've got
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:29.420]   a car line one. This is the speaker they use out in the parking lot, right? High fidelity.
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:34.980]   High fidelity. And it comes with a, you need a 24 volt DC amp to connect to it. Okay. Now
[01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:39.620]   I'm only going to turn this up to the lowest setting because this is loud. It's super loud.
[01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:43.740]   Let's see. Please let's play one fingers in your ears. Yeah. This might be a little loud.
[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:48.580]   So here we go. Oh, that's not too bad. Now that's the lowest. Nice. That's the lowest
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:55.180]   setting. So yeah, I need that doorbell. That sounds pretty good. It's got a little nice
[01:46:55.180 --> 01:47:02.260]   chime there. Wow. That's actually surprisingly high fidelity. That sounds better than I would
[01:47:02.260 --> 01:47:05.020]   expect. It actually is really good. And I wasn't, I didn't even know if I could get this thing
[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:08.420]   to work, but I'm so glad I did. You have a battery down there. What do you have? Yeah.
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:11.820]   So it's a it's a you're not going to be able to see this is off camera, but it's actually
[01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:17.820]   a 24 volt DC amp. Okay. That's connected directly to the speaker. Okay. So what I did was just
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:23.180]   to show you how versatile this is. Now I'm going to switch this button over to pin one.
[01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:30.340]   And it should play a different sound. Let's see if it works. Wow. There we go. So that
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:32.900]   could be your speaker. That could be your doorbell. Someone comes out to the front door
[01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:39.580]   and they they ring it. They'll hear they'll hear that. So you know someone's at the door.
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:47.660]   I like it. That's where you go. I just once turn it up all the way. No, you're just
[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:52.340]   no, you don't want that. I can turn it up a little more. I don't I am the wrong person
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:56.820]   because I have my in your monitors. I'm protected. You want me to do a little more?
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:48:00.860]   A little more. It's a little more. Put your head. It's time for Twit this week. It's
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:06.860]   a yeah. It gets really loud. It gets really loud. But you want that in a shop someplace
[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:11.460]   with you know a lot of room. I mean, you want something that's pretty loud. So anyway, make
[01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:16.660]   your own talk about this. This is the well, actually first tells the name of that part.
[01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:20.980]   Yeah. So this if you go to AidaFruit, it's the sound FX and there's two. There's there's
[01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:25.060]   four models really. They have one where you can use discrete speakers like this and they
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:29.580]   have another one with eight things Jack where you can hook it up to external speakers,
[01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:33.260]   you know, computer speakers, powered speakers. So you can get either one and then they have
[01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:38.420]   a two mega and a 16 mega version depending on what you what you want to get. So we love
[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:45.540]   AidaFruit. AidaFruit great. There's some cool stuff. There's the part 1995. I just feel
[01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:51.220]   like this is a great place for makers and Lady Aida's we've had her on the triangulation.
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:55.780]   She's great and she does that ask the engineers show. Yep. Yep. And we were talking about
[01:48:55.780 --> 01:48:59.660]   her on Windows weekly. So great. Good stuff. Good stuff coming out of AidaFruit. Now what
[01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:03.260]   is this? You want to talk about that? I didn't know if we had time. Yeah, I got time. You
[01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:09.940]   can't bring stuff in the not. So this is this is the this is the onion Omega. It's a
[01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:16.500]   wait a minute. Just let's guess everybody. Is it a tour router in a wristwatch? Is it
[01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:22.820]   onion Omega? Is it onion onion? What's the onion? Is that it's got to be a tour or something?
[01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:28.660]   No, it's not. Oh, it could be though. So there's potential there. It's actually a small little
[01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:34.060]   Linux computer on a chip. What? Similar to Raspberry Pi. You want to open it? So it's
[01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:38.020]   like the windows and unboxing. It's like the windows 10 Raspberry Pi. Do you have my over
[01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:42.500]   the shoulder or no? Yes, you do. It's like a because that's a big thing by the way. Aida
[01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:46.900]   fruit. Now is the windows 10. Yeah, which I don't like at all. But yeah, I'm glad I
[01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:50.980]   do. Yeah, there's no reason to do windows 10. But let's not get on that one. Yeah, I
[01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:54.660]   like the puzzle piece. Yeah, isn't that cool? This is a very nice box. This was a kickstarter
[01:49:54.660 --> 01:50:00.900]   project. And what's cool about it is it uses open WRT as the operating system. So that's
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:05.340]   the router operating system? Yes, exactly. So it's very small. It's for embedded. It
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:09.100]   comes with this thing you're taking out now is the extension board, which allows you to
[01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:15.420]   add add on modules or hook up those pins as GPIO pins. Okay, this is the core unit here.
[01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:19.300]   This is the actual product. Look how small and cute that is. So is that a processor?
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:23.660]   That's a processor exactly. And that this is what actually runs Linux. Now by itself,
[01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:26.380]   just like that, you can't really hook it up or do anything with it. But it comes with
[01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:31.300]   a mini extension board, which is the other box. Okay. And so when you put those two together
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:37.340]   and turn it on, what it does is it automatically sets up its own AP. So you can connect to
[01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:41.540]   it. It has Wi-Fi built in, by the way. There's the USB port. There's the USB. There's a Wi-Fi
[01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:47.060]   chip on there. Yeah. Yeah. Where do I dock it? So just line it up. Line up the shapes.
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:50.420]   It's got pins on the side. It's got pins on that side. It's line it up. Does it matter
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:54.500]   which way I go? It does. Yeah, but you've got to match up the shapes. Match up the shapes.
[01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:58.700]   Match up the shapes. Yeah, one of them has you had the other way. Got a corner. Oh, there
[01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:02.900]   it is. Yeah, yeah. It's like an SD card holder. I'd be I would not be good at this. Oh, sure
[01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:06.220]   you would. This is easy. And do I have to push it harder or is that? Yeah, push it until
[01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:09.860]   it goes all the way in. Okay. It's a little hard to put together there. Yeah. But the great
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:13.580]   thing about this is they're developing some really cool add-on modules for it. It's very
[01:51:13.580 --> 01:51:18.420]   small. It's really built for IoT. It's built for the Internet of Things. You could hide
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:23.260]   that inside of something and be monitoring sensors or running some sort of little locate
[01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:28.260]   me program. There's all sorts of things you can do with it. It's running. It's running
[01:51:28.260 --> 01:51:32.700]   Linux. A mini Linux? I mean, it's a it's a scale down version of Linux. This is the
[01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:36.220]   memory chip here, right? Yeah. So how much memory does that? That's a good question. See,
[01:51:36.220 --> 01:51:39.300]   I knew you're going to ask. I wish I had a magnifying glass. I could probably tell you.
[01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:43.860]   Yeah. And then this daughter. I think it's I want to say it's like 16 meg. Look at that.
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:49.660]   Oh, there's the specs there. 64 meg. I was close. It's so okay. 16 megaflash, 64 megafrag.
[01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:55.500]   Exactly. This is also what your router looks like. If you took everything out of your router,
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:52:00.740]   you absolutely could. And then, okay, so if I want to put this daughter board on, I do
[01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:04.780]   the same. Yeah, you would actually take it off. Yeah, you would take it off of the, you
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:09.420]   take the mini one and put that one on. All right. And then you get GPIO. And then you
[01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:13.380]   get GPIO. Exactly. These pin connectors. And there's also the add-on boards which plug
[01:52:13.380 --> 01:52:18.660]   into those pin slots there as well, the purple pins. So you can do ethernet add-on board
[01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:22.500]   or you can do a Bluetooth add-on board. This all comes with the kit. It all comes with
[01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:27.900]   how much? Good question again. I think it's 35. It's not bad. You still haven't Raspberry
[01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:33.660]   Pi like Raspberry Pi like but small, the integrated Wi-Fi is a huge plus for people
[01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:37.460]   because Raspberry Pi does not come with an integrated Wi-Fi. You have to get a much
[01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:44.460]   to have the Wi-Fi built in. There it is. 2,250. What? 2,250. What? Really simple to get started.
[01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:48.580]   It's not as cheap as the chip, right? Which is starting to ship any day now. I can't
[01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:52.940]   wait for that to come. I have kick started the chip. Yep. I did too. That was the $9.
[01:52:52.940 --> 01:53:02.060]   $9. Yeah, which everyone says that's impossible. But you know what's amazing is the incredible
[01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:08.500]   price performance curve in microelectronics as things get micromanagerized. The cost
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:14.900]   goes down while the power goes up. It's just crazy. It is crazy. And it's what's powering
[01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:18.820]   our whole world including this Internet of Things, the ability to take what is functionally
[01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:24.900]   a full computer including wireless Internet access into something this size for $22.
[01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:31.100]   You could put this in anything and make it Internet capable. Yep. And Kudos to the developers.
[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:35.780]   They've done a great job with the setup. Now they're having some trouble getting the documentation
[01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:39.940]   because they've been so busy shipping these things out. But I did find some documentation
[01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:44.100]   was able to get it set up in about five minutes. Like I said, it comes, it starts to access
[01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:50.940]   point when you connect to the access point, you go to a web page and type in your local
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:55.660]   SSID and password for your local wireless. And then it goes out, updates the system,
[01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:59.180]   reboots and you're ready to go. They're working on some other things like this, the onion
[01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:04.540]   console, which will be a desktop-like environment for you to make it a little bit easier to
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:10.500]   use. And they've also got a cloud app with APIs already set up so that you can connect
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:14.500]   multiples of these things and have them open the cloud and just run your API calls against
[01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:18.660]   them so you don't have to actually connect to it directly at all.
[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:25.740]   You'd be crazy not to become a maker in this day and age. The tools are so easy, so integrated
[01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:30.660]   and the potential is so huge. I want to see your Halloween projects. All right. Let's
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:35.660]   just do Halloween projects, everybody, and send them along to us and we'll show them
[01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:38.980]   and talk about them. I'm not going to pull this apart. I'm afraid of breaking it. It
[01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:43.940]   does come apart kind of hard. So I'll let you, well, if I had a screwdriver or something,
[01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:48.300]   I could do that. Yeah. Very cool. That's the onion omega and what was the URL for that
[01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:57.060]   Brian that you found it on? Onion.io. Onion.io. That is the best web address to have.
[01:54:57.060 --> 01:55:08.180]   Onion. Onion.io. Onion.io. Happy podcast today, everybody. Yes, this is international podcast
[01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:13.180]   today. I'm not making that up. Somebody else made it up. But if you go to international
[01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:19.860]   podcast day.com, I think we should celebrate. Yeah. Podcasts are an amazing medium that
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:25.180]   have kept me fed for the last 10 years. But I think also kept many of you entertained
[01:55:25.180 --> 01:55:34.620]   and formed, kept you company and have transformed the media. Absolutely. So what will you do
[01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:43.260]   on podcast day, hashtag podcast day, September 30th, international podcast day. And they're
[01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:49.940]   doing a live stream on BLAB for international podcast day. So I bet you there'll be a number
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:58.180]   of people in there. Here's the historical timeline of podcasts and podcasting resources
[01:55:58.180 --> 01:56:04.700]   and all sorts of stuff. That's neat. Happy podcast day, everybody. Thanks for being here.
[01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:10.940]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 130 p.m. Pacific for 30 p.m. Eastern time
[01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:20.300]   20 30 UTC. You can watch live at Twit.TV slash live. You can also download audio and video
[01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:28.180]   from us to it.TV slash twig or from wherever you get your podcasts on international podcast.
[01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:31.740]   If you'd like to join us in studio, a couple of nice members of the audience, just email
[01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:36.540]   tickets at twit.TV will put a chair out for you. Thanks, Aaron. Yeah, great to have
[01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:39.700]   you come. Always good to be here. Thanks to NetApp, your employer for letting you take
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:45.900]   the afternoon off. Thank you, NetApp. I bet you have to go back to work. I do. We'll see
[01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:51.900]   all the rest of you. I'll be back here Saturday. The new screen savers, Jason Callicannis is
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:56.140]   my cohost. That should be a lot of fun. The tech guy show as well. We'll see you then.
