[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   As time for Twig this week in Google, Stacey Higginbotham is joined by Kevin Tofel.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.840]   Jeff has the week off. We'll talk about Huawei. What is going on?
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.840]   Is the United States just trying to destroy the company? Or is there really reason for
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.400]   concern? Google's internal civil war. We've got a lot of stuff in the changelog, including
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.400]   an improvement in Google Duo. We'll talk about that a whole lot more coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.320]   NetCasts you love. From people you trust.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.680]   This is Twig.

[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:33.520]   verse, Facebook, Twitter, and all the rest with us today. As mostly always, certainly always as
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.000]   often as we can get her. Stacey Higginbottom of Stacey on IOT.com, this IOT podcast, Gigas Stacey.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.400]   Final week in her temporary home before she makes the move coast to coast.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.720]   Third coast to west coast. Do you call the Gulf the third coast? That is what people in the Gulf
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.840]   call it. Although I'm not really on a coast. Austin's pretty landlocked. It's true. We're so
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.160]   landlocked. We have a river that we call Lake. That's right. I really amused me when I first
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.880]   saw the Austin Lake. There are three of them. We've turned our single river, which is the Colorado
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.480]   River, but not that Colorado River into three lakes. It's a Colorado River. I may be joining
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.240]   you. Someday when we retire, we want to retire. We're thinking we're tiring to Seattle.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.720]   Well, if you visit, I will have you over and get to know the area. There you go. You could be our
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.640]   welcome wagon. Ta-da. I am welcoming. We extend the welcome mat, the red carpet to Kevin Tofel
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.400]   from about Chromebooks.com. Stacey's comrade in arms for the IoT podcast.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.080]   Just for now. If she's not going to call people from a plane, I can't work with her.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.120]   Yeah. This could be the show where we end the podcast. Oh my god.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.760]   Because a week from today, you're flying out to Seattle for the move.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.040]   But does that mean you won't be able to do this show or his show or?
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.960]   Your show. We're recording earlier. You're doing it early. Okay. Good.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.520]   We are.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.240]   That's...
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:20.240]   Kevin, we talked about this. And then this show is a maybe. Carson has me as a maybe.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.080]   We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. We like to get you whenever we can.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.440]   So Huawei,
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:35.280]   anything else to talk about, man? Well, there is, but this is big.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.920]   A big one. And mostly because it's an evolving story.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.880]   At one, devolving might be a better term for it.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.800]   This has been going on since the Obama administration. I think it was 2012 or 2013,
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.360]   when the Commerce Department warned American companies about using equipment from Chinese
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.440]   companies, including Huawei, but also, as I remember, ZTE, which they've since basically put
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.800]   out of business with these kinds of accusations and maybe shall me.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:16.000]   So as far back as seven years, there have been people saying, "Waw away. We don't know who owns
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.720]   them. We know the guy who runs it was former Chinese military, former People's Liberation Army.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:28.640]   Huawei says, "We're owned by our employees, our workers, but it's hard to prove that."
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.480]   And even if not, there's definitely the feeling that the Chinese government would have some sway
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:42.800]   on Huawei. So President Trump signed an executive order banning, which is kind of dramatic,
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.880]   Huawei gear. God, I have to get the timeline right because this seems like ages ago, but this was
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.520]   May 15th. Yeah, I was like, it was so recent. One week ago,
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   I forgot that he declared a national emergency in this executive order and said the United States,
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.640]   companies in the US cannot use telecom services that are solely owned, controlled,
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.880]   or directed by a foreign adversary. I'm not sure who defines foreign adversary,
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:23.120]   but that began the ban on Huawei gear. Well, and somebody has been whispering in trumps here for
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.760]   a while about national security, 5G, and the telco networks. So I don't,
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:38.720]   this isn't totally surprising. The timing was kind of like, what just happened? And as we can see
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.560]   from all the stories on the rundown, the fallout is tremendous. The dominoes fell, including Google
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.280]   saying, "Well, Reuters said Google's going to, I never saw confirmation from Google, but
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.800]   Reuters said Google was going to withdraw Huawei's Android license, which
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.440]   suspending business with Huawei. So without Android, Huawei phones will have to run some other,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.320]   well, they can run Android, it's open source, but they can't run Google apps. So they don't have
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.200]   the Google version of Android. And they're middle. Go ahead.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.520]   I was just real quick. I was going to say when this news hit or was reported by Reuters,
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.880]   the first thing I did was go back to a website that my team worked on inside of Google.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:27.360]   It's the Android Enterprise Recommended Devices list. There were about 240 Android devices on
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.960]   there, 24 of which at that time were Huawei. So I tweeted out, if this report pans out, or if,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.760]   you want to watch and see if it's going to pan out, watch this page. And sure enough,
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.080]   I went back today, granted we already know at this point that Google has said what it said,
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.840]   but all the Huawei devices are gone from that page.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:53.280]   That's confirming. They don't sell Huawei on the Google store. Microsoft pulled Huawei's laptops
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.880]   from the Microsoft store, but would not say anything about withdrawing the Windows license.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.800]   That would be the kiss of death, I think, for Huawei laptops. Arm, according to the BBC,
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:12.240]   has told its staff to stop working with Huawei. Huawei's phones are running on
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.000]   ARM chips. Qualcomm says we won't sell you chips. So that means Huawei can neither buy chips from
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.080]   Qualcomm or make its own ARM chips. That's probably the bigger roadblock here.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.000]   That is the... Yeah, Stacy, I was going to say you're the chip girl, but in my mind,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.160]   without having an ARM architecture license, they can't make those Kirin chips.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.720]   They can't make... Yeah, a lot of their chips. They're using ARM-based chips in their telco gear.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.360]   They're using it in some of their server stuff. They're using it in their smartphones.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:53.600]   I mean, this is not... That is kiss of death stuff. To say, "Okay, we're not working with you anymore,"
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:03.360]   means to develop your own architecture for silicon is a process. So their option would be to try
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:11.280]   to license what MIPS... Well, MIPS is the last company left because Intel and Broadcom both
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:20.080]   followed suit. Right. And Zine links, by the way. So it's really... They've been isolated.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:29.280]   Then, by the way, the story is not over. Then, while it was granted a temporary reprieve,
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:38.640]   and Google resume patches. Okay, well, that's patching. So that's basically anyone...
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.680]   Because if you have, and if you have bought Huawei-based phones and their Android-based
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.520]   Huawei phones, if Google doesn't support patching for them, you're like, "Aah!" Somebody told the
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:56.160]   government, "You know, if you cut all that off, that's bad for us." Yeah, don't you have a Huawei
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.640]   phone? I had a P20. I mean, obviously, I'm not going to use it anymore. You know, who has a
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:06.560]   Huawei phone and loves it is Paul Therat. I forgot to ask him about it because we were talking about
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.200]   this. I forgot to ask him what he plans to do with his Huawei phone. But the Huawei,
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.240]   the latest Huawei phones have Leica lenses, their amazing cameras. They're really incredible
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.960]   phones. According to people who use them, I didn't like Huawei's flavor of Android.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.840]   I can't remember the name of it. The Mio. I want to say the Mui.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:32.480]   E-M-U-I. E-M-U-I. E-Mui version of Android I did not like. But that was because I think mostly
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.320]   it was Chinese-centric. It was made for their market, not for our market.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:42.640]   See, this doesn't really hurt them in the US because they don't really have business in the US.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.920]   Obviously, it hurts them. They do sell laptops here. They do sell a lot of laptops.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:52.240]   But well, I was going to say they also, under their honor brand, sell some low and mid-range
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:57.120]   phones in the US market. A lot of people have those because you could get them unlocked on the
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.560]   Amazon or direct from, I think it was consumer. Huawei.com or something in the US. You could
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.440]   actually purchase them. There's a crap ton of those honor devices out there which are a brand
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:13.680]   of Huawei. This also, not that it's a huge deal, but this also means we've gone from two breakables,
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.000]   I mean, foldables down to one because now the Huawei X.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.360]   It'll happen in tri-fold. So the Department of Commerce
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:32.640]   yesterday announced a 90-day reprieve on an import ban against Huawei. It's the temporary
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:41.120]   general license on a limited basis. Partly, that's to give Telco's time to find alternative
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.560]   solutions. Partly, it's to get updates for those Android devices.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.760]   I wonder if there was some sort of political thing happening here because the declaration
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:11:00.000]   of a national emergency is weird. For any country to ban something that is both embedded in the
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.400]   businesses of a lot of its own companies, this seems not well thought out.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:18.560]   It also seems like, it's basically like, go ahead and do this without thinking about
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:26.240]   the implications. So the fact that a national emergency gives Trump powers to do this that he
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.600]   otherwise wouldn't have by going through Congress for trade agreements and that sort of thing.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:39.760]   I'm not, this is not really a little xenophobic. It feels like a trade war,
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:49.200]   a shooting war has broken out over trade. Remember that Huawei's CFO, Meg Wanzhou, was arrested.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:58.000]   She was arrested in Canada and is being held prior extradition to the US because apparently,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.800]   she oversaw dummy corporations that Huawei used to sell against our sanctions to Iran.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:11.200]   So that could be part of it. What has yet to happen, as far as I know, make it correct me if
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:17.280]   I'm wrong. None of the, even though the US defense intelligence agencies have apparently briefed
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:24.240]   our allies and briefed, I don't know if they briefed Congress, but we have yet to see any evidence
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:30.720]   that of Huawei spying either industrial espionage or cyber warfare against the US.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:37.520]   But that's the presumption or maybe it's proactive in case they do, but there's no evidence they've
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:43.760]   done it. They've done some shady things. We have been looking for evidence for seven years or more.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:49.120]   They've done some shady business things, but they've been business practices, not espionage.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:56.240]   My guess is in all that investigation, they've either done nothing and nothing was found,
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.640]   or they've done a heck of a lot that's going to scare the big Jesus out of people, and they
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.880]   don't want to tell us. You can think of reasons why they wouldn't tell us. Besides that, you could
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.120]   think maybe revealing what they know would reveal sources, which you, of course,
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.480]   in spycraft, you don't want people to know how we know what we know.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.840]   Maybe the intelligence agencies are saying, "Well, we know, but we can't tell you why or how."
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:28.320]   You would think Google, Qualcomm, Intel, one of these microsoft companies would at least say
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:36.320]   something like, "We have it on good authority," or "We've seen evidence of malfeasance by Huawei.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.800]   They haven't." They haven't. They've actually said very little.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:48.400]   And what makes me think they've been compelled to do this by some sort of national security letter
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:55.040]   type order that also orders secrecy, that orders it's a gag order as well.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.600]   Does that make sense? That does make sense. I could see that happening because, yes,
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:06.480]   it's clearly disruptive to their businesses, not obviously as much as Huawei's, and they clearly
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:12.800]   are trying to... This is not something anyone wants to deal with. Huawei is not an insignificant
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:19.680]   supplier or a participant in these markets. Remember the last time this happened?
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:30.000]   It was ZTE, which essentially has been destroyed by this. $3 billion of market value was wiped out.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.200]   I liked ZTE phones, by the way. I was a real fan. They are the second largest telecom
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:43.520]   manufacturer in China, $17 billion in revenue in 2017. They were banned in the US a year ago,
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:52.720]   May 2018, and pretty much tanked them. I'm curious what this means for companies like Qualcomm
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:58.960]   have actually a lot of joint ventures in China because that's how you have to operate there.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:04.080]   And I know Google doesn't, but Qualcomm does. I don't know about Broadcom.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:13.520]   There are actually several very close-knit collaborations that companies have done in the space with
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:18.800]   China that I'm sure they're sitting there going, "What do we do now? What does this mean?"
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:26.800]   Huawei itself is saying, they're very bullish to say, "We can handle this. We can make our own
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.080]   chips. We can make our own operating system. We've been planning this for months. We've been
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:36.720]   stockpiling parts from US companies. We're not worried. We value our close relationships
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.680]   with our partners," they said, "but recognize the pressure some of them are under as a result of
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.720]   politically motivated decisions. We're confident this regrettable situation can be resolved and
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.560]   our priority remains to continue to deliver world-class technology and products to our
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:55.520]   customers around the world." I remember talking to Huawei's US marketing representative
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:04.320]   at an event last Christmas. She was adamant that data did not get fed back from
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:09.200]   Huawei devices to China. She said, "Our data center for US devices is in Germany."
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.680]   But how do you prove a negative? You can't prove a negative. That's right.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:21.360]   So I would throw out a couple things. One, building an operating system takes time.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.080]   I don't know how long they've been working on it, but they have been working on it for a while.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:32.560]   Building a chip and designing a chip from scratch is a two to three year plus you've got the new
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:38.160]   chip problem process. Look at what Intel did with its designing modems, for example.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:44.240]   They do have, Risk 5 is an option. That is a chip architecture that's open sourced. It's
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:52.400]   a risk-based architecture, just like ARM. You could see them design under that
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.880]   in a chip, but you still wouldn't expect to see it for two years at least.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:03.680]   It's interesting because ARM is not a US company. They have a lot of
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.760]   companies, companies, SoftBank, they were started in the UK.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:14.240]   His designs contain technology originated in the US. It was originally Apple,
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.720]   was one of the big investors in ARM, but they sold their part a long time ago.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:24.240]   They have a lot of design work happens here in the US as well.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:30.800]   This is why this is so difficult. There's not like everything in the US.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:40.720]   The number one American made cars a Honda. These borders don't exist in many ways,
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:46.320]   in business anymore. There's no walls around the countries. Is that what you're trying to say?
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:52.560]   You could build a wall. It doesn't keep them out.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:59.360]   You're right. Here's a whole other thing, not to get off the track of Google with this aspect.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:05.760]   If this is a trade issue, and that's why we're being heavy handed here, and we are being very
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:11.680]   heavy handed, what about China? What is China doing that says, "Hey, well, we manufacture all
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.880]   those lives." The last thing you want to see is a hot trade war.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:25.120]   Because we are all of us interconnected. Anything unilateral from the US could very easily be
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:32.080]   responded to by China in ways that would be scary for technology. That's why this is really a story
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:42.000]   that resounds through all of technology. China has been cool to our technology firms for a decade
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.400]   or more, which is why everybody who goes over there does these weird joint ventures.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:54.480]   When you say cool, what do you mean? They have laws in place to prevent US companies from coming
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:01.280]   in and building their own... You have to work with a Chinese company. It has to be Foxconn building
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:09.520]   the iPhone, not Apple in China building the iPhone. They have enforced rules that have led
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:15.440]   US companies to decide not to locate there or compromise in significant ways that
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:25.760]   people at US companies are not comfortable with. Is that cool to the tech companies?
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.920]   Or just cool to our laissez-faire free kind of democracy?
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:40.480]   First of all, we have every right and a duty to protect ourselves. If we feel like a Chinese
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.680]   company is going to harm us, we have the right to kick them out. I don't dispute that.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:51.760]   I feel like there should at least give us some reason to believe that instead of just saying,
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:20:02.080]   "Trust us." I am concerned about the reaction. An escalating trade war is going to be problematic
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:09.520]   in a variety of ways. If it wasn't for the chip issue at this point, when I heard about this on
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.520]   Friday, they are just going to pull on Amazon. They are going to use AOSP, Android Open Source,
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:20.160]   and... They could probably do that today. They have Chinese stores already because Google
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.840]   wasn't able to sell stuff into China. Google doesn't sell them the Google.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.040]   They don't sell the services, correct? But because they were a licensee of Google,
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.960]   Android, they couldn't create by definition AOSP devices to compete. Now they can.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:42.480]   Now they can. But not if you don't have chips to run it. To me, that was the nail in the coffin
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.560]   right there because I figured, although we find it's just going to be an Android Fire or OS type
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:53.280]   experience. I remember reading that they use a lot of US parts in their phones. Admittedly,
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:21:02.000]   there's a huge trade deficit. Most of the trade is going the wrong way. But they do buy US parts
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.600]   and put them in their phones. They won't be able to get those anymore. I presume China can manufacture
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.200]   most things. I imagine they could figure out a way around that. But you're right. Without
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:17.440]   ARM, the Kirin chips are ARM-based. The chips that they use while we use are ARM-based.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:26.000]   They're good chips too. They're good. I mean, S-Paul, the Kirin 980 and all the
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.200]   latest ones, fantastic. They're really done well. It's not just a straight, but it's just
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.440]   used ARM's architecture and build a chip. They tweak things. They've got their own AI stuff.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.160]   They've got the DSP stuff. They've done a fantastic job, especially in the imaging, the cameras.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.320]   They have an architecture license just like everybody else.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.040]   I think the main thing to understand is it's not like there's a Chinese product and there's an
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.000]   American product. As somebody in the chair just said, "With how Chinese parts are F-150s not getting
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.040]   out of the driveway, we are tightly interlinked at this point. We're tightly interdependent."
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:06.400]   I feel like if we're worried about espionage, if we're worried about cyber warfare,
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.280]   we need to address that directly. I don't think saying, "Well, now we're going to
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.320]   draw a bright line and say, these are US products, these are Chinese products."
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.720]   I don't think you can do that anymore. I think that horse has left the barn years ago.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:27.760]   Am I wrong? No, but I don't know how well our commander-in-chief maybe understands that.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:33.920]   I'm also curious why haven't we seen follow-up from our allies in Europe?
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:39.920]   They're just as confused as we are apparently. Some closest allies like Canada say,
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:46.880]   "Okay, we'll take Huawei gear out of our 5G network." Some are saying, "What are you talking about?"
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:52.000]   Australia says, "What?" No. That's the problem. I don't understand.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.520]   Australia is right next door to China. If I were Australia, I'd be like, "Yeah, we'll get back to
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.560]   you on that, US." You'd think if we had evidence of spying and wrongdoing here that
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.440]   would be shared with some of our... Exactly. It would be shared with those allies.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:13.040]   I'm like, Leo, you started talking about the lack of evidence. I've been shaking my head ever
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.600]   since this all started six, seven years ago. I'm like, "Okay, let's see it. Where is it?"
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.960]   I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but we need to know.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:28.560]   I think about Australia did throw Huawei out. In fact, some say it was Australia that led the
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:36.720]   war against Huawei. I apologize. I got that wrong. Who is it that's still using Huawei gear?
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:43.280]   I mean, it's probably a change here, right? Not anymore. Not anymore, right? Not anymore.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.520]   I'm sure they're working hard on that. 5G.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:53.440]   I mean, can you imagine if you're telling AT&T to pull out, "I don't know what
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.360]   percent of their network gear is Huawei based," but it's not like they can just say,
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:03.040]   "Oh, as of Wednesday, we're shutting it all down. You'd have chaos because
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.840]   people's cellular connections would go down." It's not.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:13.360]   The other thing to remember is even though we've given them 90 days and I wouldn't be surprised to
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:18.720]   see the policy change because we seem to have a zigzag foreign policy anyway.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:26.400]   But the damage is done. It is now very clear that at the whim of the US government,
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:31.840]   any company can be cut off. Maybe that makes you think, "Well, I'm going to make sure I'm
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.320]   making darn sure I'm not dependent on the US government anymore."
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:41.840]   Stacey, you may know this. I'm thinking this really hurts the phone aspect or the tablet aspect
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.640]   far more than the networking aspect because there are more network vendors to choose from as
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:52.960]   opposed to this whole use arm on Android or you're out. Well, Nokia is one of the big network
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:59.760]   gear providers and they're running, they're not as advanced at 5G. They're still having some
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:08.560]   challenges. Huawei is either number one or number two, I can't remember. You've got
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:14.880]   Erickson, Huawei, and Nokia. Right now, you only have Erickson and Huawei with
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:21.600]   credible 5G solutions is my understanding. It's great for Erickson.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:31.920]   Yeah. At least there's choices there as opposed to Huawei's back to the corner on the phone
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:39.280]   tablet side, the mobile device side. Well, and the Virgin interviewed a professor at
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:46.000]   Georgetown's School of Business, Charles Scuba, who said, "If I'm a US company, I look at this
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.160]   national emergency ban. It says, 'I should be very careful to do business with any companies that
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:56.560]   have significant interlocking relationships with China. The chilling effect reaches very far.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:07.920]   It throws up a big wall against inter-country operations. That's the way economies has been
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:16.720]   based for years." Yeah, but this fits with the rhetoric and possibly the goals of this administration.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.680]   I think this is something President Trump said from the beginning of the campaign. He said,
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:28.400]   "China's an outlaw nation. They steal from us." And I think this was his goal from day one.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:35.040]   Do you think it's the trade imbalance that he's worried about or the stealing of the IP which
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.920]   has gone on for years? Donald Trump really understands how tariffs work.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.800]   Never mind. What was I thinking? No, I mean, he said things time and time again that show that he
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.720]   really doesn't understand how tariffs work and who pays tariffs, for instance.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:53.120]   This goes way beyond tariffs, doesn't it? Maybe this is the goal.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:27:01.920]   The problem is you can't just do that. You also have to build a 5G company in the United States.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:08.720]   You have to replace what we're cutting off or you completely disable the US.
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:15.120]   And I should add, because someone in the chat room pointed this out and they are correct,
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:20.320]   that Samsung is also doing 5G network equipment. I forgot about that. Samsung is a player.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:28.160]   And they're an ally. They're South Korean. But you probably shouldn't buy an iPhone because it's
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.800]   made in China. Get a good quality Samsung phone because it's made in South Korea.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:41.360]   Just imagine. Just imagine if the next tweet from the president is, "Yeah, I don't trust these
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:46.640]   Apple iPhones. You know where they're made?" I think he's already tweeted against Apple iPhones.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.520]   Oh, he's asked Tim Cook to move
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:55.440]   manufacture back to the US. Tim Apple, Tim Cook. I'm sorry, Tim Apple. But of course,
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:01.920]   that's really a non-starter. Anyway, at this point, this is the kind of thing. I think it wouldn't
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:08.080]   be an unreasonable policy to have a national effort to build up these skills and these technologies
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.880]   to create the manufacturing capability in the US. To say, we want to bring these jobs back,
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.680]   but we also feel it's safer. So we're going to start this process because it's going to take 10
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:22.720]   years, but 10 years from now, just as we did with foreign oil. Remember how great that worked?
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.400]   Oh, wait a minute, never mind.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:29.760]   Foxconn is working on setting up factories in Malaysia and India.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.840]   Yeah, India. Yeah. Well, they have to in India because they can't sell phones in India.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.760]   Same thing with Brazil. They're making iPhones in Brazil because Brazil has
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:42.960]   very strong tariffs against it. Phone's not made in Brazil. But we could build up that
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:49.920]   capability, but what we can't do is do it today or tomorrow. Right. We should just have
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.160]   everything made in Switzerland since it's neutral. It's neutral. Who can you trust?
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:29:01.760]   Certainly no one can trust stuff made in the US. We spied on Angela Merkel's phone,
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:11.920]   our German ally. It looks like E, the British phone companies dropped
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:18.160]   Huawei phones from its 5G network launch lineup. So this is spreading across the globe now.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:23.040]   And it's what we don't know is this prompted by fear of the United States?
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:27.600]   Is it prompted by US intelligence being shared with these countries and companies?
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.440]   We just don't know because it's not being shared with us. We don't know.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:37.120]   The real shame is it always? It took me seven years to learn how to pronounce Huawei.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:41.360]   Now that you know, you don't need it. Actually,
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.320]   I need to know. There's been a lot of calls to pronounce it correctly.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.520]   It's funny. Remember, we used to say, whoa, what is it?
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:53.840]   Whoa, wait. We did it. If I were any American company working closely with China,
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.280]   I would start building more relationships with India right about now.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:03.360]   Yeah. But honestly, I don't know how long India can be trusted.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:09.200]   The whole thing's a mess because you know what? Nationalism doesn't work anymore.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:18.320]   It's a big wide world out there. And many of the problems we face can only be addressed globally.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.800]   Climate change can't be addressed by any one country. It's a global situation.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:30.160]   So building walls, building up nationalism, closing borders, is just
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:35.280]   putting your head in the sand. It's not a long term solution to many of the problems we face.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.960]   I think we are now economically, we're a global economy. We know that.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:45.840]   All right. I don't know. There's nothing more to say, except that's what's happening.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.080]   That's the news from Lake Wopi-Gon.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.000]   And yeah, until the next one hits in five minutes with another headline.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.200]   Well, I have to say it is boring. It is not boring.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:03.920]   May you live an interesting time? Yeah, the worst Chinese curse. Yes, we do.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.960]   Wow. Wow.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:13.520]   Yeah, I just don't know what to think. We obviously have the right to protect ourselves
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.960]   against cyber warfare and espionage. And we should.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:26.880]   Yes. But if we're doing that and we have had these doubts for so long,
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:32.080]   we probably should have had better safeguards in channels in place to steer people away from
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:37.680]   Huawei equipment. It takes time to do this. You can't just do it with a stroke of a pen or a shark.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.880]   Well, you can't just go. Apparently someone thinks they can and has them.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:48.800]   It's almost like saying, oh, hey, Stacy, your house has termites. Good. Let's burn it down.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:54.400]   Actually, if my house had termites that would probably be the solution or bed bugs.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:59.760]   I mean, that bugs burn it down. Definitely. And burn the neighbor's house down too while
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:05.840]   you're at it. Burn the whole block down. Bed bugs. Yeah. Oh, I hate them.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:11.040]   I slept in a bed that had bed bugs. You did. I've never encountered bed bugs in my life, but
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:17.760]   this is in California. It was it was the Sheraton and Anaheim. And I woke up with bed bug bites.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:24.880]   I was like calling them else. Should I? Well, I got bed bugs. I understand that, but
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.960]   can you can you you don't want to take them with you? So what do you.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:33.040]   That was my thing. Do I burn my clothes? But
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:40.080]   it's all my clothes. So and I didn't I never put my suitcase on the bed. So I just was like,
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:45.200]   well, I'll just leave the t-shirt. I slept in here and shower and run.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:51.760]   You're runs far away. But so far. No, no, you haven't. Was that recently?
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.040]   Yeah, that was like two weeks ago. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:02.880]   So I'm crossing that hotel off the list. Yeah. Well, that's why I'm not I'm not trying to
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.520]   shame them, but it is a public service. I feel that people need to know. Did you did you leave a
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:15.920]   Yelp review? I don't believe you leave your clothes outside in a sealed black garbage bag for
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:21.520]   about a week in the sun. And that will that will kill sounds like you know how to get rid of
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:28.960]   bed bugs. I'm not speaking from experience, but I'm ready. I'm stocking up on biohazard tape.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.960]   I'm a bed bug survivalist.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.440]   You know, that's people worry about zombies. There are no zombies. There are bed bugs.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:42.480]   Yeah. No, I worry about some on prepare for the zombie apocalypse. Well, good luck.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.760]   It's not going to happen, but bed bugs happen. Bed bugs happen.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:53.040]   That's true. Well, I was feeling pretty relaxed. Pretty relaxed since I'm not actually in my home.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.360]   I'm in a temporary home. So I was like, well, if I bring them with me, we're just going to leave
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:01.360]   everything here. Burn it down. To Seattle. Burn it down.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.600]   Do they teach bed bug remediation at Harvard? Was that a classic?
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:14.000]   Yeah. Second. Second. Yeah. Yeah. You have to be an upperclassman to take that.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.720]   I showed it. We'll have more with Stacy and Kevin. There's got to be Chromebook news.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.800]   There's got to be. I'm going to ask you. I put it on there. Yeah. Ready. Chromebook news.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:30.400]   Coming up. But first, a word from kept tariff. You're in business. You know,
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:36.160]   that software is critical to business. But I think a lot of businesses here are running software
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:40.960]   that's really old. And here's how you know, if you've got a machine, it's kind of old, kind of dusty.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:48.160]   It's got a CRT monitor. It's running anything before Windows XP. It's got I E eight on it.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:57.440]   In an explore eight, you're using old software. That's not good. Stop. Go to keptterra.com to find

[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:31.760]   Thank you, keptterra for your support. Thank you. Because we've been using you for doing a great job.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.720]   Stacey, are you bringing your reformer your Pilates machine with you? I hope you are.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:42.240]   I am. I brought my reformer, my elliptical, my weight bench and all of my crazy weight things.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:49.760]   So you have a little gym. I do have a nice substantial gym. I take Pilates every day. I can.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:54.080]   I love Pilates. I made the yoga studio software. It made me think of that. My trainer said I
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:00.800]   should take hot yoga. Now I don't want to though. That's what they squeegee the floors after hot yoga.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:07.840]   And they probably have to. Yeah, that's true. How hot is it like a hundred degrees hot?
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:13.520]   You can get it from like 85 to I don't think people put it a hundred. That would be but maybe
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:18.000]   they do. But 85 is hot. I have to question my trainer because he says he feels nauseous the
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.080]   entire class is like, this is I should do this. This doesn't say you should not do that. It's not
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:28.880]   I mean, you can, but he says you'll love it, Leo. You can wear short shorts. So that's not a good
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:35.200]   reason. That's not a good reason. That's distressing for everyone else. Everybody else has to suffer
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:47.240]   because I want to have ventilation. I'm a lot. I love Pilates. I am a huge. A lot of
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:52.640]   ology is traditional. It's a it's a subscription software. But you can have it on your phone. You
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:57.840]   can have it on your roger. You can have it on your tablet. It's like $20 a month or like something.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:07.840]   It's not crazy. And it's on. It's Joseph Pilates. Original. Nice. But the trainers are really good.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:14.880]   And it's a it's a like I have that in addition to everything else. And it's not just Matt Pilates.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.280]   Oh, yeah. They use a reformer. Former chairs. They even have the foot corrector, which I don't
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:24.000]   even know what that is. I don't have a foot corrector. I do have a chair. Oh, I'm jealous.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:32.080]   Oh, I love my chair. I was doing work today. Let me give you guys another option real quick.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:36.880]   We're Pilates nerds. That's okay. That's okay. And I don't know if they have Pilates, but
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:41.400]   you know that Peloton makes the treadmill and the and the and the I have a
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:48.400]   bike. I love. Okay. I do not even though I love those pieces of equipment. But what I did about
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:53.520]   two months ago was I subscribed to Peloton digital for like 19 and a half dollars a month.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:59.280]   Oh, and they have the live classes that you can just do without a regular bike.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:05.920]   Exactly. I've actually been using. I have not used the yoga my wife has, but the meditation.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:12.000]   I've been doing the meditation bits with that. They have really expanded their offerings because
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.760]   they now have stretching and they've all sorts of stuff. That's really high intensity, interval
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:22.080]   training, all kinds of stuff. So you don't need the Peloton equipment if you don't want to, you know,
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:26.480]   draw a four-grinder more. Yeah, because it's really expensive. Yeah. But you get the live stuff,
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:32.480]   you get the on-demand stuff. I have access to like 10,000 videos and and all the classes.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:38.800]   It's fantastic. We're healthy nerds though. I don't I never look for it. Healthy nerds.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:45.680]   Oh, Pilates is awesome. And it is stretch out and make you strong and flexible balance also
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:54.240]   for old folks like me. That's important because we tend to stop and tauter. You could just stop
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:58.400]   taking that afternoon martini. I think it could be the afternoon martini is causing the tottering.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:05.280]   It could be. I don't I don't believe in that. Oh, Google's Civil War. I don't know. Do you credit
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:12.240]   this article from Fortune? I do like the illustration. I love Beth. Beth Cowett. Oh, you know her. Okay.
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:16.320]   Some employees say Google's losing touch with it. Don't be evil motto.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:20.400]   Happens when you get too big. And of course, we've seen they drop that.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.840]   They and they dropped the model. Well, they sort of dropped the model.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:28.800]   Oh, that's like, wait a second. Yeah. But they I mean, I think they dropped it and brought it back.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:34.880]   But how meaningful is that? I mean, it started, of course, with employee protests
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:43.680]   and walkouts and so forth. But it also could be that it's challenging as a company gets bigger to
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:50.400]   keep your vision thing going. You think? Well, if your vision thing is predicated on technical
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:57.440]   genius above being like a nice human, which I think is a fairly common thing in the tech world
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:05.200]   is like, Hey, your tech skills or your whatever, your reporting skills, your value is a cog in the
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:10.960]   employment machine. You serves your value or you serves the value of other people in that
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.320]   same machine. Well, and when any company triples,
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:22.160]   its workforce in eight years, which is what Google has done, it's going to be very hard
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:30.800]   to maintain. You know, Apple has an Apple University with the sole purpose of inculcating Apple's DNA
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:39.440]   into new employees because they want continuity in Apple's beliefs. I don't does Kevin, you didn't
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:44.400]   work for Google, but you were inside Google a contractor. Do they have anything like that?
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:52.080]   So as a contractor, I went through some pretty, I'd say basic training because it was only like
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:58.160]   three hours. And they were with from for day one people that are contractors, you could be a
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:02.320]   temp, a vendor or a contractor and you would go to this training. And it was more around
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:08.800]   protecting Google's information, being security conscious, what your NDA meant,
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.960]   what could happen if you broke the NDA or, you know, did something you shouldn't do,
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:18.000]   which is typical and expected. And even regular Google employees would go through that as well.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   I didn't really see much on values or that don't be evil or or any of that. And, you know,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.280]   one experience doesn't mean that's the way it is for everybody, but I didn't see that at all.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:43.120]   The other problem that Beth talks about is leaks. And she says a lot of activists,
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:48.560]   including Liz Fong-Jungs who quit Google after the walk out, don't like product leaks because
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.560]   then it gives management a reason not to tell people employees what's happening.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:44:00.400]   And so that's another problem, you know, programmers are getting more and more powerful.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:05.280]   They tend to be difficult to manage anyway.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:13.920]   I think it's really interesting that these massive companies, which really used to be able to
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:18.480]   set their, you know, policies and then ignore the workers, because if you don't like it,
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.760]   we'll hire somebody else can't because workers in some classes, some knowledge workers are
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:29.520]   hard to replace. So they have to listen to engineers who say, you know, sometimes I think that it's not
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:36.160]   you just have to invest more upfront. And, you know, we saw this at actually at Giga-ome,
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:41.920]   we wanted to hire people who were senior. We never wanted to train anybody because that slowed us down.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:50.880]   It wasn't. And I would say I've become very skeptical of the, you know, the talent argument
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.520]   in the sense that someone is irreplaceable, even if they're a terrible human being.
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:45:02.240]   It's just, it's hard to replace them. It's going to, it might cut into your margins, perhaps, or
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:07.600]   slow your delivery. And those are real problems. But I think part of it is that companies aren't
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:17.200]   building a pipeline and they kind of, and I think that's, that's a really important thing that
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:24.960]   companies aren't doing. And yeah, the other way of looking at this is, oh, man, these entitled
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:34.400]   techies, they go to work for a company and they act as if they're in charge that no one ever told
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:43.520]   them no when they were young and now. And by the way, it's ruining San Francisco, for instance,
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:49.760]   is no longer a place anybody wants to live. And there was an article in the New York Times on
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:55.520]   May 21st about how people who don't have college degrees are leaving the big cities, including New
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:01.040]   York, San Francisco, Santa Clara County, Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, because they can't afford to
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:07.200]   live there anymore. And in some ways, I think there's going to be a backlash against entitled
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:14.480]   engineers, like the Google employees, because they're making a lot of money and they're changing
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:22.160]   the way cities work. And you could argue that we're seeing a backlash against the, I don't want
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:27.280]   to call it gentrification. There was actually an article possibly the New York Times, or no,
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:34.480]   I think it was the New Yorker on the Airbnbification of cities. But there is something to that. Like,
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:41.920]   when I walk in downtown Austin, there are not, it's very different as a city than like a city like
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:47.920]   New York, which has practical services intermixed with like, you know, crazy awesome restaurants or
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:55.920]   clubs or things like that. And I think there is merit to this idea that when you have
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:02.560]   an upper middle class or wealthy class, I don't know what exactly to call it, because it's more
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:10.160]   than just the 1%, but the very wealthy who are able to live in a place and then outsource all of their
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:17.600]   services, your city becomes basically a playground for those people and kind of boring.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:24.400]   That's sad what's happened to San Francisco. Although there are also estimated 7,500 homeless
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:29.840]   people in San Francisco, so much so that the city council has hired to hire a patrol to
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:35.920]   patrol the streets and clean up human excrement. And as somebody who used to live in San Francisco,
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:41.280]   and now it goes back from time to time, there's some real problems downtown. It's really sad.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:49.200]   And there are another problem is Ubers. People are pointing to Ubers for traffic,
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:53.600]   part of the traffic problems of some of these major urban areas New York and San Francisco,
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:48:00.560]   because there are so many ride shares on the road, because apparently this upper middle class
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:06.880]   2%ers, they don't like to drive. They like to take a nice black car service, whatever possible.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:16.000]   In terms of the leaks, I just want to be clear so that people understand. I assume most people know
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.760]   in case they don't, that every, I think it's Friday, it might be Thursday, no, it's Fridays.
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:25.920]   They have an open forum with Larry and Sergei, although I think only one of them has been showing
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:31.280]   up for the last while now. And it's basically an all hands meeting. And there's discussion about
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:36.960]   what the company is doing. There are no TV seats, no temps, no vendors, no contractors that are
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.960]   allowed to go to that. I know that for a fact. I mean, it was never allowed.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.120]   You can't go because even, no, yeah.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:49.680]   No. And, you know, obviously it's held in the main building at the Googleplex,
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:53.280]   and then it's broadcast all over the world so people can tune in and whatnot.
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:58.160]   But it's broadcast in specific rooms, group rooms, like auditoriums.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:04.080]   So you have, I could not enter. It would be impossible. My badge color would not allow me entry.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:09.600]   So the leaks are coming from actual Google employees just to be very clear there.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:14.800]   Yeah. And in fact, Google's clamping down on information that can be shared into internal
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:19.200]   information. They're really trying to stop these. And I understand why, honestly.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.160]   Hmm.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:31.680]   Ah, let's see. I'm going to try to avoid any techno panic stories without Jeff to hear.
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:35.600]   How about more Chrome OS tablets on the way?
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.320]   I heard something about that. I'm glad you asked.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:45.360]   Flapjack. Flapjack. Yeah. This has been a project that's been in the works for a while,
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:51.360]   but I... Is this from Google? Well, that particular picture right there is the
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:57.840]   Acer, which is the same as the ASUS... I'm sorry, that's the ASUS, which is the same as the Acer.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:01.360]   There's really only one Chrome OS tablet out there other than the Pixel Slate right now.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:06.080]   And that's been around for since April. These are in stone progress, so I don't know what they
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:11.040]   look like. We just know some of the capabilities, the sizes. It looks like 8-inch, which would
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:17.760]   actually be new because the current Slate by ASUS and Acer, that's 10.1.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:22.880]   I missed my 7-inch... What was that? The Megal Nexus. I loved that.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:30.160]   That's just the right size. 8 would be fine. Yeah. Well, I'm going to get back to that,
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.920]   because I actually don't think so. And I'll tell you why.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:35.840]   Well, I feel like 8 would be the same sizes in Nexus, because the bezels will be smaller,
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.400]   so it'll be roughly the same form factor. I don't know.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.520]   All right. We'll talk about it. Let's talk about it now.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:50.640]   I have learned something, and I kind of made a theorem on this, that the smaller a device screen
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:57.520]   is you lose functionality equally from it having a desktop browser.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:03.680]   It's kind of a linear graph of usability oversize. And I don't know how linear it is,
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.160]   but I'll agree with you. I mean, the Apple Watch is a perfect example.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:09.280]   Usability is going way down, because that screen is so tiny,
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:13.200]   especially when you stand next to a 30-inch Surface Studio.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:19.520]   You know, there's a big difference. Yeah. I mean, a small Chrome OS tablet sounds great,
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:24.720]   and I actually had drinks with one of the folks that watches this show on Saturday,
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:30.000]   this past weekend. And we had a long talk about Chrome phones, perhaps, and Chrome tablet,
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:36.400]   smaller Chrome devices. And I just, after using the Acer, which came out back in April,
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:39.840]   granted it's not a performance powerhouse. That's the first issue I had with it, but
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:45.200]   it was hard to use a desktop browser on a screen that was 10.1 inches. And now they're
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:50.560]   looking at eight inches. And I'm like, no, and people want Chrome phones for some good reasons.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:57.360]   Google can control the update cycle, for example, and so on. But no, I just, it sounds great in
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:02.880]   theory. But if you've used a small tablet, it's pretty limited when it has a desktop browser.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:07.280]   And to your point, I mean, the next seven was Android, not Chrome OS.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:12.480]   So your point would be that Chrome OS is aimed at smaller screens, so has more
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:17.600]   affordances for smaller screens. But Chrome OS really is a desktop operating system that needs a
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:22.880]   bigger screen. That's my opinion. If we were going to see a Google-Dew a Chrome phone,
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:28.720]   what I would like to see is something along the lines of the Samsung DEX, where it's an Android
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:35.760]   phone, right? It runs Android. And then when you dock it, it then runs Chrome OS on your
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:40.160]   monitor. That's a good idea. Yeah, that is a good idea.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:48.560]   The Samsung DEX isn't great because it's a Samsung OS that's weird. But the idea is great. I
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:54.720]   mean, this thing, this is the S10 Plus. This is a desktop-grade processor. It's got a terabyte of
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:53:00.000]   storage. It's got 12 gigs of RAM. I mean, that's a computer. All you need is a software.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.400]   We've been talking about this for a while. I mean, like, I feel like all the way back in 2008,
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.880]   we were talking about docking our phones, Granite. They did not have the processing power back then.
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:15.440]   But I mean, there's reasons why we don't do this. And I'm not sure what those reasons are.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:19.920]   That's why I'm thinking. The reason one is Android does not scale. So I like your point of view.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:25.120]   I like your point of view, which is Chrome OS for the desktop, Android for the portable.
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:31.600]   OK. Yeah, see, see, DEX, Stacy, if you haven't seen DEX, it's basically an Android.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:35.920]   Yeah, it's like an Android desktop. And Android is not a desktop operating system. It's not meant
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:40.640]   for that. Yeah, you can use it that way, but it's not ideal. Chrome OS is definitely a desktop
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:46.480]   system, definitely not geared towards using as a mobile interface. So my thought was, hey,
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:50.000]   why not have the two in a sense and run one or the other? And the nice thing is,
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:57.280]   granted with a Chrome OS on that phone or device, once it always has internet connectivity for starters,
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:01.600]   you also have access to all of your stuff in the cloud, all your Google stuff.
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:07.120]   But if you have local stuff in Android today on a Chromebook, you can move and access Android
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:13.280]   information between the Android container and Chrome OS. So now you've got all your phone data
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:17.600]   right there as well. So to me, it's like, once the right design comes in, the right processing
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:22.720]   power, because I'm not convinced that ARM Chromebooks are the way to go, just having
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:27.920]   used so many of them. But again, my needs are probably more than most people. Then maybe this
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:33.200]   could happen, but I don't want to see a Chrome on a phone by itself. And because then Andrew is
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:39.280]   running in a container, there's a small performance hit, just have it be like a not a dual boot system,
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:45.360]   but almost like the Motorola Atrix. Remember that the laptop, why did that fail? You put your phone
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:50.080]   in the laptop and it would boot up to some obscure Linux UI and I was like, what is this?
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:56.720]   But people know Chrome. So if that phone booted up into Chrome OS on a monitor, that's familiar.
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:59.680]   So that might be good for kids too.
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:05.280]   So just to be clear, you haven't seen any hardware called flapjack. What you're looking at is the
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:13.840]   chromium commits that contain this string flapjack and additional information related, including
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:20.320]   some designation C18 and C19. Yep. Yep. So now you know that the panels that are there, and I've
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:25.040]   already looked up all the specs on those, you know, it's going to have a digitizer. So it will have a
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:31.440]   pen say a Wacom digitizer. Wacom, yes. Took me a few years to say that, learn that, how to say that too.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:38.000]   Did I do it so they get it right? You did well. In fact, we even know the processor. If you scroll
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:44.400]   down, I believe we can see that there's a media tech processor in there 81, 83, if I recall correctly,
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:48.480]   with wireless charging support, which would that would be a first for a Chrome OS to help it.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:56.720]   And you say, yeah, you don't know who the manufacturer is, but you say, you think it might be Google?
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:02.880]   I wondered. I thought so because it said there were references to project flapjack. And to me,
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:08.560]   that's like a typical Google thing, you know, project, crostini and project this and project that.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:13.440]   But there are other Chromebooks that do have the word project in them that are not Google.
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:18.400]   So I'm going to go with a backup guest just for the heck of it. And this one's going to come out of
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:24.080]   the left field. But I think Lenovo, they're one of the few folks that still make Android tablets,
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:30.640]   kind of low-end stuff, but they also make a high-end Lenovo Chromebook with a 4K display and so on.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:36.640]   They're not in the Chrome OS tablet game yet. So I'm thinking, huh, could be Lenovo, but that's
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.360]   just my gut. I've seen no evidence of that whatsoever.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:47.680]   So any time frame you think for this? I, based on the code and where they're at,
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:56.640]   I would be shocked if it would be before October. I'll say fourth quarter of this year. And I'm
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:01.200]   judging that based on what I see them working on. You know, I mean, you can tell when they're almost
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.640]   done designing a product when they're just fixing minor bugs, but when they're trying to get the
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:09.680]   LEDs to light up with a battery powered. Yeah. Yeah. So you're probably a good
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:14.480]   four to six months away minimum. Yeah. Okay. Flapjack.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:18.800]   Flapjack. Look, look. Now I want pancakes, you guys. It's terrible.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:23.360]   If you like Flapjack, you'll like our new operating system, Syrup.
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:34.880]   It's lickable. The geek benches you're seeing on this, are they fast or not? This is
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:39.920]   not so much. And that's why I say don't expect this to be like a Chrome phone kind of chip.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:46.000]   They're roughly comparable to like a Celeron, maybe a Pentium, maybe. And I'm not saying there's
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.920]   anything wrong with that because there's a media tech. That's all you'd expect from a media tech.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:55.280]   No, no. A media tech has been doing some really good. Yeah. They have. Yeah. Okay.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:00.480]   Yeah. They're coming up with the world, man. I mean, like anybody, they started out low and now
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:06.160]   they're doing like bigger and better. They'll get there. Let me ask Mr. About Chromebooks. In fact,
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:09.920]   do you think Chrome OS runs better under arm or Intel?
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:18.640]   Well, define better. I mean, faster? No, I'd say Intel. Intel's. Well, that's better, I guess.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:25.120]   You might say, you might say, well, the Android apps run better on the arm chips because they're
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.640]   immediately for our you have an advantage with Android apps. If you're going to run it. Yeah,
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:33.760]   I think it's a minimal advantage, but I could see, I could see that being a differentiation.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:39.200]   But in terms of performance, I mean, let's put it this way. There's a Chromebook in the works called
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:43.040]   Chezza. I think we've talked about it before on the show that's going to run on the Snapdragon
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:50.000]   845, although maybe they'll switch to 855 at this point and it'll have LTE. It'll be a, I presume,
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:57.520]   a tablet based on what I've seen. But I am not sure that a mid to high end Chromebook user,
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:04.720]   like, is going to be happy with an arm processor like that. Chrome OS is built on Linux just as
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:12.960]   much of Android is, but it's not light like Android. So I skew towards the Intel processors.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:17.200]   Perfect example. And again, not everybody's a developer. I get that. But I want to use Android
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:25.680]   Studio in Linux on Christina, which I can do now. Google says the recommended minimum hardware
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:31.520]   is a core I5 and not the core I5 with that's in the pixel book or the pixel slate,
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:35.920]   because those are Y series processors that use low, lesser, less power. They want the
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:40.400]   use series. So I'm testing a use series Chromebook right now with Android Studio because
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:44.240]   it runs on the slate, but the builds happen three times faster on the use series.
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:53.440]   So arm, for me, it's just not an option for basic Chromebook use. Absolutely. No problem, but I
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:57.760]   depends on the type of user you are, what you need to do, quite honestly.
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:02.640]   And based on what you said about screen size, what's the minimum Chromebook screen you would
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:08.880]   recommend 13, 14, 15? I'm kind of partial to the 12 and a half of the slate and above. Like,
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:14.080]   I'm testing a 13 and a half right now and there are 14 and 15 inch displays up to 4k.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:18.480]   Some people are happy with the 11.6, which is a pretty standard. That's like the smallest
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:24.320]   typical Chromebook display. I'm just happy that they're moving all towards 1080p
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:29.520]   displays because the 720p display is on the older ones. And that's just kind of lame at this point,
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.920]   considering all the video people watch on these things and whatnot. So I think it's personal
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.400]   preference for me. It's got to be at least 12 and a half inches.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:41.040]   Now, okay. And then you may want even more with this new virtual desk.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:46.880]   Yeah, this is something I love in Linux. Use it all the time.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:53.120]   Use it on Mac OS. Use it all the time. Use it on Windows. I have to learn different
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:01:00.080]   key commands for each one, but even Windows supports it in a little janky way. The idea is
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.160]   that you can go full screen with your apps, but you're going to have different workspaces.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:09.600]   So, you know, it's easy to slide to the next app, the next full screen app, or have multiple
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:15.040]   windows open in the same workspace, the multiple related windows. So is that coming to Chrome OS?
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:20.880]   It is. It is. If you scroll down, there's an actual video from the developers that I found
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:25.120]   because they're testing this internally. They're developing it and testing it.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.440]   And if you click that, there's no sound. So that's fine. And you'll see he's actually demonstrating
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.320]   where they're at in the project. You can see he's moving to another desk, moving his apps.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:38.320]   And the funny thing is, I mean, Chrome OS has a desktop, but you can't put anything on it.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.160]   You can't use it. So this, like, to me, this is like the first time we're actually getting some
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:46.480]   value out of having a space, a workspace, right? Desktop. Desktop's always just been like the
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:51.120]   wallpaper for the app. Yeah, that's it. You can't pin anything there or do anything with it.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:58.480]   I like that. That'll be nice. Yeah. Yeah. It looks like they were targeting Chrome OS 76,
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:06.880]   which is due out in beginning of middle of June. But now I'm thinking 77 because the freeze date
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:12.720]   for code has passed for 76. But by the end of the summer, I think you'll see this. And I can't
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:19.280]   wait because I can group my things, my desktops, by video consumption and social media and development,
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.880]   just three finger tab in overview mode and switch with switch. It's so much easier and so much faster.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:29.360]   Well, that's our Chromebook segment. Whenever we can get to the Kevin Tofelon,
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.880]   we're going to get the latest Chromebook news. Thank you.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:37.680]   On Chromebooks dot com.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:45.920]   Yeah, and I have no take on Chromebooks. I'm like, my daughter may use one next year.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:51.520]   And if that's the case, I will have questions. Yeah, she'll. They've got Mac books actually
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:57.040]   right now. Really? Wow. That's pretty fancy. Nice. Pretty fancy.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.000]   They're there are twenty and that Mac books. So never mind.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.400]   Backing off. Never mind. Do you want to talk about Qualcomm? Yeah, go ahead.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:14.160]   I was, you know, you sense that I was kind of ambivalent about what's next. I don't.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.640]   You're like, yeah, do I want to talk about grabs me.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:25.760]   But Qualcomm, the FTC today, ruled that Qualcomm's licensing practices are not 100% kosher.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:30.240]   Let's talk. Right. Went down 10%. The most volatile stock on them on the market. Rowan.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.040]   It was it was a US District Court judge. I'm sorry.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:38.640]   Okay. US District Court judge in San Jose, they sided with the Federal Trade Commission.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:44.160]   So the Federal Trade Commission had brought an antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm two years ago.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.400]   Yeah, it's been a long time. Yeah. Yeah. And they basically were like,
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:54.800]   welcome to appeal. This judge was like, no, I agree with the FTC, which is pretty rare, actually,
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:00.720]   that that judges do this, especially something this big. But basically, they said that
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:07.520]   Qualcomm violated antitrust law, charging high royalties for its patents to eliminate rivals.
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:13.520]   And she also said, yeah, you shouldn't you shouldn't charge royalties based on a percentage
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.720]   of the smartphones. That was this was these were exactly Apple's complaints. Yes.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:22.400]   But they were getting friend licensing, but Apple's out of it now.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:27.440]   Apple's out of it, possibly because they realized that Intel's modems weren't going to work as
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.440]   well as Qualcomm. So that's pretty clear. Apple said, if we're going to have a 5G phone,
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:36.880]   we're going to have to do a deal. Yeah. So basically, the judges saying Qualcomm has to
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:43.200]   negotiate and renegotiate its licensing agreements and stop threatening to cut off access to chips
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:51.360]   for customers to get upset. And it must license its patents to rival chip makers using friend.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:55.200]   Apple, if you could have just hung in there for a few more days.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:01.360]   Now, they are, Qualcomm is going to say they're going to seek an appeal,
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:10.000]   or seek a stay and appeal. So we'll see. This is like, this is like the Oracle,
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.560]   Android, Google thing that just, you know, in five years, you just will be in front of the
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:20.480]   Supreme Court. But who knows? Yeah. Did either of you read about Qualcomm? I thought,
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:24.400]   and I don't want to spread this information. So I'm going to ask if you saw this. I thought I saw
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:29.520]   something that Qualcomm was entitled to payments of royalties, even in certain cases, even if their
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:36.160]   chips were not used. Oh, yeah. Yes. That's absolutely true. I don't remember where I saw that. But
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:41.280]   when I read it, I'm like, well, because they have, in fact, that's really the problem is they have
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:47.520]   the key patents that make almost every smartphone work, regardless of the hardware. So they're patent
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:54.720]   royalty payments, then okay. So yeah, okay. Yeah. But I mean, they did invent those things. It's not
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:06:00.080]   like they, well, but they also participated in standards organizations. And when you participate
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:05.120]   in standard organizations, a lot of times you're going to, yeah, we want that CDMA standard to go
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:10.880]   forward. We like that standard. Well, but they have, they have LTE related patents as well. I mean,
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:15.920]   they, they knew that CDMA was not going to patents. Yes, they do. They, they do. They make,
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:19.040]   did they make those inventions or do they acquire the patents? Do you know?
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.960]   You know, they've done both. I don't, I mean, it depends on the patents. I'm sure they,
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:27.040]   there's probably a mix that's not like one five cheap. Some of our hosts, some won't name names,
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:33.040]   have accused Qualcomm of basically turning into a patent acquisition firm, or they have two
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:38.000]   businesses, you know, they have the chip business, but the far more profitable business is the patent
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.640]   business. Qualcomm license. Yeah. No, I would agree with them. I mean, remember back when we
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:47.120]   thought YMAX was going to be a thing. Yeah. Qualcomm bought a bunch of companies, even though they
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:53.040]   were like screw YMAX. That's terrible. But we're going to get our bets. Yeah. Not everybody thought
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:57.680]   YMAX was going to be a thing. You know, who really liked YMAX? A little company called Sprint.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:02.880]   And you know what happened? That little company called Sprint, whatever happened to the company
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:09.680]   called Sprint. They really hurt them for years. And they're still laggardly. The FCC chairman,
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:16.480]   Ajit Pai has now said, I like that merger deal. And you know what? I do too. If they do what they
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:23.040]   said they will do, T-Mobile, which has been trying to merge with Sprint despite some, you know,
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:29.520]   kind of shade being thrown by other government agencies, has promised to deliver 5G coverage
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:38.640]   to up to 97% of the population within three years. That got Ajit Pai's attention. 99% of
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:44.640]   US population coverage within six years of the merger's close. 90% of rural Americans. That's
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:50.320]   actually to me a really important number because. Yeah. You have to do that to get any deal through
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:54.320]   in the gut. Like when I go to Washington and talk to people about like, you know how we're all
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:59.680]   like freaking out about net neutrality, you know, I guess them all excited? Rural broadband access.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:06.400]   And I agree. I mean, you can do both. Right. You don't have to reward companies that are fighting
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:11.520]   net neutrality just because they're going to give us rural access. My real problem is we've seen this
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:17.600]   time and time again with big ISPs make promises like this and not get their merger, get their license,
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:24.560]   whatever and not do it. So I would there is there are there are severe penalties if they don't do it.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:30.960]   There's always severe penalties, but you know what? Those are those are enforced also by the FCC.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:37.600]   And the FCC is like, eh, eh, eh, all right. Billions of dollars and penalties.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:43.120]   Yeah, but I'm going to find G equipment. Are they going to roll out?
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:49.680]   Yeah, there's a question. Can you can you trust the fins? They're awfully close to Russia.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:58.640]   They are. Now, what does it mean that the DOJ? Well, there's the other side. I think that was
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:02.080]   I have good news and I have bad news. Chairman's
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:07.120]   company. Sorry. They're Swedish. Okay. They're not in Finland. No,
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.800]   kids in Finland. Correct. No, he is in Finland. All right. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Go back.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:17.600]   Yeah. So the so the chairman was all. Oh, nice. I like it. Sex. A guarantee that 90%
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:23.360]   Americans will have mobile broadband access. A hundred megabits or more. 99% of 50 megabits or more.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.080]   All and two thirds of rural America will have access to high speed mid band 5G.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:38.400]   All things we love. And then whoops, the DOJ staff recommends a lawsuit to block the merger.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:43.120]   One day later, one day later. I would also say if you're going to condition this deal,
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:49.760]   which it looks like they're trying to make happen, having mobile broadband access of 50
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:55.840]   megabits per second, you cannot have that and have it be functional under the current data cap
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:02.080]   regime for mobile broadband. Oh, that's a mmm. Yeah. So when we start talking about how this deal
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:06.720]   actually goes down, those are the sort of things you want to look at. It's fine. I mean, I am like,
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:17.040]   you know, wireless with 5G in the right spectrum, spectrum bands, you could recreate the quality
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:24.000]   of wired broadband for most. But you cannot charge them, you know, 10 bucks a gigabyte per month.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.960]   By the way, it's interesting that you say the right spectrum bands because the national,
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:36.560]   the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is warning. Oh, oh, we have to stop this right now.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.880]   I just did a print. So when I was in Anaheim, when I got my bed bugs, I was actually doing a
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:46.720]   presentation on 5G. And this is actually a story that I cited or not that particular story,
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:53.600]   but this it was an article in nature from a couple weeks ago. We, okay, when we talk about 5G,
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:58.800]   we're talking about three different possible things. And I just have to say this, the spectrum
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:03.520]   bands that they're talking about, we have allocated in the US, we have just done a 24
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:12.240]   gigahertz block. But many of the operators are not going to be doing most of their deployment
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:16.480]   in those bands because they're really crap when it comes to propagation.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.480]   Craft bands. So let me explain, let me explain what's going on.
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:28.160]   Weather, weather satellites. And I think this is really cool. It's a cool hack.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:37.360]   Use this 24 gigahertz band to passively measure, what is it they measure in 24 gigahertz,
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:46.160]   water vapor, that's right. So they're passive sounders on these satellites. And they use it
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:52.800]   to predict, in fact, the NOAA warns that if this 24 gigahertz band is given over to 5G,
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:59.760]   it would affect and give them a 77% data loss on these water vapor. And they said,
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:06.000]   our prediction abilities will go back to what we had back in 1980. It would, but Stacy, I would
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:13.440]   point out that that's not the only band because there are other bands used for similar passive
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:21.200]   monitoring of other weather phenomena. So yes, but those are at 36 and 37. Are you looking at
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.360]   the nature story? Because they have a wonderful sharing spectrum. I will get the nature story
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:35.760]   up on my radar, so to speak. So those are all those bands have terrible spectrum
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:40.560]   propagation. So basically they don't pass through walls, they don't pass through water,
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.320]   they don't, this is why they use it for that. So when it rains, these don't work.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:50.400]   And we're working our way around it by using beamforming, by using MIMO, by using a lot of
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:55.760]   other technologies. This is actually where Facebook is doing, Facebook and Google both have projects.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:02.960]   So Facebook's terahertz efforts are right in these bands. But when we talk about 5G from the carriers,
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:07.920]   they're talking about using these bands, they're buying these bands. But when you talk to them
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:14.160]   in their engineering departments, they're going to move, migrate for mobile use,
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:20.160]   they're going to migrate down to whatever spectrum they own. These microwave frequencies are too
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:26.400]   high. They don't propagate well, is what you're saying. So 23.8 gigahertz is used for water vapor,
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:34.080]   36 to 37s used for rain or snow, 50 to .2 to 50.4s used for atmospheric temperature,
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:42.480]   and 86 to 92 gigahertz is used for clouds and ice. So there is concern because in every one of
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:48.880]   these cases, or at least adjacent bands are considered for 5G internationally. However,
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.640]   your point is that no one's going to use them because they don't propagate.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:57.200]   Well, they're not going to use them. They're going to use them highly locally.
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:03.680]   So this could affect things. But the other aspect of this is we've actually done really well with
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:13.600]   learning how to guard against disruption in various bands. So we, because it's all digital,
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:19.040]   we're good at that. And I don't know if you guys remember White Space is broadband, but
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:25.200]   one of the challenges there was that we were going to cause interference. And now we've got these
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:31.680]   cool spectrum sharing databases that are awesome and work really well. So you could also deploy
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:38.320]   something like that in these upper band areas. So you don't interfere with the weather. But yeah,
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:42.800]   we're going to have to adapt. The thing that's frustrating is they've known about this since
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:51.440]   at least 2010. That's where I was going. Why did we auction these off these bands and not see this
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:56.720]   coming? That's what I don't understand. Oh, that's what the FCC does. I mean, remember how we did it.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:02.160]   And they, I might add, do it quite well. Yes. I mean, White Space is broadband. We're like,
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:06.400]   Oh, that's where we're using all of our wireless microphones. We can't use that for something else.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.320]   And then they're like, yeah, we can. We'll work it out in the industry, worked it out. And then
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:15.840]   you saw that. I will point out there was another one that I was vividly involved with.
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:21.920]   We have to talk about Spectre BPL broadcast over power lines. And this was Michael.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:31.040]   The FCC chairman. Michael Powell was really pushing this. In fact, I remember we I interviewed
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:35.440]   him in 2004. And he took us back in the labs. He said, look at this, we're able to use power
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:41.360]   lines. And what we do is we notch it because Ham's and emergency radio folks were very worried
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:46.160]   because one of the things that happens when you start pushing broadband over power lines,
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:50.800]   you generate huge amounts of interference at certain certain frequencies, which happened to be
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:57.760]   ham frequencies and more importantly, emergency radio frequencies. That got killed. Right. And so
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:02.240]   did the Michael Powell was of the opinion. Oh, no, we can fix this. Well, not yet.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:06.000]   Thought it's just not going to be a problem. And it got killed probably rightly so, right?
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:13.120]   Right. Well, we have that with LTE, a satellite based terrestrial and satellite based LTE network
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:21.040]   called LightSquared that died because it interfered with GPS. And you know, the FCC is like, well,
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:26.240]   figure it out. And then the G everybody who uses GPS was like, no. So basically,
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:33.040]   it depends on your how much lobbying you know, you're willing to do and have the power to do.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.960]   And I don't think Noah has a lot of lobbying power, unfortunately. But we do need weather
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:41.520]   forecasts, you know, you know, who needs those farmers, cities,
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.960]   But there are ways around like, there are ways around this. Don't say that if it's not true.
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:51.280]   Meanwhile,
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:56.960]   it is true. Okay, I believe you because you're Stacey Higginbotham.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:02.160]   She would know able to leap tall processors in a single bound.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:06.880]   I used to have a spectrum, an ITU spectrum chart on my wall.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:09.680]   She used to have an ITU spectrum chart on her wall.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:15.200]   Like, come on. I love spectrum. It's my favorite thing in the world.
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:16.880]   I eat spectrum for breakfast.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:21.600]   But yes, it is going to cost money. And we will have to figure this out.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.480]   I mean, it's good that they're breeding this up.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:28.400]   As our chatroom, Emmon in our chatroom says, Noah didn't need a weatherman.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:33.520]   You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:39.040]   So back to T-Mobile and Sprint. You got the chairman of the FCC, all hot and bothered.
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:46.960]   He's excited. You got the DOJ ready to sue. And basically, people are saying it's a push 5050.
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:51.600]   We don't know what's going to happen. I'd like to see a merger. I use T-Mobile.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:57.040]   I think Sprint is pretty much useless in our area. Be nice to see a merge.
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:05.360]   Especially if they live up to that pledge to get 97% 5G coverage in three years, that would be awesome.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:09.120]   You don't think they'll do it?
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:16.960]   Well, even if they did do it, there's no guarantee on pricing. There's no guarantee on the quality
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:21.920]   of the network. There's a lot of things. It's one thing to say, I'm building something out.
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.720]   It's another thing to say, I'm building something else. It's good. In coverage, it doesn't mean
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.800]   quality speeds. Coverage just means you can get a bar possibly there.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:35.520]   You remember when AT&T and Time Warner, the merger, and they told everybody
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:39.840]   that once that merger happens, we are going to hire thousands of new employees.
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:52.320]   What happened? They lost 27,500 jobs. It just shows you can promise regulators whatever you want.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:19:01.440]   You can actually lie to the FCC. You cannot lie to the SEC. I always find it interesting to look
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:07.280]   at what companies say in their 10Ks, their documents with the FCC.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.560]   I'm sorry, the FCC, because the FCC, they can just do whatever they want.
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:19.360]   AT&T promised 7,000 new jobs. Actually, that wasn't the merger. That was to get a tax break.
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:24.480]   I apologize. They cut 20. That was for the big federal tax break that we did get.
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:30.640]   Yeah. Remember, they gave the $1,000 or $3,000 bonuses to people as part of the tax break?
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.080]   Oh, yeah. That was nice.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:40.480]   Then they fired 27,000. You're both right, but I'll tell you what. I think T-Mobile has done
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:44.720]   a tremendous job. I'm a John Ledger lover, not a fighter.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:51.120]   Well, even beyond him, I like him as well. I remember I had just started at GigaOM and
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:57.120]   either at CES or some other event. I had an interview with Neville Ray, who was the CTO.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:01.680]   He was trying to convince me up to Yang Yang about how they're going to expand. They're
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:05.680]   going to do this with all this spectrum, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm." I
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:09.120]   don't walk away from like, "You're done, buddy. I just don't see what happened. I just don't."
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:17.840]   They did. Ledger came in. They've made changes. They've cut prices. They've pushed
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:21.120]   the prices of competitors down there. More than just their own prices.
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:25.280]   They have. They put the screws of rise in AT&T. Absolutely. It's great.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:33.200]   Disclosure, I switched from AT&T to T-Mobile about three years ago. I'm a happy customer.
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:39.920]   But mostly happy. It turns out when we moved to our new studio here in the beautiful East Side
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:45.280]   Studio, there was zero T-Mobile coverage. We had to get a femto cell, which we have in the other
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:48.560]   room, Connector Connector. Sure. Sure. You're a broadband.
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:53.680]   Again, this doesn't guarantee anything. You stay so you're absolutely right. They could
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:59.840]   live to the FGC, etc. There's no guarantees. But if I had to pick one of the companies,
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:03.600]   one of the major US carriers to actually pull this off and make it a good thing
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:11.440]   for more people than not, it would be T-Mobile. I agree. I think they've been... I mean,
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:19.120]   all carriers suck, but they suck the least. Yes. Yes. Okay. That's fair. That's fair.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:24.560]   Stacey, I don't want to say who she's with her carriers, but I know. Maybe that's...
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:30.880]   Oh, no. No, I don't love my carrier. My carrier is just my carrier. I have no...
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:35.680]   You'd be foolish to love your carrier because your carrier does not love you. They just love
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:42.080]   the color of your money. My carrier loves charging me lots of money. I have a reason on this on the
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:47.920]   Galaxy S10. It's ridiculously expensive, but on the other hand, the connectivity is excellent.
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:51.360]   Very good. Stacey, you're moving to T-Mobile's backyard there.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:58.400]   Yes. I mean, it is something I am going to evaluate when I finish doing that, although I'm
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:06.160]   switching from Spectrum to Comcast. So we'll see. Oh, we'd like to welcome you to the Comcast family,
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:12.000]   Stacey. Comcast has already sent me an email offering to send me up with kinds of things.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.960]   Let me just say, it's "comtastic." Well, we didn't sign up under my...
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:25.920]   In Seattle? Yeah. I don't believe so. I'll email Dane. I'll be like Dane.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:33.680]   I'm kind of nutty because... Sonic is the best by far. Sonic is awesome.
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.640]   Sonic gets Sonic fiber. I don't even have fiber, and it still doesn't...
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:42.960]   I want to move somewhere else in Petaluma just to get the fiber. We have fiber here. We have 10
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:46.800]   gigabits symmetric. So sometimes I'll just come to work.
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:52.640]   They're fusion non-fiber solutions. Yeah, that's an ADSL2 solution. That works just fine for me.
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:58.560]   You get two lines. You get two lines, and it does the knob. It's good. It's the best you can get with ADSL.
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:02.000]   My options are CenturyLink,
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:09.760]   X-inity, V-SAT, NU. Or the Kitsap PUD.
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.120]   Seattle is so techy. There might be something.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:17.040]   AT&T is an option, then you can get Sonic.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:22.960]   AT&T is not an option because they use AT&T's ADSL.
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.840]   If you can't get AT&T, then you're...
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:29.680]   It's not. I meant CenturyLink. So I cannot get Sonic. Look at you.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:36.320]   Residential Gigabit Broadband Services available in more than 170,000 households in Seattle
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.080]   from CenturyLink and Wave. They are deploying fiber.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:43.920]   So I will... Just do that. Don't ignore me. Do that.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:49.440]   And I got to say... TomSats doesn't have fiber in my area. Do not get that X1 piece of crap
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:54.640]   that Comcast pretends is a DVR. Just bite the bullet and get a Tivo.
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:58.720]   Well, I don't have cables, so I don't care. Oh, you don't care.
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:03.040]   I haven't had cable in over a decade. You don't care.
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:07.840]   Yeah. I just plug in my Roku. Yeah. Really, that's what I'm...
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:12.480]   I'm curious because I have Verizon Fios here at the house. And I've had it for a couple of years.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.600]   What does Sonic provide? What's the monthly cost? Just curious.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:21.200]   $60.60 a month? No, for cheaper for fiber, believe it or not.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:23.200]   It's cheaper for fiber, but nobody can get fiber.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:32.160]   It's for their two lines of AT&T ADSL merged into one. It's like 60 bucks a month, I want to say.
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:33.840]   And what's the uploading down?
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:38.240]   It's... I get between 10 and 20.
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:44.080]   So this is... But you're also supporting Dane Jasper and his company.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:47.760]   It was the greatest independent... I get around... Internet service provider...
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:51.360]   ...between five and 10 down.
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:57.600]   There's no caps. He's very pro net neutrality. Oh, he's fucked a good fight. Yeah.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:02.640]   Dane's an old friend. I've known him for years and years. Yeah, he is the best. I'm thrilled that
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:08.000]   you know him. Oh, I've served him drinks on my rooftop deck. I love him. That's more than I can say.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:16.400]   Caps are the keys, Stacy, because if you're going to have fast internet... No caps on Sonic.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:22.080]   No caps on me. We get this. This is their fiber, if you can get it, $40 a month.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:30.000]   For... I think it's 50 gigabit fiber. I can't remember. It's not symmetric.
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:35.280]   No data caps. 15 email accounts. Gigabyte of storage.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:40.080]   Personal web hosting. Facts line service. And that includes home phone as well as internet.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:42.800]   But did I mention that? I mean, that is amazing.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.360]   50 megabits. Not gigabits, right? Yeah. Did I say gig? I'm sorry. Yes.
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.840]   That's okay. I was like, wow. I have to pick five minutes.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.800]   I thought it was gigabit fiber. Well, there you go. They have to pick it up.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.640]   Oh, it is gigabit. It's just gigabit down.
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:26:00.000]   It's gigabit down. But it's... I don't remember what it is up. It's enough up. It's 30 up.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.280]   Not probably. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. I paid about 100.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:06.480]   You can't get symmetric. I mean, we have symmetric here, which is awesome.
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:11.040]   Yeah. So 40 is a great price for gigabit. Absolutely.
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:14.720]   Yeah. Oh, yeah. Including phone. I don't think even... I mean, there's a lot of municipal
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:18.800]   providers who can't offer that. When I interviewed him, I said, "You're going to lose your shirt,
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:24.480]   dude." He said, "No, we figured it out. When we put it in, if one in five homeowners subscribes,
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:28.400]   if we can get that 20% penetration, it is a profitable business."
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:32.960]   Wow. Yeah. I've gotten one of my neighbors to sign up.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:35.840]   Yeah. That's a good thing. We're looking on the rest. Yeah. Very small.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:41.120]   Yeah. Kevin, in a giga-ome, I was on the broadband beat and Dane was like,
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:45.680]   right there. I did so many interviews with him talking about profitability.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:52.080]   Yeah. We had a true triangulation with him. I guess really we should say he's still a sponsor,
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:56.720]   because he sponsors us with this 10 gigabit symmetric fiber.
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:04.240]   Shh. Don't tell him. We're running over his wires. Right now, we're running over his wires.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:11.440]   No cap. No cap. I love it. We want to do the change log. Let me do an ad and then, well,
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:16.320]   there's a couple more things. I want to address this works with Nest thing,
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:21.040]   because we were talking about this last week. Yeah. Yeah. That was something else. That's changed.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:25.120]   It's not about... Yeah. I think Google has... I have that in the change log. You want to just
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:28.000]   start the change log? Okay. Let's change the change log.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:38.240]   The Google change log. Concern after Google I/O about what was going to happen when the works
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:44.480]   with Nest program was deprecated August 31st, replaced with works with Google Assistant.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:49.360]   The issue, of course, and Stacey, I think you calmed everybody down a little bit, but the issue
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:56.160]   was, "Well, this is going to break my home network." They say, "Your existing devices and
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:00.640]   integrations will continue working with your Nest account. You won't have new features that
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:07.120]   will be available with a Google account. We're going to stop accepting new works with Nest
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:13.360]   connections on August 31st. It sounds like they're really going to commit to making sure all the
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:19.280]   integrations you're using will be replicated in the new setup. Yes. They're all
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:22.080]   also saying, "If you don't want to switch it over, you'll be okay."
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:26.960]   Yeah. At least for a while. I don't know if that would be great.
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:31.200]   If you won't get any cool new stuff, but your home won't break, which is nice, because people
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:36.880]   do not want to keep setting up as one who's about to have... We got to call into the show.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:41.520]   This guy lost his whole hub settings, and he said it took him seven hours to replicate everything.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:48.000]   This is what Google should have done the first time. They should not have done it the way they
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.800]   did and walked it back. They should have done this the first time.
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:55.200]   Well, I think the good news... Look, people make mistakes. The good news is Google heard people,
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:02.000]   and very quickly acted to fix it. I'm now just realizing we didn't talk about this on our show,
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.120]   Kevin, and that was kind of stupid of us. Fair news. Fair news.
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:08.480]   Fair news. It was. I put 100 words in the news letter. It's fine. It's all good.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:15.040]   I have to say, I woke up with a strange man in my bed this morning,
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:20.720]   and I think it was... I blame Google. Did this happen to you? Has this happened to you?
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:25.040]   I asked, I said, "Hey, Google, what time is it?" And some guy said, "It's 7.30."
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:28.800]   I said, "Who are you?" He said, "I'm John Legend."
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:34.160]   Has your Google assistant started talking in John Legend's voice?
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:39.440]   Mine is packed, so no. Mine has not. It is not packed, but no.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:43.680]   But I didn't have an offer. It actually offered me... I had to turn it on, though. I had to opt into
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:48.640]   John Legend. Maybe if you stopped... I think I turned it on. Or maybe Lisa. She does love John Legend.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:52.480]   So here is John Legend's voice on your Google Assistant.
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:54.560]   Oops. Oops.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:15.360]   Okay, John. Not that I don't like John Legend, but it would be nice to have other celebrity voices.
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:21.680]   I think... And this is something... I'm looking this up, because I believe what they did is they
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:27.760]   made a big deal of having John Legend come on, and they actually recreated his voice from a
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:34.000]   limited set of his comments. Yes, that's exactly right. And they use... What is the term they use?
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.600]   They use his phrasing and his inflections to then... And of course, the sound of his voice to then
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:45.840]   inform the assistant. This is the one I chose. I think I chose green. Here are the voices you
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:50.560]   can pick for your Google Assistant. If you like this voice and want me to keep using it, just stop
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:56.880]   here. You know what? But there are a bunch of other choices. That's Sydney Harbor Blue.
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:04.640]   Racing Green, Purple, Pink. But I really like... I'm just going to say I like the green,
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:09.520]   and I figured out why actually after I picked it. Because it sounds just like the voice
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:15.360]   on the old Apple DynaBook video. Do you remember seeing that?
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:26.800]   No. No. This was... Kind of was like... I want to say like the 90s, early 90s,
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:32.000]   it was their vision of what the future was going to be like. I think it was at a Ted
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:38.640]   conference back when they were in Monterey. I can't find the video. But it was a really
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:43.520]   cool vision. There was a guy in a bow tie. It was on a laptop, but it was called a DynaBook.
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:49.520]   And he'd say, "You have five appointments." And your mother is calling and stuff. And it was that
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:55.600]   voice. I swear to God, it was that voice. So I feel like Google... It's an Easter egg, I would think.
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:02.720]   That Google maybe tried to duplicate that old voice for people like me, for old timers like me.
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:09.760]   Here it is. This was 1987. The Knowledge Navigator from Apple.
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:17.200]   And it forever seemed like this is never going to happen. But we're kind of getting there.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:23.920]   This is all for get all this fruity stuff. Masterpiece Theatre. It is. Welcome. There it is.
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:32.320]   There's the DynaBook with a completely superfluous metal, weird handle. This is our human protagonist,
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:38.880]   who is apparently a professor, entering his office. He opens the book and speaks.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:44.960]   You've got three messages. Your graduate research team in Guatemala, just checking in.
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:48.160]   Doesn't that sound like the same voice? Robert Jordan, a second semester junior,
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:53.600]   requesting a second extension on his term paper. And her mother reminding you about your father.
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:59.360]   Surprise birthday party next Sunday. Today you have a faculty lunch at 12 o'clock.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:05.280]   You need to take this very much like the Google Assistant, isn't it? Yes. You have a lecture.
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:10.480]   You have a lecture? Just 415 on deforestation and... We didn't know it was going to take 30 years.
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:16.960]   Let me see the lecture notes from last semester. This is exactly the kind of thing. I could see
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:22.000]   this demo on Google I/O stage this year. No, that's not enough. I need to review this.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.960]   Did you notice it was a foldable screen? Yep, it is. It's a foldable screen with a lot of weird
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:30.560]   space age. Fels. Fels. Fels.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:36.080]   Deforestation in the Amazon and its effects on rainfall in the sub-Saharan.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:41.120]   It also covers, drops effect. By the way, somebody pointed out the camera on this thing
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:47.120]   is this nice of an actual digital camera. It's not like... We can't figure out how to get that lens
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:55.040]   any smaller. I don't think it's physically possible. Okay, let's see. There's an article about five
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:34:00.320]   years ago, Dr. Flemson or something. This we haven't got. This we disagreed with the direction
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:06.480]   of Jill's research. John Fleming of Uppsala University. He published in the journal of
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:11.920]   Google's pretty good at correcting my type ones. Yes, that's it. And you could actually type
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:15.600]   something like that into Google. You just can't see it. You can't say it yet, but soon.
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:24.080]   Anyway, I just heard that voice. Anyway, John Legend, I guess that's not new, but you can pick it
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:29.440]   along with a bunch of different colors. I told you about the colors once. Do you remember that?
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:34.320]   No, no, no. I remember that. No, why do they do the colors? Yeah, because they do it because they
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:41.840]   didn't want it to be racist or sexist. Yes. That's right. I thought that was nice.
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:50.560]   Have you heard about the translato to translate? I read it. I read about it in our newsletter.
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:56.240]   It's okay. Well, good. Stacey, explain what the hell and end to end speech to speech translation
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:03.360]   module is. It's actually better to demonstrate it. Okay, well, we have some demonstrations.
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:12.000]   Actually, that was what my plan was. So, which one might go a little farther down? Yeah. So,
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.560]   here's the Spanish input. This is a real human speaker.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:25.440]   So, the first thing they do is translate it to English, the old fashioned way.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:28.800]   Larry asked me how I felt, and I think that is when I started to cry.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.600]   Larry asked me how I felt, and that's when I started to cry. Then they did a bass. This is the
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:39.040]   baseline cascade translation. I wondered how I felt, and I think that's when I started to cry.
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:46.960]   But wait, we can do better. What if we did a translato translation? Larry asked me how I felt,
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:51.520]   and then I think that's when I started crying. But better yet, let's add the original speaker's
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:57.600]   voice. And this is the cadence matching that they do now with John Legend. Larry asked you how I
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:02.000]   felt, and I think it's when I started to cry. Here's the Spanish.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:11.120]   Here's the translators. Larry asked you how I felt, and I think it's when I started to cry.
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:16.320]   He sounds kind of like he's got a stuffed drum. Yeah, they're getting there, though. I mean,
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:22.560]   I, you know, it's not a bad idea. They're getting there. If you're like, well, that guy's a guy,
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:26.560]   and the translation voice is a guy. That doesn't sound like him at all.
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:30.640]   Well, let's try another one. This is the original Spanish source.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:44.720]   And here is the source voice after translation. So, look around the country.
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:53.600]   And what you see? Long pause. So, look around the country and what you see.
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:57.680]   Okay, this doesn't sound that bad. Actually, I take it all back.
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:03.120]   Forget the translator on. It's a working progress. It's a working that's coming along.
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:09.680]   The ideas, I guess. I don't know. I don't. I feel like that could be the beginning of
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:14.080]   more hoaxes and misunderstandings. Oh, get ready. That's just the way the world is. I mean, you know,
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:20.480]   I played the fake Joe Rogan last week, didn't I? I don't know. I hate Joe Rogan.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:25.280]   Do not. That's your pick for the end of the show. Okay. Now I did on Twitch.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:29.200]   Is that what I did on Twitch? Okay. But now I know Stacy hates it, so I'll get a different pick.
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:34.320]   Here's some good news. For those of you who spent $1,500 on Google Glass 1,
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:41.040]   Google Glass 2 is out and it's only, what was it? $9.99?
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:45.280]   It's a lot. It's a lot cheaper.
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:50.400]   Google Enterprise Edition 2 faster, more helpful and only half is geeky looking.
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:57.520]   Well, Kevin spent the $1,500. Yeah. So did I, but I didn't even get the glasses. Jason Hal has them.
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:02.720]   I got custom lenses. Oh, you got the, oh, nice. So you can,
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:06.560]   they are. I can't say I progressive by focal. So yeah, me too.
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:14.240]   So what do you still wear them? All the time, you know, it's there. I'm a check magnet with
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:18.480]   those things. Hi, do you mind if I record this conversation?
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:23.040]   Hi. I can't, I can't hear your, your on LinkedIn.
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:26.080]   Yeah, that would not go over well.
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:31.840]   Wait, oh, you're going to, let me buy you a drink. Your favorite is on Facebook. Oh, I see.
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:34.800]   I'm martini. Okay. What is this? You're like a round guy.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.640]   No, I don't wear them.
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:43.280]   Okay. Well, anyway, they're back.
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:51.280]   Faster and more helpful. Really for enterprise. I mean, this is like, you know, AR for like,
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:59.040]   the hollow lens, for example, this is not consumer. Now, apparently, I missed the boat
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:05.280]   because I got John Legend on my Google home hub, but the nest hub, when it comes out,
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:11.120]   oh, it's going to have character alarms. I wonder if you pay for that. Like, I wonder if that's
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:15.520]   like a licensing deal. Well, if you got the neat teenage Minja Newton Durls,
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:17.600]   somebody's playing what?
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:25.440]   TMNT, Tim and, if you got Leonardo in your, in your alarm,
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:31.520]   also you could choose from Lego and Hatchimals. So it sounds like it's really aimed at kids.
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:33.120]   Here, let's, let's watch.
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:47.360]   Wake me up. That is annoying. Hey, Google. Stop. Yeah. Please.
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:50.320]   Never play this again.
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:40:05.520]   So it's for an eight year old. Okay. Sure. Yeah. That's nice. Yeah. I mean, for kids,
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:10.560]   I could see it. We middle aged ladies have John Legend. They've got Ninja Newton Durls.
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:12.800]   And Legos and Legos.
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:20.880]   Wait, Legos don't talk. How are they an alarm? Oh, you clearly not seen the Lego movie.
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:24.480]   Okay. Yeah. I have actually everything is awesome, Stacey.
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:30.480]   Everything is awesome. Okay. I'm not going to sing the rest of the song. I wish you
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:36.400]   good. I think you could. Then I want you to do the, let it go from frozen. Okay.
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:44.320]   Excellent. Yes. I think you know that too. I do. All of the words. All the words.
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:45.760]   I get to work with her every day.
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:51.440]   I haven't never sings along. It's terrible. So I think, uh,
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:58.000]   retcon in our chalom has it right on. They need adult ones like John Belushi from Animal House.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:05.920]   Food. That'd be a great way to wake up. A little caddy shack. Yeah. So I got that going for me.
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:13.360]   The hangover. Bridesmaids. I know what I know what's seen from Bridesmaids. I'd like,
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:19.440]   we wake me up. Uh, an office space. That'd be good. That'd be good. Good choices. Excellent choices.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:22.880]   I would like a little tiffany hatish from Girls Trip.
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:30.400]   Good enough. I know what Kevin wants. Hey, Kevin. It's time to wake up. Wake up.
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:35.360]   Peace and love. Peace and love. Wake up, man. We've got a record to record.
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:46.080]   They won't be cool. So wooly. Hello, Kevin Talfill. Hello. This is Paul McCartney saying,
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:51.520]   wake up, buddy. Come on, mate. Come on, mate. Wake up. What a pearly.
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:55.520]   Wide color photos are coming to Android.
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:07.600]   Wide color is not exactly HDR. It's a color profile. Not sRGB is something better like
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:14.880]   p3. Adobe RGB. So sRGB is kind of the lingua franca, the lowest common denominator. A lot of
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:20.880]   cameras. Everything does sRGB. But you can see the difference if you look at sRGB versus p3,
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:25.680]   which is used, I think it's a lot used in the motion picture and television industry.
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:28.960]   And that's a much wider gamut. Or here, for instance,
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:37.840]   display p3. I like the umbrella photos. Yeah. And you see how rich those colors are compared to
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:43.760]   sRGB. Yeah. Of course, you need a display that can show them on your phone.
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:50.960]   To really a lot of phones now could do p3. That seems to be the standard. So you can see,
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:56.560]   obviously, you know, your camera, some, you'd have to have some p3 screen to test it. And they
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:02.480]   have a little wide color gamut test. So for those of you watching at home, if you see a little
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:11.920]   Android guy, you're a p3. If you don't see anything, which is what I see right now, just a red blob,
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:18.000]   right? Or do you see an Android guy? Okay. Oh, yeah, I see the Android, well, I see the Android guy
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.200]   on your screen. Why say it along with the Android play? Your Chromebook must be
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:31.440]   happening. Yeah, it is. What should you do to prepare? Gather as much water as you can.
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:36.960]   I don't know. I don't know. I think more about this. I'm going to go to the next story. Thank you
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:44.640]   very much, everybody. Enjoy your veal. Google Duo has increased the group call capacity.
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:50.320]   Now, remember, they're playing catch up to Apple, which allows you to have 32 people in your
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:56.320]   FaceTime. Google now has eight. I think that's enough. Eight is enough. That sounds funny.
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.800]   It is enough. I don't even know eight people.
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:05.600]   I will say this has kind of frustrated me a little bit about Duo. But if I have a source,
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:09.360]   which I have lots of them, I now see when they're on Duo. So I get these like,
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:14.640]   yeah, that's a major company has joined Duo. I'm like, that they don't really want to be.
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:16.800]   They don't want the reporter. Let me call them.
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:26.000]   Okay. Now here's a problem, though. Duo two. Do we rename it Ocho?
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.880]   No, please please. Please. Ocho. Ocho.
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:40.320]   Ocho. Ocho. Ocho. Ocho because Duo is Latin. It'd be Ocho. But Ocho. I like a little better.
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.320]   My son would totally.
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:48.320]   Ocho. Ocho. I don't even know if I have eight people on Duo. Let's see how many
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:52.400]   Duo contacts I have down. But now it's so when that new Nest Hub comes,
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:57.920]   that supports Duo. I guess your home hub does too, but you don't have a camera, so it's stupid.
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:03.760]   But with the one with the camera or your Lenovo or your JBL, right? You can use Duo.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:08.560]   I use it on the Lenovo. I'm thinking I'm when the Nest comes out, I'm sending one to my mom
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:12.400]   because I think right now we FaceTime, but I think it'd be a much easier way for her to communicate.
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:19.520]   Yeah, I love communicating via the Echo Show. Sorry. It's really handy when I'm out of town to
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:23.280]   connect with my family. The kids love it. Yeah. It's like mom's really there.
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:29.040]   If I had a Google home hub, my son would use it constantly. He'd call you all the time.
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:33.440]   He wouldn't call me. He'd just call his friends. Well, that's who El Ocho is for because
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:37.680]   that's what happens to get home from school. They get their group together and they're all on
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:43.040]   the Ocho. They are. Well, yeah, my daughter hangs out with her friends on Hangouts.
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:47.440]   Yeah. But that's going away. That's good. That's still around. That's good.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:50.720]   Oh, she said about that information. Well, she can use El Ocho.
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.840]   I don't think. And you know what? I tried to actually call my Google home using Duo,
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:02.960]   but I couldn't call my home. Like I can call my Echo Show. You can't call a phone.
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:08.640]   Right. No, I couldn't call my home hub. Oh, what I wanted to do because it's sitting there
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:17.600]   and I've on my phone and I couldn't find on Duo. You can't specify the device.
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:22.880]   That's a thing. You call a person, not a device. Right. But my one person is me.
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:26.560]   And I was on the phone trying to call me on my home, if that makes sense.
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:32.000]   No, that doesn't actually. Why would you call yourself? Well, that's the point. Like
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:39.920]   on Duo, if I wanted to call my. If I want to talk to my kid at home on the Google home device,
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:47.200]   I didn't have a way to call it. I got you. Yeah. I maybe through voice match.
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:51.600]   I don't know because I'm the only one who uses all these Google home things in the house.
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:56.080]   And my son's the only other one on the other end of the line. So I, and he uses his phone.
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:00.320]   I don't know. If you don't have a camera on your smart display, you can still use Duo.
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:02.960]   It's an audio only call, by the way. Yes.
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:12.720]   So there's this kid, Michael Saimen. He was a teenager. 14 years old, I think,
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:18.960]   when he created a bunch of apps, Scott Mark Zuckerberg's attention, Mark brought him
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:24.880]   onto the stage at F eight and hired him as the teenage intern at Facebook.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:32.320]   A teenager in residence. Oh, man. He created. Of course he's, well, I don't know.
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:37.600]   I don't know. I don't know. I'm just asking. There he is. Yeah. He's a white guy. What did you want?
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:42.560]   He's a clean, cut white guy. I don't care. I want anyone else.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:45.600]   Anybody but white guys. Okay. Kevin, let's leave.
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:53.200]   So he created a whole bunch of apps, including one called Life Stage.
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:48:01.200]   This was a Facebook app. It turned bios into video profiles. It was an iOS app for people 21
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:08.160]   and under Facebook launched it three years ago, then killed it. Saimen left and went to Google,
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:15.520]   where he is now, I don't know what, an adult in residence. And he has created, by the way,
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:21.760]   he did not his parents are from Blue and Bolivia, Peru and Bolivia, raised him in Miami. He taught
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:27.840]   himself to code with online tutorials at the age of 13. His first app was an $1 app with tips
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:33.120]   from the Club Penguin game. He earned him thousands of dollars, which kept his family afloat during
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:41.520]   the recession. So it's actually a nice story. He might be white looking, but he comes from the streets.
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:46.960]   Okay. Well, that's good. I'm like coming from a disadvantaged background always nice, given
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:52.720]   different perspectives. The recession their house was foreclosed on. He kept him afloat.
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:58.320]   His big break came when he overheard his sister on the phone sending photos to a friend and tried
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:03.120]   to make her guess what word they represented that inspired him to build four snaps of photo
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:08.880]   charades app. It was number one on the word games chart with a few million users. Then
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:17.920]   you know, Facebook found out about him and replaced him with his new, he left Facebook, went to Google
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:23.280]   and his new game is charades. Once again, he's back to his roots with emoji shot.
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:32.560]   Emoji charades with friends. So instead of sending pictures, you send emojis. And then
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:40.160]   by doing so, you can then play the game. And what am I trying to say? It's like a rebus, I guess.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:46.160]   That's what we used to call him when I was a kid. Clever. Yeah. Yeah. Nice story. Just telling
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:50.080]   you, it's iOS game though, unfortunately. So it really shouldn't be on this change log at all.
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:56.560]   I apologize. Are we still on the change log? He's at Google though. So he's at Google.
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:59.760]   He's working for Google. There's a link. There's the link.
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:04.960]   Google Assistant now works with the Wwise Cam. We love, we all love the Wwise
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:10.000]   E. Wwise cams. And some guy named Kevin C. Tofel tweeted this video
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:18.400]   of a norm. Show me the driveway. Show me the driveway. And here it is.
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:24.880]   My. And this is your Wwise Cam. It is my Wwise Cam. Awesome.
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:30.960]   That's a driveway. That's my driveway. That's my old lovely neighborhood.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:35.600]   So that's the only drawback. They don't have an outdoor camera yet. So you have to put it inside
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:40.000]   through the window. Yeah, I put it through the window. I had a Nest Cam there, but I didn't want
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.800]   to pay a subscription fee. So I bought a $20 Wwise Cam and use an SD card. And now it works with
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:52.400]   Google Assistant. I will say in the time I tried it since then, it's intermiss on the
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:55.440]   connectivity. There's a lot of latency sometimes and other times it's not.
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:00.240]   You know, I've had that problems with Nest cameras on Google as well. I think it's just an issue
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:05.920]   with Wifi connected cameras mostly. But I am, I have to say now that I have John Legend in my home
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:13.440]   and my bed, I am going to replace my Ring Doorbell with a hello. I'm going to replace my Amazon
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:20.000]   stuff with Google Home Hub. I think I've decided to, I don't want to, I'm not going to kick Amazon
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:25.840]   out because I still buy stuff, I guess that way. So I might keep that. But I think, for instance,
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:29.600]   on the Sonos, you have to choose, right? I think I'm choosing the Assistant. I really think Google
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:34.960]   Assistant is the one. I did the same already and Stacy and I, it's like we cover everything with
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:41.440]   IoT. So it's kind of hard to go and kick everything out. But literally, I just have like one test
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:45.920]   Amazon device because I'm all Google. Okay. And he does that because he doesn't want to do the
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:52.880]   reviews that I ask him to do. I don't know if that's the best anymore. So I also have a big audible
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:57.600]   listener and there's no audible on, it's only on Echo, it's not on Assistant. So that might be
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:05.040]   another issue. On the other hand, Sonos has audible support. So maybe that'll solve that. Yeah,
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:10.640]   because they do have Sonos is everywhere. Yep. Google Calendar and Keep. I know you love the dark
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:19.760]   mode. There you go. Google Calendar and Keep it. Dark mode, all of the things. If you go to
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:24.320]   Android Q, dark mode is in Android Q now. And I guess they're going to just make all the Google
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:30.400]   apps in dark mode, I guess. Yeah. I do like that. The brightness hurts. It burns, it burns the eyes.
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:39.040]   If I wanted right things, I'd go outside. And that's the Google change log.
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:50.800]   Yes, Ms. Higginbotham, you spoke. I was going to ask for our things. Are we? I am. You need to go.
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:56.080]   I'm not. I'm not doing as well as I thought I was doing. So I'm like sitting here. Let me do a
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:53:00.720]   quick ad and then we'll do the things. Can you stand it? I can. I just was like, Oh, because he
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:05.280]   adds the thing you know and love. It's Grammarly. Who doesn't? Who doesn't love Grammarly?
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:11.040]   Use it. It's funny because I for a long time, I was a grammar snob. I said, my grammar is perfect.
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:15.840]   I also was a spelling snob. My spelling is perfect. And then I started using Grammarly. I realized,
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:21.600]   hey, my grammar is not perfect. No, or any more than my spelling is B. Grammarly is more than just
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:26.480]   spelling and grammar. Grammarly is all about communicating more effectively. So for instance,
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:32.800]   knowing the reading level of what I've written is very useful. And what I found is a lot of the
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:40.320]   people I know who write for a living like you and and and Stacy love Grammarly. Paul Thorett loves
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:45.120]   Grammarly. You can use it on almost everywhere. It's available as a plugin for Chrome Firefox,
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:51.920]   Safari, Edge. It's got an iOS keyboard, Android, Windows, Macintosh. Yes, there's Grammarly free
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:55.360]   that does spelling and basic grammar, but you're going to want Grammarly premium because you get
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:54:02.160]   spelling grammar plus advanced punctuation structure. That's a hard thing to do. It does
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:06.640]   it write style within context. So for instance, if you're running a business proposal, the style
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:11.680]   would be different than an academic essay than a blog post or a social media post. And so it
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:17.840]   understands that vocabulary suggestions always welcome, conciseness, readability for different
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:22.960]   occasions, and occasionally I'll write something that an email that's maybe a little too brasking
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:26.240]   Grammarly will actually say you want to soften that up and make that a little nicer.
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:30.960]   And you can ignore it, but it's always it's like having a good friend over your shoulder with
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:35.920]   some some suggestions. Accomplish your goals with help from Grammarly. Stop making email
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:40.640]   typos, close more deals at work with your emails, polish your resume to get that new job. Grammarly
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:48.640]   can help you with it all. And no more ungrammatical tweets, please. They're offensive to the eye

[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:12.800]   writing better and supporting our show. Pick of the week, Stacey Higginbotham.
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:21.600]   Yes. Okay. I promised I would show you this. Two things. One, wise, who we just talked about
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:26.080]   today, actually, it was last night they sent out an email to all their users and they said,
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:32.800]   Hey, we've got cheap light bulbs. Oh, you can have tunable white lights for
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:41.680]   four pack for 30 bucks, which is crazy cheap. Oh, nobody said cheap. That's amazing. Well,
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:46.640]   there are other things that are that cheap. Kevin, your three labels are that cheap, but
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:51.840]   they are the crazy little lea. They're a little more expensive. Yeah. And now white is cheap
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:56.560]   because white, you know, but I don't know why a smart tunable tunable.
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:00.800]   The tunable is pretty good. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:08.880]   Oh, yeah. So in honor of this announcement, because you could pre-order them right now,
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:12.560]   you have to go through the app as part of their beta shopping program. I love that they call it
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:20.320]   beta shopping. Like dude, anyway, but I decided I'd show you guys the sensors, which I couldn't
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:27.280]   show you the other day because I was under embargo. Oh, so here's my wise sense box. I want you to
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:34.320]   notice how freaking tiny this is. This is my wise camera. Yes. It has four or three sensors in a
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:40.240]   bridge. Okay. Wow. It's the motion sensor. I mean, like seriously, you guys, these are like an inch.
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:45.280]   That's ridiculous. My other motion sensors are like this. And the bridge.
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:50.400]   Do the bridge? I do. Here's the bridge. So this right here. Oh my god. It's just a little plug-in.
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:58.720]   Yep. There it is. Ta-da. So I wanted to share that with you this package. If you have the
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:05.280]   wise camera, well, you need to have the wise camera. That's either $20 or $30 if you want the pan cam.
[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:11.440]   This package right here with the tube open close and one motion sensor, that is $19.99.
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:18.480]   Super cheap. It does run on its own proprietary radio. So oh, and that the package also contains
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:23.840]   the bridge. So what you're going to have is a sub-gigger Hertz radio that doesn't talk to
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:29.120]   anything else, but does a bang up job for very little money talking to its own little ecosystem.
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:35.520]   So that's the wise gear. Nice. See, this is they're smart because everything's very inexpensive,
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:39.760]   but there are so many things now you can buy that I feel like I'm going to spend hundreds of
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:46.000]   dollars on this. Well, and they're profitable. They are four for Amazonians started this Amazon
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:56.960]   people Amazon. Because they're up in Seattle, that makes sense. Yeah. And they, their idea was to
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:01.840]   become profitable or to build very cheap stuff and sell a heck of a lot of it is their whole
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:07.360]   business model. But I wasn't just growth for growth sake. They did want to be a profitable
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:14.400]   enterprise. Yes, yes. They're not venture backed. Nice. So really? They're doing this all on their own?
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:18.160]   They were for a while. I don't know if they've raised many cents, but yeah.
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:24.400]   Awesome. I'm shopping right now. I'm going to buy bulbs. Oh, better hurry. 32% sold already.
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:32.160]   Oh, it was 16% last night. So how many can I buy? Quick. I can buy three. Three's four packs.
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:36.640]   That's 12. Yeah, that's 12. That's a price. I'm buying. Yeah, 12 bulbs. So I mean, I don't
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:41.760]   have to ever buy bulbs again, right? Oh, you know what my thing should have been? I don't have it
[01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:47.120]   physically. I'll have it physically next week. The Lutron Aurora next week. I'll show it to you.
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:53.360]   Next week or the week after. And maybe I won't get the pan this time. I'll just get a couple of
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:59:00.000]   the regulars because I think I don't use the pan that much. What do you think? I don't have
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:06.160]   the pans. I just go with the straight ones. Can't be. I had a couple of the pans. Okay. I bought
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:12.640]   three because they were so cheap. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Kevin Tofel from all about. If you want to
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:20.400]   go Stacy, go ahead. Okay. Thank you, dear. No, I know. All about Stacy. It's all about Stacy. Stacy
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:28.880]   and IOT.com. She's gone. Stacy and IOT.com and the podcast you do with Kevin Tofel. Yeah. IOT podcast.
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:34.320]   Must listen. Subscribe to the newsletter to thank you, Stacy. And you, sir, Kevin Tofel,
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:39.760]   what do you have to show for yourself? So I get this question all the time. What Chromebook
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:43.520]   should I buy? And the first thing I do is say, well, what are you going to do? How much do you want
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:49.040]   to spend? Are you like a low end Chromebook user or high end? And no matter what, I almost always get
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:54.400]   the universal answer of, well, I don't want to cheap out, but I don't want to spend too much.
[01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:59.040]   I don't want to use basic stuff. I don't need Linux. So it's always like, you just need a mid-range
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:04.080]   Chromebook and you don't want to spend 600 bucks. Okay. This is the first time I can remember
[02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:13.840]   that both the HP Chromebook X360 14, which is a mouthful and the Dell Inspiron Chromebook 14
[02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:19.600]   are the exact same price because they're both discounted $100 to $130 at Best Buy this week.
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:25.680]   So what I did was I put a little chart together showing you what the very few differences are.
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:31.840]   So you can decide if you've got 450 bucks, which of these two you want? There aren't too many
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:36.640]   differences. If you want more memory, which I always recommend, you can't go wrong with any
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:43.440]   more memory, you go with the X360. But if you want more storage and you want to pen, you go with the
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:49.920]   Dell same processor, same graphics chip, same displays, back like keyboards, everything else is
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:54.480]   mostly the same. Maybe it a little bit or battery life out of the HP. It's a little lighter,
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:01:00.800]   little smaller, but for 450 bucks, you can get yourself a nice Chromebook right now, your choice.
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:04.400]   I have links to Best Buy. They are not affiliate links. So I'm not making any money off this.
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:09.680]   It's not promotional. This is just if you want mid-range, you cannot go wrong with either one,
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:16.480]   pick which column is better for you. Great choice. I agree. 100%. Now that Stacy's gone,
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:24.960]   let's do a little Rogan. Do you hate Joe Rogan yourself? I am ambivalent. I am too.
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:31.360]   I am too. My son loves him. Of course, he's a very famous podcaster, MMA guy, commentator,
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:39.040]   comic, and a company called Desa, which does AI voices, built a model to replicate Joe's voice to
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:46.480]   show AI techniques. And they've got a little game at fakejorogan.com. Probably they did that
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:51.040]   because they will hope Joe would mention it on his podcast is my guess. So I'm going to play a
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:57.600]   sample, pick a sample from one to eight and see if you can play the game here. One to eight, Kevin.
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:08.320]   Oh, how about six? You are much less likely to injure yourself if you do it correctly.
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:13.600]   I do not think that is Joe Rogan. You think that's faux Rogan? I think it's I do.
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:16.240]   Nope. It's real Joe. Carson, one way in.
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:22.720]   Isn't that amazing? All right. No, actually, that's not amazing yet because it was the real Joe.
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:28.880]   Pick another number three three. Yeah, it's goofy. The world's goofy. There's a lot of goofy
[02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:34.800]   shit out there, but just go with it. That's real. That's got to be real, right? I don't think so.
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:40.080]   You say faux Rogan, you would be correct, my friend, fooled both me and Carsten.
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:47.120]   Okay, that was faux. Pick another number. Carson, Carson, Carson, Carson, Carson,
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:56.640]   paper for healthy local ingredients, farm, fresh ingredients. That's real. It's got to be real.
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:02.320]   I agree. That's real. I think it's fake. It is real. It's real. Fulled Carsten, but he played a
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:06.480]   lot. Anyway, you could play along too. Fake Joe Rogan, they randomized these samples.
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:14.960]   But I think, let's look at the two that were fake. No, that was real. The fake one we heard.
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:19.600]   Yeah, it's goofy. The world's goofy. There's a lot of goofy shit out there, but just go with it.
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:26.080]   That sounds like AI. It's a good fake. It's a good fake. Better than Translato Tron.
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:31.600]   I thought. Burn now. Now. But he's speaking English. Yeah, impressive.
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:39.600]   And that's the Google Assistant voice. I know why Joe Rogan, wake up me up. That sounds painful.
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:45.440]   Do you want to play your video, Carsten? Yes, I have a thing this week. I have a video that a
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:51.200]   viewer sent in. Yes. Of one of our one of our favorite fans. You know, he tried to do this in the
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:57.520]   studio and couldn't really do it. One of our favorite fans. One of our favorite fans will sing along
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:20.720]   with the twig theme. Look at that. The wind out. I hate this show. He's got range. I hate it. Don't
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:35.200]   play it. Trust. His Rufus's pet claims that he loves the show, but doesn't sound like it does.
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:41.920]   I'm glad because Rufus was in studio and we couldn't quite get the howling right. But clearly,
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:47.360]   that's to prove it. That was impressive. Very impressive. Thank you, Kevin. Great to have you
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:54.080]   about Chromebooks.com, everybody. It's all about Chromebooks. I don't know what else to say.
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:05:00.800]   It's pretty much as it all says it all. And you can hear him with Stacy on the IOT podcast every
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:05.600]   week. You do it right. You kind of like Wednesday mornings. So that way we do Wednesday mornings and
