[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff Jarvis has the week off, but we're joined
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.200]   by Twitter cartoonist, the first engineer fired by Elon Musk and the creator of this
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.040]   legendary comic about the organizational structure of the Big Six tech company's Manu Cornet
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.280]   is our guest Stacey and Anne are here too. Lots to talk about. Stay here. This week in
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.320]   Google is next.

[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.520]   Jeff Jarvis is not here. We have a very fine replacement who I will introduce momentarily
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.400]   but first let's say hello to Aunt Pruitt, hands on photography, our community manager
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.360]   and the fabulous Twit Discord club twit leader. Wonderful to have you here as well.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.640]   Thank you sir. I am glad to give Mr. Jarvis some crap for always talking about how he's
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.240]   here all the time but he's not here this week. That's okay Mr. Jarvis. We see you.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.720]   He's hardly ever absent. He was when we used to do the show.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.040]   He was really bad. He used to go to Davos and all sorts of stuff. Travel. Remember that?
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.400]   He would be on it like he's like, "Yeah, it's wood in the morning here." I'm like, "Man,
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.840]   go to bed." Hey, I am very excited to welcome our guest today.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.200]   Now, 10 years ago I was sent this cartoon, a cartoon that we have referred to many times.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.520]   Everybody in the tech industry has referred to many times. Let me give you a close up
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.920]   shot of it because the details matter. This is by a cartoonist who at the time was working
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.720]   at Google named Manu Cornet or Cornet is how he likes it. These are the org charts for Amazon
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.960]   nice traditional org chart hierarchical. Jeff Bezos at the top. He was at Google. Google
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.480]   is a little bit messy. Facebook, social graph, Apple all set it around one red dot. Steve
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.640]   Jobs at the time is 2012. Actually no jobs had already passed. So it's Tim Cook officially.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.200]   Oracle, which is mostly legal and a little bit of engineering. But the one that we always
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.080]   talk about is Microsoft. This really was the case at Microsoft for a long time. We're independent
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:10.920]   divisions of Microsoft which shoot at each other. So the each of hand guns. The Windows
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.480]   team hated the Word team and the Word team hated. It was one of those, the Cloud team.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.000]   Anyway, this is a classic, really a classic. You see Manu autographed it for Leo Laporton,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.440]   everyone at Twit and drew a little Manu in the corner. We're thrilled to have Manu Cornet
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.920]   on the show with us today. Hi, Manu. Hello. So actually, I think I drew this in 2011.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:42.080]   So Steve Jobs was still alive. Yeah. Yeah. A couple of months before. And I was an engineer
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.400]   at Google for 15 years. So just by virtue of me being on the show, you have your Google
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.880]   excuse. Oh, you're right. Boom. Handled it right there. Done. You can skip the change
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.600]   about now. Wait, this is a good chance for audience research. Yay or nay on the change
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.480]   luck. I'm not sure I want to open that poll. That's an Elon kind of thing. I'm afraid of
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.200]   the bots. I don't. So we were talking about Manu. Yes, last week. And I guess that's what
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.080]   precipitated his appearance here. We knew Jeff would be out and I thought, well, let's
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:24.160]   get Manu on. He was the first person fired from Twitter, aside from the sea level executives
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.120]   like the CEO and the head legal counsel. He was one of the first people, if not the first
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.280]   people person to be fired at Twitter, the economist had a great story, which I referred
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.520]   to last week. I thought I'd been hacked. It turned out I'd been fired.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:49.680]   Manu, first of all, let me let me ask you here you are now a couple of weeks after. How do
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.840]   you feel these days about what's going on at Twitter? Well, personally, I'm doing great.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:05.320]   What's going on at Twitter? I don't know. I'm a bit concerned about the political changes,
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.640]   all the changes in moderation. Many people are concerned about the technical side. Whoever
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:17.520]   is left, are they going to be able to hold the fort? I think I have maybe less of a concern
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.680]   for this, but it seems like advertisers are leaving. I don't think Elon Musk is ready
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.840]   to pump more cash into this because he's already pumped a lot of. So I think he's going to
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:39.280]   face with a difficult choice if it doesn't really fly. Is he going to lose face by really
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.040]   ending the whole thing? Or is he going to be able to manage? I'm not sure.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.400]   He's already lost a little bit of face. You heard about him. Dave Chappelle bringing him
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:58.840]   up on stage in San Francisco during his show a couple of days ago. Now, he says he was
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.240]   both mixed, cheered in boot. I did hear some cheers, but primarily boot for about 10 minutes.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.280]   His tweet said something like, "To be fair, it was 90% cheers and 10% both." That's his
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:17.600]   usual way of trying to spin the news. I should have started with this. How are you doing
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:24.840]   personally? I'm doing great. I'm one of the lucky ones, really. I don't have these issues.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.400]   Some people have, and some of them have remained at Twitter just because of that reason because
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.640]   they are on an H1B visa, for example, and they would not be able to find another time
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:44.720]   immediately. So if they stick around, I don't have any health coverage issue. So I'm really
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:52.440]   pretty lucky. I guess I have two sides. My human and engineer side is a bit upset about
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:08:00.120]   how this whole thing was conducted. My cartoonist side is having lots of fun, drawing almost
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:06.160]   every day, something about whatever new, stupid things that he's inventing every single day.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.080]   You have, in fact, I imagine this was one of the reasons you were fired. You have a whole
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:18.960]   selection of what you call "twit tunes" that you have drawn over the time the first one.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:27.800]   This was before Elon came along, even. Initially, I did this at Google as well for almost 15
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:35.400]   years. To their credit, they never fired me for it. Even though some of them were pretty
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:47.600]   critical. Most companies, you're allowed to politely dissent. What is allowed? Defiant
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.200]   allowed. You could be allowed and still be fired. Right. Do they ever tell you why you
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:09:00.720]   were fired? Not really. It seems like the most obvious reason is because I published a
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:08.720]   little Chrome extension, a little tool to help people automate a tiny part of getting
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:14.680]   some of their email out. Stuff that would be valuable for future employment, things like
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:20.040]   performance reviews or good words from colleagues. Anything that is stuck in your work email
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:27.360]   that you would lose access if you get fired or if you resign. I published a link to that
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.560]   Chrome extension, which really only ultimately liked to a three clicks. I was fired about
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.560]   an hour, actually an hour and five minutes later. I could see Elon seeing that and hitting
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:42.520]   the fan or hitting something. I can understand that. What was your job at Twitter? What
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:52.880]   did you do? Engineer, I was working on the web application. Front end. Yes. In fact, you
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:59.320]   described this in the story before you're firing or doing the 24 hour long shifts, trying
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:06.600]   to get that blue check out in time. He said, "It has to be done by Friday." Your colleagues
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:16.280]   were working on it. You said you pitched in. There was some dimension of calling people
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.280]   by name and saying, "You're responsible for this issue. Don't get it done by the states,"
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:27.120]   which would be maybe more like a Monday. This would be on set on a Friday. It was never
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.920]   really explicitly said that you had to work over the weekend, but it was no other way of
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:39.640]   making it happen. I liked those colleagues whose names were on the shopping board really.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:46.360]   I didn't have to pitch in, but I was glad to. You talked before the show started about
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:53.040]   the collegial feeling at Twitter. I have to say, even just looking at the auction of all
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.720]   the Twitter office furniture that Elon's auctioning off and the kitchen supplies at
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.000]   the auction off, it looked like a not a bad place to work.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.320]   It was a great place to work. Yes. I think I wanted to do a cartoon about this, about
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:12.120]   maybe one of the items being sold on eBay or whatever would be the company ethics that
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:18.880]   sold to be sold. That one's going cheap. It might be free.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:26.240]   Anybody wants it, come and get it, but you've got to come and get it. Sometimes it's odd
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:33.160]   to file lawsuits and complain and be unionized even because you might come across as spoiled
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.080]   brass were already so spoiled with everything.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:42.560]   Yes. I think that's the risk is that people look at engineers in Silicon Valley and say,
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.720]   "For crying out loud, they feed you. They do your tricleaning. You get a leather clad
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.000]   bus to take you to the office. What are you complaining about?"
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.640]   Exactly. That's why maybe the flip side of it is that if they don't want to anymore,
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:05.800]   then they can fire pretty unceremoniously. But then you can find another gig. Even in
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   today's climate, it's not so difficult. Stacey and Ant, please don't let me. I will
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.960]   let me monopolize the conversation.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:21.000]   Well, I do have a question for him. You mentioned your technical concerns for Twitter, not
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.440]   at your gone. What in particular? I mean, you're a front-end person. Are your concerns more
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:34.280]   along the lines of reliability of it staying up or is it deeper content moderation or legal
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.920]   concerns? That's the thing.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.600]   I think there's two different things. The content moderation, that is clearly already
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:52.560]   going down. I saw some posts of people posting full-length Hollywood movies in 10 increments
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:59.520]   in threads. You want to automate as much as you can, but sometimes you do need humans
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:05.960]   to go through some of this. This is clearly already degraded a lot, not to mention all
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:15.120]   the hate speech and the political stuff. I'm not that concerned as keeping things afloat.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.520]   There's much fewer people, but I think there's still good people. I don't really hope for
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.920]   Twitter to go down. I have already known and not bitter or anything. I hope that it
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:31.000]   succeeds. I still like the platform. But it is true that you're starting to see some
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.640]   glitches here and there. There's just a lot of knowledge because when you fire so many
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:44.440]   people in the half of the rest, it's also gone just by virtue of being thrilled with
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:50.880]   what happened. You just lose a lot of knowledge about how things work. I don't know how it's
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.960]   going to be transferred.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.520]   Is it a safe speculation to say, "One of these days, the Twitter API is just going to
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.560]   be gone." We can't have people just accessing it, willy-nilly, and doing whatever they want
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.840]   from a third party standpoint. Twitter is just going to lock it down and further make
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.680]   it more proprietary. In all the way you're in, there is if you pay.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:19.720]   Right. I actually don't know what is currently possible with the API. Isn't it already encouraged
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:24.680]   that you would do something, even if you're linking to a tweet, you would be encouraged
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.680]   to post some kind of a...
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.680]   It's an embed.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.680]   It's an embed.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.440]   I mean, there are third party apps with the API. As you remember, you weren't there, but
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.720]   as you remember, they went through a period of open-
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.720]   Crackdown.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.240]   Then they cracked down and then they would build Gross's company, started to acquire Twitter
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:46.480]   clients and said, "Maybe we don't think this is such a good idea." What did you do at Google?
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:54.280]   Oh, so I was at Google for such a long time, basically forever, until almost 15 years.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:00.960]   I worked on Gmail and Inbox for about eight years. I worked on Android.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.720]   Sad about Inbox. I really liked Inbox.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:09.680]   Yeah. Some people really liked it. It had a small user base in Google's terms. I think
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.680]   any startup would be happy to have that user.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.800]   Oh, you only had 100 million users. Oh, come on, man.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.560]   It's barely just doing anything.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.440]   It was pitched as the next Gmail. So there's big issues to fill, which it didn't really
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:30.520]   feel. Inbox and Android, and I worked on Chrome and Chrome OS4 as well, and I worked on Search.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:34.040]   Yeah. I spent a long time there. I spent a bit on my own.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.680]   Are you going to go back to work for a company or do you want to freelancer? You just want
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.640]   to be a cartoonist for a while.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:46.360]   Great question. I'm lucky so far that I don't have a huge financial pressure because I'm
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.720]   a saver and I've been in the industry for a long time. I'm going to do some cartooning
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:57.840]   for a bit. But I'm absolutely terrible at selling my stuff. I just like to give everything away
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:04.960]   for free. I hate paywalls. I hate at least as across market tunes. I think you're as
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:12.000]   our fine because you hand-picked them. But yeah, I just want to give everything away
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.760]   for free, which makes no money, obviously.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:21.040]   As a creator, it sounds like you need an agent, sir. I don't think I don't think
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:27.680]   better. What's one? Are you all right? No, I'm not volunteering. I don't want that work.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:33.920]   I'm just thinking about where people will go now because I don't know if y'all remember,
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.920]   but way back in the day when Tumblr was a thing, you'd see people get book deals off
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:44.080]   of Tumblr and then you saw people get book and calendar deals from Twitter and even Instagram,
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.320]   maybe. I don't know where people go for that now to find the fun.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:57.360]   Keep us in touch, creators. For those who are not watching, Stacey has the cutest sneeze.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:04.160]   I'm so sorry. You're really missing that. But audio, it didn't sound nearly as good as it looked.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:11.680]   Like a four month old? What was that? When I sneeze, it's like, if I sneeze, it's like,
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:19.520]   "Rah!" And this is like, "Yeah!" Very cute. Very adorable. I'm looking at what were you saying
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.720]   I forgot now. I knocked it right out of my head. She was wondering where creators go. I think
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:32.400]   there's Patreon. There's some platforms. It's a bit different. Yeah, you should definitely start
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   a Patreon. That's easy. Or you could even do, like, is it coffee? Yeah, buying a coffee.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.360]   But I'm not going to hear bills. If you want to go back and look at his Google comics, it's
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:49.360]   GUMIX, G-O-O-M-I-C-S.net. And they're great too. But you know, it is interesting. You don't
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:58.240]   pull punches. So it's kind of fun that they let you do this. Did you ever get any heat for?
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:05.360]   I did a little bit. Not quite so much that I would get fired. And it's hard for these if you
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:12.240]   don't have the context. It's a bit hard to understand. So this is the only way that I allow people to
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:17.680]   pay for my stuff, is I have some books and then I have all the context around it. This was after
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:24.720]   the James DeMoor thing, the portrait of women in tech. That was my sort of attempt at doing a
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:32.800]   positive reply to the sexist. No, no, I really do. But the issue is that if I make a book and then
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.440]   the whole purpose of the book is to have text around the cartoons explaining the context,
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.760]   you know, if you have to explain it for 30 minutes, it's no longer funny. So it's not easy. You have
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:50.480]   to know the context to see why this is. Of course, we cover Google and we're doing it for years. So
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:56.720]   maybe I'm a little more privy to what's going on inside. But I kind of like also the puzzle part
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:02.640]   of it. I'm like, what are these talking about? Full lyrics for official promo and them launch
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:08.640]   and run and brag. And then so you have to think, well, was that really the anthem or is it just
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:17.040]   what it sounded like? Or it's fun. I love it. I think it's really worth preserving as an archive
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:26.000]   of history told in a unique way. That last one, that last one was trying to poke fun at the way
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.200]   people get promoted. This is not just about Google, but very often you have to have to say, hey,
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.920]   this is why I launched looked at its big and new and shiny and looking great. And then I'm
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:41.040]   off to something else. I'm not doing any of the maintenance and this thing may have been built
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:46.640]   in a terrible way. But you can give us some insight because this is kind of, you know, everybody
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.040]   from the outside doesn't really know what's going on inside a company. But from the outside,
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:57.760]   it looks exactly like that that the incentives at Google are to create something new, but much less
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:03.680]   to maintain it or keep it running. And some people have even said that's the problem with Google,
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.840]   is they're always trying to do the next new thing and never putting any effort into the old thing.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.320]   Is that accurate? And that's why they fail so many things. I think they're trying to,
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:20.720]   at least on paper, incentivize people who are also more into grunge work and maintenance and
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.920]   clean things up to make them more. And there are people like that.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.880]   You shouldn't call it grunge work. You could call it erasing technical debt.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:35.600]   Yeah. Those sexy maintenance engineers. Some people love that who get code to get a code base
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.760]   and love to dig into it and figure out, you know, what it's doing and how to make it better.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.520]   There's certainly people who love that, not everybody. Yeah, absolutely. I personally like
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.640]   that very much. I, and yeah, I think Stacy, you should, speaking of volunteering, you should
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:54.320]   join me to write the copy for the promo package. There you go. I'll help you for it. I'll do that.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.800]   So much. I am also terrible at selling myself, but I'll sell you in a hard time.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.000]   You can sell other people. Yeah.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.480]   Yeah. What's funny is I think you and me, Stacy, are terrible at it.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.920]   Aunt and Jeff are really good. And so it's a good balance. I wish I was better.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.240]   You're pretty good at getting the create and dominate out there. I think you do a good job
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:19.760]   promoting it. So Leo, do you need to have a team of people around you saying, hey, you should
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:26.560]   make people pay for this? I do. That's what that's honestly, that is, that is, you know,
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:33.200]   we have a huge, that's the team. There's some of the team is, you know, editing and doing content
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:39.520]   creation, but that's only that's probably less than half. Half the team is marketing, advertising,
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:45.280]   sales, copywriting, continuity. You have to do all that. And I need to do it.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.720]   So I keep the call on after this. So I'm going to approach some people.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.520]   Good. You could steal some of my people. Absolutely.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:22:02.560]   So, and again, Stacy and Aunt, don't hesitate to jump in on this because I will dominate.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:09.680]   So I have a question because I'm unlike many still on Twitter, I've noticed myself checking it
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:16.160]   list. There's definitely less of the type of content that I like to see, which was like super
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:22.880]   nerdy debates about things or cool things that people were building. But there's still little of
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.320]   that and there's still people talking to me and I'm still getting lots of new followers.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.520]   And so far, only one of them has been a jerk. So that's good.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.520]   What is your take on Twitter now and like what?
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.280]   You said you love it, right? You should people be using it. Do you still love it?
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:50.000]   Yeah, I still like the platform. I don't really like what is currently happening. It's only been
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.600]   a month or so. I think it's almost unprecedented how much of the company culture has changed
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:04.400]   within a month of an acquisition. But it's not even an acquisition. It's more like a takeover.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:17.760]   I do see more hate speech people who are in line with Elon Musk's views are more
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:25.440]   emboldened. So there's some, yeah. But so one thing I really like about the platform that
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:32.640]   happened recently is this thing called Birdwatch, which was a way for the community to moderate itself
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:39.200]   by calling out people on their lives, for example. I know something, I think there was a great answer
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:47.280]   to the dilemma of "shooie sensor people" or not when they say false things. And it seems like a
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:54.560]   good middle ground to me where you don't censor, but you add a note below it. And that's
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.480]   only appears if a certain number of people do it. And if you agree, and there's some safeguards,
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:06.880]   but you give people context to maybe find out why this is a lie. So that's one thing that I'm
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:14.240]   concerned about is that I think Musk's tweets were targeted by this at some point. So as we know
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:19.840]   from his history, if something disagrees with him, he's probably going to try and kill it. So
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.680]   I wonder if this is going to survive. I think he renamed it from Birdwatch.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:30.800]   He called it "nopes". Yeah, something like this. And I think Jack Dorsey said this was the most
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:38.880]   boring name ever. Jack is tuned a little bit. Jack was all in on Elon. He thought he'd really
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.360]   transform the place. And I think he's got to feel a little bit watching it burn to the ground. He's
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:49.440]   got to feel a little bit like, "What are you doing to my baby here?" So let me post. So one of the
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:56.480]   latest cartoons that I posted, I posted a link in the Discord chat, was I think you really need
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:03.760]   to get the context, but it was the scene of Star Wars where the Emperor is Musk and Jack is a
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:10.480]   Darth Vader in the back and watching it happen. So... I recognize him from the beard.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:17.520]   Yeah, exactly. So this, you know, I think it's actually harder to be a cartoonist than to be an
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:22.880]   engineer because you mess up one little thing. Like that beard wasn't quite obvious enough.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:28.560]   People didn't see it and they just scanned through things. I was hoping people would see it, but then
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:34.400]   they didn't and they might not. So you can mess up your joke by just one tiny detail. It looks like
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:40.880]   maybe Darth Vader's got a kind of hairy chest. Or you know, he's got his... But I think when, as
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:46.320]   soon as you said it's Jack Dorsey, then I know, "Oh yeah, that's the beard." Yeah, yeah. And you do
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.880]   Elon quite well, although I'm sure Elon's not totally flattered by how you do Elon.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.520]   Well, what's he gonna do farming again? Yeah.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:26:00.400]   You know, I have to say, man, you're a nice guy and you're not a bit... You don't sound anyway,
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:05.280]   and I don't think you are bitter about this and I don't think it's changed your attitude towards
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:10.720]   Twitter, obviously, not certainly not towards your former colleagues. When Elon first said,
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:17.680]   "I want to buy Twitter back in last spring." Were you at the time? Did you think this could be a good thing?
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:24.240]   I think like many people, we were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:32.080]   That's good, dear. And yeah, I think, I mean, to be fair, I think there were needed... We had to
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:39.760]   have layoffs, Twitter had to have layoffs at some point. It was probably... It has grown too fast.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:45.680]   It was a company that was trying to play nice. I think the one way Stacey put it a few shows ago
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:51.760]   was trying to be a good neighbor. Or was it Stacey? Yeah, I forgot. But it was trying to be good
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:59.120]   on the political realm and the free speech part, but without too much hate speech,
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.440]   and it was trying to be nice with its employees and its users. It was not perfect, but it was
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:08.800]   trying to be a nice company. And for that, also not being too aggressive with ads,
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:15.440]   it was not very profitable, so it became an easy target. It still had to be profitable.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:24.160]   I appreciate the fact that you can say that it seems like people were a bit open-minded about it,
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:29.520]   because according to most of the press that I read, as soon as the news came out, everybody
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:36.160]   was like, "Oh my gosh, that's the worst idea ever is for him to come in and acquire this company
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:42.240]   without even giving them a shot." Granted, it is turning into a bit of a crap show more and more
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.880]   each day, but you still got to give the person a shot, because we don't know what you might have
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.880]   had up its sleeve. It could have been profitable and beneficial for the company.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:59.120]   Well, I didn't know him very well. She don't know that much about the backstory and all the
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:04.480]   little... all the way he behaves, you say, "Hey, this is a guy who is building
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:11.680]   rocket ships and electric cars." And he seems like a cool dude, I mean, in some way. I also like
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:17.680]   that he is... I'm going to get lots of crapful things about Mr. Musk, but I like that.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.520]   I like you too, trust me. You'll be okay.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:26.800]   I like that she doesn't take himself too seriously. That's something, as my cartoonist side resonates
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:35.200]   with him. He arrives to the offices with a sink just to make a stupid pun. Whoever is going to get
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:41.760]   fired that day may not find it so funny, but I quite like that eccentric part. But then the more
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:50.080]   I learned about him, the less I liked it, and the more the more the benefits and doubts there was
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.520]   in my mind for him, and there's really none left at this point.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.360]   When did it start to turn?
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:01.840]   There was so much of a roller coaster for the whole period.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:07.520]   You talked in the Economist article about how distracting it was when all of this was going back
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.000]   and forth before he actually made the acquisition.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.560]   Yeah, it was very distracting. It was not only distracting because it's you're working for a
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:22.720]   company and your company is being acquired, and I'm posting another cartoon in the...
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:30.160]   But also, it's a company that is extremely always in the spotlight because journalists
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:36.480]   use it a lot, so they cover it more. And this is what we were told to just tune out the noise,
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.480]   but it's hard when you know...
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:45.280]   You've got jet airplanes going over, fireworks, a meta-blimp, a helicopter. You've got people
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:51.520]   saying free speech, go perock, love you Jackie, lawn forever, cheers, and then you're just sitting there
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.560]   head down coding.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:59.680]   Exactly. So, not easy. Yeah, and he was also changing his mind every other day about whether
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.000]   he wanted to be on the board, whether he wanted to buy the company or not buy the company, and then
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.200]   Twitter trying to sue him, would he win the suits or not? And then so, after a while, it was just
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:20.000]   such a bad Netflix show with a cliffhanger at the end of each episode. So, at the start,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.840]   you try to project yourself and say, "Okay, what's going to happen? Am I going to stay here?"
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.640]   But after a couple of bad episodes, you just roll your eyes and you just...
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.800]   What's he going to come up with next?
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.200]   Right. So, people were getting to moralize. I'm sure you weren't alone in that respect.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.640]   Yeah, and I was... Well, my way of dealing with this is to draw cartoons about it, and I think...
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.120]   You had an outlet, which is good. Yeah.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.920]   Yeah, exactly. And I think I'm hoping it helped some people
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:56.720]   indirectly by having that outlet that they could look at, at least to make fun of the situation.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.720]   Do you think Elon saw those cartoons ever?
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:05.760]   So, I gave him one that was printed on paper. I don't know how much that may or may not have.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:10.240]   Did that count towards your sheet of your pile of code?
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.680]   This is what I've been working on here.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:21.840]   It did not. It did not. I was originally called for one of those meetings, and then it got canceled.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.280]   I was always lastening it.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.280]   You never met with anybody to review your contributions for the past few months?
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:32.800]   I did not. But I know some people who have, and I was scheduled to do that, which is...
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.920]   What was that? What were those like, the people who had them?
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:46.800]   Well, I only got some vague comments about them, but I think it depended a lot on the interviewer,
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.120]   as most of them were Tesla engineers.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.880]   Right. They were some of them were, I'm sure, they were great, but they don't know anything about it.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.800]   They were front-end website development.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.920]   So, what was the cartoon you gave Elon?
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.520]   Let me post the link. It was one where...
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.520]   Just tell me the number. I've got the whole...
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.120]   Oh, great. Oh, I was going to be the line numbers, just like with Jeff.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.160]   This is like cartoon number. Give me the cartoon number, just like Jeff.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.240]   You're filling in for Jeff. It's not a democracy, man-o.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.960]   Okay. This one you gave him. Oh, I love this one.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.720]   So, you've got somebody who looks a lot like olive oil.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:28.960]   So, this one was actually 100% stolen from something Stacey said in one episode, and that was...
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.160]   Yeah, so Stacey should get the credit for this.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.280]   So, that's Stacey saying, "You break it, you buy it."
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.400]   Yes. And there's all these ceramic logos of all the big tech companies,
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.280]   Snapchat, Google, Meta, and unfortunately, Elon has accidentally knocked the Twitter
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.600]   ceramic onto the ground where it has smashed. What does Stacey say?
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.440]   Was it that you break it, you buy it?
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.040]   I think she said, yeah, she said it.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.400]   She did say that. I remember saying that.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.560]   There we go. See, I have inspired art, y'all.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.160]   Art, you are so exciting.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:58.800]   Thanks, man.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.600]   You're so exciting.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.040]   I think this is awesome.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.400]   I can't give you the original drawing for this one,
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.640]   because I already gave it to someone else, but I would.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.320]   That is fine. You gave it to Elon.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.120]   That's cool.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.360]   No, no, I gave him a print.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.440]   I gave him to a colleague.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.120]   I'm okay.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.800]   Do you know what Elon's reaction?
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.720]   So, this is pretty benign. It's kind of funny.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.760]   It's not an insult to Elon.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.080]   And, in fact, he probably felt a little bit this way, like,
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.440]   "Oh, boy, now I got to buy it."
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.360]   Yeah, that's what he said.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.640]   He just took the cartoon and he said, "Well, I bought it anyway."
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:36.720]   I had written a small hand-vision note in the corner,
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.400]   saying something like, "I hope you like having a court jester at Twitter,
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.400]   or you'll have to get me fired."
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.800]   But I don't think he read that.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.920]   He does. I don't think he likes a court jester at Twitter.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.800]   Yeah, I'm sorry, not.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.160]   Check one of the things that happened today.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.920]   Finally kicked off Elon Jet.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.840]   He was shadow banning it, which is hysterical,
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.560]   given all the things he said about shadow banning.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.120]   So much for absolute freedom of speech.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.680]   Shadow banning, which is widely misinterpreted by the right as
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.400]   "No one can see you," merely means you're deranked.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.320]   You're not going to get promoted as much.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.440]   Right? Am I correct saying that, man?
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.760]   No one can see you.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.520]   But they have to know to see you.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.080]   I don't know.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.840]   Yeah, there's Spike Masnick wrote an article about it on Techdirt,
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.720]   in which he said it was quite widely put about
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.160]   what shadow banning was that wasn't accurate,
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:38.720]   and that even though Twitter has many, many times explained
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:43.760]   how the shadow banning worked, everybody misinterpreted it.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:50.160]   And then Elon, of course, who claimed otherwise used it,
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.920]   used it against Elon Jet.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.240]   That poor kid has been now kicked off.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.640]   He initially, Elon banned the Elon Jet account,
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.240]   but not the Bezos Jet account,
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.280]   which some people took as interesting.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.680]   I think the kid who did it has been kicked off now
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.920]   as all of his accounts, but we've all followed him.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:11.200]   He moved to Mastodon, so you can expect Elon's jet on Mastodon.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.760]   Good luck taking that down, Elon.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.080]   I will follow that.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:21.200]   Yeah, Elon's jet's still around, just somewhere else.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.560]   I love this cartoon.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:27.120]   I think this is exactly what anybody who runs a company needs
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.360]   is a little light light, and I mean really light ribbing.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.760]   Yeah, I would agree.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:38.960]   I tried when I was debating whether to try and make a fool of myself
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.520]   by walking up to him and giving a cartoon,
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.360]   and deciding which one I try to get a good compromise
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.800]   between something that would be perceived as boot licking,
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.720]   would be not very critical at all,
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.360]   and something that would be too critical,
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.280]   which also existed, which would maybe get me fired on the spot.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.040]   So I try to pick something in the middle.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.680]   Here's Jack Sweeney.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.240]   He's a college kid who does the jet trackers.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.800]   He tutored.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.520]   Elon gave me no warning, plus he suspended all of my accounts,
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.320]   half of which track aircraft like NASA aircraft,
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.880]   experimental aircraft, weather, air force, not people,
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.520]   including my personal account.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.960]   So, Elon, we know now, I think it's pretty clear,
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.600]   Elon does not take light ribbing well.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.920]   Yeah, I would argue that maybe he doesn't really have a sense of humor,
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.200]   in the sense that he has a sense of humor when it applies
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.600]   to making fun of others and possibly finding things funny,
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.960]   but not being able to.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.080]   If you think of a love or if you will.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.160]   Yeah, what comments call that punching down?
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.600]   Thank you.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.280]   Yeah, he's good at punching down.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.640]   Oh, he doesn't have anyone to punch up to.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.880]   I might disagree with you on that, but all right.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.080]   He certainly nobody richer.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.120]   There's that concept.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.320]   I was reading about it somewhere of the "oppressed billionaire"
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.680]   where all these people are like,
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.960]   "People are so mean to us."
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:07.440]   And I'm like, "I think you may have just been not surrounded by reality
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.720]   for so long, you...
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:12.960]   It's very hard to shed if that is part of your image
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.480]   and mental process to be like,
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.200]   "I'm fighting against the man."
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.880]   I mean, even today, I'm still like my 18-year-old self
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.880]   who is like, "I'm fighting against the man."
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.600]   And I'm like, "Stacey, you really know your movering technology."
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.720]   You are the man, Stacey.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.840]   I am the man.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.880]   That's the problem.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.560]   But yeah, so I think I get it, but I'm also like,
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.840]   "Oh, be better us."
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:40.640]   So again, if you want to see these,
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.240]   they're very wonderful,
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:46.320]   "Twit," T-W-I-T-T-O-O-N-S.com.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.080]   And here's one.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.520]   What's going on?
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.520]   Oh, it's Robbie from Tesla in the cockpit.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.360]   He's only ever driven electric.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.080]   It's a jet going down, smoking on the way down.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:56.880]   Where's the pilot?
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.800]   I don't think he's fired him.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.720]   But don't worry, Elon, you're still the greatest.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:04.160]   I think you were still at Twitter when you wrote that one.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.440]   Wow.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.240]   Hi.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.600]   I would need to look at the date.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.040]   This is 11/7.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:09.840]   So I think...
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.040]   No, then I was already gone.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:11.920]   It was 11.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.520]   It was first November 1st.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.080]   November 1st.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.000]   So everything pre-November 1st, you did as an employee.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.360]   Right.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.280]   So this one,
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:25.040]   this one, I'm going to get less let Leo describe it,
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.240]   because he's much better.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.680]   But this one came after the rumors that
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:34.000]   Elon was going to let about 75% of the staff go.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.240]   And I think the rumor broke exactly when the company was trying to
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:43.120]   have a company meeting to plan for what we're going to do next year.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.760]   I also love what you've done with the Tesla logo,
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.400]   because you didn't want to infringe on their copyright, I guess.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.680]   So, or their trademark.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.040]   So you have a...
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.640]   Well, it's obviously a Tesla logo,
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.640]   but it really looks kind of creepy like a spider.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.520]   Like a spider.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.680]   It's an M, it's an M, but...
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.000]   For Musk, I get it.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.440]   Very cool.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.800]   So there is a sort of damocles hanging over these two
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.560]   Twitter employees' heads.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:10.720]   The sort is engraved with the word 75%.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.040]   Elon is above with scissors cutting the string.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.440]   And one employee says to the other,
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.560]   "You done writing your 20-23 goals yet?"
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:25.600]   "My goal not to be heading ahead with a big sword."
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:30.880]   Speaking of posting, I need to post legal for a narration.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.240]   I'll do it. We'll do it.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:32.800]   We'll do it. We'll do it.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:32.800]   We'll do it. We'll do it.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.640]   And the Netflix calls and you want to do that.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.600]   We'll do that.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.960]   I'll be the...
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:41.920]   Here's the "TechDirk" article I was referring to.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.840]   Before Musk riled everyone up with his misleading Twitter files
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.720]   about shadow banning, Musk used the tool to hide the account tracking his plane.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.080]   What do you think of those Twitter files, by the way?
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.400]   Does it make you uncomfortable to see all that internal stuff?
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.720]   So I have to...
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.560]   This is also my bad or good engineering.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.520]   And if I don't know something, I didn't just say I don't know.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:10.720]   I haven't seen those, so I have no clever opinion much on this.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:10.880]   Good.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.320]   I don't know yet.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:12.880]   Enough said.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.160]   I need to see.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.680]   You probably don't want to read them.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.720]   Until you do.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.760]   Until you do.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.640]   Yeah, we've talked about it.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.080]   I don't need to reiterate it.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:20.640]   It's fine.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:24.720]   I'm just, you know, I'm just peppering you with questions,
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.440]   trying to get the inside story from Manu Cornette.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.320]   How do we know when to leave Twitter?
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.360]   Do you have like a line?
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.520]   I feel like I'm trying to figure out my Rubicon.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.560]   Like when...
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.720]   I'll tell you what my Rubicon was.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.400]   My Rubicon was...
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.520]   Yours doesn't count.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.080]   You...
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.160]   Well, I've left many times, but you know what?
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.280]   I think this should be your Rubicon when he says,
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.440]   "My pronouns are prosecute Fauci."
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.960]   That's...
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.880]   That's unacceptable.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.000]   And then the other thing,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.920]   the way he attacked Yol Ross...
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.000]   That was terrible.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:58.960]   Horrifically,
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.840]   Yol and his family have had to move out of their house,
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.200]   much like Brianna Wu did.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.720]   What I'm increasingly feeling is that Elon
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.640]   maybe wasn't his intent on long,
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.400]   but Twitter, and you will, I'm sure, agree,
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.920]   all of you, has the capability to be used as a weapon,
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.920]   a very sharp weapon.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.400]   But is that?
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.840]   And Elon knows that,
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.480]   and I think is now using it that way,
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.760]   intentionally,
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.160]   to rile up people to use his Elon stands and have them attack.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.760]   It is Elon's army now.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.760]   And he's using Twitter,
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:36.480]   like one of those IRC chatbot command and control centers.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.080]   He's always done this anyway with Dogecoin and stuff.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.360]   He loves the Emperor.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.200]   You know, the Emperor waves his hand,
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.040]   and the price of Doge goes up,
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.240]   and then the Emperor waves his hand,
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.680]   and the price of Doge goes down.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.960]   Well, if that was just a toy,
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.320]   now he's realizing,
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.720]   I can raise entire armies.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.200]   I can make a man move out of his house.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:59.840]   I can ruin somebody's life with my new little toy,
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:00.880]   and I think,
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.160]   like a kid pulling wings off of flies,
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.320]   that's what he's all about these days, and that is...
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.640]   But yet he also banned Kanye West.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.920]   Well, he brought him back, and then he abandoned him.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.400]   No, no, it's all what Elon wants,
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.080]   and that's why yo-L Roth quit.
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.080]   He said, "There's no need for trust to safety.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.320]   One man makes all the decisions."
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.960]   Okay, because the question is,
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:27.440]   is there a distinction between the fact that Elon is the CEO
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.480]   and owns the company?
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.360]   I mean, because by that,
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.840]   you're sharpening his sword.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:34.400]   You're sharpening his sword.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.320]   Anything you tweet, you're sharpening his sword.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.040]   Okay, so that's an interesting point.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.960]   Okay, so then, yeah, I would...
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.040]   That for me was the line,
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.520]   and I deleted all my tweets, deleted all my DMs.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.920]   I deleted my DMs.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.280]   Yeah, well, that's probably smart,
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.560]   and then, which is hard,
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.920]   because you have to do it one by one.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.240]   Man, that is very, very hard.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.600]   I even deleted the DM.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.280]   I got 10 years ago from Steve Martin,
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.200]   who said, "Hey, just wanted to know I'm a fan."
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.640]   I even deleted that,
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.040]   because I don't want Elon to have any of that.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.840]   Were you able to export them first?
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.800]   No, I didn't export them.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.360]   It's fine.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.240]   I don't really...
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.520]   Who exports?
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.480]   A lot of people do.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.040]   I'm like...
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.080]   Everybody over there, really.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.880]   But to me, Twitter is the ultimate in Ephemera.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.720]   So I'm just kind of like, wow, all...
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.560]   I mean, yes, there are things I'm like,
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.480]   "Oh, that one witty thing I said.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.200]   How cool was that?"
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:23.600]   But I guess...
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.880]   I don't know.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:25.600]   Wasn't that cool?
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.280]   Exactly.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:27.920]   The hindsight...
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.440]   Nothing I say is worth that.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.040]   There are people I have with this.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:31.600]   The problem I have with this...
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.000]   ...they never throw anything out,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:32.400]   and they just...
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.240]   They want everything, including all their old tweets.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.280]   Digital hoarders.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.000]   The problem I have with this is...
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.280]   When Mr. LaPorte says he wants to leave,
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.840]   or anybody says they want to leave the platform,
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.560]   the masses are just coming out,
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.240]   and it's like, "Ah, you shouldn't leave.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:48.960]   You shouldn't leave."
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.480]   When it's your freaking choice,
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.280]   if it's all about free speech and free choice,
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:56.320]   why can't we just up and leave these platforms
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.280]   and that be the end of it?
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.920]   Why must there be someone stepping in
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.840]   that don't know you from a hill of beans
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.680]   telling you, "You know what?
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.200]   No, you should stay here."
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:05.680]   You...
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:05.840]   Well...
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.240]   I'm the frog.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.840]   I get to decide how warm my bath should be, right?
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.880]   Right.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:13.200]   Right.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.800]   I go, "Oh, good line."
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.320]   Good line.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.040]   Good line.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.240]   Well, it got too hot for me a long time ago.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.680]   Actually, I left almost immediately
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:26.880]   when Elon started making jokes about masturbation and mastodon.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.800]   That was the line for me,
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.480]   but at this point, though,
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.000]   I think any sane person...
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.200]   What's your preferred temperature and sensation for the...
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.160]   Yeah, that's the question.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:38.720]   Is it not?
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.440]   No.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.120]   You know, I'm fine on Twitter for now.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.080]   You know, there's still some days that it bugs me a little more
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.920]   because I hate the fact that I block somebody every single day.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.160]   There's at least one person that gets blocked every single day.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.280]   I think that's stupid.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.960]   But at the same time, there's still my community there.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.280]   And then, speaking of mastodon,
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.200]   if I hop into mastodon right now,
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.640]   it's starting to annoy me a little bit over the last couple of days
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.440]   because everybody's talking about Twitter and Elon.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:07.840]   I'm like,
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:11.280]   wasn't that the whole point of getting off of that platform,
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.480]   getting off of Twitter,
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.360]   was to get over here and have a bit of fresh air,
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.480]   not to sit here and just continue to rehash the show that's happening.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.040]   First of all, we can't stop talking about it here either,
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.480]   and I know everybody would like us to.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.840]   Well, it's...
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:24.960]   But that'll go away.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.320]   I can do this a long show.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.440]   That will go away.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.800]   This is a new show.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.760]   That will go away.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.120]   I mean, honestly, it comes and goes with the temperature.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.120]   I don't see a lot of that on Twitch social.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.720]   Mostly, we're talking about other things.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.320]   I think most people, when they first get there,
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.280]   it's such a compulsion to check...
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.680]   Actually, can I correct myself, sir?
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.480]   Not necessarily Twitch social.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:52.000]   It's definitely the home feed and federated feed is where I see it.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.320]   You don't have to watch the local.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:54.800]   Either of those.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.480]   The home feeds do you follow, so...
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.760]   Unfollow some of those people.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:58.960]   Exactly.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.280]   And I'm like, "Well, I guess it's time for me to let this go."
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.240]   Because it's just...
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.200]   What's the point?
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.680]   Can you set yourself some kind of filter or...
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.160]   You can.
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:06.800]   ...and kind of filter in.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.400]   Yeah, you can filter at all the word,
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.280]   anytime the word Twitter.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.120]   Yeah, I've been setting some filters in.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:11.920]   You know what?
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.800]   I think there are a lot of people who would like to have an Elon filter on this show.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.080]   And I don't...
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.520]   I don't blame it.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.880]   But again, this is news.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:19.680]   I don't think that.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.400]   This is news.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:20.800]   Bye-bye.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.600]   I'm sick of the dude,
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.720]   but this is news,
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.360]   and he's gonna continue to be to give the keep-sewn
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.960]   given to the news platforms.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.320]   But when I do the news...
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.160]   It's the same thing when social media...
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.440]   People start coming to Maston,
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:37.040]   and then a lot of the tweeting was about Mastodon, right?
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.240]   How do you use it?
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.200]   Why does it do this?
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:39.680]   When...
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.800]   That's all gonna come down.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.520]   That'll go away.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.480]   It's just that, you know,
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.560]   it's just people new to the platform and so forth.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.760]   It's the S word show that it's on giving.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.560]   Yes, thank you.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.320]   I'm sorry, Mr. S word.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:50.720]   Mr. S word.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:51.520]   Mr. S word.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.400]   I have learned...
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.560]   I've learned which words to avoid.
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.760]   I'm sorry, Mr. Producer from my...
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.960]   Sorry, we believe you.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:46:59.760]   We believe you.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.480]   That's my big deal.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.720]   I almost feel like...
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.880]   Stay seated to answer your question.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.160]   I almost feel like I don't even want to
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:10.080]   give him any numbers by going to the site
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.360]   and looking at it.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:11.680]   I mean...
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:11.840]   So...
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:16.480]   Madu asked what my temperature was,
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.360]   or what the temperature...
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.880]   ...and I find myself only going there once a day
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.560]   to respond to people.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.960]   I still automatically tweet out stories,
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.120]   and then I have sponsorship obligations
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.080]   that I have to tweet out,
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.200]   but I'm definitely not...
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.240]   Like, when I get the wild hairs,
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.920]   where I'm like, "Oh, I want to say this."
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.080]   I'm like, "Oh, I just don't say it anymore."
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.000]   Because I'm not a masted on yet,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.200]   y'all, I'm going to get there.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.080]   I just...
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.760]   It took forever to drive me to Twitter,
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.600]   and this is just going to be a pain.
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.600]   But yeah.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:47.840]   And...
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.160]   But yeah, I miss it.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:50.880]   I'm sad.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:51.920]   And now they're talking about...
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.440]   There's a great talk.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.760]   There's a great talk by a certain Jeff Jarvis
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.080]   explaining how to get on masted on.
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:58.960]   I know.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:59.440]   I've...
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.360]   It's not a question of how to...
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.800]   For me, it's just a question of like,
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.080]   mentally sitting down and doing...
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:04.560]   You're just...
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:05.680]   Oh, a little like ADD.
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:06.400]   But wait, wait!
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.920]   I know, you're trying to review...
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.880]   She's talking about banning TikTok.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:09.920]   She's trying to change the subject.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.480]   It's so cute.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:10.960]   There you go.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:11.840]   I'm in it.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.240]   I love it.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.520]   I heard you do that.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.720]   I heard you say both.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.960]   You know, now they're doing it to TikTok.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.960]   Nudge, nudge, hint, hint.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.000]   Say, "Wait."
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.920]   Yeah, actually, this one...
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.080]   We talked a little bit about this on the Twit.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.120]   And in fact, there was a very good piece
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.680]   that Steve Gibson talked about yesterday.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.480]   Kaspersky answered one of the questions
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.480]   people have about TikTok, which is,
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:42.720]   when state governors like Governor Abbott,
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.640]   Christie Nome of South Dakota, Maryland,
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:50.640]   say, "Oh, they're gathering too much information."
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:55.280]   Kaspersky wrote a great piece, I thought,
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.960]   on trust and safety.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.920]   Privacy and security is TikTok safe to use.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.360]   And it's probably worth reading.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.000]   They actually looked at what information is sent back,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.880]   what privacy concerns you should have.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:14.560]   I don't think anybody says it's a bad idea,
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.040]   for instance, for the Department of Defense
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.640]   to say to military personnel,
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.440]   "Don't use TikTok, don't have it on your phone."
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.000]   Any more than you should have Strava on your phone,
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.280]   or any other running app,
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.720]   because these are used...
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:29.040]   These are location trackers.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.760]   I think, honestly, TikTok,
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.760]   if you're on an iPhone,
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.520]   you can turn off location services.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.240]   You don't have to give them your contact information.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.040]   You can use TikTok pretty privately,
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.800]   especially if you're not publishing videos.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.720]   If you're not publishing videos,
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:45.760]   if you're just watching videos,
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:48.080]   and I think probably most TikTok users just watch,
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.080]   don't turn on the camera,
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.600]   don't turn on the microphone.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.080]   So let me tell you what Caspurskog, bottom line,
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.920]   is TikTok safe to download?
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.480]   So it's TikTok safe to use, last paragraph.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.320]   The answer is not necessarily clear cut,
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.840]   much of the media commentary around TikTok concerns,
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.720]   focuses on issues relating to national security,
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:08.480]   but most users are unlikely to have
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.200]   nationally sensitive content on their phones.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.080]   For individuals,
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.640]   the risk is not significantly different
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.120]   to that of other popular social media apps.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.320]   I mean, Facebook gathers much more information.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.040]   They even put that out than TikTok.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.080]   And then you might say, well, yeah,
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.320]   but Facebook is an American company,
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.480]   and TikTok is a Chinese company.
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:33.120]   Ultimately, Caspurskog says it's about being aware of data security
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.680]   and online privacy issues, making a personal choice.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.920]   I think if you want to make that choice,
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.200]   you should read this.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:44.240]   But I will summarize that there is no secret message
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.240]   inside TikTok that's sending everything
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.840]   that you do on your phone back to.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.920]   The server is in mainland China.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.840]   It's not spying on you in that respect.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.600]   It's not gaining any more information
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.440]   than any other app, including Twitter, by the way.
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:58.800]   That information is valuable to marketers, for sure.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.600]   It's not any worse than everything else
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.040]   already happening on your phone.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.280]   So, I think it's within the realm of governments,
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.160]   it's within the right of governments to tell government employees
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.720]   not to use it on their government phone.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.480]   Abbott's trying to figure out he even said,
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.880]   "I want to figure out how to keep people who work for us
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.120]   from not having it on their private phone either."
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.200]   That's going to be tough.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.240]   That's going to be tough.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:24.800]   That's going to be tough.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.360]   That's not too hard, bro.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.080]   Pushing too far.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.920]   I think I'm just going to say this.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.760]   I think that there are governors like to Abbott,
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.640]   DeSantis, Cristina, who know perfectly well
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:35.600]   that you can't do that, but are performing.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.520]   It's really for a certain group of people.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:37.840]   I don't know.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:39.440]   Abbott's a petty man.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:43.360]   The city of Austin once told him he could not chop down a tree in his yard,
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.680]   and he set off an entire legislative chain
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:49.920]   to make sure that cities no longer had rights to regulate certain aspects
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:53.360]   of their zoning to prohibit him from chopping out a string.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:53.920]   All right.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.320]   We got to stop saying petty people power.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.800]   This is a petty people.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.600]   A crew power.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.200]   They want it because they're petty.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.400]   Because they're petty.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.960]   You know, it's like the homeowners association
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.640]   committee member who's going around saying,
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.280]   "I think your mailbox letters are too big."
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.160]   No.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.800]   This is why I'm like, I should run for the school board
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.000]   because I'm not petty.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.160]   But I just don't have the impetus.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.520]   I'm like, why would I tell you that?
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:26.480]   Isn't that a debate all the way back to Plato and Socrates?
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:29.440]   And you should pick people who don't want to be kind.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:32.240]   The best leaders are people who don't want the job.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.520]   They were reluctant leader.
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:38.560]   Unfortunately, if you're reluctant, you're not going to get the job.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.640]   And today, like especially here in the US, man, you got to put yourself out
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:52.240]   and about and spend money and be crazy to get anywhere in terms of like knowledge and attention.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:52.560]   All right.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:53:00.000]   I got to do an ad because Stacy, you have to understand how this works, Stacy.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   The first ad is what determines the length of the show.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.640]   Believe it or not.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:08.800]   Because if I don't get to the first ad as I haven't in the first hour,
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.680]   it all falls to me.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.600]   Turns into a bleep show.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:16.560]   It's all over, man.
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.160]   So you know what?
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:21.360]   Your best bet would be instead of worrying about the end of the show,
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.920]   worrying about the forget the caboose.
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.200]   Think about the engine.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.360]   The engine's pulling the whole thing through.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.920]   So what you got to do after about 20 minutes to say,
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:31.520]   not let's talk about TikTok.
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:38.000]   No, let's talk about CDW and HPE GreenLake.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.760]   Let's talk about that.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.040]   What about that, Stacy?
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.040]   Let's talk about GreenLake, HPE GreenLake.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:43.520]   You know about GreenLake?
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:44.480]   You know all about that.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:49.360]   This episode of Twig brought to you by HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise GreenLake.
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:53.120]   Orchestrated by the experts is CDW.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:53.920]   What's GreenLake?
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.600]   Do you know Stacy?
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.560]   You know what GreenLake is.
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.960]   Is this their edge to cloud platform?
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.680]   And everybody's talking about it these days.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.000]   It's a beautiful people at CDW.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   They're probably not going to like me calling them beautiful.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.120]   How about helpful?
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.000]   Helpful people.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:08.880]   They are good looking too.
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:14.640]   At CDW, you understand that your organization needs simple management over its big data.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.920]   But with some needing to keep their workloads on prem,
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:22.240]   you know, for compliance or organizational requirements,
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:25.840]   they're going to be a little challenging to organize and optimize that big data.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:29.600]   That's where CDW can help your organization by consolidating
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:35.920]   and managing all your data in one flexible, unified experience with HPE GreenLake.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.320]   The edge to cloud platform.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.400]   The experience you get with HPE GreenLake is unique
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.760]   as no matter where your data or your applications live.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:48.080]   You still can free up energy and resources with automated processes,
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:51.920]   streamline management, and who couldn't use a little more streamline management.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:52.800]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:56.320]   Not only that HPE GreenLake creates a seamless cloud experience
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.760]   among multiple data environments, thanks to the as-a-service model,
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.080]   it meets your remote workforce at the edge.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:06.000]   Then with unrivaled scalability, you'll see an instant increase in capacity,
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.760]   allowing for greater flexibility and accelerated business growth.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.680]   So your team can tackle bigger priorities.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:16.240]   Like innovation, when you need to get more out of your technology,
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:20.000]   HPE makes data transformation possible.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.600]   CDW makes it powerful.

[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.960]   Thank you, CDW.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:30.240]   We appreciate the support.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.800]   Thanks to all of you who, when you go there, use that address,
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:37.920]   because then they know you saw it here. CDW.com/HPE.
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:43.040]   So, Manoj, did you have a stack of printed out code like...
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.880]   I did not.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:49.360]   And first, I'd like to propose that the length of the show be determined
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:55.040]   by a combination of time to first add and amount of lawful batter left.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:57.680]   Lawful batter.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.440]   Waffle batter.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.120]   I thought you said lawful batter.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.280]   Is your lawful batter lawful?
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.120]   It better be.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:08.480]   She's ignoring us.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:09.040]   Look at that.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.560]   She's not even paying attention.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.320]   She saw the adwood last night.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:13.840]   She saw the adwood last night.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:19.520]   So, Leah Culver who worked at Twitter on Spaces posted that picture of her
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:22.400]   sleeping in the whole cold upper code.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:26.000]   It was looked like a JavaScript code holding up her printouts.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.920]   You never do that, huh?
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:36.960]   So, just before getting fired, I was also trying to get a tiny tool to help people do this.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.800]   So, to help them not get fired.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:42.880]   That's exactly the code that Leah Culver did not want to see.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:44.240]   I can tell you right now.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:48.160]   I wouldn't submit that code, but it would be like...
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:51.600]   I actually did it just for myself because I was called in and I thought,
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.280]   "Okay, how can I present this?"
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.840]   It's not just going to be printed out of all the files.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:00.560]   So, I did something that would look into your
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:05.120]   commit history and do some little colors and stuff like this.
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:06.880]   So, I prepared to do it pretty much.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.400]   Oh, a pretty one.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.880]   Yeah, slightly prettier that would...
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:14.480]   So, what you've done as opposed to printing the whole file,
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.120]   which all people may have written most of it.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:21.840]   Yeah, we didn't have any of that when our company went under,
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:22.960]   and I'm sad for it.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:27.360]   Like, when Gigome exploded, we only had an hour and a half, two hours.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.400]   And I was like, "Contacts, downloads!"
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.080]   And I was trying to warn my colleagues.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:35.200]   I was like, "Everybody, here's what's going on."
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.840]   You're talking about that tool that Mano got fired for.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:38.880]   Exactly.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:42.240]   Yeah, you were exactly this while I did.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:42.480]   Yes.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:48.080]   Well, it's the hypothesis at this point.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.680]   We didn't give any code.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:51.920]   We don't know. They haven't said it, but we'll see you in Cordialon.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.080]   No, I shouldn't say that.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:55.120]   That's a rude thing to say.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.160]   What do you write in primarily?
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.320]   Is it JavaScript in React code?
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:06.560]   At Twitter, it was built in JavaScript in React for the web client.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.320]   Yes.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:10.320]   But when you wrote something like that,
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.000]   that would have been a Python script maybe?
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.560]   That would have been a combination of...
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.520]   Let me try to remember.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:20.240]   There would have been a combination of Python and HTML and JavaScript
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.480]   to make the thing interactive maybe.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.000]   You have to have a front end,
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.040]   but then you've got to have a back end that's going to scrape through the mail and...
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:33.040]   For this part, you would just look at the commit history.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:33.280]   Oh!
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.600]   I've got the code that you've written.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:36.080]   Oh, nice.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:36.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.040]   Went through your GitHub.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.040]   Did they use GitHub at Twitter?
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.800]   They used GitHub for a few open source projects.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:44.320]   Otherwise, it's like internal...
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.520]   Turn off the repository.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:48.960]   I shouldn't ask GitHub, get, obviously.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.560]   I always like to ask program requests.
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:59:01.360]   Some projects were open source, and I saw yesterday that some of the people who were owners of these open source projects were fired,
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:03.760]   and people inside Twitter didn't have access to...
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:04.720]   Oh!
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:04.880]   Oops!
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Oops!
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.360]   Oops!
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:07.760]   Well, it would have...
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:11.600]   It's open source so they could read it, but they didn't have admin access to do stuff.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:11.600]   You can't commit it.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.720]   You can't take it offline.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.760]   You can't do anything.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:17.600]   So, that's the problem with removing fast and breaking things.
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:18.320]   You break things.
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:21.200]   Oh, geez.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:25.920]   Man, when you draw, do you draw using pen and paper?
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:27.120]   Do you draw on a tablet?
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:27.920]   Do you draw...
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.120]   I was just trying.
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:32.560]   I do pen and paper because I use a paintbrush.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.320]   Like, so it's so...
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:34.880]   Oh!
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:38.160]   You know, the styluses are much better now.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:42.960]   They can detect the angle and the pressure, but it's still not quite there yet, you know,
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:45.920]   about the brush bristles against the paper.
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:49.600]   So, I try to go full digital, but I wasn't able to.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:50.560]   So I'm looking at mine.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:51.840]   Is this a print or is this...
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.280]   This must be a print of this one.
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.400]   This is a print, yes.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.400]   Because I do the color on the computer.
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:59.040]   And I still have the original for this one.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.240]   I might sell them at some point.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:00.640]   You should.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:01.280]   That's money.
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.160]   Yeah, no.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.520]   This might be your most famous cartoon, you think?
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.600]   Well, it was published 10 years ago.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.240]   I've spent most of the 10...
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:15.200]   The last 10 years trying to convince myself that this wasn't the one trick pony.
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.640]   Oh!
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.000]   Was this your first?
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:18.720]   No.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:19.760]   It was not my first.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.200]   But it was an early one.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:21.920]   Very early.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.600]   Well, I'm really proud to have it.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.400]   And as I said, it's something...
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:24.880]   You know what?
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.240]   I'm on my wall in my home office.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:26.560]   Yeah?
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.320]   Like Leo.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:28.800]   Like Leo.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:34.240]   Mano, you need a third party who believes in you and who will go out there.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.480]   And I say this because you have actually...
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.080]   You know, you have actual talent.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.560]   You should be doing this and you should make it available to people.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:44.880]   And if you're not gifted with ants' confidence and drive, which most of us aren't,
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.760]   if only we could be as awesome as Ant is.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.240]   Like, I have my husband.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:50.560]   I'm just foolish.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:51.280]   That's all it is.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.080]   I'm foolish.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:52.480]   All right.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:52.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.520]   You have Andrew.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.880]   He does that for you.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.320]   And I have my wife.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:56.960]   I have Lisa.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:57.760]   She does that for her.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.800]   I'm also very...
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:02.240]   I'm also foolish enough to hand Elon Musk a drawing.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.880]   But I'm not the kind of lucrative foolishness.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.400]   It's a different foolishness.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:06.400]   It's a different foolishness.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.640]   I'm foolish enough to do all kinds of silly things that I'm like,
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:11.440]   "Ooh, how much is this?"
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.520]   I'm glad you didn't hand him this drawing.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.760]   "Do you all love me very much?"
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.640]   says King Elon, sitting on his throne.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.760]   "Yes," say the sick of ants kissing his feet.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:22.320]   Oh.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.760]   Except for the one who whispers,
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.920]   "I don't, but I need my visa."
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.720]   How many of the people who stayed behind would you guess
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.840]   were on an H1B visa or maybe needed healthcare?
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.800]   I mean, it's almost as if they were forced to stay.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:36.960]   It's coercive.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.040]   It's pretty hard to say.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:39.840]   I only...
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.800]   The only one or two people that I know,
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.840]   they might not even be there by now,
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.640]   had visa issues.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.160]   But I'm very biased in the people that I choose to.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.760]   You only hang out with ferners.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.920]   No, not foreigners.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.160]   But I'm biased.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.040]   You know, I have no filter, Matt.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.240]   This is not right.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.440]   Great, great.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:03.920]   He is...
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:07.040]   Well, I'm French.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.720]   I only hang out with French people.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.800]   As his wife, he's a sort of German-
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.560]   It's only hang out with French people, too.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:15.520]   That might be the most French thing I've heard you say.
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.040]   They won't let me hang out with them,
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:17.920]   because I'm not French.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.240]   I have a French name that gets me halfway there anyway.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.920]   No, I mean, I'm biased in that
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.960]   people who are my friends will be less likely to be
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.880]   on what was Elon's views.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.120]   Right, right.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.240]   You're not hanging out with them.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.360]   But there are probably some Elon stands also who are excited
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:39.280]   and want to go beast mode and don't mind sleeping in the conference room and all of that stuff.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.360]   I'm sure I was willing to...
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.840]   Initially, I was willing to work hard for...
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.200]   We didn't really know what was going to happen.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:53.280]   I slept on the couch once on that weekend for the Blue Stuff.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.600]   I was willing to give it a try.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.480]   I just...
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.360]   I think he did it the way...
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.520]   Even if you put aside all the very clumsy way that this was,
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.600]   the way it was executed,
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:10.880]   I think it was also just stupid in a way that he initially let
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:17.680]   laid off half of the company without filtering for who was sympathetic to his views.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.200]   I think he should have done it the other way.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.640]   He should have sent that email saying,
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.560]   "You need to be quote unquote, hardcore, whatever that means.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:31.600]   Send that out first and then see who's on board and then maybe select for other stuff."
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.360]   But if you fire half of people and maybe some of them,
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:38.640]   you catch some of them which would have been on board.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.080]   That's just seems foolish to me.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:45.200]   I supported the hardcore message, just his delivery was wrong.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.960]   I got where he was coming from, but he could have gone about it a better way.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.200]   Yeah, you compared it to a code code in sports, right?
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:58.000]   Which that part totally makes sense, but the way it was phrased and the way it was organized
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.760]   was just not okay.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.600]   You were gone before that email went out.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.880]   Yeah, I was.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.680]   Would you have been hardcore?
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:06.800]   Good question.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:12.960]   I think knowing what I knew already then, I would probably not.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.880]   No, I don't think I would have thought the button.
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:22.960]   But even the lawyers are laughing at the vision that the failure to click a button
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.720]   equals a resignation.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.560]   That doesn't really work that way.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:29.200]   Yeah, it's not an action.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.560]   It's a lack of action.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:36.880]   It's like if you ever read Ask a Manager or anybody, this is an HR nightmare story.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:41.440]   Like watching it unfold in real life has been like whenever you read these things,
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.440]   nobody's fired the HR team.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.480]   Yeah, it's literally going to have the nightmare.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.280]   They're all gone.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:53.200]   So the salute emoji I'm told was becoming very common.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.760]   You didn't on Slack and so forth.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.400]   You did a nice little version of that with the Twitter bluebird saluting.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:05.040]   This is what people would put on their Slack when they were on the way out.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:05.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.400]   Right.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:06.880]   Yes.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:11.920]   In fact, when I was contacted by people from the press asking if they could,
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.120]   if I could put them in touch with other former employees,
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.800]   I just told them to search for that emoji on Twitter and who it's trying to find.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.160]   It's like quite a few.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.280]   Yeah.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.360]   That's beautiful.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.400]   No, it says it's really.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.360]   Solidarity.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.000]   I like it.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.280]   Yeah, because it's not merely, it's not Cia.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:34.160]   It's like, I really salute what we did together, what we created together.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.800]   And I salute those of you who stay.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.920]   I salute those of you who leave.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.240]   It's a really, I think it's a perfect gesture.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:46.640]   Teammates. It might not be the middle finger that someone to see uses their gesture,
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.680]   but I think it's the right one.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.200]   I think it's like, I salute you.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.680]   This is the, I haven't seen this before.
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:56.240]   I only work for two companies, but there's still a community of people who used to work for
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:00.560]   Twitter who are still hanging out together and they have a special Discord server.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:04.560]   And it seems like some of the community has survived the event,
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:08.640]   which I think is really talks to the nice, come on.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.920]   I have to point out, if you go to Emojipedia that this saluting emoji,
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.600]   there's a variety of ways to do it.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.960]   Apple's clearly a salute.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:20.160]   I'm not sure what Google's is the Twitter version looks like you're getting patted on the head by Elon.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:23.600]   Okay.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.000]   I don't think it's exact right.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:26.560]   Good job.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.680]   You're saving me money.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:33.600]   Every time I see, every time I see that emoji, I have to try to figure out a way to zoom in.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.440]   It's my like, what's going on there?
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.920]   My family uses that quite a bit.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:44.400]   I finally got used to it, but my family was using it quite a bit in our own slack for when I give an order.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.240]   Oh, yes, sir.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.560]   Like, what is this?
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.520]   Is this scratching?
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.080]   Is it?
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:50.960]   Yeah, that might be.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:51.760]   But now I see it.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.920]   A little bit of a backhanded, okay, dad.
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.960]   Let it be backhanded.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:06:59.760]   I'll fix them.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:04.240]   The king of motivation here.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.000]   Create and dominate.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.840]   I'm more like a create and go back to bed.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.680]   But you know, each of us.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.040]   Yeah, I'm with you there.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:13.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:14.960]   You just said a little bit.
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.840]   Here's the here was the red pill blue pill question.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:24.240]   You know, are you ready to go beast mode or are you going to leave?
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:28.080]   And the blue pill was fly away.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:32.640]   The red pill was burnout, slaving away for a sociopathic clown.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.640]   Strong words.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.360]   Bigger attitude.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.480]   Change it a little bit.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.240]   I would not.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.480]   This would not be the one that I printed.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.840]   That's the one.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.840]   Unless you're on the way.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.480]   And then I wouldn't be worried only about getting fired,
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.000]   but then you punch in the face.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:48.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.240]   Go ahead.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.080]   You know, part of that is like after,
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:57.280]   okay, I will just say when you are in the trenches,
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.880]   even if it's a toxic workforce,
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.560]   if you were creating something you love,
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:04.800]   it can be you don't stay for your sociopathic clown boss.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.960]   You stay because you the people you're with.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.160]   And because we're done.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:12.640]   And you same reason you're staying with Twitter as a user, Stacey,
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.600]   because there's value.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:16.640]   And you don't want to get some.
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.680]   You accomplish some or you just want to go back to bed.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.920]   That's what I did originally.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.520]   I was I think the in between the time when you know I took over
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.200]   and the time when I was fired,
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.720]   I was really not working for him.
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.720]   I was working for my coworkers.
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:31.360]   For your squad.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.480]   I love that.
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.400]   And avoid getting them fired.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.240]   But companies take advantage of that.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:36.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:37.440]   Yeah, I realize that.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:37.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.600]   And not necessarily in an evil way.
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.040]   I mean, you can take advantage of that
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.360]   to like ban people together to do cool stuff, right?
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:49.280]   But you can also really abuse your workers in some ways,
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:49.920]   not abuse.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.440]   But.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.280]   We try to do that with our workers.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:55.760]   We try to give them that false sense of camaraderie.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.800]   And we do team binding exercises stuff.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.720]   And then that way when we cut their pay,
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.720]   they just they're going to be loyal to each other.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:03.760]   It's just a good management.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:04.240]   Oh.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.480]   You provide coffee.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.200]   I mean, my business.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.160]   Did I say that out loud?
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.960]   Did you want to have an eye gotten that
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.000]   come coffee machine?
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.320]   Well, I'm thinking I think you should go to
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.200]   to the heritage global partners
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:19.840]   and look at the Twitter auction and maybe
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.800]   pick up one of these lovely coffee machines,
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.280]   is Lamaro Zoco Strada.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:30.880]   Trei semi aldo es prisom machine.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.400]   Do you look at that with fondness mano?
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:33.840]   I remember that.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.160]   I remember that machine.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:41.440]   To be fair, this would be the case at most tech companies.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:41.680]   Sure.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:46.800]   This is really an industry where we get to be divas as to.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:47.280]   Sure.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.680]   Who we choose to work for.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:51.920]   And we get to have ethical qualms.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.080]   Well, most people don't, you know,
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.360]   you can't really say to most companies or bosses like,
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.400]   I don't really like it.
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.920]   Like, you know, I'm going to put.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:05.440]   But because there's more demand than supply for these jobs,
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.840]   then we get to be spoiled.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.880]   Early on, there were a lot of articles saying,
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.960]   yeah, everybody in Silicon Valley is looking at Elon secretly going,
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.400]   yeah, show those engineers, cut them down a size.
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.840]   And you even said this, Twitter was fat.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.360]   There was definitely fat to cut.
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.920]   And any new owner would have done this.
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:27.600]   I think so.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.040]   I think in some way, the acquisition deal may
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:36.000]   have prevented some of those because there might be some terms in there to avoid.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.720]   That could have been a material event.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:40.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.200]   So I don't really deny that it was needed.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:45.280]   And some other companies did it at the same time.
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:48.640]   It seems like Facebook did some five the same day.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.040]   Yep.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:49.520]   Yep.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.600]   There was almost 40,000 last month across Silicon Valley, I believe.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.320]   Much bigger numbers.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:54.560]   Yeah.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.240]   I still, it's horrible for anybody to lose their job.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.520]   And we can't lose sight of that.
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.320]   That is a terrible thing.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:09.440]   But I might take advantage of this auction and pick myself up a Hobart HS 7N 13 inch
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.480]   automatic slicer.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.560]   And you know,
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.600]   You're following your deli meats?
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.360]   For all my deli meats at home.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.800]   You know, I have already,
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.120]   at least already tells me I have too many gadgets on the cat or fight.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.520]   If I bring home a deli slicer,
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.080]   she might get a little, a little unzettled.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.280]   Much more spags, sir.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.360]   Although I have to say,
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.320]   one of the, one of the slicers,
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:34.560]   and I thought this was really odd that they're selling is a manual deli slicer.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.760]   Like has a, like you, it's not electric.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.600]   You turn a crank.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.200]   I thought that was,
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.360]   did I talk about that last week or was that on another show?
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.200]   I'm, it's all a blur.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.320]   If you get one of those,
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.000]   I'm coming to your house for a report for.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.720]   I'm a, I'm a, I'm going to get it.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:54.240]   I'm, I'm very tempted by some of this.
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:57.200]   A father Robert said we should do a 24 hour,
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.120]   because it's only a 24 hour auction on the 17th of next month,
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.200]   that we should do a live 24 hour live stream.
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:05.360]   Did it?
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:08.400]   Get a professional steamer oven.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.120]   That's what you.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:09.440]   I know.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:10.320]   Look at all this stuff.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.440]   Projectors.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.000]   Look at this.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.840]   Look at the mics for polycom.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:16.800]   Polycom real presence trio 8800 IP.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.040]   Now it's a little deceptive because all the bids started like 25 or 50 dollars.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.280]   Here's that 55 inch Google Jamboard.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:28.000]   I've wanted one of those for ages, but see, I don't think it'll go for 15, 50 dollars.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.280]   Leo, I have a, I have a suggestion you're going to hate.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:34.080]   I think you should relabel those in not in dollars,
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.360]   but in how many years of club, club, club, club, club, club, club, club, club, club,
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.160]   Twitter memberships.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.680]   This is cheap.
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:41.120]   This one year.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.880]   I always say this club, Twitter is a buck less than a blue check.
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.400]   And look how much you get.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:52.800]   You say in the economist article that you and everybody else knew exactly what was going to go
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.160]   happen to the verified check, anybody would have known.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:03.040]   Yoho Roth had written a memo warning Elon, you're going to have big impersonation problems if you do this.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:13.040]   That's the, there's a few days ago, there was a list of 10, 10 things that you should do as a
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.280]   toxic manager or leader.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:21.760]   And I really checked out pretty well with things like, you know, keep your workers always on as
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:23.440]   given deadlines all the time.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.040]   Don't give them time to think.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:31.040]   So, you know, if you know that you need to make this deadline or you're fired by Monday,
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.840]   then you don't have time to think, hey, is it okay?
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:36.160]   A good thing that you're trying to make me do.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:41.520]   Here is the Birkle 330 M STD manual flywheel slicer with stand.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.920]   Do you think Andrew would let you have this in the house?
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.120]   I think.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.680]   I don't think I need that.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.600]   You'd have to have, you know, maybe you know what?
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.320]   We should get it from Mark Zuckerberg because he's always smoking the meats.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.160]   Now he could be slicing the meats.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.400]   I mean, that thing is terrifying.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.080]   I'm scared of my mandolin.
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.280]   So I mean, that thing.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.960]   This is a mandolin steroids.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:06.560]   How about paper, thin, paper, thin waffles?
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:10.400]   Say out away for a fiend.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.440]   That's just a crepe.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:13.920]   Come on.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:14.720]   You know that man.
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:15.920]   Is that a crepe?
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.040]   It's a crepe.
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:18.240]   Yes.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:24.880]   In other news, we were laughing this morning on Floss Weekly,
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.640]   which is a great episode.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.240]   Who was on Floss Weekly this week?
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:32.640]   It was a roundtable with Mr. Bennett and Mr. Powers and Mr. Serals.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.840]   And we talked about the verified check and how it's been updated.
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:39.840]   Like with mine, it says, this is a legacy verified account.
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:43.360]   Oh, it may or may not be notable.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.920]   I feel like every time I go to Twitter, I'm giving Elon a penny.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.920]   But okay, let me go look and see what I got.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.400]   I'm pretty sure that's what yours says too.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.640]   It says it's verified because notable and government news.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.080]   I still have the notable.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.200]   Oh, you still have that one.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.640]   But I think I stopped paying.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.400]   So I think that probably.
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.120]   I stopped paying too.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.120]   And a lot of the people that I followed,
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.280]   there's have been changed to what mine said.
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:05.760]   What's yours?
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.120]   Mine is mine says it's a legacy verified account.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.640]   It may or may not be notable.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.160]   But here's what happened.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.240]   Twitter said they weren't going to take my money anymore.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:15.760]   So I was like, okay, great.
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.280]   Because I wasn't going to pay for Twitter blue anymore, obviously,
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.440]   even though I did for a while.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.240]   And then they, I just saw they re-ept it.
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.880]   And I actually need to unsubscribe right now.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.200]   So you're paying for it and you still got the weird.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.480]   Not anymore.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.600]   Well, that's fine.
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.000]   Because maybe because I'm paying for it, they're like, I don't know.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.400]   Because it used to say I was possibly notable.
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:39.280]   That's so insulting.
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:40.000]   No, no, no.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.480]   It used to say, person could be notable.
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:48.080]   It used to say I was notable because I was a public figure or a journalist or whatever.
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:48.560]   Yeah, right.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.120]   The technology.
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:51.200]   Mine still says like, right.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.360]   But now it says they might get it.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.920]   I'm looking at Kim Kardashian's right now.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:56.960]   Yeah, she's notable.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:02.000]   Because she says verified legacy verified account may or may not be notable.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.200]   So you're at the USO.
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.400]   So folks from ESPN and other journalists.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:09.200]   And then I looked at ESPN proper.
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.560]   They have a gold check or a yellow check that says that they have
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.960]   a official Twitter business account.
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.480]   Huh.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:19.280]   Yeah, we know that they were going to do three colors.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.800]   That was the new plan.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:22.480]   That's what's supposed to roll out, wasn't it?
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.880]   Like soon.
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.760]   Like maybe it's just maybe it's rolling out now.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.760]   Twitter one.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.480]   For some reason.
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.080]   Let me unsubscribe.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:32.960]   That's interesting.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:38.160]   Maybe it'll start selling those wood blocks that used to be verified.
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.760]   And it's another revenue stream for you.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.680]   I love my wood block.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:42.960]   I love that you saw that.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.320]   That's a stir.
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:47.600]   Well, I didn't see the image, but I have it right here.
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.280]   Should I go get a wood block?
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.480]   How many how many clubs?
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.160]   Is that worth it?
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:55.520]   That one's worth that one's a whole it's $80.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.600]   It was like I don't like to say this, man.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.120]   Because then people are going to say, I'm sorry.
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.560]   Clearly you're wasting our money on.
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:04.560]   That's why I said you were going to like this idea.
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:05.040]   I'm sorry.
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.480]   I do.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.480]   I know you now have an honorary member.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.120]   So ships.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.160]   So enjoy.
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.960]   Because I might cut you off, buddy.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.720]   I actually paid for it.
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:15.920]   I was already a member.
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.720]   Oh, well now you have a complimentary one.
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:19.200]   Thank you.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:22.880]   Now you get one for like, is it lifetime or is it for a year?
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.240]   And when you're a guest on the show,
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.840]   when we send you that coupon code,
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:28.320]   it makes you a permanent member, I think.
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.400]   Oh, I was great.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:33.120]   I'm not just from like a month.
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.800]   Here.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.200]   It could be a temporary member.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:37.520]   Okay.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.680]   You might be a for a coin.
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:40.560]   I don't know.
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.680]   Okay.
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.000]   I feel like I need to offset this.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.720]   These are very well spent seven bucks a month.
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.560]   I really like it.
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.560]   So it keeps me out yet.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.840]   Well, this is interesting.
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:59.920]   Somebody has recreated the Elanjet account already.
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.440]   Not the Elanjet guy.
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.520]   Wow.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:07.920]   Apparently there was a delay.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.120]   This is interesting.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.240]   Maybe he got it back.
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.240]   All right.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.120]   We're going to have to update it.
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.400]   It looks like Elanjet is back.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:18.480]   Maybe this is the problem when you have one guy doing trust and safety.
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.480]   He can change his mind.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.880]   This says, is Jack Sweeney?
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.640]   Yes, is Jack Sweeney, doesn't it?
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.080]   Isn't the source of the.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:26.320]   The source of the.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:30.320]   The full for the information is, isn't it already public?
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:30.960]   Yeah, it is.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.760]   And that's, I mean, that was his position all along.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:36.720]   Remember, Elan tried to pay him $5,000 to not do it.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.560]   And he said, well, no, I'm going to keep doing it.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:43.360]   And Elan, I think rightly so, says it's also a security issue,
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.800]   but it's public information.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:50.960]   But I understand, you know, you don't want everybody to know exactly where you are
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:51.840]   at any given time.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:56.400]   Maybe this is good for Twitter and Tesla and SpaceX employees.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:57.840]   This is the billion average.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.920]   Hey, the bus is coming.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:00.960]   Watch out.
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.320]   Everybody hit them.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.520]   Press the boss button.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.880]   Stop playing Elden Ring.
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:05.920]   Here he comes.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:15.120]   Sam Bankman Freed, arrested the day before he was going to testify in Congress today.
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.520]   Or yesterday, I guess.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.000]   Charges.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.560]   It's from the US Attorney for Southern District of New York,
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.680]   with they shared a sealed indictment with the Bahamian government
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:34.320]   who arrested and is expected to be extraditing him to the United States.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.920]   Because it's sealed in diamond, I guess we don't know what the details are.
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:45.760]   He was going to testify virtually before the House Financial Services Committee
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:52.000]   Tuesday, Maxine Waters of California, who oversees the committee, says she was surprised
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.880]   as it is arrest and disappointed that Congress wouldn't be able to hear from Maxine.
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.960]   He shouldn't have been surprised.
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:04.240]   I frankly was surprised that he was going around talking and doing things.
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.160]   And was going to go testify to Congress.
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:10.000]   Doesn't anybody want to do anything about this?
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.040]   Isn't it fraud?
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.920]   Seems like an attorney of his would have been like,
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:15.520]   "Dude, you need to lay low and be quiet."
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:22.640]   According to CNBC, the charges against Bankman Freed include wire fraud,
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:28.080]   wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, security fraud conspiracy, and money laundering.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:36.960]   The SEC filed a civil complaint also against him yesterday, alleging that the XCTO of FTX
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:41.360]   engaged in "a scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX."
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:46.880]   See, that's the thing in the United States you may not do is steal from rich people.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:47.920]   It's rich folks.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:50.000]   Don't steal from rich folks.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.680]   Sorry, it's still from the poor folks in Mississippi, but you know.
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:54.160]   Exactly.
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:59.200]   The filings said Bankman Freed raised more than $1.8 billion from investors,
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:05.360]   and that "unbeknownst to these investors, Bankman Freed was orchestrating a massive
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:10.080]   years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the training platform's customer funds
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:14.960]   for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire."
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.360]   Wait.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:22.720]   This is breaking news according to Cyrus Farrahvar.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.800]   Are you reading Twitter again?
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:28.640]   I am because I was trying to cancel my subscription, but hold on.
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.440]   Is this your lawsuit, Cornette vs Twitter?
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.800]   That is me.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:33.680]   Yeah, what happened?
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:38.000]   So a federal judge has just ruled against Twitter in your lawsuits,
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.120]   mandating that severance packages to fired employees must include mention of an ongoing lawsuit.
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:43.680]   Your lawsuit.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:44.160]   Green news.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.200]   Sorry.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.480]   And so-
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.080]   Bring me the champagne.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.040]   We are going to-
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.640]   We are going to-
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:51.040]   No.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.080]   Go on a clarinet.
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:52.080]   No.
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:52.640]   Cornette.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.960]   Jeff isn't here.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.360]   Is it someone has to retread her while the show is going?
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:57.920]   That's right.
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.120]   I literally-
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.360]   Well, I realize that it's-
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:05.760]   What they're doing isn't actually legal in another sense in California, at least.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.680]   I'm not in California, so it doesn't really apply to me.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:17.360]   But I can't unsubscribe to Twitter blue at all because I am on the old original 299 account.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.680]   So all they'll let me do is upgrade.
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:20.800]   Oh, you know what you have to do?
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.760]   I think you-
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.880]   Can't you do that on-
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:23.680]   Oh no, wait a minute.
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:24.960]   You didn't do that through the iPhone?
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:25.280]   I can't.
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:27.200]   I didn't do it through the iPhone.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.080]   I did it on the web.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:28.160]   I did it on the mobile.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:29.760]   Because we were on the show.
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:30.480]   Yes, right.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:31.600]   I did it on the mobile.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:34.960]   And so now I literally can't unsubscribe.
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.320]   I mean, I can obviously call-
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.280]   What happens if your-
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.680]   If your car gives a fine, if it can't charge you-
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:39.920]   Right.
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:41.760]   I was about to say, I can just call MasterCard.
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:43.760]   And they'll be like, okay, sure.
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:47.520]   But I was like, oh, this isn't actually allowed.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.680]   You have to give the person-
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:50.160]   So-
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:50.240]   So-
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:50.640]   So-
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:50.640]   So-
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:50.640]   Give us-
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:50.640]   So-
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.040]   Give us-
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:51.040]   So- Give us-
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:51.680]   So- Give us- Give us-
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:52.640]   Give us-
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:52.640]   Give us-
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:52.720]   Give us the-
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:53.200]   What is this-
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.160]   So the Judge rule-
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.640]   Do you have any more information on what Manu's case?
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.080]   I think Manu might want to know.
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:58.640]   Right.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:22:59.600]   Okay.
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:00.000]   Hold on.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:00.480]   I'm just saying-
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.040]   I'm looking.
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:01.520]   And while you're looking-
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.640]   You'll pop in the court.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:03.520]   I'm popping the court.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:07.120]   Okay, so I'm not going to make you go to Twitter.
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:07.440]   So-
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:08.480]   Every single time Manu,
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:10.320]   we're going to open a bottle of champagne.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.320]   Every time good news comes out in your case.
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:15.040]   Woo!
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.680]   So basically the judge,
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:20.160]   the lawsuit is saying Twitter-
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:21.120]   Okay.
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:22.080]   Go ahead.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.760]   You can't ask me a question and then talk to me.
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:24.640]   Listen, I'm listening.
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:25.120]   I'm listening.
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.640]   I'm turning into a mother right now.
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:27.920]   I'm like mom mode engaged.
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.280]   Okay.
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:30.960]   So-
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:34.240]   The class action lawsuit, it looks like-
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:39.280]   I just give up-
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:45.600]   Is going to force Twitter to inform former employees
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.080]   that the Cornet versus Twitter lawsuit
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:52.640]   has been filed so they won't agree to severance packages
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:56.560]   that are not as favorable as had been previously promised.
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:59.440]   So basically that was the case.
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:03.040]   And the judge today said-
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.920]   They said,
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:11.200]   "No, Twitter, you actually do need to tell people about-
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:18.480]   Sorry, tell people that this lawsuit exists,
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:21.360]   so they'll know that better severance packages are available to them."
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.880]   Oh, interesting.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:28.320]   It's not so much a victory for you, mano, but for all the others.
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.840]   Exactly.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.360]   Yeah, but again, that seems to have been his premise from the get-go.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.080]   He's doing it for the squad.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:38.880]   Yeah, and that's why I said-
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:42.960]   When I was fired, I said I was sort of proud of the reason
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.120]   because I wasn't fired for being, you know,
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:47.440]   for being a slacker or anything,
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.640]   or just helping other people.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:49.760]   You're doing too good.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:52.720]   Oh, I don't know that.
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:53.760]   I wonder how many-
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:56.080]   I wonder who-
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:59.520]   Okay, I wonder right now who has more cases in front of a judge
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:03.200]   in the United States, Donald Trump or Elon Musk.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.520]   Because he's got lawsuits galore,
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:08.800]   the shareholders of Tesla are selling over his 56-
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:09.280]   That's a good question.
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:10.160]   Yeah, right.
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.200]   56 billion dollar salary last year.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:21.280]   LA Times had a story about Tesla being sued because of,
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.520]   you know, charging people five to 15 thousand dollars
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:30.240]   for self-driving technology, which isn't full self-driving.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:33.600]   In fact, I loved-
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.840]   You know, it must be fun being a lawyer for you.
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:40.000]   I love the lawyer's response.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.200]   They said, "Well, it's your honor.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:42.160]   It's not fraud.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.400]   It's a failure of-
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.320]   We just- we shot high.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.880]   We aimed high and we failed."
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:56.160]   Tesla lawyers said, "Mere failure to realize a long-term aspirational goal
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:57.840]   is not fraud."
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:00.560]   I don't know-
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.200]   As if you sell people five thousand dollar package-
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.320]   No, it was just-
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.960]   It was aspirational, I understand.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:12.240]   I mean, I agree that this was always aspirational
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.160]   and hopeful, but you really-
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.080]   I mean, is it caveat-
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:16.400]   Empter?
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.840]   Like, you know, sure.
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.600]   You thought this was going to be delivered.
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:20.240]   You paid five.
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:23.200]   It sucks to be you, but I mean, I don't know.
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:25.440]   I'm sure that that's-
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.360]   With Elizabeth Holmes lawyers also said,
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.400]   "Well, you know, your honor,
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:31.040]   she was just trying to save human-
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.560]   No, that was actual fraud.
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.560]   She lied to her investor.
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:36.240]   I was like, "No, no, that's actual fraud."
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:39.200]   All right, just checking.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.480]   She was-
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.920]   She was the difficult question,
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:46.400]   because people are genuinely trying to do something good for the climate-
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:46.800]   You don't want to stop-
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.200]   You don't want to stop-
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:47.200]   You don't want to stop-
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:47.200]   You don't want to stop-
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:47.200]   You don't want to stop-
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:47.200]   You don't want to stop-
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:47.200]   You don't want to stop-
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:47.200]   You don't want to stop-
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:47.200]   You don't want to stop-
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:47.200]   You don't want to stop-
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:47.440]   You don't want to stop-
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:47.600]   You don't want to stop-
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:47.600]   You don't want to stop-
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:48.160]   You don't want to stop-
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:48.640]   You don't want to stop-
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:50.160]   Elon's a-
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:50.880]   Yeah, and I think-
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.560]   Elon really thought he was going-
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.240]   I mean, I think they really thought-
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.280]   I mean, everyone thought-
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.480]   self-driving would be here.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:58.720]   Even skeptical people-
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:03.360]   Like by 2025 or 2020 or whatever year we thought we would be in.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.360]   Back in 2006-
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.000]   And this is by the way one of the reasons about a Tesla-
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.760]   I know you have a Tesla too-
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:10.320]   Stacey-
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:16.560]   One of the reasons about a Tesla was the secret Tesla Motors master plan that Elon posted in 2006.
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:21.360]   By the way, saying that he was co-founder of Tesla, which he wasn't, but okay.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:26.160]   He bought the company from the founders and then they raced them.
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:30.800]   But his plan was originally to save the planet.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:37.680]   And in fact to create, you know, to charge people a lot for luxury electric vehicles,
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:40.800]   but then use that money to create an affordable electric vehicle.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:43.760]   That was noble, right?
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.880]   In short, the master plan is one, build sports car.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:49.600]   Two, use that money to build an affordable car.
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:53.120]   Three, use that money to build an even more affordable car.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:57.760]   Four, while doing above also provides zero-emission electric power generation options.
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.320]   So he got the first one done.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:05.520]   He's yet to build an affordable car or even more affordable car.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:10.480]   And I don't think he's created zero-emission electric power generation options either.
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:14.000]   He did a part du, part du, part du.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.560]   I'm pronouncing it right because man is here, but duh.
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:17.360]   [laughter]
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.400]   Good job, good job.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:22.240]   I don't know why, whenever I say words in French,
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:24.640]   I sound a little more angry than I am.
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:25.360]   Pop duh.
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:26.080]   You really do.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:28.160]   It's like German except it's French.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.880]   Very much in character, I agree.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.800]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:33.440]   I don't know.
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.520]   French is a beautiful, lilting language.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:40.320]   I was watching a documentary about Egypt on National Geographic last night,
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.920]   and they had a French archaeologist, and I said,
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:43.920]   "Dilisa, that's such a beautiful language.
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:44.720]   I love that language."
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:45.920]   And he didn't sound angry at all.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.440]   So there you go.
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:49.040]   Part duh.
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:50.640]   Let me just go duh.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.400]   Let me go see part duh.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:55.280]   Master plan part duh.
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:59.120]   First master plan, which this is 10 years later,
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.680]   create a low volume car which would necessarily be expensive.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.600]   Use that money to develop or meet.
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:07.040]   See, notice he's modified it already, modified it slightly.
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:11.600]   Use that money to develop a medium volume car at a lower price, not affordable.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.880]   Then step three, use that money to create an affordable high volume car.
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:15.600]   Still hasn't done it.
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.920]   Then four, provide solar power.
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:19.360]   Okay.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:20.480]   Yeah.
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.360]   That's okay.
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:22.400]   Let's see.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:23.040]   Part duh.
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:27.840]   He's got a, the boring company, I think is part of part duh.
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.440]   Autonomy hasn't reached that.
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.360]   Can't really blame him though.
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:32.560]   That's hard to do.
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.280]   That's hard.
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:33.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:38.000]   I bought my Tesla because it was fun AF to drive, and it was electric.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:43.440]   So master plan part duh, and this came out in 2016.
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:45.280]   So this is only six years old.
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:47.680]   And some of this he actually has done, I think,
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:54.160]   create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:59.040]   We have Tesla power walls and a Tesla solar roof.
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:02.720]   Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments.
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:03.120]   He's trying.
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:04.240]   He's working on that.
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.400]   He's got a cyber truck coming any minute now.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:14.640]   Develop a self-driving capability that is 10 times safer than manual via massive fleet learning.
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:18.000]   See, I think, you know, in a way that is aspirational, right?
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:18.480]   He didn't.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.760]   It's not working.
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:22.160]   People are dying, but it's, but he's trying.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:24.320]   And then enable you,
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.440]   enable your car to make money for you when you aren't using it.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:31.600]   This he promised would happen by 2020 that Tesla owners would be able to make as much as
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:37.120]   $30,000 a year, letting their car when they're sleeping go out and pick people up and drive them around.
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:43.040]   Yeah, but that felt like a silly, that didn't feel like something to work.
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:43.520]   It is part duh.
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:45.440]   It's in his master plan.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.880]   Yeah, but that's okay.
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:53.600]   Like, you have to think hold a master plan is clearly from like pinky in the brain or a six year old's workbook,
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:57.200]   not from something you should rely on.
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.040]   I'm going to help out the show.
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:05.680]   I think if anyone is going to make self-driving happen for reals, I would bet on Google first.
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:06.320]   Interesting.
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:07.600]   Is it?
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:10.560]   Oh, wait, Mo's a lot farther ahead, isn't it?
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:11.760]   Yeah, I think it's further ahead.
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:21.200]   Do I wonder if anyone who now owns a Tesla I don't would be worried at the message that it sends,
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:26.480]   even though they didn't really change anything, they just bought it for the electric bank part of it.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.640]   Somebody made a bumper sticker.
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:33.760]   I think they posted a massive on that says, I bought this Tesla pre-Twitter.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:40.560]   I was going to break that up because I still have my do you still have your Tesla?
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:43.360]   No, no, I drive forward now.
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:46.400]   I mean, I drive all my cars into the ground.
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:49.440]   So, you know, I bought my car in 2015.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.560]   I'll be driving it for a while.
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:55.360]   But I will say the halo and I didn't buy it for the halo.
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.680]   I bought it because it was super fun to drive.
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:00.800]   How do you drive a car into the ground if it's not a plane?
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:01.520]   How does that work?
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:05.840]   It's just an idiom, but yeah.
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:06.640]   Sorry.
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:10.080]   All these idioms are completely lost.
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:13.280]   Being me, I will literally drive it into the ground in a ditch somewhere.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:15.040]   But that's just me.
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:20.720]   I mean, I keep my cars until they're not economical to keep anymore, basically.
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:23.440]   Which is the right thing to do.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.040]   Everybody agrees, right?
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:27.360]   Well, and I buy them used as well.
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:31.760]   So I did that wrong entirely, you know, from beginning.
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:36.640]   I buy them new and I get rid of them in three years because I lease them.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:40.240]   Well, if you lease, at least things a little bit different.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:41.440]   Yeah, with the company, it's true.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:46.320]   And people think Tesla drivers are jerks and it's not.
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.440]   Do you get that weird?
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.840]   You know, sometimes.
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:53.360]   So I've got a friend who's like, oh, you're still driving your Tesla.
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.920]   I was like, what are you going to get rid of a car?
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:56.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:56.960]   You know, that's not.
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:00.960]   Make it a political statement just because you drive in a Tesla.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:02.160]   I think that's ridiculous.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:06.640]   But, you know, I mean, although, you know what?
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:10.400]   Some of these people are driving Volkswagen's and those people help the Nazis.
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.080]   By the way, that was Elon's point.
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:16.080]   He said, well, do you drive folks?
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:18.880]   Because who was it gave up her Tesla for an Audi or a.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:21.360]   Oh, yeah, that was a list of Milano.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.560]   A list of Milano.
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.280]   And then he.
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.200]   Old German cars are a little suspect.
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:26.080]   Elon tweeted her.
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:28.080]   Yeah, you bought a car made by nets.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.680]   Literally made by nazis.
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:33.040]   Yeah, she's, but she's really blowhardy too.
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:33.360]   So.
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:36.640]   I think I like that blowhardy.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.800]   Are you sitting out there?
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:40.720]   And I think you're secretly judging us.
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:43.520]   Wait, it's a good time for an ad.
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:46.400]   I just feel like.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:48.640]   Can't just sit in there thinking.
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:50.080]   I just sit back and watch.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:52.240]   We go blowhardy again.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:52.720]   Blowhard.
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:53.920]   Just sit back and watch.
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:55.040]   There's a lot of people,
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:34:00.480]   be it on Twitter or wherever social platform or whatnot that are just.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:04.160]   They put out a lot of great messages that sound good.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.840]   But then there's no sustenance behind it.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:12.160]   So it's just a bunch of blowhard doing it for the PR kind of stuff.
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:14.000]   You know, and then there's other people like.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.080]   Make sure to rest in peace.
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:17.280]   Kirstie Ali that.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:22.560]   Doesn't really say much, but she did a lot of things in society and for the community.
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:25.360]   And then there's Craig Newmark who never says a word.
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.680]   I'm just doing a lot of things out there.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:28.960]   You know, that's a good point.
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:33.920]   Is this connected to the idea that people should separate
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:39.920]   the artist from the actual person who may or may not have done some bad stuff?
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:43.920]   Like am I going to stop reading their books just because they had a.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:47.760]   I tell you one of my favorite cartoonists really was a jerk on Twitter.
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:48.800]   So.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.800]   Is it Scott Adams?
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:51.840]   No, this guy.
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:56.320]   No, that's a good question.
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:58.240]   So that just went right over my head.
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:01.120]   As an artist, that's a really good question.
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:07.440]   Do you Michael Jackson, do you still listen to his music or or are Kelly or.
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:13.520]   I mean, now if you I mean, I have drive and afford, Henry Ford was a notorious anti-semite.
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:14.480]   He was a racist.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:14.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:16.000]   So.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.800]   There's a lot of famous French writers who did some some bad stuff.
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:26.800]   And there was a there's also a famous French comic who said that we only really ever give a pass
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:33.680]   if ever to artists. We don't say like of a baker like, oh yeah, he you know, he.
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:38.480]   Missed babes with little children on his oven, but he makes such a great baguette.
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:42.560]   Now you are a Frenchman.
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:45.600]   That's a Frenchman.
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:46.320]   I don't care.
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.480]   That doesn't that doesn't happen with yeah.
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:52.560]   It only happens with artists that we may even consider giving them a pass.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:55.920]   I don't know if somebody made a really great baguette.
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.480]   I wouldn't care if you know he was this.
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:35:59.920]   He's talking about children.
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.840]   He's talking about diddling children.
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:02.880]   Yeah, it's different than.
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:04.160]   Why do you draw the line?
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:05.920]   Yeah, well, I see.
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:06.640]   He's like right there.
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:08.320]   I don't know.
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:10.240]   A really good baguette's hard to find.
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:11.120]   All right, you're right.
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:11.520]   All right.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:11.840]   I want to.
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:15.920]   No, no, no, no, no, no, we're going to.
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:17.440]   Yeah, it's time for another ad.
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:17.840]   Okay.
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:19.280]   And waffles and waffles.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:21.440]   Those really thin kind.
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:23.360]   They call really thin kind.
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:23.760]   Crips.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:26.000]   So is it a lawful waffle?
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:26.880]   That's the question.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.680]   No one lawful waffles.
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:32.880]   Our show today.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.000]   Right.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.600]   She doesn't like me anymore either.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:41.040]   Between and Stacy, I'm getting a lot of shade here.
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:41.760]   I got to tell you.
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:42.240]   I like you.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:42.560]   I like.
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:42.960]   Thank you.
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:43.760]   I like.
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:44.960]   No shade.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:46.400]   No shades.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:49.120]   It's not shade.
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:50.400]   It's obvious.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:56.000]   I'm bad at shade, but I'll tell you what I think.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.040]   This is the 49th shade of gray on the scale.
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.520]   There's no side.
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:04.320]   I was Stacy.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.680]   It's just straight on there.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:06.240]   It's a 50-day.
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:07.440]   I like it.
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:09.680]   We may have a show title there.
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.240]   This is where you can Google is brought to you by
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:18.320]   Tanium, the industry's approach to cybersecurity.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:19.840]   Okay.
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.440]   Is it?
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:22.400]   I mean, it's not.
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:22.800]   It's not.
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:23.440]   It's flawed.
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:24.480]   It's fundamentally flawed.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:28.240]   IT management and security point tools.
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:31.360]   They only offer a little bit of the solution you need to protect your environment.
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:32.480]   You know that by now.
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:37.440]   And I'll tell you a lot of primitive fences say we can we could stop all breaches when
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:38.560]   they obviously can't.
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:41.920]   They if they could, would there be a ransomware every 11 seconds?
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:42.560]   I don't think so.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:46.640]   Making decisions based on out of date, stale data,
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:50.880]   trying to defend your critical assets from cyber attacks with tools that don't
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:51.680]   interoperate.
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:55.600]   That's no way for IT teams to navigate today's attack surface.
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:58.560]   You got to, you got to, you got to do something different.
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:01.600]   And that's why Tanium, it's the right time for Tanium.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:08.240]   Tanium says it's time for a convergence of tools, endpoints, IT operations,
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:09.120]   and security.
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:12.080]   Bring it all together, interoperate.
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:14.960]   They've got solutions for government entities, for education,
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:17.520]   for financial services, retail, health care.
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:21.200]   You can trust their solutions for every workflow that relies on endpoint data.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:26.240]   Some of the things Tanium can do for you, asset discovery and inventory.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:28.240]   You can track down every IT asset.
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:29.760]   You own instantaneously.
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:32.160]   You can do risk and compliance management.
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:36.800]   So important these days, fine and fixed vulnerabilities at scale.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:39.760]   And in seconds, do it fast.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:44.320]   Threat hunting, you can hunt for sophisticated adversaries in real time.
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:50.320]   You got client management, which can automate operations from discovery to
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:57.120]   management, sensitive data monitoring, index and monitor sensitive data globally.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:59.040]   In seconds, I mean, this is the thing.
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.960]   This is it, man.
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:06.160]   Tanium protects organizations with other endpoint management and security providers
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:09.680]   have failed with one platform, one platform.
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:13.360]   Tanium identifies where all your data is across your entire IT estate,
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:18.320]   patches every device you own in seconds because speed matters and implements
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:21.520]   critical security controls all from a single pane of glass.
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:27.280]   Kevin Bush, the vice president of IT at Ring Power Corp, says, "Tanium brings visibility
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:29.200]   to one screen for our whole team."
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:33.520]   If you don't have that kind of visibility, you're not going to be able to sleep at night.
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:36.000]   But with real time data comes real time impact.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.320]   If you're ready to unite operations and security teams with a single source of truth
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:43.440]   and confidently protect your organization from cyber threats,
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:50.160]   well, it's time you met Tanium to learn more, visit tanium.com/twit,
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:56.400]   tanium, T-A-N-I-U-M.com/twit.
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:59.360]   Thank you, Tanium, for supporting the show.
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:00.160]   We really appreciate it.
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.160]   And you support us too when you go to that address.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:06.240]   You know how important that is, tanium.com/twit, T-W-I-T.
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:09.280]   I have in my hands the GUMIX.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:12.400]   Yeah, where did this come from?
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:13.120]   Burke brought this in.
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:14.480]   Did I have this all along?
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:18.880]   And I just forgot all of mine is, this is the book you were talking about
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:24.400]   where you kind of have the comics, but you explain what the exe-jus-
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:25.600]   There's actually two.
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:28.080]   I was there for so long that I needed two volumes.
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:32.560]   This is Volume 1 and the Volume 2 is more critical, let's say.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:35.520]   This is, I love your stuff.
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:36.960]   Did you, when did you start drawing?
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:41.840]   When I was born?
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.440]   Little, you're a kid.
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:43.760]   Wow.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:46.480]   It's funny because you dedicate this book to your parents.
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:47.040]   I just didn't stop.
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.680]   You said you, your parents never understood what you did for a living
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:51.040]   and now with this book they really want.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.560]   Larry, this is Senator Pichai.
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:02.000]   Larry, you can tell the press that no money changed hands, but
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.440]   say, do you like chocolate?
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:06.480]   Who's he talking to?
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:11.760]   This is when Kit Kat started appearing around the place.
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:16.400]   I think it was the first time that an Android release was called,
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:19.280]   they were all called desserts, but this was a national brand.
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:20.560]   Oh, we talked about this.
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:21.840]   And they said no money changed hands.
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:22.720]   They didn't pay us for this.
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:23.200]   Exactly.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:23.600]   Right.
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:24.160]   Exactly.
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.880]   So maybe they were paid in Kit Kat's.
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:27.920]   So it was a Kit Kat bar.
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:30.160]   So there were a lot of Kit Kat's around the campus?
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:33.040]   I can't remember.
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:35.120]   I think there were a few cats.
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:35.680]   Everywhere.
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:38.080]   Not mold and usable, I don't think.
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:40.080]   Do you carry an iPhone or an Android device?
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:44.880]   Android, I'm a very much an open source in the next guy,
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:47.520]   so I try to run as much open source stuff.
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:51.280]   So you drew as a kid, did you study art in school?
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:52.800]   I did not.
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:53.360]   Maybe I should.
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:56.800]   I've, because now I could be able to draw a perspective and stuff like this.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:02.320]   Yes, but that's okay, because that means you're just a normal cartoonist.
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:06.000]   You do, uh, caricatures really well.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.600]   I mean, you really capture what people look like.
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:08.800]   It's you're good at portraits.
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:14.480]   So I try, so for, for these, either I cheat and I take a photo and then I,
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:17.920]   I use the photo as a, as a template.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:24.720]   Or I try to do it from scratch, which is a better caricature and try to capture the features,
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:26.480]   but that's way harder.
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:30.240]   And I, I think I'm going to need another lifetime of work.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.360]   Okay, everybody, look at this.
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:31.760]   Who's that?
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:32.960]   Everybody knows who that is.
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:34.400]   You know who that is.
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:36.800]   It's obviously Steve Ballmer.
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:37.520]   Ballmer.
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:38.000]   Ballmer.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.920]   I'm glad I was like, I was guessing that I'm like,
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:40.560]   it's a ballmer.
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:43.760]   I've seen him in so long.
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:44.400]   Wow.
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:47.440]   I know, but that, well, this is from 2005, but there's Tim Cook.
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:50.080]   You can mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:51.200]   You know how these people are.
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.120]   It's good.
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:54.080]   I think you do a good job.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:55.040]   That's a really good mark.
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.120]   And then Larry Ellison.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:05.760]   This one was, yeah, this one was actually critical to others, but sort of flattering
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:08.880]   to Eric Schmidt, who was the CEO of Google at that time.
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:13.040]   So he, he printed out a version of this and he placed it on his,
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:15.840]   door of his office.
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:21.120]   Oh, well, actually that, if there was a fault in Eric Schmidt,
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:23.120]   is that he was like a little too brutally honest.
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:25.760]   He didn't, he didn't play that game.
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:27.760]   So this is how tech companies apologize.
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:29.600]   Google, we screwed up.
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:31.120]   Sorry, Facebook.
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:34.640]   Sorry, but we're still right.
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:38.960]   Oracle say, but one word and we'll sue your ass off.
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:40.880]   Blackberry.
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:42.160]   Like that mistake?
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:42.800]   A mistake.
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:45.520]   Apple, you're holding it wrong.
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:46.880]   Microsoft.
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:50.080]   It's just a picture of Paul Bristik this time.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:53.600]   I think that's hysterical.
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:54.240]   I love it.
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:56.080]   And you're not using illustrator to do this.
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:58.000]   You're doing this free hand.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:58.480]   Free hand.
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:43:59.120]   Yes.
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:43:59.920]   That's so cool.
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:01.280]   And that's so fascinating.
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:01.920]   Yeah.
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:04.160]   Actually, but as much as I like your caricatures,
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:06.320]   I like your cartoon faces though.
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:08.560]   They look like olive oil, Popeye and olive oil.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.320]   I mean, I just really like them.
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:11.520]   They're really cute.
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:13.520]   Did you read tatas a kid?
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:14.960]   Yeah, of course.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:18.960]   I grew up with all the Belgian and French things.
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:20.800]   Tanta Ricks.
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.720]   Yeah, I study his French.
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:26.160]   My favorite is one guy called Sunken,
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:32.160]   who is the author of a series that is not quite that well known in the US.
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:34.480]   But I think it's being translated these days.
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:38.400]   It's the, yeah, I just love his style.
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:42.240]   On the way he portrays movements and faces.
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:44.080]   What are his comics called?
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:44.960]   Do you?
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:49.600]   So the English version is being translated as a gomer goof.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:52.880]   It's a guy called Gomer who just goofs a lot.
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:55.040]   And this is how it sounds.
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:56.880]   The translation is pretty good.
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:58.560]   But it's been around.
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:04.000]   It's very well known in France and Belgium, I would say,
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.080]   but not quite that well known in the US.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:07.840]   But maybe the translation will help.
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:08.320]   Huh.
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:09.520]   I have to look for it.
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:14.560]   Somebody a long time ago gave me a treasure trove of French comics in
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:15.840]   comicsology format.
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:17.920]   And my French is no good.
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:19.920]   I never really did anything with it.
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:20.720]   But I saved it.
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:22.960]   I thought someday I'm going to be able to read this.
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:25.360]   Gosh, when I was learning French,
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.920]   someone gave me butterlairs, the flowers of evil.
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.520]   That was not an incentive to lose.
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:32.320]   Le flue de malle.
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:34.080]   I'm like, dang, really?
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:39.040]   I said, Stu, don't belt you.
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:41.040]   This is even worse.
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:42.080]   I could have done--
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:44.000]   I think both of those can be hard.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.320]   But there's poets that are hard to understand,
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:49.680]   even for native French people.
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:51.520]   They could have done that to you.
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:52.800]   Oh, we got those in English too.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:53.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:54.160]   Yeah, we--
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:55.360]   Right.
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:56.400]   You know, I still--
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:59.440]   I think I still have my copy of the little prints,
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:00.400]   "Le petit plus."
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:00.960]   Yes.
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:02.400]   I'm like, that's still running right now.
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:05.040]   Oh, that's a much better for learning French.
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:05.600]   No, yeah.
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:06.320]   It was great.
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:07.200]   I can read that.
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:07.920]   That's easy.
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:10.000]   Well, it's a kid's book for one thing.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.760]   Yeah, I think I might still be--
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:13.120]   That's where I need to start.
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:14.320]   Yeah, start there.
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:16.720]   That in my six French dictionaries.
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:18.240]   Other news.
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:22.960]   The other shoe dropped in the almost $70 billion
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:25.200]   acquisition of Activision by Microsoft.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:28.080]   Federal Trade Commission chairman,
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:29.520]   Lena Kahn.
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:32.560]   I guess she's just the chair, we don't say.
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:34.000]   There's no gender to a chair.
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:36.400]   Unless it's--
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:38.560]   If it's French, there is.
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:39.360]   Unless it's French.
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:39.840]   Unless it's French.
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:42.960]   That was trying to remember the word for chair,
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:44.000]   but I forgot.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:44.800]   Chez.
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:45.600]   Chez.
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:46.640]   Lashez.
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:47.920]   Yes.
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:49.120]   And it's a Chez long--
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:50.960]   because it's long.
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:58.000]   Lena Kahn, who is Lashez of the Federal Trade Commission,
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.960]   has staked out an ambitious trust-busting agenda
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:03.600]   on a case that may be difficult to win,
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.680]   says the New York Times.
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:07.760]   They say, you know, Microsoft took great--
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:11.280]   I have a pressing question.
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:14.560]   Is chairman the same in French?
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:17.120]   Is it really tied to the piece of furniture?
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:17.920]   Or is it--
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:18.400]   Lond de Chez.
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:20.400]   Lond de la Chez.
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:22.560]   No, there's no--
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:24.480]   there's no sair in that title.
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:24.720]   No.
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:26.480]   So what do--
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:27.200]   OK, sorry.
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:28.560]   This is something I'm like,
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:30.320]   I cannot pay any attention to anything
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:32.640]   until I find out if this is just a weird--
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:33.440]   Oh, no.
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:33.920]   OK, thank you.
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:35.040]   Just be Lond de la Chez.
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:36.800]   All right, good.
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:37.760]   All right, give me the MACCUS.
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:38.320]   You need a MACCUS.
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:39.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.440]   Lena Kahn, go for it.
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:42.400]   No, what is he--
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:43.520]   How would you say chairman--
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:44.160]   It will be President--
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:45.520]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:46.240]   President--
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:47.040]   President Biden.
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:47.880]   President Biden--
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:49.920]   So if, like, the chairman of the board would be--
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:50.480]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:51.440]   Or a secretary?
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:54.080]   Do you have, like, home secretaries or, like,
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:55.520]   the secretary of the treasury or--
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:56.080]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:57.440]   Minister, that's a minister.
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:58.240]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:47:58.400]   OK.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:03.760]   I have-- I met Sarkozy, by the way, one time.
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:06.480]   My wife and I, Loique LeMour, who did
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:10.800]   Loeb for many years in Paris, when he invited us out
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:12.560]   about 10 years ago.
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:15.120]   We got to go to the Elizie Palace
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:17.800]   and to meet President Sarkozy.
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:19.440]   That was quite-- he's about four foot tall.
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.960]   He's a tiny little man.
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:22.480]   It's quite an experience.
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:24.880]   That's all I took away from it, by the way.
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:27.120]   Were you serving any food over there?
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:29.280]   Yeah, I was a busboy.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:29.960]   You missed out.
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:31.280]   Yeah, no, it was good.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:33.240]   Loique knew everybody.
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:37.560]   Loique was, like, his right hand for technology or something.
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.720]   He knew everybody.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:45.960]   Now he's on a ayahuasca retreat, a permanent ayahuasca retreat.
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:47.960]   I see him every now and then on a retreat.
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:48.360]   Do you?
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:49.360]   Yeah.
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:50.400]   He's quite fascinated.
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:51.320]   I love Loique.
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:52.240]   What a great guy.
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:53.640]   What a great guy.
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:55.240]   Do you think he would still be on footer,
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:56.920]   or would you move to Mexico?
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:57.800]   That's a good question.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:04.880]   I'm not going to give another $0.10 to Elon by going to Twitter.com.
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:05.960]   You almost had me.
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:07.720]   It was this close.
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:09.480]   Nicely done, sir.
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:10.240]   Way to fight it.
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:13.240]   Close that tab.
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:17.440]   I-- you know, for a long time when I left Twitter,
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:18.680]   I would go back just to re--
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:19.440]   I can't post.
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:20.480]   Can't respond.
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:23.160]   Can't do anything just to-- like, hands-off read.
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.920]   And I found after a while--
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:26.320]   I'm not getting anything.
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:27.880]   This isn't that great.
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:28.760]   I was still at this point.
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:30.560]   There were a lot of brands and news organizations
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:31.760]   that were still there.
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:34.200]   But it wasn't a conversation anymore.
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:35.400]   It was just--
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:36.640]   Yeah, I'm casting.
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:37.400]   It was a nude feed.
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:38.040]   News feed.
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:38.760]   Yeah.
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:41.080]   I-- Mr. Delahanty--
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:44.120]   excuse me, Mr. Delahanty mentioned
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:46.600]   how he would go through his feed and block
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:49.800]   the people that were mentioning the ads that showed up
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:51.160]   in his feed.
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:52.840]   And it cleaned up his experience.
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:53.720]   So I tried that.
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:55.120]   And holy crap, I don't see--
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:57.040]   I don't see nothing anymore.
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:58.000]   Nothing.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.040]   And I mean, I was seeing the ads, the sponsor tweets
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:00.880]   every now and then.
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:02.080]   It wasn't really bothering me.
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:03.280]   No, it stopped.
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:06.360]   But dude, I went through like Mr. Delahanty did.
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:09.280]   And it was a weekend of work.
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:12.560]   You know, going in and manually blocking those accounts.
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:14.200]   When you say it like that, it sounds like he's
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:15.520]   the vice principal at Twitter.
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:18.600]   But Mr. Delahanty is not the vice principal.
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:20.000]   He is not the Delahanty.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:20.760]   He's not the Delahanty.
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:22.000]   Patrick Delahanty.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.800]   The one and only whom we all love.
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:25.840]   Yeah, we love it.
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:27.840]   He's the honorary man of the chair.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:29.360]   He's the honorary--
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.360]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:34.520]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:35.880]   Now I've completely lost the thread.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:42.920]   Lena Kahn, former current FTC chair who got the job
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:46.320]   because she was going to bust a big tech.
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:49.680]   I mean, let's face it, that was the mandate, right?
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:54.960]   And her big issue is Monopsonie, which is not monopoly.
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:57.920]   Monopoly is when you control all the customers.
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:59.360]   Monopsonie is the opposite.
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:02.280]   When you're the only place you can go to buy something,
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:05.400]   Amazon is becoming a Monopsonie, for instance.
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:08.440]   And for some-- the issue with Monopsonie,
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:10.560]   at least according to a letter she wrote, that has just
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:16.200]   been released by Elizabeth Warren when this acquisition was
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:17.200]   announced.
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:18.880]   Warren, Senator Warren, and a few other senators
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:21.840]   wrote a letter to Lena Kahn saying,
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:23.360]   you've got to do something about this.
[01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:27.040]   You can't allow this Microsoft merger to happen.
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:32.160]   And I thought Lena Kahn's response was kind of interesting.
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:35.120]   Let me see if I can find it, because it just came out.
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:42.720]   And I read it to Paul, Microsoft, Warren Kahn.
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:45.120]   She was talking about Monopsonie, but particularly
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:46.600]   in regard to labor markets.
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:55.320]   Here it is, responding to Senator Warren's letter.
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:57.640]   Actually, this was back in June.
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:03.560]   But I share your concern, Kahn wrote, that Monopsonie--
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:05.440]   and you're going to have to explain this all,
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:06.920]   so pay attention, Stacy.
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:11.320]   I share your concern that Monopsonie law--
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:13.600]   I thought I should warn her before we have the pop quiz.
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:14.040]   Good.
[01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:14.680]   That was good.
[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:15.800]   That was good.
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:17.440]   Glad you were not asking me.
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:19.480]   I was pondering going for waffles during this video.
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:20.320]   No.
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:25.000]   I share your concern that Monopsonie power in labor markets
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:28.800]   may enable firms to harm workers in a host of ways,
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:32.320]   including through undermining their rights and dignity.
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:34.480]   Although antitrust law in recent decades
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:37.000]   has generally neglected Monopsonie concerns and harms
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.360]   to workers, I strongly believe that merger investigations must
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:44.120]   scrutinize the impact on labor markets.
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:47.160]   Given that Activision disclosed the filing,
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:50.000]   I am able to confirm that we are investigating the proposed
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:50.280]   merger.
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:51.480]   This is back in June.
[01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:54.040]   But why did she bring this thing up about labor markets?
[01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:57.200]   I'm not sure why Microsoft Act was the only threat
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:01.600]   that this poses is to Sony that Microsoft might pull back
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:04.200]   some games from Sony's PlayStation 5.
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:07.120]   Microsoft's already assured Sony that that wouldn't happen.
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:08.920]   They said, well, sign a agreement that won't happen
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:10.080]   for 10 years.
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:13.040]   They offered a consent decree to the FTC.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:15.520]   They said, we would be glad to sign a consent decree that
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:17.560]   would forbid it forever.
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:19.720]   And still, the FTC said, no.
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:24.880]   They're apparently not worried about this, which seems to be
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:27.000]   the only potential problem with this merger,
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.480]   but about labor markets.
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:30.560]   So this is interesting.
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:32.640]   And this is probably going to be an overstep.
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:36.160]   This might be the point where Lena goes too far.
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:39.280]   But the point behind it is they have been looking--
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:45.920]   Lena's cons focus on this is if a company gets big enough,
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:48.880]   how does it hurt all of the players in the ecosystem?
[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:51.280]   Not just other companies, consumers.
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:54.680]   Not just other consumers, suppliers.
[01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:58.400]   I mean, the FTC's put out some notices around suppliers.
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:02.720]   So with labor, my hunch is because Activision had such--
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:06.440]   remember, were they the ones having sex in stairwells?
[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:07.440]   I can't remember.
[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:08.440]   Yeah, they were horrible.
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:09.360]   Horrible, horrible.
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:10.440]   Yeah.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:11.320]   They had some really--
[01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:12.320]   They had some really--
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:13.160]   --repervents.
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:14.160]   --room at their hospitality.
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:15.160]   Yeah.
[01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:16.560]   Sorry.
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:20.640]   I mean, there was actual harassment and possibly assault
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:23.440]   there and then retaliation against workers.
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:26.120]   And the idea being that if a company is too big,
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:27.160]   they become too powerful.
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:31.680]   There's no place else for a game designer to work.
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:35.480]   Is I think the mental gymnastics that they're doing--
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:37.680]   I don't think that's a compelling argument.
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:40.800]   I don't know where they stand on NDAs in the gaming industry
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:41.240]   right now.
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:44.040]   I know some states allow it and some don't.
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:46.240]   But that has historically been their argument.
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:47.520]   It's too big of a place.
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:51.920]   There's not enough other options for insert injured party here.
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:55.040]   And because Activision was so crappy,
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:59.840]   this may be, I guess, a way to really highlight that.
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:00.440]   I don't really know.
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:00.960]   I really--
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:02.640]   Microsoft's kind of crappy too.
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:05.440]   Microsoft just recently came out with an investigation,
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:08.240]   a long, long delayed investigation of the behavior.
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:10.280]   It's own executives, including Bill Gates,
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:13.040]   and concluded it hadn't been handled properly.
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:16.640]   That HR had ignored complaints.
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:19.760]   Microsoft has not maybe as egregious,
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:23.400]   but similar problems with harassment and discrimination.
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:27.640]   And I mean, Bill Gates famously dated his employees.
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:30.080]   Married his employee, it's a matter of fact.
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:31.760]   And then continued his data's employees.
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:33.280]   And then continued his data's employee.
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:35.120]   Yeah.
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:37.400]   Men behaving badly in positions of power as a new story.
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:38.840]   What a shock.
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:39.600]   I know.
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:42.440]   I'm sorry for bringing things back to Twitter,
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:45.440]   but I think Musk may have been surprised
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:49.080]   when half the people he didn't lay off, many of them left.
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:52.280]   And he was maybe surprised that they had other companies
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:53.240]   to work for.
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:56.840]   I think because he was trained by the Tesla
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:59.960]   and the SpaceX experiences where people didn't have
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:03.920]   that many other choices, that he thought people would stay
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:06.920]   longer because they didn't really quite have that many other choices.
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:08.120]   I don't know how much--
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:09.520]   Well, that's the monopsony, right?
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:10.120]   It does--
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:13.400]   I mean, Tesla probably does to some degree.
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:14.840]   Although you go to Apple, in fact, there
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.320]   is this revolving door between Tesla and Apple.
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:20.080]   But maybe SpaceX, there's only a handful of other companies.
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:22.040]   You wouldn't want any one of those to become too powerful
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:24.680]   because then employees would have no choice, which
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:26.880]   means they couldn't negotiate better salaries.
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:28.080]   There's all sorts of problems.
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:31.800]   And that's one thing the FTC is apparently very concerned about.
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:35.920]   Although now, thank you, Scooter X. He just sent me the FTC press
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:40.000]   release on the prosecution in which they say,
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.440]   "Activision currently has a strategy of offering its games
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:44.840]   on many devices regardless of producer.
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:48.040]   But that could change if the deal is allowed to proceed
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:51.760]   with control over Activision's blockbuster franchises."
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:54.360]   There's a word you don't hear a lot in an FTC press release,
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:55.760]   blockbuster.
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:59.120]   Microsoft would have both the means and the motive
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:03.200]   to harm competition by manipulating Activision's prices.
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:05.360]   You see, it's more than just exclusives.
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:08.200]   Decrating Activision's game quality?
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:09.120]   Why they would do that?
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:10.280]   I don't know. They own the company.
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:11.840]   Don't they want to make money?
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:14.520]   Or player experience on rival consoles?
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:16.080]   So it looks best on Xbox.
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:17.520]   OK.
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:21.080]   Changing the terms and timing of access to Activision's content
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:24.120]   or withholding content from competitors entirely.
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:25.320]   Resulting in harm to consumers.
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:26.800]   This has nothing about labor in it.
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:27.520]   This has nothing.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:30.560]   So maybe Lena wasn't paying attention when she responded
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:33.520]   to Senator Warren and just said, "Send it this.
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:35.120]   It's in my thesis.
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:36.080]   It's in my dissertation.
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:38.920]   Just send it that."
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:40.400]   This makes sense.
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:41.960]   This does make sense.
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:46.480]   For Microsoft, this is potentially, regardless of the outcome,
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:49.000]   the kiss of death to this deal because it delayed significantly.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.960]   For instance, next step is to go before an administrative law
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:52.360]   judge.
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:53.320]   That's how this works.
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:56.320]   That won't be until August 2023.
[01:57:56.320 --> 01:57:59.880]   If they decide to appeal that or goes badly for them
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:01.720]   or they can't make an agreement.
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:03.320]   So that best, you're going to get this
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:05.640]   is delaying it by eight months.
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:07.120]   At worst, it could go on for years
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:09.960]   because you could then appeal to go to the federal court
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:12.560]   and then go up the appeals chain.
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:14.440]   And that would also kill the deal.
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:17.080]   So whether the deal gets killed by the FTC
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:20.280]   or just delayed to the point where it's moot,
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:22.080]   this is bad news for that acquisition.
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:26.360]   So when I talk to Paul and I think I agree with him,
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:30.560]   it was hard to find anything really detrimental
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:32.360]   to having Microsoft acquire Activision.
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:33.520]   As they pointed out, they still only
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:38.040]   make them the number three game company in the world.
[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:39.560]   Anyway.
[01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:41.160]   And it doesn't sound like Microsoft
[01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:43.800]   is really trying to sell consoles anymore.
[01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:48.040]   It feels like they're moving away from the exclusivity model
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:50.520]   and they're trying to make people pay for gaming
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:51.600]   as a service instead.
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:55.280]   So it wouldn't make much sense to harm the experience
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:56.440]   on other platforms.
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:57.720]   Exactly.
[01:58:57.720 --> 01:59:00.240]   Exactly right.
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:02.360]   You're going to make your money on Call of Duty.
[01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:04.720]   You don't want to limit it to Xbox.
[01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:07.320]   You want to make it available everywhere in a great experience
[01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:10.560]   everywhere because you'll sell more copies.
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:17.680]   So the decision has been made on the word of the year.
[01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:18.680]   We had three choices.
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:23.880]   And before you look up what the word of the year is,
[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:24.840]   I want to know what you think.
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:26.360]   The one choice--
[01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:28.440]   I'll tell you my personal choice was--
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:30.400]   this is from the Oxford English Dictionary.
[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:34.040]   My personal choice, metaverse word of the year.
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:34.800]   Makes sense.
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:36.000]   No.
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:36.520]   No.
[01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:38.720]   The other one was a hashtag, which I don't think
[01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:41.400]   should ever be a word of the year.
[01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:43.200]   I stand with--
[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:45.040]   hashtag I stand with.
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:46.400]   No.
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:47.000]   That's not very good.
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.000]   OK.
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.200]   So the only other choice is the one that actually wants.
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:57.080]   With a 93% majority of the public vote, goblin mode.
[01:59:57.080 --> 01:59:58.720]   Yes.
[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:00.520]   But that's not a-- that's two words.
[02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:04.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:05.560]   It's like, that's a phrase.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:06.360]   Come on, people.
[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:07.360]   Come on.
[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:10.280]   I would have voted for Rona Graham.
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:11.920]   Rona Graham.
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:14.440]   Oh, Ron-- was it Ronto Graham or--
[02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:16.360]   Oh, oh, we were talking about that.
[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:21.880]   Yeah, the new designations for after a petabyte and yada
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:23.160]   byte, you need some--
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:24.080]   Oh, right.
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:25.240]   --there's going to be a--
[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:27.600]   not a Bronto byte or a Helabyte, which
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:29.080]   is what Google wanted.
[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:30.320]   Yeah, we said Helabyte.
[02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:31.080]   I remember that.
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:33.600]   I remember Bronto byte being the thing way back in the day.
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:35.600]   But OK.
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:38.360]   There's actually a problem, because you have to use an unused
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:40.240]   letter of the alphabet.
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:43.240]   And so--
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:46.400]   and by the way, I think they met in Versailles to the side
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:48.040]   this, didn't they?
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:49.280]   We talked about it on the show.
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:49.760]   Yeah.
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:50.960]   The French have a whole state.
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:52.840]   They used to have the original kilogram.
[02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:54.160]   They've got some sort of--
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:55.600]   It all comes down a phrase.
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:56.440]   Yeah.
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:58.200]   So thanks for turning us in that direction.
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:00:59.880]   Once again, men are--
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:01.480]   All right.
[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:02.360]   The Rana--
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:03.040]   See you in my new--
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:08.040]   The Rana byte and the Quetta byte or the new.
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:09.440]   And we talked about it last week.
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:12.400]   But I agree that would have been a much better--
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:14.720]   even Helabyte would have been better than Goblins.
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:17.200]   No, you're not going to get that until we start talking
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:18.280]   about it on the regular.
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:19.720]   And that's going to be several--
[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:20.640]   But so this was my problem.
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:21.560]   Maybe I'm not a touch.
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:25.000]   But I don't remember hearing Goblin modal.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.000]   Goblin modal.
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:26.840]   The TikTok thing.
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:27.360]   OK.
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:30.400]   It's like you hanging out in your house,
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:34.600]   eating French fries, doing whatever it takes to stay healthy
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:36.400]   and normal and sane.
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:37.920]   Is that close?
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:38.440]   Really?
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:38.920]   Yeah.
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:39.420]   Yeah.
[02:01:39.420 --> 02:01:39.920]   Yeah.
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:41.960]   Word of the year gets decided in Versailles.
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:43.480]   It will be a very different choice.
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:43.920]   It will be.
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:44.420]   It will be.
[02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:44.920]   It will be.
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:45.420]   It will be.
[02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:45.920]   It will be.
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:46.920]   It will be.
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:47.920]   It will be.
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:52.120]   It will be the president of the Shez de la Baud.
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:55.760]   Previous words last year was Vax, V-A-X.
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:56.760]   That makes sense.
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:01:57.680]   Yeah.
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:01:58.200]   I guess.
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:01:58.720]   Since when?
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:01:59.480]   For the year.
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:00.400]   Yeah.
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:03.240]   Climate emergency for 2019.
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:06.400]   2013 was selfie.
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:07.240]   But Goblins.
[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:09.800]   So what is Goblins mode, Stacey?
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:10.760]   I've never heard of this.
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:12.200]   I just told you, man.
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:14.200]   What?
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:15.200]   You went listening.
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:18.200]   All you said was it was a TikTok thing.
[02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:19.320]   And then I kept talking.
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:20.720]   Now I know why you had a rough year.
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:22.720]   But after two words, you just stopped listening.
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:23.720]   I'm bored.
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:26.480]   I'm having a little champagne and Mando Cornette's honor.
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:27.880]   And I don't know.
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:32.520]   Did you say Goblins mode is like when you wake up at 2am and shuffle into the kitchen
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:36.480]   wearing nothing but a long teary shirt to wear, make a weird snack like melted cheese
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:37.480]   on saltines?
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:38.480]   Is that what you say?
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:39.480]   That's what you did not say.
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:40.480]   I didn't say that.
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:44.880]   I just said it's where you like you sit down and you eat weird stuff and you just like.
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:45.880]   Too much.
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:46.880]   Yeah.
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:47.880]   Yeah.
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:49.720]   And you do things in the name of self care or in the name of staying sane.
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:50.720]   It's not even self care.
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:51.720]   It's like bad for you.
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:52.720]   Self care.
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:56.200]   So you're you're a little goblin hanging out doing gross things.
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:03:01.280]   You did the you did the golem voice when you said gabron mode.
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:03.200]   So that's what you were thinking.
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:04.200]   It's my yoda voice.
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:05.200]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:06.200]   Yeah.
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:07.200]   Well, how does goblin.
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:08.200]   Thanks, man.
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:09.200]   Yeah.
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:10.200]   Anyway, my.
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:11.200]   I got wait.
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:13.000]   Golem is my precious.
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:14.000]   Yes.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.640]   My precious.
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:17.440]   I had never heard goblin mode.
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:22.040]   And apparently even once they see described it, I still hadn't heard it.
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:24.800]   So I live in goblin mode all the time.
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:27.360]   It's so like the whole life, right?
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:32.800]   And not honoring honoring the behavior as opposed to the word for it.
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:36.800]   This is so well, it's a lot of people talk about doing this.
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:37.800]   Doing goblin mode?
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:38.800]   Yeah.
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:44.320]   I mean, it's very much a tick tock thing and there's even like goblin core, you know,
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:47.680]   like norm core and contour and all the cores.
[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:52.640]   But yeah, it's it's very much a reaction to the pandemic and okay.
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:56.680]   So I can see, I mean, who hasn't?
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:57.680]   I mean, what was it?
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:01.080]   Oh, Liz Lemon and her night cheese working on the night cheese.
[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:03.880]   You know, and she would she would eat her night cheese.
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:05.560]   This is where I feel bad.
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:07.160]   I feel like we need.
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:08.160]   So disconnected.
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:14.280]   We need an academy false says to keep control of the language because what happens
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:21.080]   and this is what the academy for us as protects is you get trendy and Casper graph wall,
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:27.560]   who's the president of Oxford languages, said that this exactly this has been demonstrated.
[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:28.840]   He says it's a relief to acknowledge.
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:31.360]   We're not always the idealized curated selves.
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:35.240]   We are encouraged to present on our Instagram and tick tock feeds.
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:39.440]   Goblin mode resonates with all of us who are feeling a little overwhelmed at this point.
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:43.400]   This has been demonstrated by the dramatic rise.
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:46.480]   In fall of platforms like be real.
[02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:47.480]   See, this is a problem.
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:48.480]   You get too trendy.
[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:49.480]   Wait, don't be real.
[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:50.480]   Still a real thing.
[02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:53.320]   Is it a real deal still or is it like I still?
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:54.320]   I still use it.
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.320]   You do.
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:56.320]   You don't count.
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:58.120]   Maybe that's what he is.
[02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:00.480]   But I don't use it as a photography platform.
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:02.280]   No, that's the opposite.
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:03.280]   It's the opposite.
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:09.480]   Yeah, it's totally and it is a very, very, very, very, very small circle of folks there
[02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:11.920]   that I enjoy checking in with every day.
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:17.440]   It might be being too trendy and going through the fashion too much might be bad.
[02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:21.600]   But I think if you go with the Academy of Sciences, you swing the pendulum the other
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:22.920]   way way too far.
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:26.400]   You can say, "Luickend" or "sweater."
[02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:30.480]   Or "Laudie Netture" instead of "computer."
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:31.480]   Laudie Netture.
[02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:33.040]   Good luck.
[02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:35.440]   I still remember that and I was like, "What?"
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:36.440]   No.
[02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:39.280]   I wonder if that was the Academy of Sciences that made that happen.
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:40.280]   Probably.
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:42.960]   They just come up with stuff.
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:43.960]   I don't play.
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:45.720]   You have a beautiful language like French.
[02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:48.400]   You don't want to add words like "Luickend."
[02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:49.400]   That's terrible.
[02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:50.400]   Littie Churt.
[02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:51.400]   The big bag.
[02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:52.400]   Dad, you jogging.
[02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:55.880]   All the issues, what do you replace it with?
[02:05:55.880 --> 02:06:01.240]   And then if they come up with some long expressions, replace weekends and nobody's going to use
[02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:02.240]   that.
[02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:04.800]   Yeah, that's true.
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:08.000]   I stand with, came in third.
[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:11.680]   #IStandWith and Metaverse came in second.
[02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:14.240]   Metaverse just feels too commercial.
[02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:17.440]   Yeah, but it's been around since '92.
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:20.920]   Before Facebook grew, I agree.
[02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:21.920]   Yeah.
[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:22.920]   Yeah.
[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:27.560]   Facebook made it ruined it, sir, but Facebook definitely put it top of mind for normal folks.
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:30.040]   Yeah, that's why it was a word of the year.
[02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:33.280]   It's not because everyone suddenly rushed out and read Neil Stevenson's book.
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:34.280]   That's probably true.
[02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:35.280]   Yeah, that's probably true.
[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:36.280]   Gosh.
[02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:37.800]   What was that book called that we read?
[02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:38.800]   Terminal something?
[02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:39.800]   Terminal.
[02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:40.800]   Terminal shock was so good.
[02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:41.800]   Terminal shock was so good.
[02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:42.800]   Did you like it?
[02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:43.800]   Let me get a snow crash.
[02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:44.800]   Did you?
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:45.800]   Yeah, I hated it.
[02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:46.800]   I hated it.
[02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:47.800]   I hated it.
[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:48.800]   So much.
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:51.800]   So that, as a response, I had to hate a long way to a small angry planet.
[02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:52.800]   And now...
[02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:53.800]   You didn't even show up for the...
[02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:54.800]   You didn't show up.
[02:06:54.800 --> 02:06:55.800]   I couldn't be bothered.
[02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:56.800]   There was such a horrible...
[02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:57.800]   It's out.
[02:06:57.800 --> 02:06:58.800]   So now...
[02:06:58.800 --> 02:06:59.800]   Harsh.
[02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:03.520]   Now it's going to come down to the final, third and final match.
[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:05.600]   The book is Project Hail Mary.
[02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:07.280]   Who could not like Project Hail Mary?
[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:08.360]   It's such a good book.
[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:09.880]   I have some issues with it.
[02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:11.640]   And we'll talk about it on January.
[02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:12.600]   Oh, Tim's fighting words.
[02:07:12.600 --> 02:07:13.600]   January 12th.
[02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:14.600]   I read that.
[02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:15.600]   Love it.
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:16.600]   Did you love it?
[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:17.600]   Yeah, me too.
[02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:18.600]   I know.
[02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:19.600]   Come by our book club.
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:20.600]   You have to come to the book club, sir.
[02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:21.600]   Yeah, come to the book club.
[02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:22.600]   Yeah, I would love to.
[02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:23.600]   I actually listen to it.
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:25.000]   And I assume what Leo does as well.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.000]   Yeah.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:27.400]   Yeah, I don't read anything anymore.
[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:28.400]   I can't.
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:29.400]   I don't think you do.
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:30.400]   So you do audiobooks.
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:31.400]   Nice.
[02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:32.400]   I think that.
[02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:33.400]   Yeah.
[02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:36.080]   I don't know where I do it.
[02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:37.080]   What are you reading these days?
[02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:38.840]   What are you reading these days, man?
[02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:41.320]   Oh, let me see what I'm reading.
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:48.320]   I'm listening to a bunch of lectures, things like, you know, this company that used to
[02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:49.800]   be called the Teaching Company.
[02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:50.800]   Yeah.
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:51.800]   And it was called the Great Courses.
[02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:52.800]   Yeah, I have a lot of stuff.
[02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:53.800]   Yeah, I love that.
[02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:54.800]   I love that.
[02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:55.800]   Yeah.
[02:07:55.800 --> 02:07:56.800]   Yeah, I love them too.
[02:07:56.800 --> 02:07:59.960]   If only they would stop changing their name every two years.
[02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:06.200]   They have the best, and this is the one I only when I really listen to all the way
[02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:08.120]   through and loved.
[02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:12.440]   The best thing, best education in classical music.
[02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:17.320]   Let me see if I can find it because it really was really fantastic.
[02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:18.960]   But I have quite a few of those.
[02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:21.280]   There's a lot of Robert Greenberg.
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:22.280]   Is that the one?
[02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:23.800]   Yeah, I love Robert Greenberg.
[02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:26.480]   This one is exactly Robert Greenberg.
[02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:30.120]   I have to listen to and understand great music, third edition.
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:31.120]   Really good.
[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:35.080]   He plays the music and then you get in.
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:36.400]   It helps you understand it.
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:37.800]   I just really loved this.
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:38.800]   Yeah.
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:41.640]   He has a series on Mozart, which is great.
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:43.840]   Oh, I've listened to that.
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:44.840]   You see Berkeley.
[02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:47.120]   Oh, no, he's at San Francisco performances.
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:49.440]   Yeah, I love those great courses.
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:50.440]   I did.
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:54.960]   There's a John McWhorter that we talk about all the time, the guy who did.
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:55.960]   I like Mr. McWhorter.
[02:08:55.960 --> 02:09:00.440]   Yeah, he really did a couple of really good books.
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:02.560]   Talking back, talking black.
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:06.360]   The nine, was it the nine words?
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:08.360]   The naughty nine words.
[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:09.520]   Not even something like that.
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:11.720]   He also has a great podcast.
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:18.040]   So he's got a linguistics course, which I really enjoyed understanding linguistics on
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:19.040]   the great courses.
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:21.520]   I don't know how he got into a great courses ad.
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:22.880]   Is it time for another ad?
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:23.880]   It is.
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:24.880]   It's time to wrap it up.
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:27.760]   And go have a lawful waffle.
[02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:29.280]   Good news.
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:32.000]   The waffle is now set free.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.120]   It's legal again.
[02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:38.320]   Wouldn't that be terrible if we had like a waffle prohibition, Stacey?
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:42.760]   Like the government decided, you know, to make a constitutional amendment saying waffles
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:43.760]   are illegal.
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:45.920]   People have to have bathtub waffles.
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:47.320]   The whole.
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:52.160]   Actually bathtub waffles are delicious because you're in the bathtub eating waffles.
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:56.040]   But yes, if we had if we had like a whole.
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:57.040]   Respect your game.
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:09:58.040]   Respect your game.
[02:09:58.040 --> 02:10:02.280]   You see what happens if you're if you're clumsy and you you like the waffles fall.
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:06.680]   Yeah, I don't recommend eating that waffle, but you just fish it right out.
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:07.680]   Toss it out.
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:08.680]   That's the good thing about waffles.
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:13.000]   Unlike a pancake which might come apart, the waffles crust preserves its integrity even
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.200]   when immersed in water.
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:16.200]   I was a kid.
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:20.280]   I'd like to eat my cereal breakfast is my bath or a strange.
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:26.720]   So the inevitable happens one day and had cereals in my bathtub.
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:30.680]   So you were actually speaking with knowledge of the situation.
[02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:31.680]   It's good.
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:36.280]   If you'd been eating oatmeal, it would have been like a spa treatment because I recommend
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:37.280]   yours to go in your bath.
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:38.780]   Your maid votes there.
[02:10:38.780 --> 02:10:39.780]   That's really good.
[02:10:39.780 --> 02:10:44.720]   It's like a Vino only Cheerios instead.
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:45.720]   Our show today.
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:48.080]   Why do you find out how I got there?
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:51.960]   This has been a very interesting and not Nabisco.
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:54.240]   This episode of this week in Google brought to you by cash fly.
[02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:56.360]   I mean, literally brought to you by cash fly.
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:10:58.440]   Our content delivery network.
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:10:59.640]   The whole world is moving.
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:05.080]   A digital traffic patterns are spiking all over the place, which is great, but it's not
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:06.560]   so good for the viewers.
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:10.800]   They don't want to hang around for videos that buffer and shoppers hate carts.
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:11.800]   They'll abandon the money.
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:12.960]   Commerce sites that are slow.
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:14.800]   I've done it all the time.
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:16.040]   See it's spinning.
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:17.040]   You don't want me to buy this.
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:18.040]   Well, so what?
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:19.040]   There you go.
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:20.040]   I goodbye.
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:22.800]   Gamers leave bad reviews when latency is high.
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:24.600]   Well, yeah.
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:28.560]   Well with cash fly, you don't have to worry about those fluctuations.
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:30.400]   Consumers expect these days.
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:33.600]   These days we forget that we're on the internet.
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:37.640]   We just expect to flawless experience when engaging with content.
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:39.480]   Any device anytime anywhere in the world.
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:44.760]   Well, that's why you need cash fly a leader in CDN technology since 2002.
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:50.120]   They're in their 20th year now and they hold the track record for high performing ultra
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:54.880]   reliable content delivery over the last two decades.
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:12:01.560]   They pioneered the use of TCP any cast and innovation that CDNs continue to build on.
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:04.640]   Quality of experience is the metric you should be paying attention to when you're serving
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:09.680]   content simultaneously to a large and distributed audience on a global scale.
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:15.080]   But with cash fly, your delivery stack can be your secret weapon for quality of experience.
[02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:19.240]   You get ultra low latency video streaming that delivers video to more than a million
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:20.240]   concurrent users.
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:26.920]   You get lightning fast gaming, which delivers downloads faster with zero lag, glitches,
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:31.960]   no outages, mobile content optimization that offers automatic and simple image optimization.
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:35.240]   So your site loads faster on any device.
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:38.000]   Multiple CDNs give you redundancy and failover.
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:42.240]   You can actually intelligently balance your traffic across multiple providers, which gives
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:45.840]   you the shortest route and mitigates against performance glitches.
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:49.520]   Plus, you'll never pay for service overlap again.
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:53.240]   Get flexible month to month billing for as long as you need it and discounts for fixed
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:55.280]   terms once you're happy.
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:58.200]   Design your own contract when you switch to cash fly.
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:12:59.800]   Look at all the companies you use cash fly.
[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:04.720]   All the biggest, bestest companies, including I might add, Twit.
[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:08.480]   So how do we know this because we've been using cash fly for over 10 years?
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:10.440]   I think it's been more like 15 now.
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:12.200]   It's been a long time.
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:18.080]   And I wouldn't have it any other way with more than 3,500 clients in over 80 countries.
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:23.800]   Organizations like Twit consistently choose cash fly for scalability, reliability and
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:25.960]   unrivaled performance.
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:30.160]   Cash fly is the only CDN built for throughput delivering rich media content up to 10 times
[02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:35.440]   faster than traditional delivery methods and 30% faster than other major CDNs.

[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:48.480]   Thank you, cash fly, for supporting this week in Google.
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:51.440]   I did want to mention a club Twit.
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:55.120]   You have to be a club twit member to participate in Stacey's book club.
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:58.240]   Project Hail Mary the book on January 12.
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:02.880]   Tomorrow our dear Glenn Fleischman will be doing a fireside chat.
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:09.120]   He's just back from his trip around Eastern Europe and he has lots of tales to tell.
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:12.920]   9am you're going to do that interview tomorrow morning, yes?
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:13.920]   Yes, sir.
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:17.000]   How far am Pacific time?
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:22.920]   Of course the time zone shows in our Discord applicable to your time zone if you check
[02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:23.920]   it out there.
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:26.880]   Yeah, mine says 9am because I'm in Pacific time.
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:31.520]   Inside Twit with Lee Send Me January 19.
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:34.640]   We'll be talking about the situation at Twit.
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:38.000]   When to Dao's doing a fireside chat with you aunt on February 9.
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.520]   So some good ones.
[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:40.680]   Queen Code Monkey.
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:44.320]   Queen Code Monkey, most of all about Android.
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:48.800]   If you are not yet a member of club Twit, let me give you the elevator pitch.
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:53.520]   Seven bucks a month you get ad-free versions of all the shows, you get access to the Discord,
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:57.680]   you get the Twit Plus feed with shows you might not even get if you don't join the club
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:02.200]   like our hands on Macintosh show with micro sergeant hands on windows with ball throughout
[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:08.080]   the untitled Linux show with Jonathan Bennett, the Giz Fizz with Dicty Bartol.
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:10.760]   We get a lot of good stuff in there for seven bucks.
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:12.840]   I think it's a really worthwhile thing.
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:18.040]   And now cartoons by Manu Cornet.
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:23.440]   Just head on in to twit.tv/clubtwit and join today.
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:27.640]   We would love to have you.
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:29.160]   Do not you will not get Rick World.
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:30.160]   Don't worry.
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:33.080]   Pay no attention to that.
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:36.080]   And has in response to your waffle bath.
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:37.440]   He says a shower beer.
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:39.440]   You don't dare.
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:42.720]   You have not lived until you had a beer too.
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:46.640]   I guess after a ball game, maybe yeah, that would make sense.
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:52.440]   But does that mean you drink in the shower right now?
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:54.840]   With the beer.
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:56.840]   No, you drink with the beer.
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:00.440]   Actually beer is really good for your hair.
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:02.440]   Several hair masks.
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:05.240]   These are in your hair.
[02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:07.800]   And you know, you smell so good.
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:09.320]   You wash it out afterwards.
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:12.400]   You create a hair mask using beer.
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:17.200]   It's your heart out of your adolescence.
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:19.800]   I did have an issue.
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:22.880]   You put in a story and we've talked about this before.
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:24.080]   It's not a democracy.
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:25.440]   I was tempted though.
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:31.560]   Students rebel against heat seeking crotch monitor surveillance devices.
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:32.560]   But then I didn't want to really.
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:34.960]   I really want to click the link.
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:36.960]   So go ahead.
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:37.960]   It's a hack a day.
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:38.960]   It's a hack a day story.
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:40.600]   How bad could it be?
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:47.120]   Well, we've talked about surveillance in the past, especially in schools with having cameras
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:48.120]   up.
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:50.480]   And there's always been an argument about the kids being watched.
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:51.480]   Oh yeah.
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:53.120]   And the invasion of privacy.
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:54.120]   Yeah.
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:17:00.160]   But at the same time, I could see a use for it, especially with all of these ridiculous
[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:02.040]   mass shootings happening.
[02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:05.600]   We could reference and see where people are and things like that.
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:08.840]   Ooh, I have big opinions and thoughts on that and social justice.
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:11.440]   But we don't need to talk about that because waffles.
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:12.440]   True.
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:13.440]   Got it.
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:16.920]   I wasn't going to bring up this story.
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:17.920]   But then there's this story.
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:18.920]   But you did.
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:20.480]   You did bring it up.
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:22.600]   This story, they're not using cameras.
[02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:25.720]   They're using these tiny little sensors on the desk.
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:28.000]   That points at the sensors.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000]   The crotch.
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:30.920]   Well, that's just because that's what's under the desk.
[02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:33.640]   It could point at something else, but it's just what's there.
[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:34.640]   Yeah.
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:36.120]   They're PIR sensors.
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:37.120]   They're not really.
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:38.120]   I mean, it's just more.
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:40.000]   That's like heat seeking.
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.000]   This headline.
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:42.000]   It's a little.
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:43.000]   It's not heat seeking.
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.280]   It's just saying there's a warm body here.
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:47.920]   Although we've also talked about the story.
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:49.600]   I really use the boxing glove now.
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:51.600]   I didn't bring it up.
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:53.280]   It was that story.
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:54.280]   Punch him.
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:55.280]   Punch him.
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:57.080]   I didn't know.
[02:17:57.080 --> 02:17:58.920]   We brought this up when it happened.
[02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:01.000]   Corey Doctorow wrote about it.
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.120]   He was one of the people who brought it up.
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:04.920]   It was universities.
[02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:06.640]   They deployed this.
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:11.440]   The irony was they deployed it against a group of students, graduate students, who wrote
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:14.560]   about invasions of pirate privacy and digital surveillance.
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:18.000]   So when they found these things, they were like WTF.
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.000]   Oops.
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.000]   Okay.
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.000]   Moving right along.
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:22.000]   You're a thing of the week.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.000]   You're a thing of the week.
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000]   Yes.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.000]   Show your toy.
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:26.640]   I have a number.
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:28.140]   No.
[02:18:28.140 --> 02:18:29.140]   You have a number.
[02:18:29.140 --> 02:18:31.640]   Oh, he's going to join right in.
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:32.640]   Forget this.
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:34.560]   I just want to give you a big old hug.
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:35.560]   That's so awesome.
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:37.560]   I just bring in man who everywhere.
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:38.960]   He's got a number and everything.
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:39.960]   Go ahead, Stacy.
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:40.960]   Thing of the week first.
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:42.160]   It's a hub.
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:43.160]   What is it?
[02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:46.880]   I thought it was a paddle.
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:47.880]   What is it?
[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:48.880]   Yeah.
[02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:49.880]   All right.
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:54.320]   This is like I literally have four little white hubs, but this one is round and it's
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:55.320]   made by Ikea.
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:56.320]   Oh, I like Ikea.
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:57.320]   Oh, I like Ikea.
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:18:58.320]   Didi Hira.
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:18:59.320]   Didi Hira.
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:01.480]   What is the bitty hira, huh?
[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:03.600]   Dear Reheara.
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:06.560]   It looks like Deregira.
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:07.560]   Deregira.
[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:09.040]   It looks like Deregira.
[02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:11.040]   But if you were Swedish, you say Deregira.
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:12.040]   Deregira.
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:13.040]   Where's the bitty along those lines?
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:14.800]   It's a Deregira hub for smart products.
[02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:15.800]   There you go.
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:17.400]   For smart products.
[02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:18.880]   This is from Ikea.
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:23.520]   And this replaces their Trad-free gateway.
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:28.720]   You know, it's so funny because I'm never Ikea started doing hue lights and I thought,
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:29.720]   well, that's weird.
[02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:32.520]   They do a lot of home automation stuff, don't they?
[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:34.400]   They have a whole home automation business.
[02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:39.760]   And what's interesting about it is they really take, I guess, the Ikea approach to it.
[02:19:39.760 --> 02:19:42.520]   So what's interesting to me is they have lights.
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:44.000]   They have air purifiers.
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:45.240]   They have smart plugs.
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:47.000]   They have blinds.
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.560]   They have this hub to control it.
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:52.800]   And in a few weeks, or actually, I'm sorry, down a few weeks, at some point in the next
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:55.880]   few months, it will be updated to matter, but it will not be a controller.
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:19:56.800]   It will be a bridge.
[02:19:56.800 --> 02:20:00.800]   So that means you'll be able to control.
[02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:05.520]   So we're able to tell your Ikea device using matter what those Ikea devices to do, but
[02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:08.920]   you won't be able to control the Ikea light bulbs, for example, directly.
[02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:10.560]   Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
[02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:13.680]   Because I still get confused on the IoT protocols.
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:18.080]   Well, I think it's probably a good thing because what you want is some central controller
[02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:20.160]   control, all sorts of stuff.
[02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:23.040]   So we'll talk about this.
[02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:24.040]   You know what?
[02:20:24.040 --> 02:20:25.040]   Talk to me.
[02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:27.440]   We should do Stacey Talks about matter at some point.
[02:20:27.440 --> 02:20:29.040]   I would love next week.
[02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:30.040]   Are you going to be here next week?
[02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:35.640]   No, we're going to do it in like six months when we have actually played with matter.
[02:20:35.640 --> 02:20:38.160]   Because right now, it's all coming out.
[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:39.560]   It's all coming out.
[02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:40.560]   Okay.
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:43.600]   I mean, we could talk about like what we think is going to happen, but you know how I hate
[02:20:43.600 --> 02:20:44.600]   that.
[02:20:44.600 --> 02:20:45.600]   I'm like speculation.
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:46.600]   Speculation.
[02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:51.680]   Anyway, this hub, 6999, it replaces trot-free.
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:56.560]   If you have the old trot-free system, this, you can update your trot-free stuff right
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:21:00.360]   to this very easily within the new app, not even opening the old app.
[02:21:00.360 --> 02:21:02.400]   So that's nice.
[02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:05.120]   It works fine.
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:06.120]   I don't know what to say.
[02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:07.480]   I've got so many freaking hubs now.
[02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:08.480]   I don't even care.
[02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:13.960]   But if you like the, I don't think the IKEA home interface is all that because I kind
[02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:15.760]   of feel like I'm a power user now.
[02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:19.320]   But if you're like just a normal human being, this actually is kind of a nice interface
[02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:23.560]   with you and they're going to add more features over time.
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:24.560]   So I don't know.
[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:25.920]   Do you all have questions about it?
[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:26.920]   No.
[02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:27.920]   Cool.
[02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:29.440]   You answered mine.
[02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:32.840]   6999, IKEA.
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:37.480]   And do you have to use IKEA stuff with it or is it a standard?
[02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:41.120]   You do have to use the IKEA blinds.
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:43.320]   It's designed to control IKEA stuff.
[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:44.320]   IKEA stuff.
[02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:46.640]   It does support Zigbee.
[02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:53.040]   So if you have Zigbee bulbs, like you can add those if it's the right version of Zigbee.
[02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:54.040]   So yeah.
[02:21:54.040 --> 02:21:59.720]   This is why home automation is such a nightmare matters going to again, six months for now.
[02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:00.720]   Let's talk six months.
[02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:03.320]   We're going to do a matter thing and see if it's succeeded.
[02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:04.320]   The D.R.I.
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:06.080]   Hera is matter compatible.
[02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:08.200]   Yes, it's matter compatible.
[02:22:08.200 --> 02:22:13.920]   But again, it will be a bridge, not a controller, not a controller.
[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:14.920]   So it's a link.
[02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:16.920]   It's not something that can actually be a brain.
[02:22:16.920 --> 02:22:17.920]   How's that?
[02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:20.200]   Does it do goblin mode?
[02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:22.120]   And it lives in goblin mode.
[02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:23.120]   All right.
[02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:27.400]   It's about eating cheese.
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:30.000]   Mano has a number, but it's a little different kind of number.
[02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:31.520]   Mano, what do you got?
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:35.040]   Yeah, it's not really a number that's in the news, so I don't know if it counts.
[02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:41.920]   But the guess is I'm going to ask you how many elements as in, you know, elements like
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:48.360]   carbon or oxygen, like a table, how many elements do you think are in an iPhone or a
[02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:49.360]   modern iPhone?
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:51.080]   Oh, what an interesting question.
[02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:52.080]   Wow.
[02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:56.120]   There's 108 elements in the table of elements, something like that, 100 something.
[02:22:56.120 --> 02:22:57.880]   They keep adding you.
[02:22:57.880 --> 02:22:58.880]   There might be more.
[02:22:58.880 --> 02:22:59.880]   Yeah.
[02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:00.880]   They're not big.
[02:23:00.880 --> 02:23:01.880]   They're just, thank you.
[02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:03.640]   It was like, they fall apart.
[02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:04.640]   Yeah.
[02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:06.040]   They last like half an hour.
[02:23:06.040 --> 02:23:08.880]   So we know there's, for instance, aluminum.
[02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:14.880]   We know there's glasses silicone or silicon rather.
[02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:15.880]   There's going to be gold.
[02:23:15.880 --> 02:23:16.880]   There's copper.
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:17.880]   See you.
[02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:18.880]   Oh my God.
[02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:19.880]   We're just at 27.
[02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:22.880]   Does plastic is plastic in the element, man?
[02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:23.880]   Oh, it's an oil.
[02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:24.880]   It's a petroker.
[02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:25.880]   So carbon.
[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:26.880]   Leo, what do you think?
[02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:29.880]   So you stay see you said 27?
[02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:32.880]   Yeah, there's a lot of weird stuff in electronics.
[02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:34.880]   You've been listening to man.
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:35.880]   There's mercury.
[02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:36.880]   Yeah.
[02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:37.880]   Mercury.
[02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:38.880]   I forgot about mercury.
[02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:39.880]   Lead.
[02:23:39.880 --> 02:23:40.880]   PB.
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:41.880]   Okay, maybe not.
[02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:42.880]   Make it 13.
[02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:43.880]   13.
[02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:44.880]   13.
[02:23:44.880 --> 02:23:45.880]   Yeah.
[02:23:45.880 --> 02:23:51.880]   I think 18.
[02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:52.880]   Okay.
[02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:56.880]   The number comes from a physics lecture from a couple of years ago.
[02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:58.880]   So I might be ignored by now.
[02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:00.880]   I love you, man.
[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:01.880]   63.
[02:24:01.880 --> 02:24:02.880]   Wow.
[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:05.880]   Like half the table of elements.
[02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:06.880]   Wow.
[02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:07.880]   That's fascinating.
[02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:09.880]   That is amazing.
[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:10.880]   Wow.
[02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:14.880]   And actually here's a more recent one.
[02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:18.880]   The wise geek that come from November 30th.
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:22.880]   It says 75 of the 118 elements.
[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:24.880]   Alumens is most dominant.
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:26.880]   Comprising 24%.
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:31.880]   But there are as many as 118 elements.
[02:24:31.880 --> 02:24:33.880]   So it has gone up.
[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:34.880]   Wow.
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:38.880]   Itrium, Turbium, Uropium, Gandalinium.
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:40.880]   Those are just the screen.
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:41.880]   Oh, yeah.
[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:43.880]   Well, because like material science is what makes
[02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:47.880]   like Gorilla Glass possible, if you think about it.
[02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:49.880]   Gold, tin, and tantalum.
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:54.880]   We just talked about a new infrared sensor, for example, and the reason why it's so much
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:58.880]   more powerful than other IR sensors is it's because it's built on Antimony.
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:00.880]   And I'm like, holy cow.
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:01.880]   All right, sure.
[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:04.880]   That's really, that's a great number.
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:05.880]   Thank you, Anna.
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:06.880]   Good number.
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:12.880]   The story on antimony is that it was discovered because it killed a bunch of monks who were
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:14.880]   doing research on it.
[02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:18.880]   And they discovered it so they called it the Antimony.
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:19.880]   Oh, my God.
[02:25:19.880 --> 02:25:20.880]   That's amazing.
[02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:21.880]   Oh.
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:25.880]   Wait, do you have a, do you have the periodic table of the elements flashcards too?
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:28.880]   I do not, but that sounds interesting.
[02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:31.880]   There's a great, it's a good gift idea for, it's beautiful.
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:32.880]   Hold on.
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:34.880]   I'm going to tell you all because Stacey loves gifts ideas.
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:36.880]   Do you all really want to know this properly?
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:37.880]   Yeah, no, that'd be good.
[02:25:37.880 --> 02:25:38.880]   I do.
[02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:39.880]   Yeah.
[02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:42.880]   And also writing comics about like physics, popularization.
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:43.880]   So that's why I'm here.
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:44.880]   I feel in a random.
[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:45.880]   You should get out of this.
[02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:46.880]   Oh my God.
[02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:47.880]   Holding business.
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:48.880]   There's no future in that.
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:49.880]   Be a cartoonist.
[02:25:49.880 --> 02:25:50.880]   You're really good.
[02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:51.880]   I think this is.
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:52.880]   Okay.
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:53.880]   Okay.
[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:54.880]   Oh, sorry.
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:56.880]   I don't know if I didn't have any bills to pay.
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:25:58.880]   Well, those, those can be in pain.
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:00.880]   So do you get these on Amazon?
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:05.880]   You can buy them on Amazon in the book is called The Elements.
[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:07.880]   And then if you look up the book.
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:08.880]   I love that book.
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:09.880]   That is a fantastic book.
[02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:11.880]   So they make flashcards.
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:15.880]   This is one of the first iPad apps because it was so big and beautiful.
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:22.880]   And this is the $25, $26 for the Elements flashcards.
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:24.880]   Do you buy them?
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:25.880]   Yeah.
[02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:26.880]   Yeah.
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:27.880]   Yeah.
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:28.880]   We have that book and we have something else.
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:29.880]   But the cards are super fun.
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:34.880]   And my child, when they were doing chemistry, we had an excuse to buy them.
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:36.880]   We also, oh, yeah, we have molecules.
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:37.880]   And that was super fun too.
[02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:38.880]   Yeah.
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:39.880]   Theater.
[02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:40.880]   We did not ever graduate.
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:42.880]   No, never graduate.
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:45.880]   Thank you.
[02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:50.880]   Ann Pruitt, what's your pick of the week?
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:53.880]   First one, this one was sent to me on Twitter.
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:54.880]   I can't remember who it was.
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:57.880]   It sent it, but I apologize for not remembering.
[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:00.880]   And it says, have I been trained regarding AI?
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:02.880]   You know, we've been talking about stable diffusion.
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:10.880]   And how those systems are trained based on what's seen out there online.
[02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:16.880]   And with this service, you can put in a URL to an image or upload an image to see if it
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:19.880]   had been used allegedly for training.
[02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:27.880]   And I found it interesting because some of my prints that I've had in the past showed up
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:30.880]   in some of the stuff that was being used to train.
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:34.880]   So when you go to the website, have I been trained.com, you put in whatever it is you
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:41.880]   want to search for, and it'll just give you a dump of everything that was used to train
[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:43.880]   the AI that's out there.
[02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:46.880]   I don't know if it's particularly stable diffusion.
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:53.880]   And like if you use that link that I put online, 111, you can scroll down and you'll see a
[02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:55.880]   lot of the nature scenes and stuff like that.
[02:27:55.880 --> 02:28:00.880]   And I saw at least two of the images that I had out there.
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:01.880]   Excuse me.
[02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:03.880]   That's what I put in to see if it would find it.
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:09.880]   It didn't find that one, but what it did find was some of my other images that I used to
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:11.880]   have out there available for print.
[02:28:11.880 --> 02:28:12.880]   Yeah.
[02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:13.880]   Well, these are in public, right?
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:15.880]   I mean, I can see it.
[02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:16.880]   Yeah.
[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:21.880]   They just thought it was just everything that every webpage ever scraped them all.
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:27.480]   And they do give you an option to put in some type of opt out, but I just thought it was
[02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:31.600]   fascinating to see the service out there, especially when you're dealing with people's
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:32.600]   faces.
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:36.680]   I uploaded a headshot of myself just to see what would happen.
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:40.760]   Of course, nobody's really going to use me, but it was neat to see how it put up other
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:45.560]   black man, bald head, and certain lighting and all of that stuff.
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:47.680]   It was pretty cool.
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:50.400]   And next, I want to give a shout out to Miss Sheila Johnson.
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:55.680]   She's the first black female billionaire here recently.
[02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:59.680]   She co-founded BET way back in the day.
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:00.680]   Oh, yeah.
[02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:01.680]   Yeah.
[02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:06.000]   But she's also a part owner in the major teams there in DC.
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:15.280]   You have the caps for the NHL, the mystics for the WNBA, as well as the men's NBA basketball
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:16.280]   team over there.
[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:21.640]   She's crossed that threshold of a billion dollars net worth, and just want to give her
[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:23.320]   flowers.
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:25.640]   And she's not buying Twitter.
[02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:27.640]   She's not.
[02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:31.520]   Excuse that.
[02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:34.480]   And don't forget Ants Prince, AntPruit.com/Prince.
[02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:35.480]   Yes.
[02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:39.720]   So many beautiful images, including the whiskey river image we just showed.
[02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:41.400]   Just some great stuff.
[02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:42.400]   Yeah.
[02:29:42.400 --> 02:29:45.560]   And of course, Ant underscore Pruitt on Instagram and Twitter.
[02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:46.560]   Yep.
[02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:49.640]   Stacey is gigastacey on Twitter.
[02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:58.720]   I should save this really for Jeff's return because you know how he loves his blab opera.
[02:29:58.720 --> 02:29:59.720]   He loves...
[02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:00.720]   Oh, yeah.
[02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:01.720]   I saw you.
[02:30:01.720 --> 02:30:05.120]   He loves the blab opera and the blab opera is back, baby.
[02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:06.120]   Yeah.
[02:30:06.120 --> 02:30:07.120]   Actually, I'll save it.
[02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:08.120]   Should I save it?
[02:30:08.120 --> 02:30:09.120]   I'll save it.
[02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:10.800]   I'll tell you what, I'll do...
[02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:13.440]   I'll save one and I'll do the Beethoven one.
[02:30:13.440 --> 02:30:16.480]   I've already showed this is kind of cool.
[02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:20.760]   It says Google's Arts and Culture.
[02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:23.760]   It says rhythms are everywhere.
[02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:25.280]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:30.120]   So tap several times in your space bar to create a rhythm.
[02:30:30.120 --> 02:30:33.280]   You'll have four seconds to record your beats.
[02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:40.880]   And then it will find a Beethoven, a work of Beethoven that will match your rhythm.
[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:45.880]   So let's see.
[02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:49.720]   That's a crazy rhythm.
[02:30:49.720 --> 02:30:53.040]   Wow, that's pretty good.
[02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:56.000]   That's the Sonata number 12, an A-flat major.
[02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.560]   Opus 26.
[02:30:58.560 --> 02:31:00.440]   Two Scared So Allegro Motto.
[02:31:00.440 --> 02:31:03.680]   So you can get the whole thing if you want to.
[02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:04.680]   Wow.
[02:31:04.680 --> 02:31:05.680]   That's kind of amazing, huh?
[02:31:05.680 --> 02:31:07.520]   Shall I do a new rhythm?
[02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:08.520]   Let's do...
[02:31:08.520 --> 02:31:09.520]   Listen to Stacey typing.
[02:31:09.520 --> 02:31:10.520]   This is the Stacey rhythm.
[02:31:10.520 --> 02:31:19.160]   There is no Sonata that matches the Stacey rhythm.
[02:31:19.160 --> 02:31:20.640]   Oh, yes, there is.
[02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:21.640]   Wait a minute.
[02:31:21.640 --> 02:31:22.640]   Play it.
[02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:23.640]   It's over?
[02:31:23.640 --> 02:31:24.640]   Okay, here we go.
[02:31:24.640 --> 02:31:27.480]   The whole thing, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:27.480 --> 02:31:29.400]   That would be a punt.
[02:31:29.400 --> 02:31:31.680]   This is Stacey typing, Sonata.
[02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:32.920]   That fits.
[02:31:32.920 --> 02:31:33.920]   That's nice.
[02:31:33.920 --> 02:31:37.480]   Isn't that great if you like Beethoven?
[02:31:37.480 --> 02:31:38.480]   That's nice.
[02:31:38.480 --> 02:31:40.640]   And you'll have piano, Sonata's.
[02:31:40.640 --> 02:31:44.960]   You can tap out any rhythm and you will get a Sonata.
[02:31:44.960 --> 02:31:50.040]   Now we'll save the blob opera for the blobs or back, baby, for next week.
[02:31:50.040 --> 02:31:53.200]   Jeff Jarvis will return.
[02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:57.800]   Mr. Manu Cornette, so great to have you on.
[02:31:57.800 --> 02:32:01.520]   Your website, m-a-dot-n-u, perfect.
[02:32:01.520 --> 02:32:03.000]   Nice and short.
[02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.800]   Do you sell the book, GUMIX?
[02:32:04.800 --> 02:32:05.800]   Can I buy that somewhere?
[02:32:05.800 --> 02:32:07.560]   It's on Amazon.
[02:32:07.560 --> 02:32:08.400]   Yes, Amazon.
[02:32:08.400 --> 02:32:09.400]   Two volumes.
[02:32:09.400 --> 02:32:14.840]   So if you want to pick one, the later one is probably more critical.
[02:32:14.840 --> 02:32:15.920]   Get them both.
[02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:16.920]   Get them both.
[02:32:16.920 --> 02:32:18.560]   Get them both.
[02:32:18.560 --> 02:32:19.560]   Love it.
[02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:22.880]   Satya Nadella says, "Impossible to ignore."
[02:32:22.880 --> 02:32:26.920]   Did you really say that?
[02:32:26.920 --> 02:32:27.920]   He did.
[02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:30.560]   He used the Orchards thing.
[02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:36.760]   He mentioned it on the first page of his book about wanting to change the culture.
[02:32:36.760 --> 02:32:38.760]   You're kidding.
[02:32:38.760 --> 02:32:39.920]   Wow.
[02:32:39.920 --> 02:32:42.280]   Well I have my very own copy.
[02:32:42.280 --> 02:32:43.280]   You'll find it.
[02:32:43.280 --> 02:32:44.280]   Keep going.
[02:32:44.280 --> 02:32:45.280]   It's there somewhere.
[02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:46.280]   There it is.
[02:32:46.280 --> 02:32:49.720]   I have my very own copy and I've cherished this for 10 years and I'm so glad to meet
[02:32:49.720 --> 02:32:50.720]   the guy who made it.
[02:32:50.720 --> 02:32:52.120]   Thank you, Manu, for joining us.
[02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:53.120]   I really--
[02:32:53.120 --> 02:32:56.160]   You know how engineers are measured on how much impact did you?
[02:32:56.160 --> 02:33:01.480]   So my boss at Google said I had a lot of impact but just on the wrong company.
[02:33:01.480 --> 02:33:06.480]   Yeah, unfortunately it wasn't code.
[02:33:06.480 --> 02:33:08.080]   We couldn't monetize it.
[02:33:08.080 --> 02:33:09.080]   That's the problem.
[02:33:09.080 --> 02:33:10.080]   That's all.
[02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:11.080]   They just couldn't monetize it.
[02:33:11.080 --> 02:33:12.080]   Really nice--
[02:33:12.080 --> 02:33:13.840]   They could monetize it if they sold cartoons.
[02:33:13.840 --> 02:33:15.760]   Yeah, you know, maybe they should.
[02:33:15.760 --> 02:33:18.200]   It might be better than some of the other things they did.
[02:33:18.200 --> 02:33:19.200]   Like possibly.
[02:33:19.200 --> 02:33:23.760]   Do you think you would go back to work at Google, Manu?
[02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:24.760]   Undecided.
[02:33:24.760 --> 02:33:25.760]   Yeah.
[02:33:25.760 --> 02:33:28.440]   Probably not but we never know.
[02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:33.120]   Yeah, this is a chance to sit back, reflect, enjoy the holidays.
[02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:34.560]   Maybe a startup.
[02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:38.000]   Watch the dumpster fire over a former place of employ.
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.200]   Must be with some sadness.
[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:42.520]   Not only you watch but comments with drawings.
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:43.800]   I mean, what's a fun doing that.
[02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:45.640]   That's a good outlet, isn't it?
[02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:50.160]   And those Twitter comics are all online at Twitch.
[02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:51.160]   What is it?
[02:33:51.160 --> 02:33:52.160]   Tootoons?
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:54.240]   Yes, and all the Google ones are also online.
[02:33:54.240 --> 02:33:58.840]   So I'm not really good job at selling my book but you can sell.
[02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:00.640]   You can get all of them for free online.
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:02.400]   Oh, buy the freaking book.
[02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:04.040]   I'm not going to tell you the URL for that.
[02:34:04.040 --> 02:34:08.120]   Maybe when he does a book for Twitter now, I will stop mentioning it.
[02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:10.120]   But toutoons.com.
[02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:15.280]   T-W-I-T-T-O-N-S.com and they're all great.
[02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:20.920]   They're all very funny and sadly very topical.
[02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:21.920]   Thank you for Mr. Manu.
[02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:22.920]   Sadly.
[02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:24.560]   Mr. Manu.
[02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:26.080]   Say it with me.
[02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:27.920]   Buy my book.
[02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:29.560]   Buy my book.
[02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:31.360]   There you go.
[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:32.360]   Say that.
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:33.360]   You can't do it.
[02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:35.440]   -I can say that. -I can say that.
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:36.440]   I can say that.
[02:34:36.440 --> 02:34:37.520]   Mr. Website for free.
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:38.920]   He's open source, man.
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:40.720]   That's the open source guy.
[02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:43.840]   Get the comic that made Elon fire him.
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:44.840]   How about that?
[02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:46.360]   How about that, huh?
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:47.360]   You break it.
[02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:48.880]   You buy it, Elon.
[02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:49.880]   Smash.
[02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:52.160]   Thank you, Manu.
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:53.160]   Thank you Stacey Higginbotham.
[02:34:53.160 --> 02:34:54.640]   So great to see you.
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:57.920]   Stacey is at StaceyAnIOT.com.
[02:34:57.920 --> 02:35:00.580]   Her podcast with Kevin Tofol is the IoT podcast.
[02:35:00.580 --> 02:35:02.920]   You can get that there.
[02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:05.280]   Please come back and join us next week.
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:06.280]   Please.
[02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:07.280]   Please.
[02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:08.360]   Are you telling me I'll be here?
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:09.360]   Yes.
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:10.360]   Jeff Jarvis will be here.
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:11.360]   I'll be there.
[02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:12.360]   So we'll end up through it.
[02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:16.560]   Twit.tv/hop for hands on photography, which you got coming up on hands on photography
[02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:18.280]   this week.
[02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:21.000]   This week I got my hands on the Canon R7.
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.760]   Oh, I had a brief amount of time to play with it.
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:26.400]   So I did my very best.
[02:35:26.400 --> 02:35:28.400]   We're getting some images and video on.
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:29.720]   I'll share my thoughts.
[02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:31.400]   I can't wait.
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:32.400]   Good.
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:35.040]   That's a very interesting camera.
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:36.200]   Thank you everybody for joining us.

[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:02.200]   I did it.
[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:03.200]   We got him.
[02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:04.200]   I did it.
[02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:05.200]   Twit.tv.
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:07.600]   We're not on Twitter.

[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:11.640]   Twit.tv/twig.
