[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.880]   and let the party begin.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.880]   Even Jeff Jarvis is wearing a silly hat.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.400]   I can snap his hat like that.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.120]   That hurt.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.240]   I'm going to take that off now, Jeff, just so you can breathe.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.120]   Also joining us.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.640]   OK, so Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.000]   He's from Boston.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.520]   But oh, and look, that's very nice of you.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.240]   Matt cuts his also here.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.720]   He's got his special hat on.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.080]   I don't know what that is.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.800]   Looks like a Cornhorn shirt.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.000]   Oh, OK, that's good.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.240]   No, it's actually a devil's--
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.920]   It's a unicorn horn.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.920]   Devil horn.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.520]   It's a unicorn horn.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.040]   There you go.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.040]   Perfect.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.040]   There you go.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.240]   You are a mythological, Matt.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.600]   Yes.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.800]   He fights the Google spam.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.240]   And has been on the show many times before.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.240]   Of course, Gina Trapani, who is the queen of the show
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.320]   and has her fez.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.360]   And she is wearing it now very happily.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.200]   Hello, everybody.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.520]   And thanks to Eileen, our producer,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.320]   we have Chipotle for all.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.000]   So I'm just going to--
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.960]   Great.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.720]   Aren't you happy?
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.000]   I wish I could just push this right down the food tube to you.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.480]   This is--
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.800]   Wasn't that the food tube yet?
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.280]   What?
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.560]   What's that?
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.720]   Gina, you're the programmer.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.280]   You're supposed to write it.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.640]   I don't know.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.000]   It's a hard way to--
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.920]   Why can't we push burritos over the wire?
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.080]   Now, I have to ask a question of the Chipotle experts.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.880]   So I believe this is what they call a burrito bowl.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.680]   Do you open it this way or that way?
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.280]   Oh.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.960]   Oh.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.480]   That way.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.480]   That's the idea.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.320]   You have foil on top.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.880]   It's now a tossed burrito.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.880]   Oh.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.080]   It's the pineapple upside down burrito.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.360]   Well, I mean, that's only to make a question.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.760]   The where are the bean juice?
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.040]   It's going to get all over.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.320]   It's going to be the guacamole.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.600]   No, the guacamole is in a separate vial.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.320]   Oh, good.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.280]   That's good.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.160]   And I--
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.560]   I shouldn't be eating this because, frankly, they
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.760]   don't advertise on this show.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.080]   Oh, they don't.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.240]   Real reason for us to support them in any way, shape or--
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.360]   I went through a competitive burrito place tonight.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.400]   Thank you.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.160]   Competitive burrito place are us.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.040]   So today, the 100th episode--
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.040]   you know, I don't usually celebrate 100s
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.120]   because, frankly, this show is going to go to the thousands.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.680]   We know that.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.360]   Of course, none of us will be here for it,
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.440]   except maybe the young Gina Trapani.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   The kid.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.120]   You call it.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.320]   I think we only have to do 99 more sets
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.800]   of 100 before I hit my 10,000 hours,
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   and I'm actually good at it.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.880]   Ah, that's good.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.560]   Well, you know, Gina wrote a great article.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.560]   I was just very flattered that you would even do that.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.080]   Well, considering I had no idea what I was doing
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.360]   when we started this, I had to write up a little something.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.640]   I really learned a lot during the show.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.760]   And I so appreciate Leo, you having me inviting me
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.000]   into the Twit family and giving me
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   a chance to blather live on screen, which no one else
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.440]   has done before.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.280]   It was a big risk.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.120]   I really appreciate it.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.480]   I've learned so much from both of you.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.320]   I was, you know, to be honest, when we talked about doing
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.280]   this show, there were only--
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.160]   it started, frankly, with how could we do a show with Gina?
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.200]   What could we do that would get Gina to be on our network?
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.960]   And then I actually was--
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.320]   I don't know.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.600]   Was it just Gina or might have been,
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.080]   what could we do to get Gina and Jeff together on our network?
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.560]   Because I wanted both of you.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.640]   So let's be honest here, really.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.600]   It is my great privilege to have you two on.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.280]   I want to say the both of you.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.640]   But to have Gina, Trapani, write an article on this,
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.600]   is smarterwhere.org.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   Lessons from 99 weeks of Twig.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.760]   And I agree with all of these.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.440]   Actually, I'm kind of glad you codified these,
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.000]   because I knew them.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.360]   Well, it's second nature to you, Leo.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.920]   You've been doing it for so long that you don't even
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.680]   realize how good you are.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.680]   No, that's not true.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.800]   What a great setup you have.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.160]   But you say things like a live show is a better show.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.240]   You're right.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.080]   Definitely.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.800]   And I don't know.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.880]   I didn't remember you accidentally saying blow job,
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.360]   but it is more fun, isn't it?
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.160]   It's really fun.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.320]   And thanks to all the people who are in the chat room who
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.720]   come and talk to us while we talk.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.160]   It's really cool to have an audience.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.680]   I think that's actually the challenge
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.240]   that I want to take on in the new studio.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.200]   By the way, wait until you see it, where we've just started
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.720]   moving stuff in, and it's amazing.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.000]   I saw your picture that you posted it in Sarah,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.960]   but retweeted it.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.120]   It looks amazing.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.040]   I mean, I'm kind of blown away at this point.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.800]   I didn't expect this.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.520]   But one of the things that I really want to focus on
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.880]   is how to get live interaction upgraded.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.680]   Because we have this great chat room, and it's wonderful.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.560]   But I'd love to have more interaction.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.520]   So that's one of the things I really want to deal with.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.560]   And we actually have some ideas.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.160]   One thing I've always wanted to try to--
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.560]   first, I want to say something too.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.120]   I like Gina.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.920]   I want to say thank you to both of you
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.280]   for including me and my long-winded
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.920]   bladder in on the show.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.800]   I cannot tell you.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.880]   I'm a faker.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.240]   I'm a poser.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.640]   I'm here by chance.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.040]   I am so-- no, no, no, no.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.840]   It's true.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.120]   I don't know.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.520]   Crap.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.160]   You guys actually know stuff.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.000]   But I absolutely love being here.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.520]   And I tell people all the time that not only
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.480]   is Gina incredibly generous and brilliant and wonderful.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.960]   But the great thing about you, Leo,
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.800]   is that you have the happy broadcast voice,
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.240]   but you are as nice as your voice.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.160]   And that says a lot.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.000]   And I can't tell you folks out there
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.280]   that the privilege it is to be with these guys each week.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.880]   It really, truly is the highlight of my week.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.680]   I loved doing it.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.600]   It killed me down to be here last week.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.480]   And just beating around Leo and watching Leo is amazing.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.880]   The best testament that I have is that, even
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.920]   with my king-sized ego, when people have recognized me
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.440]   on the street in Munich and in California
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.960]   and in New York and all over.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.880]   And I'll think, oh, did you see me on TV?
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.920]   You read my book?
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.600]   No, I see you on Twig.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.160]   Lovely.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.640]   Sad Leo.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.760]   The power of Leo report is absolutely--
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.680]   It's true.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.600]   First time I get recognized, too, is Twig.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.720]   And nothing to do with life hacker or books or anything.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.360]   It was Twig.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.160]   It's amazing.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.520]   That is kind of amazing, given the--
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.200]   So Leo, I also want to salute you,
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.600]   because you really are remaking all of media.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.400]   You are remaking, improving.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.960]   The internet can support the kinds of work you do.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.000]   And so I know I joined with all Twiggers, Twitters,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.400]   and other electative signs to come.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.320]   That this is a tribute to you that you could make this work.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.720]   And thank you for including me.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.480]   And I know Gina believes the same.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.160]   Well, I didn't believe any of it until I saw the new studio.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.400]   Now I'm starting to think maybe this thing does have some legs.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.400]   Maybe you've got something here.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.160]   Maybe there is something going on that I--
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.320]   So you know, on Leo on that, I've
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.160]   been trying to push broadcast people for years.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.200]   I could imagine a wall of Twiggers,
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.920]   with their chat or something going on underneath.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.920]   It gives you the chance to be kind of a maestro
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.880]   calling on people from video screens.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.240]   Yes, that's what I want to do.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.000]   We have the technology now.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.040]   We didn't-- you know, really, this is this little room
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.560]   that we're in.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.440]   You've both been here.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.160]   Matt, you've been here too, right?
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.160]   You kind of know how tiny it is.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.560]   Uh oh, where did Matt go?
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.400]   Did I push a button?
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.280]   Did I do something wrong?
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.120]   Go ahead, man.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.120]   Sorry if I'm a little loud.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.040]   No, I screwed something up here.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.600]   No, I hadn't gotten to see the cottage,
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.360]   but I watched over on, I think, gig on the video of the new studio.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.840]   And it looks really amazing.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.400]   Yeah, we're excited.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.760]   So-- but the point being that this room was really kind of never
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.280]   intended to do all the things we're doing
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.040]   and the new place of lettuce to this.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.160]   And I want to thank Tony and Eileen.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.200]   Tony Wang, who edits this show and puts it out.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.480]   And Eileen Rivera, who produces this show,
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.560]   they made a little video.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.600]   Would you guys like to just watch a little teeny, weeny video?
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.360]   Yes.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.120]   I don't know what's on here.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.680]   I haven't seen it.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.360]   They didn't warn me.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.680]   But they didn't make it, so I have to play it.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.120]   I didn't even know how to do it.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.120]   That's not the one.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.480]   OK.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.520]   I looked at the wrong one.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.240]   A blooper reel.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.360]   A blooper reel, yeah, really.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.800]   Oh, Twit 100-- Twit 100, I see.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.680]   OK.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.400]   I see.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.600]   I played the wrong one.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.440]   It's OK because that's how we have audio either.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.280]   So let me--
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.320]   As always, Eileen fixed you.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.320]   Yes, she fixed me.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:14.960]   I do that.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.200]   You ever since you do that one to me once?
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:16.560]   I do that.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.360]   Eileen fixed me.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.680]   Let's see what happens here.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.600]   This is Twig, a brand new show this week in Google.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.560]   I'm Leo Laporta.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.160]   Couldn't be happier at the panel we've assembled.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.360]   For this first show, we're just going
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.760]   to have the kind of core members.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.800]   But in time, we'll add others on an ad hoc basis.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.480]   Matt Cutts.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.480]   First, let me introduce Gina Trapani.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.480]   Some of you know from Twit and, of course,
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.960]   the founder of Life Hacker.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.400]   She's at smarterware.org.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.520]   And one of the smartest people I know.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.960]   Also, a developer who's written ad on,
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.440]   she has a great Gmail ad on, better Gmail.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:50.940]   Yep.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.800]   In fact, you have several Gmail adons.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.240]   Yep.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.240]   Yep.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.800]   So she knows Google.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.400]   And I presume is going to talk about Wave at some point
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.040]   because I want to know more about that.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.160]   Also with us, both Gina and Jeff are authors.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.080]   But Jeff's newest book is kind of apropos.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.440]   Why hate that picture?
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.680]   What would Google do?
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.200]   Jeff Jarvis was a machine.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.800]   I'm so glad to have you on the show.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.440]   Harder to be here.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.160]   So this is realizing your audio of the first time.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.600]   Not just Google the software, but Google the company,
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.120]   Google the trends, the stories.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.520]   And I hope we can get some tips as well from Gina, especially,
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.280]   using Google better.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.240]   Who even puts a phone in the rest pocket?
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.080]   They're like phones are for pockets, at best.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.520]   Aliyo, myself, and the entire drinking public.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.200]   I'd like to--
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.680]   Chris Tabana.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.360]   Congratulations, you 100%--
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.440]   Seven of Rola.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.800]   Oh, Jim.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.600]   100% episode of this week in grapes.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.600]   Oh, it's you.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   It's you.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   I got small penis jokes ignite airport meltdown.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.360]   And it goes blank.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.880]   There you go.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.280]   Congratulations to Leo, Gina, and Jeff,
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.800]   and the rest of the Twig team on 100 episodes.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.440]   Gosh, you guys don't look a day over 99.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.640]   That's Mitch Wagnar, your friend.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.640]   Still looking forward to catching you guys every week
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.480]   to hear the latest news about Google.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.840]   It's Facebook.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.720]   You listen to a boom box.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.120]   Glee Chipotle, and how to pronounce Gina's last name.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.120]   Which by the way, is she married?
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.600]   She's a congressman who was recently in the news,
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.000]   would be Gina Wiener.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.680]   Ah, thank you.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.680]   Bye.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.680]   I'm so glad I'm recording this.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.760]   I mean, she's a piece of engineering right here.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.720]   I mean, not to be a total Google fangirl.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.560]   I mean, I am already.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.080]   Sometimes I feel bad about being so far up one company's butt.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.880]   But this is a pretty good butt to be.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.120]   This is really amazing.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.000]   I mean, this is like a--
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.320]   Show title.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:11.320]   You get that engineering.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.640]   I have to tell you, I felt this little insensitive of you
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.360]   to having a 100th episode without myself or Matt Cutz
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.360]   on it.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.000]   Like, are you invited now?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.480]   And him.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.960]   Greetings, Leo, Jeff, and Gina.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.840]   And congratulations on your "Hundorth" episode.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.240]   I've been impressed with how you guys
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.000]   have kept the topics fresh all this time,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.280]   but also have overcome your competition.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.200]   This month in Blacko, who could forget,
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.760]   this Fortnite and cool, this lunar cycle on Bing,
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.720]   which had a ton of marketing power behind it,
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.000]   this weekend in Yandex, this harvest season in Blacko,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.680]   this Julian calendar in Wolfram Alpha,
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.920]   which you all remember got tons of press coverage,
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.280]   and this CPU cycle in DuckDuckGo, which actually
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.120]   does have to be cool people are perfect.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.480]   Anyways, congratulations and keep a great thing going.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.000]   I'm in birdie.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.720]   So it's kind of like a condom for Facebook.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.720]   It does work on Chrome.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.640]   And it's a Chrome extent.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.920]   I really didn't plan to say that,
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.880]   and I kind of regret it when I did.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.960]   Leo, it's Chris, your old pal.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.320]   I just wanted to let you on your 1,000th show of this week
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:15.840]   in Google.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.880]   I mean, I remember when it was this week in Altavista,
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.920]   and this week in Gopher.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.280]   This week in Gopher was-- it was before its time, really.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.520]   And so I want to congratulate you for that.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.800]   And congratulations for this week.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.960]   And you all have to wait to become this week in Google.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.840]   And it's been like that.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.000]   I'm assuming you're looking to the future, though,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.520]   and thinking of this week in BLECO or wherever that one is.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.120]   Or in math, one with Mathematica.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:49.040]   So be well, and I hope you have 1,000 more shows.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.760]   From four hours ago, Google Android,
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.420]   a little bit open source, quote, sort of like a partial
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.160]   circumcision.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.160]   Congratulations, Leo, Gina, and Jeff on the 100th week.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160]   What is this week in BLECO?
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.160]   I always enjoyed the show.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.680]   I always just do it.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.080]   I'm occasionally lucky enough to enjoy you on it.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.280]   But if not, I'll be sucking along with it
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.840]   playing through my headphones.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.640]   Hey, Leo, Gina and Jeff.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.480]   Happy 100th episode of this week in Google.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.560]   Without which a couple of you told me,
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.480]   we wouldn't be able to do any other shows on the network.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.520]   You carry the rest of us on your backs.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.020]   True.
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.120]   And for that, thank you.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.440]   And also the great content.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.260]   You covered things like Chipotle and Lee.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.180]   What's the thing?
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.500]   All right, Facebook.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.620]   And no, thank you so much for doing a great show.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.300]   Thanks for letting me host a couple of times.
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.260]   Here's to 100 more.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.740]   I'm married.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.500]   Whoa.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.100]   Oh, dear.
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.740]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:43.340]   I shouldn't be--
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.900]   There's Chipotle everywhere.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.060]   I love why I love Twig.
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.260]   I had no idea you guys were dancing that whole time behind me.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.240]   But that was so cool.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.880]   Eileen, thank you so much for putting that together.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.000]   Didn't she do a great job?
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.920]   And Tony Wang, too.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.440]   Thank you.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.600]   Really, really very grateful.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.320]   That was really fun.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.600]   And Devona and Purdy and Mitch.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.560]   Oh, my god.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.040]   So cool.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:10.960]   And Kevin Marks' writing.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.400]   I'm trying to think.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.280]   I'm thinking it's a mobile bike repair company
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.040]   that he runs now.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.000]   I don't know.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.640]   Maybe Salesforce didn't work out, and he's moved on.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.120]   I don't know.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.760]   The chat room says he was in a tram.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.680]   A tram of what?
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.580]   I mean, there was a bunch of--
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.080]   That's the strangest thing I have ever seen.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.380]   How California to be have more bikes than people.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.760]   Anyway, it's fun.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.520]   I mean, thank you, Eileen, for doing that.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.420]   Thank you, Eileen.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.680]   And she brought me more Chipotle.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.440]   Because now that we've cleaned up the last bill,
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.440]   I think it's time to get more Chipotle on the floor.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.120]   Wow.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.720]   Matt, thanks for putting up with that.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.480]   And when you--
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.480]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.760]   I love Twig.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.480]   So as long as the love fest is going on,
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.920]   I just want to say thank you so much for doing it.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.000]   I think I discovered Twig around episode four or five.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.240]   And I think I have probably exercised
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.360]   to every single episode of Twig.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.920]   Like, you guys just keep the company.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.680]   And there's literally a group of people
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.120]   who fight spam manually, like literally above me.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.720]   And they installed a projector.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.600]   So every Wednesday, they could spam flight
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.800]   while they watch Twig.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.760]   So you guys provide such an awesome, amazing service,
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.120]   and everybody loves it.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.240]   So thanks very much.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.640]   I'm not sure how to know that.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.080]   That Googlers are watching us.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:25.920]   Wow.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.520]   High Googlers.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.080]   I guarantee they are.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.000]   And I've been up in the office when
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.080]   they get the projector going.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.920]   And the law's for 10, 15 minutes.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.840]   And then they'll be spam fighting as they're listening
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.360]   and watching.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.280]   And it's a lot of fun.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.200]   Wow.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.440]   And of course to our great audience,
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.080]   because we have a wonderful audience.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.400]   Tom Merr-- it wasn't far off when he said this show does
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.120]   support the network.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.600]   It's one of the handfuls of shows that really make
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.560]   a lot of money.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.960]   And so I should have said that.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.240]   Now I have to pay these guys.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.200]   And well, we'll get you some--
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.280]   In burritos, Leo.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.040]   In burritos.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.760]   No, it's been a very successful show out of the box.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.160]   And to that, I credit not merely the subject matter,
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.520]   but really more Gina and Jeff.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.760]   Because one of the things we've learned doing these shows
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.280]   is it's not so much the subject matter.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.680]   It's the people who do the shows that make the shows work.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.920]   And you guys have full of deep thoughts and funny.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.200]   And it's just great.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.320]   So thank you all for being here.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.360]   Thank you for watching everybody at home.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.800]   And now we'll get to the news.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.640]   Group hug.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.640]   Group hug.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.640]   Group hug.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.400]   We love you.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:36.280]   Google is now at 1 billion uniques a month.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.200]   I can't think-- there's no other website anywhere near that.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.120]   1 billion.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.600]   Did you celebrate that, Matt?
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.160]   Was there a cake?
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.120]   Not really.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.800]   So we tend not to worry as much about what the metrics
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.760]   companies say, because different metric companies will
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.520]   say different things at different times.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.640]   But in the early days, we would have a little crayon graph.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.640]   And we would actually draw the traffic.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.840]   And then when people came to visit-- like when Al Gore came
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.080]   to visit, he would sign on the day that he came to visit.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.000]   So googly.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.840]   I love that.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.000]   Did I know why--
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.160]   Was it on a whiteboard?
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.520]   He put it on-- it was almost like butcher papers,
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.440]   like 48 inches.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.360]   And it scrolled a long way.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.640]   And it's still somewhere around the Googleplex hidden.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.240]   I don't know exactly where it is.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:17.760]   I think this--
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.800]   The infinite scroll.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.720]   The obvious joke here is that the Gore signed you're welcome.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.560]   But I won't.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.760]   This is what I created the internet for.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.600]   Actually--
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.720]   That billion is only just to the google.com domains, right?
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.800]   And if you're watching YouTube videos elsewhere,
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.400]   if you're seeing ads sent elsewhere,
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.440]   don't know that counts, right?
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:41.960]   I guess not.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.280]   And there's analytics.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.960]   There's Google toolbar.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.040]   There's Google Public DNS.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.320]   So there is a lot of data that flows through.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.960]   But what I loved about the crayon graph
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.360]   is we kept having to scale it down by a factor of 10
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.360]   over and over again.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.240]   You should have made it logarithmic in the first place.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.200]   You wouldn't have had to worry about that.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.240]   But who knew?
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.960]   So this is from ComScore, which I think
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.760]   is absolutely considered a reliable source.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.760]   I think I don't know.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.320]   But over the past year, according to ComScore,
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.080]   Google's unique visitors have increased 8.4%
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.720]   to just over 1 billion a month.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.760]   That is number one.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.800]   Microsoft number two with 905 million unique visitors.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.480]   They were up 15%.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:24.920]   Now this--
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.000]   Well, where does that come from?
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.920]   That's not Bing.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.600]   I presume it's-- well, I don't know.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.080]   I presume it's mikersoft.com.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.920]   Well, yeah, I don't go to that Microsoft site.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.120]   If you-- OK, this is why they have such a big number.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.560]   If you install Windows and you never
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.280]   change the defaults, your homepage is mikersoft.com.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.640]   And I would guess that 90% of Windows users-- maybe not that high.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.320]   But a large number of Windows users,
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.280]   there's-- that's when they open their internet explorer.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:53.920]   Oh, look.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.000]   There's Microsoft.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.200]   Facebook up 30%, but still only 714 million unique.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.920]   714 million unique a month.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.640]   Facebook.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.680]   Facebook.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.120]   Well, they have not updated their--
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.320]   their member number since 500 million.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.200]   But we now know it's well over 700.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.280]   It would have to be.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.320]   Well, that doesn't-- visitors wouldn't necessarily
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:21.800]   have to remember.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.520]   Who visits Facebook?
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.280]   I think that's something I think--
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.320]   because of fan pages and that kind of stuff.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.720]   Oh.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.280]   Oh, well, that's interesting.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.280]   OK, I'd love to know that.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.920]   Yahoo.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.640]   And by the way, we were this week in Yahoo for many years.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.920]   689 million up 10% up.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.440]   Up.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.920]   Up.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.560]   10%--
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.080]   Comsworth--
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.360]   The internet is growing.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.360]   Yeah, that's for sure.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.000]   So this is not the way analytics works or quantcast works.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.240]   This is a global measurement panel.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.480]   Yeah, so it's--
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.200]   It's a little weird.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.240]   Nielsen ratings.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.760]   Yeah, but it's 2 million users.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.360]   It's a large-- it's a very large sample site.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:05.720]   It's huge.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.920]   Google does know these numbers.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.760]   And I like the early days of Google when
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.760]   they shared numbers, like how many sites
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.640]   and how many users--
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.320]   You're going to know exactly, right?
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.760]   Of course they do.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.040]   And I never understood them.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.360]   I'm not going to make Matt answer this question.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.280]   I never understood why they stopped.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.000]   I think the transparency about that was great.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.120]   And I wish they'd continue with that.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.920]   At some point, Facebook updates its stats to some level.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.960]   All the sites do to some extent.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.560]   YouTube tells us how many minutes of video we're on every
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.600]   nanosecond.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.600]   But I wish that Google would give us the kind of--
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.320]   because it knows the scale of the internet,
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.240]   but other than anybody else.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.480]   Is that number scary?
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.520]   That's exactly why.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.520]   I'm sure it is.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.020]   That's why.
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.000]   It would be a little scary because everyone would know
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.320]   that Google is the only one who really has that number.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.400]   And it's going to be an astronomical number.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.840]   It's bigger than a billion.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.920]   It's bigger than a billion.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.520]   Sorry to say creep, Jeff.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.920]   But I don't know, just a guess.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.560]   No, I think you hit the nail on the head, Gina.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.400]   Well, and I think Marissa Meyer has released at least a couple
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:00.840]   stats.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.760]   One was that we get over a billion searches a day, which
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.560]   that's a pretty nice big number to reveal.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.760]   And then I think she had said something like we get over a
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.320]   billion users each week coming to Google.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.840]   So it depends on how you count people, whether you count
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.320]   by cookies or whether you try to do some other methodology.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.400]   But if you think about it, a large fraction of the internet
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.480]   likes to search on Google.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.800]   So that's not a huge surprise.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.640]   Yeah, but Unix is kind of a special number.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.680]   For instance, we say 714 million uniques.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.920]   That means just for people who don't know, I'm sure everybody
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.120]   does.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.160]   But that's individuals.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:41.360]   That's like me plus 713,999,999 other people.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.800]   I mean, it's individuals.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.720]   So when you say 714 million for Facebook or a billion for
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.000]   Google, I mean, how many internet users are there total?
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.080]   Not a few billion.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:52.800]   So two--
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.360]   Two of the usual number of people.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.480]   So it means half of everybody who has access to the
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.480]   internet uses Google at least once a month.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.480]   That doesn't surprise me all.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.080]   Not at all.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:04.800]   And it's not creepy.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.720]   It's just merely that it's--
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.680]   I think my guess is you're absolutely right, Gina.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.880]   And it's not so much even just creepiness.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.320]   Google rightly, I think, doesn't want people to think about
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.160]   how much power they wield.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.000]   Because that's scary to people.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.560]   Why are you laughing at that?
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.760]   I'm laughing because on the bright side, if anybody doesn't
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.280]   like Google, there's no lock-in.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.840]   You can leave any time you want.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.560]   You can go to Bing.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.360]   You can go to Beko.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.000]   You can go to DuckDuckGo or any other sites mentioned in
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.840]   that promo.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.840]   So--
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.680]   DuckDuckGo.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.880]   The only reason people come back to Google is if we have
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.600]   good results.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.200]   Is there really a website, the search engine DuckDuckGo?
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.240]   In fact, yes, they made a big deal this week about how they
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.240]   don't do personalization because there was a book called
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.240]   The Filter Bubble.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.360]   And they're saying, you won't get the filter bubble when
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.920]   you're at DuckDuckGo.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.760]   I support that it's actually a one person search engine.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.960]   It's one guy, Gabriel Weinberg.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.840]   And I love it when people try different search engines and
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.120]   see what works for them.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.120]   So how should I test this?
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:09.640]   I guess I'll do this.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.480]   Gina Trappani.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.480]   Yeah, we'll do the ego search.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.240]   But we won't do me.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:13.960]   We'll do Gina.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.800]   All right.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   I'm afraid that my dabbling in the porn website back in
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.400]   the day is going to be revealed by DuckDuckGo.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.000]   Oh, look.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.600]   I like this.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.560]   They've got the Wikipedia.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.640]   They've got the picture.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.520]   You good?
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.000]   They've got an interesting ad.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.400]   Find Gina Trappani.
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.440]   Locate Junior Tpani one minute to search public records now.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.760]   I don't like that.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.640]   Oh, goody.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.600]   I mean, what-- you know, OK, yeah, you don't track me, but
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.160]   then you have an ad for somebody who does.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.280]   That's good.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:40.720]   Official site.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.560]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.240]   The badge here.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:42.920]   Lifehacker.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.480]   They knew that.
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.840]   Worked smart at Fast Company.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.280]   Well done.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.040]   Twitter.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.200]   Smarterware.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.480]   This is pretty canonical.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.000]   Not too bad.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.760]   I mean, it lists my name site, which is kind of my
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.080]   official site first.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.600]   And I think Wikipedia is also a really good first result as
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.100]   well.
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:24:59.960]   These are good results for me.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.760]   But would you rather they had smarterware than
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.360]   GinaTrapani.org?
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.200]   No, no.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.920]   I'd want my name site, GinaTrapani.org, for sure.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.360]   It's top.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.480]   And then I'd want Smarterware next, because I write on
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:09.880]   that more.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.640]   I haven't done any stuff at Fast Company in a while, or
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.360]   Lifehacker, really.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.640]   But for the most part, these are pretty good results.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.200]   Kind of like this.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.720]   If you misspell my name, it gives the Leo Laporte results
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.080]   and says, did you mean Leo Laporte?
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.520]   So that's Googaly.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.160]   Then it's got the Wikipedia entry, Official Site, Tech TV,
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.960]   People from Sonoma County.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.920]   Search Leo for free and find email address.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.240]   That's People Smart, OK?
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.120]   I wonder how they determine this official site.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.920]   Well, I think it's Wikipedia.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.360]   OK.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:39.880]   OK.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.360]   OK.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.600]   Because Wikipedia will often have the phrase that says
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.040]   official site or official homepage.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.600]   So my guess is Gabriel's just sort of mining Wikipedia.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.080]   So how would you make a really good point, Matt, which is
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.600]   there's no barrier-- well, there is a barrier to entry,
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.840]   but there's no barrier to changing.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.520]   To exit.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.040]   To exit.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.000]   It's kind of interesting, though, that one guy could compete
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.360]   with Google.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.080]   Well, historically, he also used Yahoo, Boss, and Bing
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.880]   as sort of fallbacks or extra stuff.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.720]   So it wasn't 100% entirely his corpus.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.200]   But it is the case that, think about BLECO.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.600]   That's something like 27 people.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.000]   And they're able to crawl several billion documents.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.920]   So the web is out there for people
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.200]   who want to index it and try to make a better search engine.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.240]   And I'm personally glad that people haven't given up
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.360]   on trying to do better than Google.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:32.840]   Really?
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.960]   You feel like that challenge is good for Google?
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.240]   Competition's good.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.600]   It keeps us on our toes.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.040]   Nobody wants to be complacent.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.160]   So Duktuko takes a little more of a privacy centric.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.200]   So we won't personalize and we'll anonymize our logs.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.880]   And BLECO is more towards slash tags.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.120]   So they're going to remove all the spam by hand
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.120]   and that sort of thing.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.160]   And everybody's got a different philosophy.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.480]   And let users pick what they like the best.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.600]   And then if something starts to thrive,
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.440]   then that's good for everybody.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.360]   Well, then you'll be really happy about this story.
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.760]   Bing grabs--
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.080]   Market share from Google.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:09.880]   Compete.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.720]   And I don't actually pay much attention to it
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.920]   compared to Saequancast or ComScore.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.840]   Because as last time I checked, they were very much
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.760]   relying on the tool and ask toolbar, right?
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.600]   They found that Google has lost close to 16%
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.560]   of its market share.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.520]   No, I don't buy this.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.640]   And Microsoft grew by 75%.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.080]   Well, plus, last I checked, Google was in the '60s,
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.240]   the mid-'60s in the US anyway.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.600]   And that says it was down from like '79,
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.160]   a year, 33 and a year.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.280]   One of those is wrong.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.520]   I'm trying to remember, but at least last time I checked
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.360]   Compete, it was not using--
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.880]   I mean, the analytics were based on a toolbar.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.320]   I can't-- was it the ask toolbar?
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:55.920]   I can't remember.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.320]   Couldn't be the ask toolbar anymore.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.600]   But normally metrics sort of break down
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.000]   into three broad genres.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.880]   One is consumer panels, so people install software
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.680]   to watch them.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.800]   And sometimes those users aren't quite as savvy,
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.960]   because they'll do things like, when
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.200]   the sweepstakes, if you install the software to watch you--
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.120]   That's ComScore.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.440]   That's how ComScore works.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.520]   And then there's often people who buy ISP traffic.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.080]   So they actually watch where people go according to the ISPs.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.040]   And then the third type is looking at where people land
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.480]   in terms of refer stats.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.200]   So stat counter and net applications,
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.800]   those kind of people look at, you know,
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.720]   install something like Google Analytics,
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.080]   and then see how often people show up via Bing or Google
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.680]   or Blacko or something like that.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:40.320]   Here's somebody aggregated.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.640]   ComScore said Google market share grew.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.480]   Yahoo! held steady.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.720]   Bing held steady.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.920]   Ask dropped compete.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.200]   Said Google dropped.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:51.800]   Bing dropped.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.600]   Yahoo! grew.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.840]   Ask dropped.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.800]   AOL held steady.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:01.280]   Hit wise says, well, I don't know if it's growth or not,
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.320]   but Google's 67% Bing 13.0.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.960]   So actually, it looks like based on the aggregate,
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.120]   the ComScore that the compete is kind of not
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.800]   is out of the range of the rest of them.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.480]   So that seems like a little bit of a strange result.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.280]   Yeah, you don't have to say anything, Matt.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.080]   You could just nod to it.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.960]   It depends on what you--
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.320]   Yes, there's a lot of damn lies in the--
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.080]   You don't need to say anything.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.360]   You don't need to say anything.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.280]   I'm sorry, Eileen?
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:38.720]   Well, I don't know why they're hearing a ringing sound.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.720]   I'm not hearing-- are you hearing a ringing sound?
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.800]   I'm getting a little bit of a high pitch, the sound.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.320]   You are?
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.840]   Is here?
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.520]   Oh, not right now.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.080]   OK, well, we'll fix that post.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.800]   I get that in my head all the time, so--
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.240]   It's "Tonight-us" or something in the studio.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.560]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.760]   Now I know why I'm hearing voices in my head.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.320]   They're you.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:29:59.960]   That's us.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.200]   That's why we're talking.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.400]   There is, we should say, that we have changed
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.720]   the studio operation preparatory.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.680]   As John Salimina, our studio engineer, says,
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.800]   the beginning of the end, we've started to tear pieces
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.600]   and bits out of the cottage to put them in the new place.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.640]   And the audio, the normally very high quality audio system
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.200]   we use from Telos is not here anymore.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.920]   And so you may get a little more noise and weirdness.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.200]   I think that would only be on the live stream.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.560]   I think our audio is fine on the downloads.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.000]   When do we start producing from over there?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.120]   Hell if I know.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.880]   Oh, OK.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:39.000]   I'm assuming that things will go horribly wrong.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.560]   And Gina, you're a programmer?
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.600]   That's a safe bet, right?
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.920]   Plan for failure, yes.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.640]   Expect failure, and then you'll be surprised
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.400]   when there isn't.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.360]   You have to be surprised.
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.520]   So I'm saying roughly a month.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.160]   I think our first show will probably
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.600]   be either July 17 or 24 from there.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.800]   Because I want to make our first show be, this week in tech,
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.400]   the big shoe.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.480]   Not that this isn't a big show.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.920]   It's the granddaddy.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.600]   And so I think-- and also it happens to work well
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.320]   with our schedule.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:07.880]   I can walk.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.080]   I have an hour between shows.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.680]   I can walk down, and we can do that.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:16.280]   But whether it could even be the 10th, it could-- hey, hey,
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:16.720]   who knows?
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.320]   It could be the third.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.480]   I don't know.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.120]   So it could be the third, the 10th, the 17th, the 24th,
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.600]   or sometime in September.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:30.320]   The problem is we've got everything's over there.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.240]   And we've got 30 cameras, and we've got all the lights,
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.680]   and we're building the camera mounts.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.080]   Those aren't quite done yet, but those
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.040]   will be happening pretty fast.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.320]   But then you have to kind of set them up
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.160]   and see if it works.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.600]   And I'm just assuming that it will not work.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.920]   It's like a program, right?
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.480]   Gina, you write the code, then you run it,
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.880]   and then you debug.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.600]   And we don't know how much debugging will be involved.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.440]   Yes, that is always the expected, right?
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.600]   We're assuming.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.200]   Well, and this is the case where we're, in fact,
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.720]   writing the entire program before running it even once.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.640]   It's kind of a mistake.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.560]   Let's talk about building small modules and unit tests
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.320]   around them.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.800]   Unit testing.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.680]   Unit testing.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.560]   For your studio setup.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.680]   Is there anything-- is there anything like unit testing
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.560]   and analog hardware?
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.520]   I guess there is.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.840]   That's why we took the audio out of here,
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.280]   because we want to get it over there and get it set up.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.480]   So what's this?
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.240]   Google to America.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.280]   This is-- oh, Malick's headline.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:23.920]   Get online.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.800]   Love the gigabit in Kansas City.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.400]   I think didn't they?
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.560]   Didn't Google recently announced that not only
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.840]   do it in Kansas City, they're going to do it.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.200]   Where else was it next door, right?
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.760]   Yeah, Kansas City, Kansas, and then
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.280]   Kansas City, Missouri, I think.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.640]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.560]   Poor old Topeka.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:52.960]   Friday morning, Domain Name Wire, which
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.160]   is a blog that monitors domain name registrations,
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.000]   reported that Google has registered more than 100 domains
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.240]   like Alaska.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:00.880]   Get online.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.200]   Get Alaska online.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.960]   Get online Alaska.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.200]   For other states too, Alabama, Colorado, North Dakota,
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.960]   South Dakota, Arkansas, Arizona, and so on,
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.880]   it even grabbed GetAmericaOnline.com.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.080]   Might have been a little mistake there.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.440]   I don't know if they'll be able to use that one,
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.560]   or if they want to use that one to be honest.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.480]   What is going on, Matt Cuts?
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.000]   Do you know?
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.320]   This one I don't know about.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.840]   I have no idea whether somebody's
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.640]   planning fiber-related stuff.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.040]   I'm doing a little who is action on my own.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.840]   It's kind of interesting idea that maybe Google might be--
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.720]   I would lobby for this.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.400]   I lobbied for when the 700 megahertz spectrum was available.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:45.960]   I want to Google to buy it and kind of do open mobile access.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.320]   I would love to see Google get in the internet provider game
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.040]   and really stick it to these companies like Comcast,
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.640]   and Time Warner, and all the other ones who
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.960]   were just doing such a lousy job for--
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.120]   There's one problem, Leo.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:57.480]   What's that?
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.480]   Horizon.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.640]   Horizon.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.320]   Why is that a problem?
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.000]   Because that's the devil's deal.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.240]   I mean, not to beat up on Google, but that's the devil's deal
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:11.200]   is that I think Google was going to be the highest quality
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.840]   voice for the open internet, but it
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.480]   has to do business with evil telecos.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.960]   Because Verizon-- well, they did that.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.760]   Verizon AT&T, but they did that internet-sminternet deal.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.260]   Right.
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.600]   Back to that.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:29.560]   I saw Yochai Binkler in Paris, and he got all of a sudden.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.800]   He was finally going to get his iPhone on Verizon,
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.120]   and then the deal was done, so now he has an Android.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.200]   He's going to get an Android and he got an iPhone instead.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.640]   Really?
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.140]   Yeah.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:40.600]   So I think that's the problem.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.840]   Yes, Google was, to my mind, the best hope for the neutral
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.600]   internet, because it could provide that kind of competition.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.520]   The next fear-- well, the next thing Google has fought for,
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:56.040]   which will help us, is white space, becoming, as they
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.280]   say, Wi-Fi on steroids.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.320]   That would be exactly what you're saying.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.160]   That would be great.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.400]   That would create competition.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.320]   Competition alone, I think, will solve this.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.720]   But I've heard rumors, rumblings, people
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.760]   say it wouldn't happen, but the Congress is going to go after
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.520]   that and stop the white space.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.320]   I'm going to sell that bandwidth instead of making it
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.040]   a license.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.040]   That's a shame.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:15.560]   That's too bad.
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.440]   That would be a crime.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.880]   Well, it seems like a lot of the time you've got something
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.360]   like Chrome was really useful, because it showed how much
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.360]   better web browsing experience could be.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.400]   And now you see things like Firefox releasing faster,
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.840]   and IE9 is a lot more standards compliant.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.560]   And browsers as a whole are a lot faster.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.760]   So one way you could view the Kansas City fiber deployment
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.360]   is just trying out some of these ideas to test whether it
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.200]   is possible to deploy for less--
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.160]   Improvement by example.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.520]   I think it's not a tonic California.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.720]   Isn't that a tonic California?
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.220]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.440]   In fact, it's our internet service provider, SonicNet,
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.480]   that's doing it.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.920]   Yeah, it's a basketball where oddly enough, O'Reilly and
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.680]   Fookamp are.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.640]   Coincidence, I don't know.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.560]   But it's not a lot of homes.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.120]   Several hundred homes are going to wire for Gigabit.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.880]   Sonic is actually, I think, doing the Google--
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:14.080]   running the Google back end in Kansas as well.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.840]   So they have a lot of experience with Gigabit installs.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.320]   And we use a number of internet service providers here
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:21.880]   for bandwidth.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.920]   We have four or five bandwidth providers.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.640]   But going into the new place, we've got--
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.200]   I love this-- a 35 megabit pipe from SonicNet.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.320]   So I'm pretty excited.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.440]   We couldn't get fiber.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.760]   There's no fiber in there.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.400]   But it's the fastest.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:40.120]   Yeah, it's just-- it's Petaluma for crying out loud.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.120]   We're lucky you thought chicken internet.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.200]   But at least we got copper in there.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.000]   Oh, we don't know.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.400]   Oh, let me tell you, because we want to have two providers
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:48.960]   for redundancy.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.960]   So we wanted to have cable modems in here from Comcast.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.280]   And it turns out that the building is so old,
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.360]   it's not wired for cable.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.640]   In order to get cable in there, we've
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.720]   got to go through the hairdressing salon next door.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.000]   And they don't want us to do it.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.200]   No.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.040]   Oh, no.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.160]   Those Comcast people are messy.
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.240]   They leave footprints in the hall.
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.360]   I don't know.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.640]   Why wouldn't you?
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.920]   Well, didn't Sebastian Poland decide not to do free Wi-Fi?
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.120]   Because people were worried it might cause cancer
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.000]   or something like that?
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:21.760]   That's right.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.160]   Oh, that's so California.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.400]   They'd radiate our heads.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:29.200]   Yeah, we're very-- Sebastian pool
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.800]   is where the hippies have went.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.920]   When they left Santa Cruz, they all went to Sebastian pool.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.920]   Led by Tim.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.080]   Yeah, led by Tim.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:37.760]   Tim is a hippie.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.000]   I love you, Tim.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.320]   Hey, credit to Google for doing this.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.840]   As you know, Google keeps a database of malware sites.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.920]   And you can check the databases and your webmaster tools,
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.200]   but they'll also put a warning up
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.840]   if there's malware on a site.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.480]   First of all, I'm going to--
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.280]   Mayakalpa here, our site was hacked.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.960]   I think it was just our chat page.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.640]   We have-- and I don't know all the details yet
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.160]   because our sys admins are working on it.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.760]   But the way we learned is a number of our chaters said,
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.360]   hey, I'm getting a Google warning in Chrome
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.240]   that this site has malware on it.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.360]   And at first, I said, that's got to be a false positive.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.480]   Because remember, there was a false positive incident
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.520]   some months ago.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.520]   And I said, our site would never be hacked.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:25.160]   First of all, there ain't nothing on there.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.920]   Well, it turns out there was a line injected into our jQuery
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.920]   library on one of the three servers that runs the chat.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.040]   And Bear found it.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.240]   Bear removed it.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.640]   And we're looking at trying to figure out
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.720]   how it got stuck in there.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.400]   But thank you, Google.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.800]   They're doing the same thing with out-of-date WordPress
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.280]   installs.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:45.280]   Apparently, there are 47 million WordPress deployments
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.120]   out there, many of them running old--
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.960]   you know about this, old version.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.600]   Very old.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.840]   In fact, the WordPress guys were really nice.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.160]   They made an API where you could check which versions were
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.800]   insecure versus the latest.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.160]   And unfortunately, the reason why a lot of--
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.000]   well, of course, WordPress is updated for security
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.960]   for features.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.400]   But if you look at the older versions of WordPress,
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.600]   pretty much every single one of them is insecure.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.080]   So at first, we were like, well, we
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.800]   don't want to pick on WordPress.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.600]   You guys do a fantastic job in general.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.360]   And they were actually saying, they only
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.360]   want to support the last two or three
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.320]   versions of WordPress.
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.840]   So they want people to upgrade.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.560]   So if you remember a little while ago,
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.400]   I said there were people right above me who listened and watched
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.680]   Twig while at work.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.320]   Actually, it was one of those guys that made this message.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.800]   Well, a word to them.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.560]   Thank you.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.440]   I actually run WordPress.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.440]   Partly the reason I-- part of the reason I really still
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.960]   run WordPress is that it's Squarespace is on my personal
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.160]   blog.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.840]   It's because exactly for this reason.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.560]   And I have to say, you log into WordPress,
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.160]   and almost-- it seems like every week, there's a security
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:51.840]   update.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.400]   That speaks to your blog post.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.840]   And you and Mitch were having a little back and forth
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.760]   on this, Gina.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.440]   We were.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:00.800]   We were.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.240]   I loved it.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.640]   Why not Tumble?
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.400]   Tumble, yeah.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:08.920]   Tumble is a really cool blogging kind of social network.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.520]   And so my blog was going kind of fallow.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.680]   I wasn't writing as much.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:12.600]   WordPress was out of date.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.240]   My plugins were out of date.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.880]   I wanted to do things that I couldn't.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.360]   And I needed to spend time hacking.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.160]   So I kind of had this moment where I was like, I'm just
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.720]   going to switch to something that's super easy
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.960]   so I can just write.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.800]   And I looked at Tumbler to do it.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.560]   And I really-- I kind of realized that there's
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.720]   a difference between social networks and publishing tools.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.440]   And Tumbler really kind of straddles that fence.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.240]   But it's not easy to import your existing content
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.360]   and Tumbler, which is something that's really important to me.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.560]   I mean, I've been blogging for 10 years in different sites.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.800]   And I have forgotten more that I know.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.680]   I use Google as my memory now.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.200]   I Google stuff, and I find posts that I wrote on Life Hacker
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.200]   in 2006.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.240]   I was like, oh, yeah, I remember I did know how to do that.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.960]   And this is how to do it.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.480]   So archiving and permalink is really important to me.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.520]   And so I decided not to use Tumbler.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:01.880]   It's hard.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:02.840]   I use WordPress.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.280]   And the updating is an issue.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.640]   And I've had to do a kind of--
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.440]   I'm a programmer.
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.520]   So of course, I want everything to be exactly what I wanted.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.000]   So of course, I was inside WordPress hacking.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.240]   It's the PHP innards.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.720]   And really, I might just evaluate Squarespace.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.240]   It sounds like Squarespace kind of gives you
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.320]   that the luxury of being hosted and not having
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.040]   to deal with updates, but also is a true blogging tool
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.040]   and that there's permalinks and important export.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.360]   And you can kind of retain your permalinks over time.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.480]   I just want to be able to have my own domain
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:34.600]   and move my content from provider to provider system
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.560]   to system without--
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.760]   I am with you 100%.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.160]   You know, that's why I still run a--
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:41.440]   that's the other reason I still run a WordPress blog is I got
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.680]   scared from Twitter, from Twitter.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.920]   I had pounce.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.040]   I had all these sites where I've been putting content up
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.720]   and my last blog was on Vox, which I loved.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.920]   What a great platform Vox was.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.000]   But then they went away.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.960]   And so I had to export everything that was--
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.200]   it's run by the six of park people, the movable type people.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.360]   And they decided not to do it anymore.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.000]   And that was a wake up call.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   That's the thing.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.960]   I think I've come this place where it's like social networks,
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.560]   like Facebook and Twitter and Tumblr and Vox or some degree
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.440]   are like really good ways to share content
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.760]   and get it to your friends instantly and immediately.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.800]   But I don't know that they're the best place to park content
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.880]   that you want to keep.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.120]   And then you want to refer to.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.120]   I was like, are you doing this for now or for later?
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.400]   So I tweet stuff all the time, throw away stuff
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.560]   that I know is going to kind of fall away
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.000]   into Twitter's archives.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.720]   I mean, I'm working on Think Up, obviously,
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.960]   to sort of combat this problem.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.680]   But that's not a solution for everyone.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.000]   But if I want to write down an idea and articulate an idea
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.960]   that's important that I'm going to want to refer to back to
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.160]   later, which I do all the time with my archives
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.640]   over the past 10 years of blogging,
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:41.760]   I'm going to put it on my blog.
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.600]   So I just kind of buckled down and decided
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.200]   to get my blog to a place where I want it to be and just put
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.240]   in the work to future proof my work.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.440]   Because that's my work.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.960]   And I feel like the things you put out on the internet,
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.560]   things that you write and things that you say,
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.880]   that's who you are online.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.240]   And that's just important to me.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.280]   And I don't trust a social network that
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:03.440]   doesn't treat your content the same way to put it there.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.000]   But Mitch's argument was a really good one, which
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.280]   is the social networks gave you the audience instantly.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.240]   That's where the people are.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.160]   So you do quick.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.480]   And so this is a 2007.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.800]   I had this epiphany.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.360]   And I still use Tumblr.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.120]   I have a Tumblr.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.160]   You do too, Gina.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:17.800]   Yeah, I do.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.320]   I do.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.160]   But it's for ephemera.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.880]   It's for, hey, look at this cute thing.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:26.040]   I don't consider anything that I put on Tumblr to be permanent.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:29.400]   I realize that at any moment, it could go away.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.800]   And this is nothing against Tumblr specifically.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:32.920]   It's just in general.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.040]   And he hosted service that doesn't have
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.440]   easy import and export, that you can't use Google's terms,
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.440]   liberate your data from it.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.400]   Fitz was at FITZ was at FU cabinet.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.160]   And he's just-- in fact, I think they bought a brick,
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.960]   an 8x8 brick with a data liberation front logo on it.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:49.840]   I love that guy.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:50.840]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.840]   So that's exactly the right attitude.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.480]   Nevertheless, there is something to hosting your own content.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.480]   Now, let's be honest.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.560]   You could screw up a lot.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.560]   You're more likely to screw up your own content.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.560]   Maybe not you, Gina.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.200]   Me, I'm much more likely to screw up my database
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.800]   and lose everything on a server that I'm running.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.320]   Definitely.
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.400]   And Tumblr is.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.120]   Right.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.680]   But you know, like a service like Squarespace,
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:14.400]   from what I understand, and WordPress.com,
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.960]   there's a host of services, but you can map your domain to them.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.160]   You can import your data, and then you can export your data.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.680]   It's sort of like I use Gmail, right?
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.560]   But I know that I can--
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.120]   but I use Gmail for my domain.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.760]   So my email address is never going to change.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.440]   I could switch providers and get my mail out of Gmail
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:29.920]   and move if I wanted to.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.880]   And that's kind of how I evaluate a service, whether or not
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.520]   it's worth using.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.640]   Can I move in the future if I wanted to or needed to?
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:41.040]   Isn't this the model where backupify has been going,
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.280]   that it just becomes a way to backup all your stuff someplace?
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.360]   Yeah, I love backupify.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.320]   And I'm using it.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:50.920]   I started using it when they were free,
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.240]   and they said it'll be free forever.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.320]   So I backup everything through backupify.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.800]   But--
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.320]   And I love backupify.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.080]   I use it too.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.000]   But it really seems like you want the convenience of the cloud,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.160]   but you really want to be able to get your own data easily.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.160]   And not just make it possible to export your data, but like--
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.160]   Right.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.920]   Have a copy by default.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.480]   So if things are down, you're not host.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:13.960]   Right.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.520]   I mean, Matt, you're the search engine guy.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.120]   So I've been blogging for years and years,
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.760]   and I've got thousands and thousands of posts
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.600]   with permalinks on Life Hacker and on my personal site.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.240]   And over time, I like to build on ideas.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.880]   So I'll have a little bit of an idea.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.720]   And then a year later, write about it and link back.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.200]   You do the same on your blog.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:35.520]   And I don't write for SEO, but I do--
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.320]   I think that a post becomes more important over time
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.560]   as it ages and more conversations kind of surround it.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:45.920]   And that permalink and having that time in the index
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.480]   and out on the internet really make something become
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.640]   something more than it is.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.520]   And that never really happened with a tweet
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.880]   or with a Facebook status update.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:53.920]   What about this compromise?
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:55.400]   Because this is the compromise I ended up using.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.880]   So I host my own blog, but I use JSKed Echo,
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.280]   or you could use Discuss.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.840]   I use a-- and this scares me a little bit--
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.080]   hosted commenting system.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.640]   So the comments are on their system,
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.680]   but they have-- they're pulling from Twitter, Facebook.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.280]   They use Facebook Connect, Twitter.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:11.960]   It's easier for me.
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.480]   I don't have to know all those technologies,
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.040]   although they're not that hard to implement.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.040]   So that I have now my canonical post, which
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.600]   I own, permalink permanent, and then
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.080]   a very social commenting system which
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.520]   pulls from everywhere, not just from my own blog.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.240]   Is that a good compromise?
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.640]   Maybe Mitch might accept that?
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.440]   I mean, I think that interplay between publishing content
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.360]   in a place, but then also broadcasting out
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.480]   these places, which make sharing really easy,
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:38.400]   is really the compromise.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.880]   And Tumblr does that really well.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:40.880]   You can write along the lot of those.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.360]   It's amazing.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.880]   And on Tumblr, and then it gets shared instantly,
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.640]   and it kind of removes that step of having
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.880]   to do the broadcasting part.
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.200]   I just don't want to keep my stuff there
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.080]   until they have an export tool.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.040]   And I heard from a Tumblr engineer, they're building one,
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.320]   and I feel bad picking on Tumblr.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.760]   I just happen to be sort of evaluating it as a solution
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.240]   for me.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.600]   Well, they're the big guy right now.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:00.600]   They're-- I mean, they're rapidly--
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.640]   They're doing really well.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.600]   Didn't we see some report that there's more, what,
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.200]   page views than WordPress?
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.400]   I think they're getting close.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.600]   Matt, you had something to say?
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.280]   Oh, just talking about client-side comments.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:12.960]   Yes.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.560]   It's really tricky because comments are a bear.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.880]   I usually pre-moderate mine to keep spam out
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.600]   and to keep out griefers and stuff like that.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.120]   And it's a real hassle if you have
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.400]   to approve every single comment yourself.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:29.560]   So I would prefer to go with the JS Echo kind of stuff.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:33.080]   But since it runs on the client in JavaScript,
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.200]   that's really hard for search engines to index.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.320]   And we're making progress.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.520]   I'm sure it's not there.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.160]   But of course, you index some of the sources for it.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.320]   So you index Twitter and you index Facebook.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:42.880]   Oh, do you?
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.480]   What-- actually, you probably don't index Facebook.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:47.720]   Well, we do get fan pages.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.960]   So we don't get everything from Facebook.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.440]   But if a page is publicly visible,
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.520]   if it's not robotic out, then we can crawl it.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.920]   So if you make your Facebook page public,
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.400]   then it's possible we might see it.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.840]   I do make my Facebook page public,
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:02.480]   but not all my commenters do, obviously.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.360]   In fact, probably the majority don't.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.840]   We're going to take a break.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.720]   This is actually a good time to do a Squarespace ad.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.640]   What do you think?
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.120]   Just a coenkey dink.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.640]   But it does raise an interesting issue.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.640]   If you are doing a website, it makes sense
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.760]   if you're going to do a website to do something
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:25.800]   that's robust that you control the content on.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.040]   But at the same time, you kind of want to do a website
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.960]   that's easy, because if you have to spend a lot of time
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.280]   maintaining it, that's a pain.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.640]   Squarespace, actually, I think does kind of cut down
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.480]   the middle perfectly on this.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.520]   First of all, it's hosted.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.480]   So in fact, what you get with squarespace.com
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:44.320]   is hosting plus a content management system.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.280]   That's always up to date, because they're keeping it up
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:47.560]   to date.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.320]   It's their database of the code.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.680]   So that's a nice thing.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.400]   In fact, they're about to go to Squarespace 6.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.400]   And when that happens, it'll happen automatically.
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:57.600]   You won't have to do anything about it.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.840]   But they give you full control of your data.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.280]   And I think they were smart.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.880]   They were wise to understand that this is an issue
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.560]   for all of us.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.880]   So they have blog import.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:10.880]   And I should say export.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:11.360]   That keeps--
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.880]   Yeah, this is important.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.080]   This would be the Gmail of blogs, right?
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.120]   This is what you have to be able to get data in
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.160]   and get data out easily.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.240]   It was like a trap.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.920]   And the Permalinks are preserved.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:27.920]   Images, tags, text, authors, even comments.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.800]   And they actually have a very nice commenting system.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.640]   They are fully preserved.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.480]   All SEO is preserved.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.880]   Search is preserved.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.400]   That means your Google index isn't going to change.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.320]   So I guess-- I mean, Matt, I'll defer to you
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.160]   if that's not the case.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:46.240]   But I think this is really a great solution for people
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.440]   who want the best of both worlds.
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:51.920]   Hosting plus hosted software.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.560]   And boy, do they have some great tools, the iPhone, iPad,
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.920]   app, the templates that aren't templated.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.960]   Just every site looks gorgeous.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.120]   Very easy posting from the web page as well.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.600]   Incredible stats information.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:09.240]   Integration of social media that's as simple as point and click.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.160]   They do the SEO automatically.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.480]   They do all the Google-approved things like site maps
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.280]   to make it completely googolable.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:18.440]   I think Squarespace has it down.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.920]   Here's the deal.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.120]   You could try it free.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:21.920]   Everybody could do this.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.200]   Just go to squarespace.com.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.120]   Click the big green button.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.480]   You don't need a credit card or anything.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.640]   The name of your site, a password in your email address.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.360]   And you're there.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.680]   You're doing it for 15 days free.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:35.400]   You have full access to the entire Squarespace tool set,
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.600]   including the import/export tool.
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.760]   Then if you decide to sign up, here's the pricing.
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.200]   And you can get it monthly.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:46.480]   But the longer you sign up for, the lower the price.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.280]   And as little as $10 a month.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:52.380]   And if you use the offer code TWIG6 when you sign up--
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:54.600]   TWIG, they'll number six.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.260]   All one word when you sign up.
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.940]   30% off for the first three months.
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:01.220]   So you get a really good discount for you to try it out.
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:02.940]   I just think Squarespace is fantastic.
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:04.420]   And I want you to give it a try.
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.180]   squarespace.com.
[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:10.140]   Use the offer code TWIG6 if you decide to buy.
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:12.420]   They've nailed it.
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:16.980]   It's halfway between Tumblr and your own blog.
[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:19.780]   And I think that's kind of what you want.
[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:21.180]   Well, not everybody, obviously.
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.420]   But some people, that's what they want.
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:25.620]   So you decided, Gina, just to keep your own blog,
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:26.900]   your host, your own blog.
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.620]   You know, I had already invested so much time
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:29.780]   in the theme and the plugins.
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:32.060]   I decided to stick with WordPress and just--
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:33.580]   Are you using--
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:34.660]   What are you using?
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:35.660]   Expression or WordPress?
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:36.820]   Yeah, WordPress.org.
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.260]   Yeah, on my own host.
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:39.700]   I love it.
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:40.820]   The update thing is a problem.
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:41.820]   It's something keeps me awake.
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:42.780]   I'm building ThinkUp.
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.060]   That's an unstoppable PhD app.
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.140]   It's got updates.
[00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:46.500]   And it stinks.
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:49.580]   It's just kind of the way it is.
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:50.700]   There are updates.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.900]   First thing I asked our sys admins when they said
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:58.500]   that their hack on the site was, is it my fault?
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:02.380]   And they said, no, Leo, we actually isolated your WordPress.
[00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:05.540]   So it has no access to any other server.
[00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.060]   Because you have a smart sys admin.
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:08.420]   I said, that was a good idea.
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:08.980]   But I do.
[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:10.580]   I check every day.
[00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:12.340]   But sometimes it'll be a couple of days.
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.380]   And a lot of those WordPress upgrades
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:16.380]   are like critical security flaw.
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.460]   They're widely known.
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:20.140]   It's easy to Google to find a WordPress blog.
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.580]   I mean, you can see what, as you said, Matt,
[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:25.020]   they've got an API to see what version it is.
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:27.980]   So you can really easily see whether you're--
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:32.740]   if you're looking for easily violatable blogs,
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:33.260]   you can find them.
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:34.540]   Hey, let's talk about the filter bubble.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.220]   You haven't been here, Matt, since we talked about it.
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:40.220]   You should know that Gina and Jeff and I
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:43.420]   both have completely dismissed the notion of a filter bubble.
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:48.060]   We like search personalization.
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:48.900]   Yeah.
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:53.700]   What's-- and you're fairly involved, I would guess, in this.
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:57.300]   Yeah, it was funny because Eli gave a talk at Ted
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.220]   about his book.
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:00.220]   Eli Bareser wrote this book.
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:00.580]   Right.
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:01.940]   And it's called the filter bubble.
[00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:03.140]   And it is an interesting read.
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.380]   So if you're interested in search,
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:06.220]   you might enjoy it quite a bit.
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.260]   But it was frustrated because he gave the talk
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:09.740]   before the book was available.
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:11.740]   So we had to only go by the talk.
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.140]   And he was saying things like, there's
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:15.300]   57 different personalization factors.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:20.540]   And that sounded like a random, semi-legitimate number.
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:24.420]   And I think Jeff had said before on an earlier show,
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:27.220]   you've never had as much choice as you have with the internet
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:27.900]   right now.
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.700]   And I sort of feel like that's the case.
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.260]   I'm sensitive to the example of if you only
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:36.260]   click on links that your liberal friends share on Facebook,
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:39.500]   then you eventually only start to see liberal type stuff.
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.740]   But certainly at Google, we do actually
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:44.100]   have algorithms that think about diversity.
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:46.540]   And so for example, you might limit or cap
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.380]   the number of results you see from one site
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:51.700]   so that you see more results from other places.
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:54.140]   So even Google News, when it started,
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:58.020]   one of the big advantages was to surface not only Reuters
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.820]   or AP, but Profta or Xinhua.
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:03.780]   So we wanted to bring in a diversity of viewpoints.
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.620]   So it's possible that personalization
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.180]   can have some minor effect.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:10.580]   But overall, it's usually a much greater win.
[00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:12.060]   It's really helping the relevance.
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.900]   The more I thought about it, Leo, the more I think
[00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:19.760]   that that perspective is with the same as Nick Carr
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.660]   and Andrew Keene and folks like that, it's--
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:24.740]   The Neo-Luddites, we'll call them.
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:27.200]   Well, no, it's authoritarian.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.840]   They want authority.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:32.240]   The irony is that I think we're finally freed
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.480]   from having just Bill Keller tell us
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.320]   what happened in the world today by the internet.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:39.160]   And they want to go back to that.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.960]   So even Perisor almost says that Google Stick
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:45.920]   responsibility for deciding what we get to give us more.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:46.960]   And I want the opposite.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:49.160]   I don't want that at all.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:53.860]   I got in pockets of trouble or praise
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:58.840]   for questioning the article as the atomic unit of news.
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.040]   I loved that, by the way.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.600]   I didn't think it was a big deal at all.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.760]   But some people got really mad about it.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:08.640]   And as I thought about it, I watch out warning Gutenberg
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.560]   alert, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:14.160]   I love the phrase Gutenberg parenthesis, by the way.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:14.920]   Exactly.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.000]   And I think what's happened is that we had a way,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.280]   as I've said before, cognate the world
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:23.760]   and put it into boxes and know the beginning and end
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.040]   and know there was authority and know who did it.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.240]   And the scarcity was comforting.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.520]   It put a border around the world.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.240]   And the internet gives us abundance
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.480]   and abundance is unsettling.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:37.040]   And it changes how we view the world.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.960]   So I think this whole filter bubble debate
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.360]   is part of the same thing.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:43.920]   It's saying that, uh-oh, we can get anything from anywhere
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.800]   now.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:49.520]   And where I'll take help in filtering that, which
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.640]   is what Matt's saying, I think others say, no, no, no,
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:56.160]   I don't want algorithms to help because that seems inhuman.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:00.000]   I want professional editors to help still.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.160]   And it's really an authoritarian, somewhat elitist view,
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.400]   I think.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:07.480]   Well, and what I thought was really interesting
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.200]   is I was sort of having a discussion with people
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.200]   on hacker news about it.
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:13.760]   And one guy said, I don't want the best results for me.
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.280]   I want the best results, period.
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:19.840]   I just want the unfiltered results, the monolithic.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.680]   And the fact is, results for someone in China
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:25.720]   who speaks Chinese are going to be different than German speaking
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.000]   users is going to be different than an expert.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.040]   And so I thought that was-- there
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:33.800]   is no one ideal objectively true, correct set of results.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:34.800]   It's always--
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.960]   That's exactly the prejudice of mass media.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:41.480]   That precisely brings it out.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.480]   The illusion.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.000]   The myth.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.920]   The illusion that you could have the canonical search result.
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:49.600]   Right.
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:51.640]   And the beauty of it is that if you go down
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:53.880]   to the bottom of the search results page,
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.800]   if your results have been personalized,
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.160]   there will be a link that says view customizations.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:59.360]   You can click on it.
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.200]   And it will tell you why they were customized.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.080]   And then it'll have a link to run the search again
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.800]   without personalization.
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.240]   And a few people are like, well, why did you
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.760]   put it at the bottom of the search results?
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:09.880]   And the answer is we started at the top,
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.080]   and really no one cared or ever clicked on that link.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:13.640]   And so if it doesn't earn its click through,
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.640]   then things would tend to be lower on the page.
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.520]   But if we haven't personalized a set of search results,
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.800]   then there's no view customizations link down at the bottom
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:22.760]   of the page.
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:23.960]   I didn't know it either.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.560]   I thought it was so neat when you compared that
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.320]   with doing it in a collagneto.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.760]   Of course, now Leo, your porn results are going to come up.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:30.360]   Actually, they did.
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.000]   I was searching, as you might have noticed, for gay rights.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.280]   But the reason I was searching for gay rights
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:39.120]   was a smooth transition boss.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:42.360]   This is why you are the master segue.
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:44.880]   I actually use Google search results for my segue.
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.200]   How about that?
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:48.520]   How many people could say that?
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:51.560]   First of all, this is gay rights month, right?
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:52.720]   Pride month, baby.
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:54.000]   GBLT month.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:54.400]   Yes.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.160]   And-- but I'm bummed because--
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.040]   GBLT, GLBT, which is it?
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.280]   GLBT, general.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:00.780]   Gotcha.
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:03.040]   Gotcha.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:06.800]   Sometimes I prefer bisexuality.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.200]   I just--
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:11.760]   And you have the right to do that, Leo.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:12.800]   I don't use--
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:16.280]   Leo, I like lesbians better myself.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.240]   Danger.
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.680]   What is the-- what is the long-- there's a long acronym
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:22.040]   that includes questioning and all of that stuff.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.640]   The GBLT, Q, ST, Z, Z, E.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.880]   Yeah, there's a long one.
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.680]   Usually Q is pretty umbrella for allies.
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:30.680]   And then--
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:31.680]   Q. Well, use Q.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.920]   So the reason I search for it is because you're
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.600]   supposed to get a rainbow on the results.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.960]   And I think that once again, because I've turned on--
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:41.560]   see, I have the voice search turned on--
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:44.920]   that I've turned on the labs, do you get this--
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.000]   see, they're supposed to be a--
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.760]   according to Google-- the Google operating system blog,
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:50.720]   when you search for gay, do you get this?
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.760]   You get a rainbow.
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:54.760]   If I do it in Safari, I get it.
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:55.960]   And if I do it in Chrome, I don't.
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:57.360]   Oh, Chrome turned it off.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.840]   If you just search for gay, I think
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:01.840]   it works for Stonewall.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:05.200]   I just think that's really neat.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   It's basically-- it's like a doodle,
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.840]   except for the people who ask for it.
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:10.040]   For search results.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:13.640]   Just think that's really cool.
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:14.400]   It's a nice touch.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.280]   Has that happened before?
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.520]   Has Google done that before, where
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:22.160]   they would change the search interface based on the result?
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.000]   We have, in some instances-- so sometimes for Easter,
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:29.120]   we make the Google at the bottom be little Easter eggs.
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:33.240]   But I remember for some of the Christmas holidays,
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:37.160]   so Quanza and Christmas, we'll actually
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.800]   have little Christmas trees or lights down the right hand side.
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.320]   And I think we might-- I don't remember
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.600]   if we did a Festivus one.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.840]   We have a aluminum pole or something like that.
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:49.120]   This one was more subtle.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.120]   This is a couple of years ago, if you searched for gay,
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:55.400]   you'd get a rainbow, which every website used to have.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.920]   I used to have these on my websites, these gray rainbow
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.400]   gradient bars.
[00:59:59.400 --> 00:59:59.920]   Yes.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.640]   That kind of looks like just a Google branding.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.360]   It's very subtle that you wouldn't necessarily notice that.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.840]   But that's--
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.720]   The thing about Pride Month is that there isn't one day
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.800]   that's Pride Day.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.880]   There are Pride celebrations on different weekends
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.480]   throughout the month.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.480]   So it's not like Google could do a doodle on a given day.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.560]   I mean, I guess they could.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:21.240]   But this seems like an interesting way to do the doodle.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.360]   It's like you're asking for information about this thing,
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:24.680]   and it's a celebratory month.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.840]   So this is kind of a neat little subtle thing to do versus
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.800]   doing one-day doodle on the last Sunday of the month
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.520]   or something.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.040]   That's neat.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.200]   So anything out yet?
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:33.640]   See?
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:38.080]   So Street View has been banned in Bangalore.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.880]   Soon we're going to call it Blurgalore.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.640]   That's a story Jeff Jarvis.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.040]   Why would we argument here is there are sensitive places,
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.040]   but they're always sensitive.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.360]   They're just photos.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:51.880]   It's--
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.960]   From the street!
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.840]   In all these cases, ask the analog question.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:00.000]   Can you go take a picture of this thing on your own
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:00.840]   and put it up?
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.480]   Yes, the scale of different shore.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.080]   Same with face recognition.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.760]   Can you go and take a picture of somebody
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.440]   and put it online, and somebody will recognize
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.080]   what that is?
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.200]   Yes.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.920]   So when we automate it, what makes it so evil?
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.680]   We even have an acronym, or at least I have one at Google
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.840]   that's Tanagi, which is this is not a Google issue, right?
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.120]   Because people could stand on the street
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.120]   and take the pictures.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:25.520]   So--
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:26.800]   That's good.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.600]   I like it, Tanagi.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.680]   But anything Google does becomes a Google issue.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.560]   And it spreads out in other ways.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:37.440]   I saw-- oh crap, I better forget his name now.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:42.120]   I just gave a talk on the way up here that Pitney Bose.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.200]   I'm in postal mode.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:43.560]   Really?
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:44.480]   Pitney Bose?
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.040]   They're still in business.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.400]   I did this postal thing last week.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.400]   I did Pitney Bose today.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.320]   And the guy following me is, oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.160]   I can't remember his name.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:57.360]   Wrote the book about forgetting a long German name.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.360]   Anyway.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.480]   And you forgot?
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.440]   Yeah, I forgot.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.640]   Because I forget this, exactly.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:02.640]   We know it's not--
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.720]   We know it's not Habermas.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.600]   You wouldn't forget him.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.320]   No, I wouldn't forget that.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.840]   Anyway, or Gutenberg.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:11.240]   So the way he put it was interesting to me.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:15.120]   He showed the first home pixelated in Germany.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.160]   And he said that that was an extension of PII,
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.920]   that PII was personally identifiable information
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.520]   wasn't any longer just your name or your Social Security
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.960]   number, that people were considering the view of their home
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.040]   to be personally identifiable information.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.440]   Oh, please.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:33.480]   [GRUNTING]
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.280]   I get what he was saying.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.320]   And yes, logically, that was their extension of the view.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.720]   But it's a wrong view.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:42.760]   Is it an issue that Google makes money on it?
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.320]   I mean, it can't be a privacy issue.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.720]   Because if you look at the back of my head
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.720]   when I'm walking down the street, I mean, it's a public.
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.080]   So it can't be a privacy issue.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.440]   It has to be something like it's a commercial enterprise
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:52.720]   using money.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.400]   I hear that all the time in Germany.
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.320]   There's a lot of that.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.800]   They make money on me.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.160]   Well, so does the newspaper selling you to advertise?
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.960]   I think there is anti-Americanism in here too,
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.160]   not to seem--
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.160]   No, I'm sure that's the case.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:05.960]   It's jingling-pistic.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:06.440]   But yeah.
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.480]   We deserve it.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.400]   We've earned it.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.960]   We come by it, honestly.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.960]   Anyway, so don't-- I guess they suspended the street view
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.160]   cars.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.040]   I finally saw a street view car driving down the road.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:18.520]   Cool.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.200]   Is it your first time?
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:20.680]   That's weird.
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.400]   You're so close to the Bay Area.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.760]   I mean, you're in the Bay Area.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.080]   You think they'd be everywhere all the time?
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.080]   I feel like this is the cassette deck problem, right?
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.080]   It used to be able to pop a cassette,
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.880]   the tape in, and hit record, record songs off of the radio.
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.120]   And it wasn't a big deal until File Sharing became really easy.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.640]   It's like the technology to distribute images.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.520]   People could take pictures of your house all the time,
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.440]   but you didn't know.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.160]   Well, that makes sense.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.120]   But now Google does it.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.480]   And you can see that they are.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.080]   And the tech makes it really easy to do this thing
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.600]   that everybody could always do before,
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.200]   but just was a lot of work.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.080]   And now suddenly it's kind of an issue.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.240]   That makes a lot of sense.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.360]   So it seems more just like--
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:57.320]   I know people took pictures of my house before,
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.320]   but I didn't know.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.720]   Because it was their copy.
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:00.320]   It was in their--
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.520]   Yeah, it was stuck in their SD card, in their camera,
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.080]   someplace else.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.000]   You didn't see it, right?
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.280]   So it didn't bother you.
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.760]   You just were-- I don't know.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.240]   It didn't--
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.040]   That's interesting to you.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.160]   It works both ways, too.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:13.640]   When I interviewed Philip Kaplan, Pud, he was saying
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.000]   that we got weird of that.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.120]   It's the opposite of that, is with our photos and Flickr,
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.720]   that we got weird of that when there was one creepy guy
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:23.920]   in the little tiny photo box who saw all our photos.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:24.440]   Right?
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.040]   But once it was everybody, who cares?
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.520]   But millions of people see in our photos, it's fine.
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.480]   It's the opposite of that.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:30.040]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.040]   Right.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.760]   The creepy guy in the photo booth, I forgot him.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:41.920]   Should Skype worry that--
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.920]   We talked about this RTC thing a couple of weeks ago
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.120]   that Google had kind of was starting
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:51.400]   to do web RTC, open source software, in the Chrome browser
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.880]   for video conferencing.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.080]   What's wrong with that?
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.320]   I think it's a good idea.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:02.840]   Skype cowers in fear, according to Engadget.
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:03.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.680]   A.K.A. Microsoft cowers in fear.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.200]   That's right.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.400]   Maybe they should.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.760]   When are we going to see that?
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.880]   I don't know.
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:14.600]   Not long after releasing web RTC audio and video chat
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.080]   software as open source, which was, as we mentioned
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:22.280]   a few weeks ago, Google has started putting it in Chrome.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.000]   The company's planning for web RTC
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.880]   to be a front runner for video conferencing and online chatting.
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:32.200]   And because it's royalty-free, Mozilla Opera.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.080]   I guess everybody but I, E, are encouraged to include it
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.360]   in their browser as well.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.400]   I love this.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.560]   I love building out the browser platform.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.680]   I mean, more and more, I realize--
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.280]   I mean, Google says that about the web.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.600]   I mean, they're really about making the browser
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.200]   the platform.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.960]   And what I like about that is that it's like, here's Chrome,
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.360]   which is an awesome browser.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.880]   But because we're working with standards,
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.640]   we're working on open standards, and we're using open source
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:56.880]   software, every other browser can also use this technology.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:59.200]   So you're free to go to another browser.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.640]   This is kind of the same.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.080]   This like, here's our choice.
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.240]   You can make other choices.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:07.720]   And this is the difference between native apps and browser apps.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.720]   I'm starting to call them browser apps more
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:12.320]   because they're kind of browser-based.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:12.820]   Right?
[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:14.280]   And it just makes a lot of sense for Google,
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.520]   because Chrome is an incredible platform.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:19.240]   But it also gives everyone else a chance to compete.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.040]   And so I'm all for open standards,
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.560]   open video and audio standards built into the browser.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.720]   That's great for everybody, not only Chrome OS.
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:29.640]   I mean, this isn't like Google's just doing this for Chrome OS.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.960]   Every other browser can use this.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.960]   Will there be a tripani.gina in your future?
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.880]   I can't has announced that starting next year,
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:43.440]   you can use any word as a top-level domain.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:47.200]   They call them generic TLDs or GTLDs.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:50.880]   But I don't think Gina or I will be registering them
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.280]   anytime soon because it's not cheap.
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.800]   And the application process is quite elaborate.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.520]   We're talking around, I think, $185,000.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.760]   So the only people-- there's a good article on geek.com
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.400]   explaining the process, which is quite involved.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.000]   In fact, they had to do a flow chart.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   Good God.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:14.000]   I'm fine with bureaucracy, but not $185,000.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.440]   Well, I think the idea is that it's not open to everybody.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:22.160]   It's open to HP, Apple, Google, companies like that.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:25.080]   It seems a little confusing to me to be in a world where
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:32.600]   you're told, OK, now I want you to go to FT.murdoc or something
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:33.200]   like that.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.600]   I don't know.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.760]   What's wrong with.com?
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.640]   Are we really that--
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:40.760]   And as if those companies don't have enough money to just buy
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.280]   the .com domain that they want anyway.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:43.840]   Right.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.160]   HP's got HP.com.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.960]   They use HP as an example a lot.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:51.360]   So I guess HP will be buying .hp, drivers.hp.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.360]   I guess that-- I don't know.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.160]   I just see--
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.360]   It feels spammy.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.320]   It does.
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.080]   It feels as if--
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.360]   so now there's another damned race, and somebody
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:02.880]   with more money than I have is going to get .jarvus
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.840]   and have it forever.
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.160]   And I'm all for opening things up, but if you're going to open it
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:11.160]   up, really open it up, or don't.
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:13.480]   And this halfway of only opening it up for rich people
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.120]   is very on internet, I think.
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.760]   I agree 100%.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.240]   It just bugs the hell out of me.
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:22.400]   Now, if I had $185,000 if I found it under a seat cushion,
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.960]   would I register .lio?
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.640]   I don't think so.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:29.800]   But boss, should you register .twit?
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.760]   Well, if it were $12, I would do it.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.600]   But I can't-- $185,000.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.000]   So think what I could do with that.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.480]   $10,000, would you do it?
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.920]   No.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:41.320]   No.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:42.680]   Five, I'm--
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.400]   All right, well, we've got--
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.680]   That's a lot of money, Jeff.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:45.400]   I know it is.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:48.800]   Well, I've got to buy a lot of bricks for you.
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:52.280]   I have to sell a lot of bricks for that.
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.000]   I think Google's official position
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.160]   is probably going to be that we'll
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.640]   make sure that whatever URL you use, or whatever TLD you use,
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.880]   we know how to crawl it.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.480]   And that makes perfect sense.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.480]   If you've got .film or .movie, you
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:05.480]   want to make sure that that can be returned.
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.520]   Does it make your life harder, Matt?
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.760]   Well, there will be people who have to rewrite some code,
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:10.800]   I'm sure.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.600]   The only concern that I really have
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.760]   is if you have a domain name like .bank, right,
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.960]   there's a chance for consumer confusion there.
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.960]   Do you go to citybank.com or city.bank,
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.440]   or just .bank, or--
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.120]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.000]   You know, bank.com or something like that.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.440]   So I think it will be fine.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:31.160]   In fact, it will probably make people search more
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.000]   because they won't know.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:32.560]   Do I go to--
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.080]   Do I go?
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.720]   --burger-- yeah, burgerking.com or .bank.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.200]   It's a terrible idea.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.400]   And it makes URLs less useful.
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:39.880]   Yes.
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.160]   And it's a greedy--
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.640]   I think it's a greedy ploy by I can to get--
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.360]   because think about this.
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:50.680]   You don't want a bad guy to register .bank.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:53.960]   So does that mean that Bank of America or somebody else
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:56.520]   has to spend-- for them, I guess 185,000 is no big deal.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.200]   But think of all the TLDs.
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:02.640]   I mean, is HP going to register .hp sucks?
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:05.840]   Well, what happens when BP registers .earth?
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.480]   Right.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.040]   I think this is terrible.
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.160]   Now we've hit the nail on-- this is a terrible idea.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.800]   It's got to be motivated by pure greed.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:22.400]   Well, I can also try the devil's advocate position,
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:22.920]   which is--
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:23.360]   OK, that's true.
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:26.480]   There might be some TLDs that could be known and trusted.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.320]   Like if you knew .bank really was four reputable banks,
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.680]   or if you knew that .xx really was only for porn
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.160]   or something like that, then you'd
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.520]   know where to find your banks, or you'd
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:38.200]   know where to find your porn, or something like that.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.960]   And it is true that you see a lot of really weirdly named
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.400]   .coms because they couldn't get any real domain name.
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.160]   So those would be the points that you could--
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.400]   But you could resolve that just as the phone company does
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:48.600]   by adding new area codes.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.520]   You could add a .c-o-t.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:56.520]   And then that gives you an infinite whole other equal set
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.760]   of domain names.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:58.360]   I don't know why--
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.680]   There ought to be a .movie instead of whatever--
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.440]   But I can't set it up.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.680]   Not universal.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.640]   Yes.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.200]   Because that's the other thing.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.040]   If you're universal or Sony, you're
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:13.080]   going to run for this in a hope-to-own .movie.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.520]   And it holds out everybody else.
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.680]   And nobody else can do it.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:21.720]   It becomes a restraint-- this is in the great abundant internet.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:23.000]   This is where the scarcity is.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.680]   And the irony is we just went to IPv6,
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.800]   and we have abundance of numbers again.
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.080]   And we have a scarcity of names.
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.320]   And the irony is by opening up more names
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.960]   in a limited way like this, it only
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.240]   makes the scarcity worse.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.520]   Because with .com, you have to fit it in somehow.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:42.640]   And there's virtually no limit of .com names.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:46.400]   But if you can go in and buy .bank and limit it to two banks,
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.600]   you created a new layer of scarcity.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:49.920]   Right.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.800]   I'm going to go out on a limb here
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.240]   and that say that this will never happen.
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:57.720]   Somebody's going to wake up and smell the coffee.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.960]   Because this is a bad idea.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.240]   4-square, 10 million users.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.320]   Pretty good.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.480]   I got the Swimming's badge the other day by checking in at a beach.
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:12.680]   For bidding visual, Leo.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:13.680]   I love you, bud.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:19.720]   Every time I get up, the only tweet I allow 4-square to do
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.480]   is a badge tweet.
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.360]   I don't allow it to do a tweet on a mayor ship
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:24.360]   or, god forbid, a check-in.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:27.320]   So a badge is once every two months or three months.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.440]   But invariably, I have four or five people saying,
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:33.440]   I'm unfollowing you, 4-square spammer.
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.680]   I'm happy.
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.000]   Come on, I got a badge.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:36.840]   I'm sorry for the badge.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:37.680]   You're in your swimming.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.200]   You're in your swimming.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.600]   Is 4-square-- it's not.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.640]   There's no value to 4-square.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.680]   It's fun.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:46.920]   I do it.
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.800]   Do you all do it?
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:49.160]   I do.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.440]   I've done it last.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.560]   I got to admit.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.520]   I've signed up, but I haven't really gotten into it.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.800]   And it was strange because I went skydiving this weekend.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.440]   And the people went there, and then they were like,
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.600]   how do I check in to show that I skydived?
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.800]   And I was like, you know, just skydive.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.400]   Just a joke.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:06.880]   No, no, no.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.720]   You want the badge.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.320]   You want the wind in my hair badge.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.880]   There needs to be a record.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:15.400]   4-square needs to say that you went--
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.120]   I don't believe the equivalent was skydiving.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.280]   4-square needs to validate.
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.160]   That's actually the fun thing about 4-square.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.160]   I mean, people are at 30,000 feet about to jump out
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:25.960]   of an airplane, and they're creating a new 4-square location
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:29.000]   at that GPS, saying 30,000 feet about to jump out
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:29.360]   of an airplane.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.280]   That's 3D.
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:31.800]   I'm the mayor.
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:35.160]   Do you guys check into Facebook places?
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:35.680]   No.
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.400]   Good God, no.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.800]   I allow latitude to automatically check me in,
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.200]   because that's nice.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.000]   It just does it.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.160]   I like latitude, actually.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.920]   I use latitude, but that one's completely automatic.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.280]   Fair-square square is good at the gaming component.
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.640]   By the way, 4-square pointed out there
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.640]   is an actual mayor who's a mayor.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.240]   The mayor of New York City is the mayor of City Hall.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:56.960]   Nice.
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.200]   I went to City Hall.
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.560]   And I'm trying to remember, did I--
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.080]   I don't think I saw Bloomberg as the mayor.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:01.320]   I don't know.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.080]   Maybe he had been--
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.000]   I thought it was-- maybe I'm wrong.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.360]   That's right, though.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:10.320]   Bloomberg's CTO Rachel Stern, who's a wonderful, wonderful
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:10.760]   young woman.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:11.520]   I follow her on Twitter.
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:12.480]   I did not know who she was.
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.480]   She was his CTO.
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:14.320]   I just followed her.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:14.920]   She's that now.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:15.520]   Yeah.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.800]   Rachel's just a big fan of hers, and she's great.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:22.440]   So I'm sure that she had a little something to do with that.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.240]   Well, let me look.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.520]   Because I have the infographic here.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.000]   This is actually a cool infographic
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.120]   showing how Facebook grew from 0 to 10 million users
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.200]   in just a couple of years.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.080]   Of 4-square.
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:35.520]   4-square.
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:35.920]   What did I say?
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.360]   Facebook 4-square.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:39.120]   This is interesting.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:40.600]   Happiness.
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.640]   So happy-- the happier you are, the bluer you are,
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:44.920]   which is wrong.
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:47.160]   And the unhappier you are, the redder you are.
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:50.080]   And so this in Manhattan looks like people downtown
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:54.440]   are more happy than people on the Upper East Side.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:54.960]   Makes sense.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.640]   Is this sentiment analysis of the--
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:57.640]   Yeah, of tweets.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.440]   Of shouts, yes.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:14:58.960]   Oh, nice.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:14:59.960]   Isn't that cool?
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:07.160]   It says, 6 to 1 ratio of yays to ugs globally.
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.160]   Here's some life moments.
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:11.800]   And here it is, the actual mayor, real-world mayors
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:16.560]   enthroned on 4-square at Mike Bloomberg Mayor of City Hall,
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.200]   New York City.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.520]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.600]   Sweet.
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.560]   And Rachel Stern probably gets the credit for that.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.320]   This is kind of a nice infographic they did.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.360]   There it is.
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:25.720]   One.
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.840]   Is Staten Island just red or--
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:29.360]   Aw.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:29.880]   Sorry.
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:30.360]   No.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.240]   No, there's not that many--
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.360]   Is that Staten Island right here down here?
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:33.840]   Where is it?
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:34.640]   Yeah, like bottom left.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:37.320]   There's hardly anybody checking in there.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.440]   You got a problem with that?
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:41.120]   There's four happy people.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.840]   And five-and-a-half of it's a dub.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.320]   That might be Ellis Island.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.320]   Ellis Island?
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.320]   That's all right.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:47.840]   That's all right.
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.400]   In London, not a lot of happiness in London.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.320]   This is the London eye right there, I think, is the blue part.
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.920]   Hong Kong, only the people on the coast.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:57.680]   Isn't that funny?
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.160]   I just think that's hysterical.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:03.160]   Where people go, apparel, banks, convenience, and home and retail
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:04.760]   are the most popular chains.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.640]   This is what Dennis has been wanting to do,
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.720]   is to now finally start feeding back the data.
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:13.720]   Google's great value is that it takes what we do and gives it
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.160]   back to us by adding value along the way.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:20.120]   And this is where a four-square can start to prove some value to us.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.080]   I mean, it can tell you as an individual how often you've
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:24.760]   nicked in for that coffee.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:28.720]   It can tell us as a country and group of friends what we're doing.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.800]   And that's when it starts to gain some added value.
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.320]   That's actually why I love latitude,
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:36.240]   because I love the graph on the dashboard saying you only spend,
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.800]   you know, 11 hours a day at work or something.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:42.520]   Actually, it's kind of embarrassing.
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.760]   I don't spend much time at work at all.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:45.760]   Oh, no.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.360]   No, I don't.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.640]   You're just productive.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.000]   That's right.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.360]   We all see how present you are.
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.920]   You're on all the time, Leo.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:54.640]   I'm not, though.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:55.480]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:56.880]   I'll pull up my dashboard and show you.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.680]   But anyway, before we do that, I'm going to take a break.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:02.440]   And we are going to get your tool.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.360]   No, I have a tool.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.560]   You have a tip, and you have a number.
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:08.600]   And Matt has something too for us, I believe.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.360]   Coming up in just a bit before we do that,
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.640]   we do want to mention our good friends at Netflix.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:16.000]   I don't even know why I do an ad for Netflix.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.120]   It's like Coles to Newcastle.
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:20.080]   Show of hands, how many of you are not yet
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:20.800]   Netflix members?
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:21.640]   Nobody.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:22.640]   Zero.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:23.480]   Oh, you.
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:24.480]   OK, would you please do this?
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.280]   Go to Netflix.ci/famine.
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.880]   Netflix.com/twit.
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:29.880]   And sign up for Netflix.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:30.600]   Now, here's the deal.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:32.320]   Forget the DVD by mail thing.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:33.320]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.840]   But the watch instantly, you never
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.680]   have to think ahead anymore.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:37.920]   You just go home.
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.240]   You fire up your PlayStation 3, your Xbox 360, your Nintendo
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:44.120]   Wii, your Roku box, your Blu-ray player.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:48.360]   A lot of TVs now have Netflix on them, your Apple, your iPhone
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:51.280]   and your iPad, many Android phones now.
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:52.680]   And you just go there.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:55.600]   But boom, you're watching a movie.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:58.680]   I love Netflix, and it's $7.99 a month for the streaming only
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:17:59.200]   subscription.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.520]   Now, that is a great deal.
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:03.600]   Try everything, the whole thing, the whole thing free,
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.920]   Netflix.com/twit.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.120]   And if you decide you want it, you
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.600]   don't have to do anything, but they'll know.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.600]   They'll know it's us.
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.720]   Hard day's night, love that scary movie, love that.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:20.280]   No, I don't love that.
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.920]   Hackers, one of the worst movies about hacking ever made,
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:26.400]   Angelina Jolie.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:27.280]   Oh, we're watching it.
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:27.720]   Look at that.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:30.080]   Look how instantly you could just watch a movie even just
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.440]   on an impulse.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.720]   And now, Mad Men, coming soon to Netflix, along with glee,
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.240]   Netflix.com/twit.
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.880]   Look, the movie is about to start.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:43.280]   Look at that.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.720]   Should we just watch hackers for one?
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:46.560]   No, maybe not.
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.560]   Oh, I forgot Angelina Jolie, popular.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.160]   Yes, yes, I forgot.
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:56.440]   I asked Cara Swisher what her favorite movie was.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.920]   No, we were talking about salt.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.640]   She says, salt.
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:01.400]   Angelina Jolie, what more do you need to know?
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.200]   Yeah, basically.
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:04.400]   The tourist, too.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.640]   That was just like watch Angelina Jolie and Johnny
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.560]   Depp do things.
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.560]   Like fine.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.520]   It's fine.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:09.800]   Really?
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:10.640]   I haven't seen that yet.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.640]   All right, I'll have to watch that.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.800]   It's worth just the visual feast.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.160]   A visual feast.
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:16.680]   Yes.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:17.480]   Both of them.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.640]   Another side of Gina.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:20.960]   We thought it was all just glee.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:27.960]   We could do our special crushes edition.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:29.920]   Gina's crushes.
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:33.360]   Next, on a very special this week in Google.
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.240]   We eat starts this weekend.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:36.520]   That tells you something about mine.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:37.720]   Yeah, I love weeks.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.000]   And I love her.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.880]   Yes, she's awesome.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:42.920]   Sons of anarchy?
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.240]   Anybody watch that?
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.080]   No, what's that all about?
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.440]   So it is on Netflix.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.960]   And I watched the first two seasons.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:51.920]   And then after that, you have to do Amazon on demand
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.400]   or something.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.160]   Is it British?
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.880]   No, it's FX or something.
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:57.680]   It's about a motorcycle gang.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:58.920]   It's really, really good.
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.120]   Oh, so Sons of Action.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:00.480]   That you get.
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:02.040]   That you surprise me constantly.
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:04.360]   Your climbing mountains, your jumping out of planes,
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:05.560]   you're in a motorcycle gangs.
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.040]   You just don't look the part, my friend.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.560]   He's amazing, isn't he?
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:09.920]   He doesn't look the part to me.
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:10.280]   Just imagine.
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.240]   Is this how you get your aggression out?
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.840]   Because I just talked about you this morning at Pity Bose.
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:17.880]   I tell the story about you and buying the scale on Blippi
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.840]   and all that and talk about how you're surprisingly
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:22.680]   one of the nicest guys on earth when you have the most
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.440]   right to be a cynical ass.
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:26.400]   And you're not.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.560]   So now I guess I'm in this picture.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:30.520]   Is this how you get your aggression out?
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.360]   I can neither confirm nor deny.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.360]   So you have a motorcycle?
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.280]   I don't.
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:39.560]   I can see you on a Harley, a big fat hog, maybe a little
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.280]   Vespa scooter or something.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:45.800]   So here's my latitude dashboard, 24,279 miles travel.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.440]   But this is the one that's embarrassing.
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:50.480]   20 hours a week average at work.
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.920]   Because it's lying to you.
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:53.600]   Leo, you're there all the time.
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:56.640]   Google Latitude never lies.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:57.760]   Oh, it does have the wrong address, though.
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:00.440]   Maybe.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:03.760]   I've only spent half my time next door, apparently.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.200]   At time at home-- there's my home address.
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.200]   Never mind.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:07.320]   Time spent out.
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.880]   27 hours a week out of the house.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:10.520]   It's cool.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:11.800]   I just think it's cool.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:12.320]   It's cool.
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:12.840]   I love it.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.720]   And it does that all automatically.
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:18.000]   And for all I know, it's sending it to the CIA, which is great.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.200]   It saves me time on explaining where I've been.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:22.000]   No, it doesn't.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.560]   I have no, it doesn't, of course not.
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.080]   No, it wouldn't.
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.000]   Never.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.240]   You have nothing to hide.
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:27.960]   I don't.
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:28.560]   I don't.
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.200]   I don't.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:35.760]   So let's do Matt's Google word of the day.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.320]   Excellent.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.640]   My word of the day is agglutinative.
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:39.560]   What?
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.440]   So I've never heard of this word before,
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.640]   but I was reading the official Google blog.
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.840]   And they were talking about how they added support
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:48.080]   for five new, Indic languages.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:48.480]   Wow.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:51.720]   So Bengali, Tamil, Telugu.
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:54.920]   And they mentioned the word agglutinative, which evidently
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:22:00.160]   means when you add extra words, it means sticky.
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:04.640]   So you add things on the end to sort of say the tense or the number
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.720]   or something like that.
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:06.960]   So agglutinative.
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:07.600]   So that's good.
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.280]   It's like from the root gluten.
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:10.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.040]   It's like German.
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:14.000]   Yeah, you stick a whole bunch of words together,
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.360]   or Russian, those kinds of languages.
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:19.160]   This term was introduced by Wilhelm von Homboldt in 1836,
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:23.120]   the class of languages from a morphological point of view.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.080]   That's really good.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:24.920]   So agglutinative.
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:25.720]   Very thank you.
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:28.520]   We should do that more often, Matt, the word of the day.
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:29.600]   I'll do the phrase of the day.
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.120]   I smell a calendar coming on.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.800]   I want to do the phrase of the day, because I love that.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.720]   And it wasn't yours, but you did quote the Gutenberg
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.320]   parenthesis.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:38.960]   And I didn't-- yeah.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:43.160]   I mentioned it, but I didn't define it, Jeff.
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.800]   From a bunch of researchers at the University of Southern Denmark,
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.520]   and they argued that before Gutenberg, we
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.960]   were very much about process and flow,
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.560]   and everything got remixed as it was passed around.
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:57.240]   And then in the 500 years dominated by text,
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:00.280]   everything was set down and permanent and serial,
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.000]   and beginning to end and everything.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.240]   And now we're coming back out on the other side of the parenthesis.
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:07.720]   We're going back to flow and remix,
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.960]   and things are being malleable and plastic.
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.320]   And that's what's blowing our minds.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:15.560]   That's why people object to things like algorithms
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:18.760]   instead of editors, and to not having things in a finite form
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.040]   like an article.
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:22.680]   And so the Gutenberg parenthesis becomes a wonderful way,
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:25.600]   I think, to explain the different ways we're now
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:30.960]   cognating the world based on how media is changing around us.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.960]   And I gather that the notion of parenthesis
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:37.120]   is that it began with Gutenberg, but it's ending out.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:37.880]   Yes.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.080]   Here's interesting little factoid.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.080]   There's a bright young guy named Noah--
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.480]   crap, now I'm going to forget another name.
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:47.720]   Noah-- Noah, where your last name is--
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:52.080]   who worked with people at Reed College on a paper.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:57.600]   And he said they tried to analyze the most important patent--
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:58.120]   Noah Pepper.
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:01.200]   Thank you, Noah Pepper-- patents of recent years,
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:04.120]   and they did it by just looking at citations within patents.
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:06.320]   So it was a closed universe.
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.120]   And he said that the most important patent
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:14.760]   was the inkjet printer, because apparently it
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:18.280]   was a new thing that says we're going to physically place
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:20.160]   matter exactly where we want it.
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.560]   Wow.
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:24.400]   And so that's what leads to things like 3D printers
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.840]   and distributed manufacturing and all kinds of other things,
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.080]   right?
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.040]   But it also struck me with--
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.120]   it's interesting, is not only does the Gutenberg age of text
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:36.360]   start to come to-- not a close, but it comes to the next phase.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:39.600]   But similarly, the whole technology
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:44.520]   of impressing ink on paper physically
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.000]   is also going to go away.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:46.920]   Yes.
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:48.040]   We had 500 years of it.
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.600]   It would probably no invention in the history of mankind
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:53.920]   has had this kind of staining power and this kind of impact.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.640]   And it led to so much else.
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:57.960]   But we're now going to do that same process
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:00.080]   by all kinds of other ways--
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:05.520]   zero-ography, inkjet, screens, e-ink, all these other ways,
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:08.720]   and physically-impressing ink on paper
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:11.200]   starts to die with, which I find-- pardon me,
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:15.200]   I'm geeking out right now, but I find that interesting.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.400]   No, in fact, I think that the measure of what you just said
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.960]   is true is how much letter set letter press printing
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:28.720]   has become a hipster artifact that it's instead of being,
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:30.840]   oh, yeah, that's how you print.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:32.320]   Ooh, isn't this cool?
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.360]   In fact, I think it's--
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:40.120]   Dig has letter press business cards, a real thick stock,
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:41.080]   and they're pressed in there.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:42.560]   Yeah, I could feel them.
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:46.680]   It's the ultimate hipster artifact, but printing press.
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:49.680]   I got so upset, I missed a Kickstarter project
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.760]   where they're bringing back out of an archive,
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:54.720]   a type foundry.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.120]   The operates, not unlike the way Gutenberg did.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:59.120]   You have the flat thing at the bottom
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:01.360]   with the letter impressed on it, and then you put it
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.000]   into a mold and you pour the metal in,
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.320]   and that becomes the font.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.320]   That's cool.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.320]   That's cool.
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:08.160]   And they're reopening.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.480]   And if you gave enough money, if you gave $75,
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.680]   you'd get a headline out of a Ludlow machine.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.040]   I desperately want.
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.760]   Wow.
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:16.240]   Not anyway, geeking.
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:17.880]   Geeking out, as always.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:21.640]   Gina Trippani, our tip of the week.
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:23.360]   Tip of the week, forget ink on paper.
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:26.960]   You can now copy and paste images on your clipboard.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:30.160]   So an image that's on your clipboard into Gmail, which
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:30.680]   is cool.
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:32.480]   So if you want to attach an image,
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:35.320]   you don't have to open the file box and all that stuff.
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:37.600]   So you have to have rich text enabled.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.040]   I usually deal with plain text.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.120]   So rich text has to be enabled.
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:41.880]   And it's really good for sending screenshots.
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:44.480]   You can do a control command shift
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:47.000]   for to get a screenshot onto your clipboard and the Mac.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.280]   You can just control V into Gmail on Chrome.
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:52.120]   And I think the shortcut is like all print screen
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:52.720]   on Windows.
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:53.200]   Same deal.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.080]   So all of this seems to be motivated by the Chromebook.
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.600]   Don't you think that this is like the more
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.080]   we put into the browser capabilities?
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.280]   Although there's not a whole lot of--
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:04.480]   I don't know if there's a situation where you would have
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.240]   an image on your clipboard on the--
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.360]   I guess you don't have a-- do you have a clipboard even?
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.600]   I don't know.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:10.760]   There is definitely a clipboard.
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.260]   I don't know.
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:12.760]   I guess you could select an image and a web page
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:13.600]   and get it on your clipboard.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.200]   Yeah, it makes sense.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:16.480]   But yeah, I think this is just all about sort of--
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:19.400]   the whole objection to web apps was well.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.600]   You can't deal with file the way you can in native app.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:26.040]   And I think this is just about breaking down those walls.
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.520]   By the way, Life Hacker has a new book by somebody you might know,
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:32.880]   Gina Tapanian Adam Pish.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.920]   The new edition of the Life Hacker book is out.
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:37.480]   Yeah, lifehackerbook.com just came out this week.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:39.480]   Adam did the revisions.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:40.480]   And I did the tech edit.
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:46.080]   So I got to edit him again, which I'm sure he loved.
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:46.800]   And the book is out.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:48.640]   It's available on Amazon.
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:51.080]   There will be in Bookstore, so check it out.
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:54.160]   I'm kicking myself now because I have the first one.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:57.280]   And I should have had you autograph that when you were here.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:00.120]   I'm kicking myself.
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.240]   Well, you'll have to come back.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:03.000]   We've got the new one on its way to you, Leo.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.120]   Oh, good.
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:07.160]   But I like the first one is like, great.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:08.680]   First divisions are more valuable.
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:09.720]   It's just more valuable.
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:12.120]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.880]   I found this interesting.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.880]   Google said to the FCC that voice communication is now
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.160]   the tail wagging the dog.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.880]   And the numbers they gave I loved.
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.600]   In 1997-- I'm going to throw out a lot of numbers here,
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.960]   but I'll make it as cogent as I can.
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:32.960]   In 1997, there were 54,000 terabytes of voice data
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.000]   and 3.3,000 terabytes.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.640]   So 54 versus 3.3 terabytes of internet.
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:47.760]   Jump to 2015, where voice data off the internet, non-V-O-I-P,
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:54.200]   is 26,000 terabytes, half of what it used to be in '97.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:29:00.600]   IP, that is 23,000 terabytes.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:03.120]   So the two of them add up to the voice that you had in '97.
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.400]   That's what's happening.
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:08.360]   But the mind used to-- that's 26,000, 23,000.
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:12.720]   Internet is 19 million terabytes of data.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.800]   And in the TechCrunch post, there's a big circle
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:19.000]   that shows the internet and little dots that show voice
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.560]   and the FCC and regulation are paying more attention
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.560]   to voice when the internet is now 160,000--
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:30.840]   160 times rather, 160 times that of the voice network.
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:33.080]   So that's my number of the week.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.280]   My tool of the week comes from Denmark via the great Google
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:40.520]   Maps mania blog.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:43.240]   And apparently, I guess this makes sense
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:46.160]   that when you-- I just think of the Blues Brothers and Carrie
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:49.440]   Fisher's hair salon, Curl Up and Die.
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:52.000]   Apparently, when you start a hair salon,
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.480]   you pretty much-- you have to have a pun in the name.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:59.720]   To prove this, a Danish website, I won't cut my hair.
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:02.120]   What I find interesting is they use the OpenStreetMaps
