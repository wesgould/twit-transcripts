[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.960]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.640]   And we're going to talk about Google and the cloud.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.240]   Now we can use the word cloud because Apple has certified
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.200]   that everybody knows what the word cloud means.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.720]   Partly cloudy, Gina, Trippani, right?
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.280]   You got it.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.680]   Gina from smarterware.org.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.040]   But you can call her Gina.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.920]   I can't get the Trippani right.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.280]   Gina Tripani is here.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.720]   It's OK.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.480]   It's OK.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.600]   Honey is OK.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.760]   If I were trying to figure out how we can get Gina on Twitter
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.800]   on Sunday because she's going to be very close to here
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.120]   for Tim O'Reilly's food camp at the O'Reilly headquarters.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.480]   But we will make that happen.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.360]   I would love to get you there.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.760]   I need to see the cottage before the new--
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.120]   We should have a werewolf tournament.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.480]   And then should I succeed in fooling you
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.520]   about my werewolf heritage?
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.120]   I'm going to accuse you instantly.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.400]   That's not going to work.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.760]   Well, then you're going to accuse me back.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.480]   And then it's just a matter of who believes who.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.600]   It's actually a sure destruction.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.880]   It's a game, folks.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.080]   It's a geek game.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.720]   They play at these kinds of things.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.320]   No, really?
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.960]   No, I think there's probably people who
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.240]   say, what are you talking about?
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.080]   Don't you think?
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.440]   That's Jeff Jarvis right there.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.760]   He knows he's never been to fool, but he has been to me.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.880]   No, I'm afraid I won't get invited again.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.240]   Yes.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.640]   Well, we're going to tell everybody, please,
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.320]   we want Jeff to come to food camp.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.400]   So please invite.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.920]   You know, you can't lobby for this.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.640]   There's no way--
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.240]   That you don't get invited.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.360]   So let's catch me too.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.920]   If you have to ask--
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.440]   No!
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.120]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.480]   He is also on the Twitter at Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.880]   And he is the author of What Would Google Do?
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.360]   And better bookstores everywhere.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.680]   Also joining us right now, Adam Pash from likefacker.com.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.680]   He's the tip guy.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.200]   Lou?
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.560]   Life hacker that--
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.200]   I don't know why I have trouble saying life hacker.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.400]   Life hacker--
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   You should be used to it by now.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.720]   Dot com.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.120]   Great to have you back, Adam.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.320]   Yeah, thanks for having me back.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.200]   It's an happy IPV6 day, everybody.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.720]   [WHOOOOSH]
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   Yes.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.040]   Gina, you're the geeky in the crowd, the programmer.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.160]   What the hell is IPV6 day?
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.160]   Uh-oh.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.320]   I wasn't there for this at all.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.320]   Uh-oh.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.840]   Uh-oh.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.160]   I'll tell you.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.880]   I'll tell you in my cracked way, and then you can correct me, OK?
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.520]   OK.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.400]   So we ran out of internet addresses.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.080]   Who to thunk it?
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.360]   Because the current system IP version 4--
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.800]   you know, it's TCP/IP, the internet protocol,
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.560]   the current version of the internet protocol, version 4--
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.920]   only allows for--
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.760]   well, it's a dotted quad.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.880]   So it's 8 bits by 8 bits by 8 bits by 8 bits.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.320]   It's 4 bytes, which I think is what?
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.760]   4 billion-- no, 2 billion addresses.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.720]   4 billion addresses.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.400]   Anyway, we ran out and we're running out.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.920]   Running out.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.680]   Yep.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.840]   In fact, in some areas, they have run out.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.040]   Not because there are that many devices,
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.440]   but what happens is whole blocks of addresses
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.240]   get assigned to universities, internet service providers.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.240]   And there are some universities that have, you know,
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.400]   like 400 million addresses.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.040]   And--
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.400]   The boss wants every device in the world
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.080]   gets connected, then that's what's going to happen.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.760]   And you will run out.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.080]   So they've come up with a solution IP version 6.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.640]   So it's 4 billion, 2 to the 32th addresses.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.000]   This new one is 2 to the--
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.400]   they've added another 8 bits, another byte.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.240]   So it's 5 bytes.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.120]   So that would be 2 to the 32 squared.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.800]   It's a lot.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.960]   It's, in fact, they say more addresses--
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.080]   not squared.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.120]   I don't know.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.440]   2 to the 128th.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.640]   That's what it is.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.760]   It's so many addresses.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.120]   It's 128 bits.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.680]   So it's so many addresses that you could give every molecule
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.720]   in the galaxy its own internet address,
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.360]   and you'd still have some left over.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.520]   In fact, so many addresses that--
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.560]   How many addresses?
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.960]   It's a lot of addresses.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.840]   So many addresses that there's a company called Hurricane
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.800]   Electric, which has become kind of a big proselytizer
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.440]   for IPV6, H-E.com, that will give you an IPV6 address.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.000]   Actually, they'll give you a block of addresses.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.480]   They'll give you a block of addresses.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.920]   So big that it's actually bigger than the current IPV
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.400]   for total universe.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.240]   Free.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.240]   They'll just give it to you.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.480]   So today is a test day in which many websites, including
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.000]   Facebook and the Google, will offer IPV6 packets
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.480]   to see if it breaks.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.200]   And so far, I think we're going all right, right?
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.720]   Yeah, we're doing pretty well, right?
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.400]   Nobody-- Google predicted fewer than 1% errors.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.440]   That is 1% of people not being able to reach their site
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.760]   because their router is misconfigured,
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.120]   or their internet service provider is misconfigured.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.720]   Google's doing it.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.440]   Yahoo's doing it.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.920]   As I said, Facebook is doing it.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.280]   I don't see current numbers, but the estimates
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.920]   were maybe as many as a million people.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.400]   Yeah, I think I saw 0.3%, 0.4%, which I think
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.320]   amounted to about a million total of what, like 2 billion?
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.080]   Still, that's a lot.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.920]   A million people who can't get to what it says a lot.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.080]   Of the however many billion.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.000]   Well, this will seem--
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.320]   We'll see.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.680]   I also think one of the big things for the switch
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.600]   is it gets rid of--
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.040]   or it's trying to provide unique IPs for every device,
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.000]   as opposed to get around a lot of the problems with Nat
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.520]   and DHCP where you've got a route internally
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.040]   and to get to a device, then you have to go through a router.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.280]   I think isn't the goal also with IPV6.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.000]   It expands the protocol and improves the protocol from IPV4.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.280]   And it does give you-- or aims to give you direct devices,
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.160]   direct connections to devices, direct addresses for devices
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.240]   without having to do all that routing.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.200]   Most people is really not designed
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.080]   to see if end users are broken.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.040]   Most people won't see any problem.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.000]   But the IPV6 in general, that transition, part of that
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.960]   is so that you don't have to deal with all the hassle.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.880]   You don't have to be like a network admin
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.360]   to get your devices all connected at home and stuff like that.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.800]   You just need a new router.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.600]   You need a new hardware.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.720]   Most operating systems are IPV6 capable.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.160]   Most routers are-- currently sold routers are not.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.360]   I think Apple stuff is of all things.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.000]   But most ISPs haven't done it either.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.480]   In fact, there's some speculation
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.920]   that most ISPs will just get around this whole thing
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.520]   by doing what's called IPV6 Nat, where they'll
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.640]   do the netting for you.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.360]   They'll still give you an IPV4 address,
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.120]   and they'll use IPV6 Nat.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.960]   So it actually could get quite ugly.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.920]   A lot of-- we shall see what happens.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.880]   This is like a Google I/O, and everyone shows up
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.440]   with a laptop and a phone and sometimes a tablet.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.320]   So people have three devices on them that get to the network.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.200]   And then they wait to give you the giveaway,
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.280]   because they know that everyone's going to fire up
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.720]   yet another device on their person that's
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.280]   going to be connecting to the network.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.440]   I mean, we're going to come to a point
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.040]   where every person has several devices on them
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.040]   at one point.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.400]   And that saved us for a long time.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.240]   And one of the reasons we didn't run out of addresses sooner--
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.320]   I know Vince Surf-- I remember talking to Vince Surf
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.440]   10 years ago, and he said, we're going to run out of--
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.120]   we're running out of addresses.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.760]   And he should know.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.960]   He's the father of the internet.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.680]   But he was a guy who came up, I think, with a protocol.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.080]   But it turned out Nat addressed routing in your--
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.040]   in routers everywhere--
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.560]   saved us for a long time.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.040]   But we are now, in fact, in trouble.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.440]   I've got a different question, though.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.560]   When everything has a sim, your car now
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.240]   has a sim.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.720]   I'm carrying three or four devices that have sims.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.640]   You only carry 40 devices that have sims.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.560]   We are going to-- and they all have phone numbers, which
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.280]   I don't necessarily understand why they need to.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.640]   But we really got to run out of phone numbers, aren't we?
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.760]   Yeah, that's an interesting point.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.440]   We have 10 digit phone numbers.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.880]   So yeah, you could see pretty quickly
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.960]   we'd run out of phone numbers.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.160]   There has been some talk, I think, of going to 11 digit
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160]   phone numbers, which probably would break down.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.880]   That's going to happen eventually, right?
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.400]   I mean, phone numbers have been kind of expanding over time.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.000]   You know, we have an interesting-- actually,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.960]   this brings up kind of an interesting question
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.800]   that I hadn't really thought about talking about on this show.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.080]   But actually, this would be the perfect show
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.240]   to talk about it.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.520]   So we're building a new studio.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.320]   It's a big office.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.560]   We have 17 employees.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.960]   It's a 10,000 square foot studio.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.640]   We'll probably have many more employees down the road.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.920]   Normally, when you build an office,
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.000]   you put a phone system in, don't you?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.680]   A what?
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.680]   A phone.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.560]   I bet you, right now on your desk, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.520]   you have some sort of PBX phone system.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.360]   Yeah, barely.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.840]   It's the world's worst system.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.360]   The city university has.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.280]   So my question is, is that a--
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.000]   I saw you shaking your head, Gina.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.040]   What should we do?
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.680]   We can't-- what we're looking at is a virtual phone system.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.800]   It's basically a hosted asterisk server.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.400]   And then you buy phones.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.720]   But it's $20 per seat per phone.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.360]   And I'm starting to think, what do you even need a phone
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.160]   and a business for anymore?
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.840]   At UC San Diego, all the new buildings built on campus,
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.160]   like brand new construction, no phone lines, no cable lines.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:31.760]   Wow.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.640]   Just high speed, just high speed internet access.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.120]   Well, that's basically we have.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.760]   The new studio has 35 megabits of Symmetric,
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.280]   plenty of bandwidth.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.440]   Every employee has a cell phone.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.240]   Gina, there's no in-university phone number for people.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:48.960]   Well, there are.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.040]   This is just for new buildings, new construction,
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.560]   that they're not running land lines.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.400]   We're in this weird transitional state.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.160]   Yeah, we are.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.040]   Where some of my employees would like a phone on their desk.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.640]   Some of my employees will like to use their cell phone.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.080]   Some of my employees would like to use Google Voice or Skype.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.240]   I think that's what I'll use.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.280]   I'll just have an IP-based solution on my desk.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.920]   I was thinking, should I have a--
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.760]   but what happens now?
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.120]   We have a receptionist at the front lobby.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.640]   Do you have a phone?
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.720]   Well, this is good.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.040]   And I should say that I'm talking
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.920]   about residential student buildings.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.560]   I'm not talking about administration buildings.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.760]   Administration buildings, faculty,
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.800]   do have phones on their desk still.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.800]   But I have a really interesting choice that they decide.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.840]   We have a virtual service right now called Grasshopper.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.680]   It's an 800 number.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.960]   When you call it, there doesn't ring any phones here.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.000]   It just rings whatever.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.440]   So everybody's got an extension on it,
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.040]   and you tell it what to ring.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.540]   Right.
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.600]   You just focus upon.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.080]   The main problem is when people use trunk lines and stuff,
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.880]   and the number that shows up on your phone,
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.560]   the callback number is not the right number.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.560]   Most irritating thing on earth today.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.680]   I just thought--
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.120]   You know, I know that people in their homes
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.720]   are kind of a slowly getting rid of land lines.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.560]   But if you're doing a modern business,
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.880]   well, I don't even know what to do.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.000]   I think you've got to go-- I think all decisions,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.840]   when you come to a fork of the road,
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.240]   you of all people have to take the modern fork.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.240]   I think so.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.800]   There's no U-turn for you, man.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.360]   You're going forward.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.080]   No phones.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:13.840]   That's it.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.760]   Well, I lean our producers here.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.760]   Now, Eileen is one of the few people in the business
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.760]   who would be making outbound calls to guests,
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.680]   and then have to have them call her back.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.040]   So I would think, Eileen, you would want a phone.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.120]   She's going, eh.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.120]   She uses your cell phones.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.280]   I'm going to fancy getting rid of these.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.560]   You've got to hang around.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.560]   Yeah, but maybe not a desk phone.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.240]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.240]   But we don't want--
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:38.840]   I lean those.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.360]   It's cheaper to buy a land line and to buy everyone of a
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:41.920]   cell phone.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.520]   I'm not going to give everybody cell phones.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.360]   But you can give them--
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.520]   I think they just use Google Voice.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.960]   I use a phone at home, and it doesn't work very well.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.880]   Right.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.600]   You know, an internet-based one.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.160]   But I lean these--
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.600]   She should go to Android with all choices.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.800]   Well, she's an Android user.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.760]   She doesn't show called all about Android.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.400]   I don't think that's a question.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.320]   Zach.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.880]   So she's got to use that.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.400]   She's using a Nexus S.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:11.720]   I don't know.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.840]   I think it's a very interesting question that I hadn't really
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:19.400]   thought about, but we sat down yesterday and said, OK, we
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.720]   have an IT guy.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.920]   What are we going to do about phones?
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.480]   And it's like, I don't know.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.800]   What's going to happen in the new Apple spaceship?
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.400]   Oh, is that it?
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.640]   Did you see the video?
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.160]   First of all, I have to say--
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.640]   Steve was on stage on Monday at the WWDC.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.280]   And by the end, I felt really bad for him.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.320]   He seemed very tired.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.560]   He was very thin, very frail.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.440]   There's a very touching picture on the San Francisco
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.760]   Chronicle God of him and his wife at the end of it.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.440]   And it's a beautiful moving picture,
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.080]   but I have to say, very sad.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.720]   And now we see a video of Steve.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.840]   I guess he's still got a lot of energy pitching
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:14:00.760]   this Cupertino City Council on building a spaceship.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.800]   It's like a round Pentagon.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.320]   It's a donut.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.320]   The presentation was as if he were presenting the iPad.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.040]   The presentation was just very familiar kind of Steve's style.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.400]   These are these incredible numbers
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.960]   that you can't possibly disagree with.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.320]   We're putting more trees in.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.840]   This is very similar to his consumer product launch
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.160]   presentations.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.240]   Should I play a little bit of this?
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.520]   It's on YouTube.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.360]   Now, I guess it must have been on the local City Council
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.480]   channel or whatever it is that they have in Cupertino.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.120]   This is Steve Jobs addressing the Cupertino--
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.800]   let me see if I can get this going here--
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.040]   City Council.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.160]   I get one card here.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.920]   By the way, there's nobody in the audience.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.440]   Oh, wow.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.760]   Anybody knew he was going to do this?
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.240]   Well, maybe they closed it off.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.720]   I thought people showed up after.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.200]   It's just him.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.120]   I thought I saw people.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.080]   He's just sitting in the front row there.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:55.160]   Apple seal, Mr. Jobs to be here and sharing the information
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:55.760]   with it.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.840]   Welcome, Mr. Jobs.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.720]   Mr. Jobs and then the train whistle.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.360]   Oh, there are-- there's a couple people.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.320]   There.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.720]   Who comes Steve with his bottle of water,
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.120]   his black turtleneck and his skinny jeans.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.720]   I'm going to play a agenda tonight just to highlight
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.760]   your present--
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.240]   I don't have much of a presentation.
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.520]   I mostly just came down to tell you something.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.000]   All right.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.160]   And get your feedback on it.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.080]   Yeah, I think this is a lot for the wrong video.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:21.560]   You know, we--
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.720]   This is not the right video?
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.600]   And my parents garage 30 years ago.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.560]   I don't think so.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.000]   How many times has he gone to talk to the super-cooperteous?
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.040]   Because he definitely gave it a keynote--
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:31.760]   the one I watched.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.600]   I don't know, maybe I watched it.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:32.800]   No, you're right.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.280]   You're right.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.040]   It's the wrong one.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.480]   That's what I've been told.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.360]   Chat room.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.040]   Let's go to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.280]   They've never steered me wrong.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.760]   How about the San Jose Mercury News?
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.640]   They have to have the right video.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.120]   All right.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:49.680]   There you go.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.320]   Link in the chat room.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.840]   Thank you, chat room.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.520]   You too.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.120]   I showed the wrong YouTube video.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.760]   So there's another presentation.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.720]   You can actually watch Steve Jobs present to the--
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.280]   it looks exactly the same.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.560]   At this time, we have ceremonial manners and presentation.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.960]   And it is my honor to call--
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.640]   I'm going to take a little things out of order
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.200]   in actually his under oral communication.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.440]   And as you know, Kuberchino is very famous for Apple Computer.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.920]   And we're very honored to have Mr. Steve Jobs to--
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.240]   This was a lunch night, by the way.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.240]   To give a special presentation.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.280]   They wanted free Wi-Fi, free iPads.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:27.760]   I mean--
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:27.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.960]   There's an audience here.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.960]   OK.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.520]   Do you think they had Apple employees in the front row?
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.320]   Yes, they do it.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.280]   Steve's other keynote.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.080]   Welcome, Mr. Jobs.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.520]   This looks like you have a fan club here.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.040]   Thanks, yeah.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:41.880]   Thank you.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.000]   I was--
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.440]   Apple's grown like a weed.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.160]   And as you know, we've always been in Kuberchino.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.840]   Started in a little office park.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.000]   So he did this like the day after WWDC.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.200]   Buildings we are in now.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.200]   That was yesterday.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   It was yesterday.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.400]   Four of the ends in 280.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.600]   So let me see if I can skip ahead to--
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.720]   In those buildings hold maybe 20--
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.200]   Find the pictures of the--
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.760]   He does seem tired.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.320]   He does seem kind of like the plotting.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.880]   I'm kind of glad I played the other tape,
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.000]   because you can see--
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.160]   And they do--
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.000]   That he's tired.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.880]   You do see a difference.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:23.840]   So this is the site.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.680]   They bought a large parcel from Hewlett Packard.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.040]   And they're going to put a giant ring.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.640]   It's a donut.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.840]   It's like the Pentagon.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.840]   Only it's a circle.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.280]   It's a pretty amazing building.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.840]   Let me show it to you.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.960]   It's a little like a spaceship landed.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.960]   There it is.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   Look at it.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:50.640]   And it's got this gorgeous courtyard in the middle,
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.920]   but a lot more.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.960]   You know, this won't be done--
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.600]   Let's take a closer look at it.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.880]   --until 2015.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.640]   You have to think that in some ways he might think this
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.200]   is his legacy.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.520]   This is--
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.880]   And so it's curved all the way around.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.280]   As you know, if you build things,
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.720]   this is not the cheapest way to build something.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.760]   There's a straight piece of glass on this building.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.720]   It's all curved.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.880]   And we've used our--
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.760]   That's where I went wrong with the Twit Brickhouse.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.920]   It's all curved.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.320]   All the world now.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.320]   You weren't making the iPad of the buildings then.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.320]   No.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.480]   Glass in the world for architectural use.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.280]   And we want to make the glass specifically for this building
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:26.780]   here.
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:30.200]   We can make it curved like this all the way around the building.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.840]   And you can see what it will look like.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.440]   That's by the way, that's the girl in the 1984 commercial.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.240]   She just needs a hammer right there.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.200]   Again, today--
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.040]   They're also going to add trees.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.720]   All the parking is underground.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.880]   Which is kind of cool.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.840]   This is going to be a cool building.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.000]   I imagine the Cupertino City Council will approve it.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.480]   The land's coming.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.200]   They're going to add 40% employees to 13,000 employees.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.640]   Well, that makes them happy.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.840]   They're going to increase the trees to 6,000.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:08.240]   And all the parking is going to be reduced and put underground.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.520]   90% of the parking is underground.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.440]   So yeah.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.480]   I mean, he's aiming to make a building that he said architecture
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.480]   students will come to look at this building.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.200]   And the City Council questions were just--
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.680]   I mean, they were all just so wowed.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.320]   I mean, they must hear presentations
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.720]   from the dumbest people because they seem just over the moon.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.480]   Me, I'm in my 50s.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:37.000]   So I think that a lot of them want to live around where they work.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.440]   We have a lot of people--
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.440]   It's actually very hard for me to watch Steve.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.360]   He's so ill, obviously, ill.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.880]   Oh, man.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.680]   Wait, what a genius.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.480]   And I hope he gets to build this amazing building.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.480]   I hope he gets to see it.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.520]   Because it will be a legacy.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.480]   20, 15.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.720]   We'll be an amazing legacy.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.160]   They hope to break ground, I think.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:00.720]   Next year.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.120]   Next year in 2012.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.480]   So it takes three years to build.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:08.640]   There are a couple of good moments in that presentation.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.120]   There was a point at which the City Council
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.960]   asked when it will be done or when it will break down.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.480]   And they'll break ground.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.800]   And Steve said something like, well,
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.840]   I've been asking my people that same question too.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.720]   Boy, do I know that feeling.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.040]   It's a little bit better.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.480]   Even Steve Jobs has to harass his people to meet deadlines.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.720]   That is a common managerial issue.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.320]   Speaking of Apple, they've updated iTunes.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.120]   As you know, to support the cloud--
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.440]   in fact, I just downloading the new version.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.160]   They've announced a new cloud music service
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.240]   to compete with Google's and Amazon's.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.880]   And I think Compete it does.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.600]   They paid a fairly hefty license fee.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.440]   It's thought to be more than $100 million
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.960]   to the four major labels for the right
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.800]   to do music fingerprinting.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.080]   Which Google was supposed to be rare to do too,
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.680]   but they couldn't reach an agreement.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.200]   Right.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.480]   Well, and if you think about it, this is brilliant.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.600]   Because it's going to cost $25 a month.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.600]   I betcha Apple gives most of that to the record industry.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.800]   It's a piracy tax.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.400]   Because you're paying $25 a month for Apple
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.360]   to replace all your pirated cuts with high quality
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.160]   256 kilobits AAC cuts.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.920]   You don't have to upload the music.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.200]   You just have to run iTunes.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.760]   That's a month.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.640]   It's $25 a year.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.440]   $25 a year.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.280]   And I'm sure that the deal--
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.200]   what they said is to the music labels, look.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.640]   Yeah, maybe they ripped the songs from a CD they bought,
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.520]   or maybe not.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.080]   But either way, they've got the music.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.320]   If you do this, you're going to get $25 a year out of them.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.920]   The labels are going to get the $25 a year.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.320]   I bet you it all goes to the labels.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.560]   I don't know what the deal is.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.920]   70% to 30% like the traditional Apple split.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.520]   So this is the iTunes match stuff, right?
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.600]   So this is like Shazam.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.080]   I know that you have the song.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.080]   Exactly.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.560]   And Apple knows what songs are in your library anyway.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.920]   So then they just--
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.320]   you stream the high quality version.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.040]   They basically give you the--
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.160]   No, it's interesting.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.400]   There's no streaming.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.240]   But you download it.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.560]   You can download it.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.240]   OK.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:11.520]   OK.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.680]   So you're basically-- you're replacing your collection of maybe
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.960]   or maybe not pirated low quality stuff
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.280]   with the high quality version.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.240]   They may have streaming down the road.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.840]   Not necessarily low quality either.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.040]   I know a lot of people who are kind of angry about the idea
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.680]   that it's $256 and you're paying $25 to downgrade your music.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.840]   If you have Flack or 320 kilobits mp3s,
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.720]   maybe you'll be unhappy.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.200]   Right.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.000]   I suspect streaming may come down the road.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.400]   But as far as I understand right now, there's no streaming,
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.120]   which is weird.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.440]   So you're telling it, I own all of these songs.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.440]   It's very uncloudy.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.600]   Well, even all of this iCloud is a little bit uncloudy.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.080]   And this is unclear, again, we won't know until iOS 5 comes out
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.600]   later this year, probably September.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.560]   But it's sad.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:02.280]   What they kept saying is whenever you put something
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.680]   in a cloud, it downloads it to every device.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.400]   It's like Dropbox.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.040]   Presumably, there's selective syncing.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.720]   And the screenshots I've seen are iOS 5 on songs anyway,
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.760]   or you could just click each song one by one and say
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.280]   download that one, download that one.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.920]   But you'll put them on your phone.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.080]   It's actually unclear how much it's like Dropbox,
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.720]   because with Dropbox, of course, it all lives in their cloud.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.880]   They were talking about something that I didn't entirely
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.080]   understand with iCloud, where there's a 30-day limit,
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.760]   where it stays on the server before it goes to your devices.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.600]   And then they say, if you didn't get it in 30 days,
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.720]   you had plenty of time to get it.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.760]   You didn't want it.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.440]   Or that's weird.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.280]   So they take it off after 30 days.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.360]   There's some 30-day history limit
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.120]   that they were talking about.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.160]   And it was really unclear what that actually meant.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.560]   But yeah, I don't know if that was--
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.520]   I mean, music's different because they're hosting the music,
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.960]   and they've got apparently--
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.560]   Yeah, 18 million songs.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.640]   But your files--
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.840]   Or your files, your photos, the photo stream,
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.200]   there was like a 30-day history thing.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.640]   That's for photos, I think.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.000]   And then there's the--
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.360]   And this was unclear, too.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.680]   But it sounded like if they don't have it in their 18 million
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.840]   song collection, you can upload it.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.160]   So there is some cloud storage.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.080]   I mean, most of it's not, because most of it's just
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.080]   saying, well, we got that song.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:16.600]   We got that song.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.200]   We got that song.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.400]   And it was one copy for everybody.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.320]   I think there's still a big question as to how well that's
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.080]   all going to work with the fingerprinting.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.760]   And I mean, Apple said, you know, Google's--
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.680]   or jabbed at Google and was like, you know,
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.200]   it takes you weeks to upload all of your music.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.880]   And then with this, you can-- it's take minutes.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.320]   If you have a reasonably large library,
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.120]   and it actually is fingerprinting all of them,
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.880]   I'm assuming it'll take more than minutes.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.840]   It took me two days.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.040]   I have 7,000 songs.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.000]   Took me two days to get it up to Google Cloud.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.640]   But I have it now in every Android device I have, which
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.160]   is great.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.960]   Yeah, it took me a few days.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.200]   And it wasn't like it was a painful few days.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:52.640]   It's--
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.360]   But it's you about it.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.240]   And then it's done.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:54.600]   Right.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.960]   It's, you know, I'm not thinking about it.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.800]   In fact, it's on my system right now.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:04.160]   Any time I add a new song to iTunes, it'll automatically go.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.800]   And if you're someone who actually doesn't manage all your music
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.720]   with iTunes, it actually actively monitors your music
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.240]   folders.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.760]   You don't have to-- like, iTunes, if you add music to a folder,
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.560]   unless you use it to--
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.720]   apples automatically add to iTunes folder,
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.960]   unless you put it in there.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.480]   iTunes is never going to know when
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.920]   you put a new song into a file structure or a folder structure.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.280]   But Google Music will.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.600]   And it monitors the folders and it uploads anything
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.120]   in the folders you tell it to and on multiple computers.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.960]   So everybody's in the chat room saying,
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.720]   it's photos only that has the 30-day limit, not music.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.200]   OK.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.440]   Is it with a lot of documents, though?
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.760]   I mean, it's--
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.080]   Because that's a different-- that's kind of unclear.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.440]   Well, fortunately, we have the great Shakespearean actor
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.360]   Richard Dreyfus to explain it all for us.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:01.000]   CNET, on their Friday reporters' roundtable podcast,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.120]   asked Richard Dreyfus for a dramatic reading of the iTunes
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:06.640]   Yula.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.600]   Listen.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:16.280]   Please read this software license agreement carefully
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:20.320]   for using the Apple software.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.120]   By using the Apple software--
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.240]   That's supposed to be Richard the third.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.840]   --you are agreeing to be bound by the terms--
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.160]   Or weird, my clear.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:35.040]   If you do not agree to the terms of this license,
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:40.760]   do not use the software.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.440]   But the best one, he does a good Habermas impression.
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.080]   Oh.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.120]   Oh, boy.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.240]   Listen carefully.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:53.200]   License is effective until terminated.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.800]   Your right, as long as it's license,
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:00.200]   will terminate automatically without notice from Apple
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.280]   if you fail to comply with any terms of this license.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.560]   Upon the termination of this license,
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.080]   you shall cease all use of the Apple software
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:20.960]   and destroy all copies full or part rule of the Apple software.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.760]   Thank you.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.760]   You have to think that's exactly how Steve Jobs
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.440]   imagined it when he wrote that.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.640]   Ah, let 1,000 remixes bloom.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.840]   Oh, you're right.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.880]   That is just-- that's awesome.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.680]   Everybody in the chat room is freaking out,
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.200]   asking for a link.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.040]   It's CNET.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.360]   CNET's reporter's roundtable, yeah.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.440]   And there's more.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.600]   I didn't even do it all.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.040]   There's quite a bit more.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.240]   I think I found it on--
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:45.840]   Boing Boing, yeah.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.760]   Cory Doctorow linked to it.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.720]   Yeah, yeah, the link has been posted.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.040]   The link has been posted in the chat room
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.720]   for all in sundry to enjoy.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.760]   Thank you, Richard Dreyfus.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.800]   He's, I guess, he's kind of a geek, I've heard.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.880]   Pretty cool.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.080]   Yeah, I went to some tech conference
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.400]   where they had him speak.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.280]   It was odd, but--
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.920]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:14.200]   We're going to take a break, come back with more Gina Trappani.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.520]   Trappani.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.520]   There you go.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.120]   Number three.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.480]   Trappani.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.040]   Trappani is here from Brooklyn.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.600]   And also from smarterware.org.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.800]   And think up app.com.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   Also, Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.000]   And buzzmachine.com.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.680]   And Adam Pash from LifeHacker.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.320]   All here to talk about Google and the cloud.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.800]   We'll talk a little bit more about Apple's announcements.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.880]   But there's a lot more from Google as well.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.680]   There's actually a lot to talk about in general.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.200]   It's a good day for Googlers.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.240]   Before we talk about that, though, I do want to say that you
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.480]   ought to have a website.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.000]   You really ought to have a website.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.280]   And if you don't, I've got the place to go.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.160]   People ask me all the time, where is the best hosting?
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:00.840]   Where should I go?
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.640]   And I tell them, there's hosts and hosts.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.440]   But if you want hosting plus the best content management
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.920]   software, they're really, in my mind, is only one place to go.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:13.440]   squarespace.com/twig.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.000]   Squarespace is the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:17.960]   It's hosting, yes.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.800]   And very, very high quality, really good uptime.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.640]   They handle-- get the slash.dig, twit effect, very well.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.760]   It's very hard to bring down a squarespace site.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.520]   Because they have virtual server technology that just flips
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.720]   on bandwidth as necessary.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.280]   But also, I think this is really important.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.120]   They have the software that you use to generate
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.920]   sites on squarespace is super slick, super beautiful,
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.680]   and always secure, because it's automatically up to date.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.440]   That's the advantage of doing hosting plus software.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.960]   There's iPhone and iPad apps.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.240]   I keep lobbying for the Android app,
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.320]   and I know it's coming soon.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.280]   There's great stats, templates that just are gorgeous.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:02.000]   And the beauty of the templates is you're not stuck with 60
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.440]   or so templates, because they're infinitely customizable
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.960]   without you're knowing any JavaScript or CSS.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.680]   You just slide things around.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.440]   I mean, it's just very simple to use.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.960]   Now, if you do happen to know JavaScript and CSS,
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.680]   the sky's the limit.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.200]   You can customize it in any way you want.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.680]   In fact, when we set up our inside.twit.tv blog,
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:27.120]   we made sure it looked like the rest of the Twit material.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.520]   And that's totally easy to do.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.280]   If you don't have a site, you need a site.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.560]   If you have a friend who has a business that doesn't have a
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.720]   site, this is a place to go.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.040]   Starts at $12 a month, but you can save money by looking at
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.160]   their long-term subscriptions as well.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.360]   Great for photographers.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.320]   If you're an artist of any kind, your portfolio sites on
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.920]   here, if I go to squarespace.com/twig, and then click
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.800]   the examples button to see all the different beautiful
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.600]   sites people do with squarespace.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.880]   Squarespace is the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.960]   squarespace.com/twit.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.520]   I just picked one.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.200]   This woman is a graphic designer and a custom chalk
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.720]   letterer living in Brooklyn.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.240]   And she does these on the street.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.880]   That's chalk.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.800]   Yeah, Brooklyn.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.200]   Yeah, Brooklyn.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:14.960]   Go Brooklyn.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.360]   So this is so cool.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.360]   Squarespace site.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.840]   So you could get like--
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.880]   oh, we should get this.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.720]   Like, this is like what people do on there.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.240]   So this is Sterling Cooper Draper Price.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.240]   Mad Men Holiday, so I ran 1965.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.960]   That's funny.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.480]   So this is her portfolio.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.200]   This is all in Squarespace.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:40.840]   The West Anderson, Brooklyn, St. Mark's Avenue.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.400]   This is fun.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.560]   243.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.400]   And it just goes away.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.640]   What?
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.320]   It's on the sidewalk.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.520]   It's chalk.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.600]   Well, sometimes it's like--
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.800]   You've seen these on menu boards and restaurants and stuff.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.840]   Like, or at bars, like over the bar and that kind of thing.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:31:59.800]   Weird.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.440]   Isn't that cool?
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.400]   Anyway, my point being not so much this,
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.800]   but this is a Squarespace site.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.160]   And that's the beauty of it.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.720]   If you are looking for a great site,
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.880]   please just visit squarespace.com/toyg.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.120]   Click that green button that says, try it free.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.840]   And you can try it for two weeks without a credit card
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.240]   or anything.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.280]   You just set up a site, play with it,
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.680]   get to know every bit of Squarespace
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.160]   and see if it's what you want to use.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.720]   Squarespace-- and I love the examples.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.560]   It's a nice place to go.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.320]   Squarespace.com/toyg.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.760]   We thank them so much for their support of our show.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:37.200]   This week in Google, I'm kind of sad.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.400]   Remember that Google had like Google.com/apple
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.100]   and Google.com-- or I guess it was--
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.080]   slash Mac and Google.com/linix.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.640]   And they at Google.com/Microsoft.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.320]   These were all specialized search sites.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.920]   And Google's just posted on their blog yesterday.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.120]   We're going to kill those because frankly, you don't need them.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.560]   We're just seeing if I go there now if there's anything.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.880]   And I'm sure they just didn't have very much use.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.600]   Nobody used them.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.000]   I stopped using them a long time.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.480]   Yeah, so this is Google.com/Mac.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.400]   It just takes you to the main Google page or/linix.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.560]   But it was just kind of a restricted Google search.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.360]   Yeah, they're all turned off already.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.800]   No specialized search services.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.480]   There seems to be some house cleaning last week.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.680]   We talked about the APIs.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.240]   They killed another killing this.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:20.960]   I think they're--
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.200]   That's appropriate.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.760]   Larry says, focus, I'm sure.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.760]   Yep.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.200]   Quite appropriate.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:33.240]   You can still get your Google search results.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:33.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.680]   The results are there.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.440]   Or fork-fork in different languages.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.960]   But they still support some of those.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.240]   Oh, fork-fork.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.400]   So, you know, they haven't killed all of this stuff.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.320]   How long before they kill that, right?
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:45.560]   I love that.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.560]   I think that's hysterical.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.960]   Look at these are--
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.600]   it's display tips in.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.560]   And these are all the languages.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.840]   And most of them are real languages.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.880]   But then some of them are a little weird.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.880]   Pork-fork-fork is one.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.360]   And isn't there a Star Wars one or a Star Trek one?
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.880]   There's Elmer Fudd.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.280]   Oh, right.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:01.760]   Elmer Fudd.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.280]   There's Hacker.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.160]   Yes.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.440]   I like Hacker.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.480]   I mean, those can't see very much usage either.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.120]   But, you know, they get the hit of traffic every week.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:09.960]   Once in a while.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.200]   We'll say, what do you do?
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.880]   We mention it, and then there's a spike.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.360]   Seychelles-Wah Creole.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.280]   Wow.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:18.800]   Wow.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.000]   Sudanese, Swahili, Swedish.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.120]   That is actually very cool.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.760]   That is quite a language dropdown.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.480]   It's amazing.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:33.040]   Zulu, Pashto, Myori.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:33.720]   But I wonder--
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.600]   Oh, well, cling on.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.600]   Cling on.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.800]   I wonder if you get a lot of--
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.520]   I'm going to do-- from now on, I'm doing all my searches
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.120]   and cling on.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.120]   Let's see what happens.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.480]   Preferences have been saved.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.560]   Oh, dear.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.600]   I am going to be so sorry I did this.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.480]   Google-- oh, oh.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.800]   Docked to talks.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.400]   Hocked out.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.480]   You know, there is--
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.280]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.040]   Does it do it?
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.320]   If they do the audio, they want to read to you out loud.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.800]   Do they have that going on?
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.720]   I doubt it.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.760]   Oh, Google Translate?
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.600]   Maybe.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.920]   Would that be wonderful?
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:10.760]   How would I do that?
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.760]   Can I--
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.760]   If you go to translate, Google.com/translate,
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.520]   you can pick from all their dropdowns.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.440]   But I've looked at it.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.800]   They normally announce when they have new languages.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.720]   And I don't--
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.280]   No cling on there.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.080]   JK.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:27.240]   No, just Korean.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.640]   Oh, shoot.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.680]   There are people who speak Klingon, right?
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.280]   You could get somebody to do that.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.800]   We don't need-- yeah, you should have computer.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.080]   Now, but see, now I've got a problem
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.040]   because I have no idea how to turn that off.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.200]   I don't know what anything means.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:43.560]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:43.920]   There it is.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.880]   Google.com and English.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.000]   That's nice that they put that right there, too.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.040]   Because I was an idiot.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:48.640]   And--
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.280]   They're dumb ass pork.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.360]   Give me that.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.320]   Is that-- what?
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.160]   I don't--
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.280]   Somebody wrote that.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:05.400]   That's somebody's 10% project, 20% project.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.080]   Oh, there was a line to do that one.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.200]   I could translate that into Klingon for you.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:13.120]   They need to get up to date and add like Navi or--
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.800]   --you know, also the newer.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   Ewok.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.840]   Kazakhstan-- I don't know what this story is.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.600]   Kazakhstan was just Google--
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.600]   This is fascinating.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:28.640]   You think this is-- Google.KZ is a Kazakhstan search.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.360]   It's just like Google.cn is for China.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.560]   But the Google.cn servers, as we know, are not in China.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.360]   They're in Hong Kong.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:39.680]   Kazakhstan has said, if you want at Google.KZ,
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:43.200]   you have to host the servers in country.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.920]   What does that mean, Jeff?
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.640]   Well, it means that then they can shut it off.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.720]   And so Google's saying, no, we're not going to do that.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.400]   So if somebody types in.KZ, they just redirect them right
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.080]   away to Google.com.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.960]   And they're saying that's a pity because they can't target
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.440]   the searches.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.920]   But of course, I would think they can just based on IP address.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.360]   So I think they're just getting a little tough there.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.240]   But that is one of the scary ways that countries
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.000]   will try to control the internet.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.680]   Hello, Sarkozy, right?
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:10.360]   Right.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.600]   And Eric Schmidt says, for example,
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:17.760]   the single point of failure for the internet is country domains.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.520]   So now I've solved my Klingon problem.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.280]   All my searches are in Kazakh.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.040]   Was it Russia?
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:24.520]   What is it?
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.080]   It's Cyrillic.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.520]   I could see the Cyrillic character.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.600]   Well, no, is it?
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.880]   I don't know even-- oh, great.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:36.840]   You know, I wonder if it's more than just filtering the searches.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.640]   I wonder if there's also some interest.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.080]   If they host their servers there in going to the servers
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.000]   and saying, OK, what did this guy look for?
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:44.960]   Exactly.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.480]   Exactly.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.200]   It's privacy as well.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.360]   And if Kazakhstan gets away with it, you don't darn well
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:56.680]   that China and Iran and pick your totalitarian bozos
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.080]   will do the same thing.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.960]   Now, it's easy to say no to Kazakhstan.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.480]   I mean, it's not like Kazakhstan has the muscle to say,
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.760]   we're going to cut you off, Google.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.280]   But--
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.560]   We have to go to our ambassador.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.280]   Oh, no, I'm going to miss the punch line.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.040]   What was the guy's movie?
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.000]   Borat.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:16.320]   Thank you.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.920]   Borat, yes.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.200]   Is he from Kazakhstan?
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.800]   Something like Kazakhstan.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.720]   I think it was Kazakhstan.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.240]   Was it chat room?
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:23.760]   Is it really?
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.960]   Was he from Kazakhstan?
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.960]   That's kind of ironic.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:33.280]   Oh, we're still talking about the chat rooms.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.920]   What language do Grito speak?
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.880]   They are.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.360]   You shouldn't really mention Star Wars stuff,
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.400]   because then it's-- they really they go off track.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.920]   So very easily.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.920]   It was a good thing to say.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.200]   I just want to back everything.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.720]   That you know, why they probably
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.320]   could provide the personalization just
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.480]   by checking the incoming IP address.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.480]   Yeah, it seems like they're making a point
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.520]   that they refuse to do this, because they're
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.840]   in support of the open internet.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.440]   This is very much Google's open internet stand being made
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.160]   publicly.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.040]   Good on them.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:02.680]   That's what I see.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.920]   You know, at some point we end up with a server farm
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.440]   on the ocean in a new land called Googlestand.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:13.040]   Well, it's like pirate radio, right?
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.040]   In the old days, in Great Britain,
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.040]   trying to censor radio stations.
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.320]   Exactly where we have to go.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:21.360]   They put the radio stations on a boat.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.840]   So you go out to the water-cooled, wave-powered server
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.200]   farms or server ships now.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.680]   And I moved to Googlestand, would you?
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.680]   It's a lonely, dark place of burning servers.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.480]   It's really really loud servers.
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.160]   But sure.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.840]   Hey, one of the things that got a lot of attention
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.400]   on the Apple announcements was the fact
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.920]   that iOS 5 is going to have very tight integration with Twitter.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.480]   Basically, all the Apple apps you'll
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.560]   be able to tweet from the app directly.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:00.800]   You'll only have to log into Twitter in the Apple preferences.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.000]   And from then on, everything will
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.640]   know what your Twitter account is.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.720]   And there's an API.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.720]   So developers, presumably, will also
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.120]   build in that kind of tight integration of Twitter.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.120]   A couple of things came to mind.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.320]   I mean, a number of people said, oh, that's a slap to Facebook.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:18.480]   Because basically, Apple's throwing--
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.240]   this is about that internet identity thing
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.040]   we talked about, Jeff, last week.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.480]   Yes, exactly about it.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:27.960]   Who is your canonical identity on the internet?
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.680]   Is it @Jeff Jarvis?
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:33.720]   Is it Facebook.com/Jeff Jarvis?
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.960]   Or Google profiles/Jeff Jarvis?
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.840]   The way you phrase that, because I thought it was--
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.480]   I guess Jobs said that trying to do a deal with Facebook
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.840]   was prohibitive.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.760]   Owners.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.640]   Owners was the word he used.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.200]   The problem with Twitter, of course,
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.200]   is that you can make up identities right and left.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:54.320]   The proportion of true identities in Facebook
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.240]   has to be much, much higher.
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.760]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:58.200]   Right.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.880]   So there's an advantage Facebook has, because there's
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.800]   a real identity.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.720]   But do we care if we're--
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.200]   I have multiple Twitter accounts for different purposes.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.040]   Me too.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.640]   And it would make sense for me.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:13.960]   Well, first of all, I hope Apple allows multiple accounts.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.840]   Well, why do they need to--
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.680]   they're using it.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.760]   Is there not use it?
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.240]   The advantage of Twitter is I can use it as a published name
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.240]   to the world.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.720]   The advantage of Facebook is it's a more verified, really,
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.120]   me.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:28.000]   The irony of what Apple did here was what they really
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.720]   need is a verified use so that they're
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.560]   going to have a unique account.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.120]   Well, I'd like to, for instance, in news applications,
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.680]   I want to tweet to my news link.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.200]   Twitter feed.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.720]   It's called links for Twitch.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:42.000]   Links underscore four underscore Twitch.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.480]   And then-- but for personal stuff,
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.800]   I want to do it to Leo LaPorte.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   So when I take a picture of the kids,
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.560]   I want it to go to Leo.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:51.400]   Maybe I even will have different feeds depending on,
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.480]   is this for family?
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.840]   Is this for public?
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.040]   I hope Apple supports it.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.040]   This sounds like the kind of customization you're not
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:58.880]   going to get at Apple.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.560]   I ain't going to do that.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.440]   Yeah, that sounds like a nerd problem.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.880]   Well, I don't know if it's a nerd problem.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:07.040]   I think it actually addresses exactly what you were just
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.320]   saying, which is that Facebook, you
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.600]   have a canonical identity that's you.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.280]   And on Twitter, you may have multiple it
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.200]   because it's a publishing medium.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.760]   Now, but I had another thought about Twitter.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.160]   I thought this is publicly--
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.520]   the Twitter folks are probably going, yeah,
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.600]   that's great for Twitter.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.080]   Privately, they're going, oh, crap.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.880]   Because now they can't change their API, right?
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.320]   They can't--
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.800]   Apple is in effect frozen.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:39.560]   If Apple is using the API, remember,
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.320]   Twitter keeps changing the ground under these third party
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.240]   developers.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.160]   Well, you can't do that anymore.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:52.480]   Well, no, because Apple has turned Twitter from a company
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:57.040]   to a internet system.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.320]   No, I'm saying it's a utility now.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.360]   They may be slower to deprecate and change existing methods.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:02.680]   What?
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.680]   Slower.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.480]   Yeah, yeah, because they're going
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.160]   to have to get Apple's buy-in on that, right?
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.240]   Right.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.360]   But I mean, if the main thing is that Twitter--
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.240]   I mean, if the main thing is that you're just using it
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.200]   to tweet from applications and stuff,
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.760]   I feel like it's pretty limited.
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.200]   Maybe.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.440]   But it may be--
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.720]   I mean, Android is--
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.040]   the funny thing is about three quarters of the things
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.120]   Apple announced on Monday are already in Android phones,
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.360]   including the notification system.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.280]   But on an Android phone, and some people don't like this,
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.640]   you can use Twitter with your contact list
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.680]   to provide additional details as you can Facebook.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.960]   Pictures or phone--
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.040]   Facebook has phone numbers.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.160]   Twitter doesn't have a lot of personal information.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.200]   But I think in some ways, Apple made
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:47.920]   Twitter something less than Twitter was.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:52.160]   It made Twitter something both simultaneously more and less.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.640]   But all Twitter has to do is call Apple and say,
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:56.400]   we're making this change.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.480]   They're going to let them know.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:02.440]   Well, the problem, of course, though, is you get in the same situation
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.200]   that you're in with Google Maps on iOS
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:09.600]   where it's baked into the distribution.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.000]   And if Apple says, no, I don't think
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   you're going to change that API call.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   What's Twitter going to do?
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.400]   Well, they can't just update an application.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.760]   They've got to wait for a full operating system.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.280]   But Apple literally could say, no, we won't--
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.080]   if you don't-- you might break iOS,
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.800]   but we're not going to change anything.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.320]   And then that's 20 million Twitter users who go.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.440]   What the--
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.520]   Well, now, Twitter will know what it feels like.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.040]   Apple read.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.400]   Well, not necessarily the way that it goes
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.680]   is that you release a version of an API
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.760]   and you commit to supporting that version to a certain point.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.920]   So version 1.0 is out.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.920]   And then Twitter releases version 2.0.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:48.600]   They're still supporting 1.0.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.760]   It's like, when does XP?
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.280]   We will support this up until this time.
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.400]   They're going to give Apple plenty of notice.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.720]   I mean, this is kind of-- but developers
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:58.440]   are going to be able to take advantage of the new API calls
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:01.160]   while they kind of slowly sunset the existing ones.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.920]   I just think that this is going to make that roadmap,
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.240]   that timeline a little longer, right?
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.120]   Because Apple's releases--
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.440]   I mean, Apple's--
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.840]   So you don't think it kind of promotes the notion of Twitter
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.680]   is internet infrastructure?
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.680]   No, that's right too.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:15.640]   It does.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.520]   But it's-- it's-- it's-- it's--
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.800]   A, it's not a good infrastructure because it doesn't--
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.360]   Well, I agree.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.480]   --identity well.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:26.760]   And B, more importantly, it's scary because it doesn't
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.480]   think of itself as an internet infrastructure company.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.840]   It's going its own way.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:32.640]   You know, I could imagine-- I have a red Dave Weiner
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.880]   on the topic, but I can imagine he's going batty.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.880]   Right.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.800]   No one said that Dave, I'm not saying you're batty.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.960]   I'm just saying that the topic would make one batty.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.760]   Anyone including me batty, OK?
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.400]   But he cleared her.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.120]   But this is the problem of being trapped with Twitter.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.560]   It's a kind of a bear hug from Apple.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.800]   I mean, it's a big deal.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.600]   I think it's a huge, great deal for Twitter.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.160]   And you know, if the one canonical identity
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.160]   or if the verifiable identity thing becomes an issue,
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.920]   I mean, Twitter did start to roll out
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.000]   that verified identity mechanism, which I don't think
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.120]   is available to most people.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.320]   I mean, right now, it's like for celebrities who
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.160]   might have impersonators.
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:14.240]   But they could-- I mean, it's not crazy stretching
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.720]   the imagination that they could extend that to anybody who
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.800]   is willing to provide a phone number or credit card number
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.920]   to say, yes, this is me.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:24.040]   So I mean, that could kind of take care of the identity thing.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.680]   And I think it's huge.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.440]   I think it's going to-- I hope that Twitter can stand up
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.680]   to the traffic.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.440]   It will bring them.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.480]   It's kind of interesting because there were rumors
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.440]   that Apple might buy Twitter.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.280]   And instead, they just co-opted it.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:36.760]   Free.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.960]   We got all the Twitter functionality free.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.120]   And that's kind of what I mean, is that Apple's just kind
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:46.320]   of piggybacking and said, good, nice job, guys.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.720]   I mean, Apple tried social with ping, right?
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.520]   They couldn't get Facebook to go along.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.020]   Right.
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.560]   Facebook didn't really-- the Facebook integration
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.120]   was an enoch.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.920]   They couldn't come up with a good deal.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.560]   So I mean, this makes a lot of sense.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:58.360]   And I'm excited.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:58.920]   I'm excited.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.280]   They went with Twitter.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.560]   I'm a fan.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.280]   Well, you know what?
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:05.320]   It makes me think I'll use Twitter a lot more.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.840]   Like, so it'll be right there, right?
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.080]   It's now anointed.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.320]   So it's actually interesting, though,
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.760]   that Twitter is now being integrated into the operating
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:14.080]   system.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.960]   But then there's all those other applications,
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.560]   which were extremely popular applications like Instapaper
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.200]   or Camera Plus and whatnot.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.080]   Why buy that?
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:26.000]   They couldn't-- well, they could have bought,
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.600]   or they could have integrated in some way,
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:32.160]   but instead just took the best functionality from those things
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.040]   and sort of made their own versions.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.200]   I mean, if I'm Marco, I mean, I'm not happy about it.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.160]   He's the guy who created Instapaper.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.520]   But from the point of view of users,
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:43.640]   it's great that Instapaper functionality is built into iOS
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.720]   5.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.200]   Marco's--
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:45.880]   Yeah, well, it is.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.400]   It's one of the same problems as Twitter--
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.920]   the Twitter sphere deals with the developers
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.720]   where Twitter has a new URL shortener.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.560]   And now URL shorteners are all freaked out,
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:47:59.360]   because they can't--
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.720]   and all of the stuff at Twitter.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:04.040]   But then it's sort of like Apple doing similar things,
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.280]   but not with Twitter, where Apple probably
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.840]   knew they couldn't accomplish that
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:12.680]   and decided just to go with the big horse.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.840]   Yeah, Adam, Gina and I have this back and forth all the time,
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:21.000]   where Gina is the nice one, and I'm not.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.680]   My fear is that if I were developing,
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:26.680]   I certainly would never develop anything around Twitter now.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.120]   Not like what you're doing, Gina,
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.440]   where you're adding on a kind of back end--
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.320]   Oh, but wait a minute.
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.280]   Doesn't this make you use the API?
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.080]   This makes you a little bit more comfortable with it,
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:42.120]   because now Apple is offering an effect at Twitter API in iOS 5.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.120]   Oh.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.080]   So now you're not piggybacking on Twitter.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:49.400]   You're piggybacking on Apple, piggybacking on Twitter.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.240]   And I'm saying Apple's a bigger--
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.240]   Yeah, but that doesn't affect Bitly.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:56.280]   That doesn't affect the photo services
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.520]   that got screwed last week.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.960]   No, and as Adam mentioned, Twitter announced today
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.040]   that they're going to build into their web client.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.800]   They're going to build into T.CO shortening,
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.640]   although you could still use Bitly or the others.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.000]   Yeah, here's the thing about that.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.720]   What gets me about that is that the proportion--
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:12.600]   I don't know what the number is.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.920]   And I think there is a number somewhere--
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.080]   It's a vast majority, though, isn't it?
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.000]   Well, no, but the vast majority of people
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.560]   don't use the web client.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.200]   Use third party clients.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.440]   Yeah, and so I won't notice that.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:28.000]   I mean, my echophone will still use my own shortener.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.760]   Right.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.960]   Well, but remember in iOS 5 now, when
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:36.040]   you go to the Preferences and you authorize Twitter,
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.920]   there's also a button that says install the Twitter app.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.080]   Oh, I finally get it.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.640]   OK, so that's what this is.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.960]   That's why-- because Twitter can't stand using all the--
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.400]   So this is actually a deal with Apple,
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:51.040]   is a way to now screw all of the third party apps.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.480]   Well, it's good, but that's what I kind of meant was,
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.200]   it's great for Twitter.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.120]   But it's also, in some ways, bad for Twitter,
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:01.360]   because now they're more of an infrastructure service
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.800]   than they are accompanying.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:04.880]   But it also means that--
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:05.800]   They're the plumbing.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:06.720]   I think on top of them now.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.200]   Right.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.760]   But because they're the plumbing, they're--
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.760]   See, that's the irony.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.200]   That just shows Twitter is not a platform.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.520]   A platform is something you can develop atop of.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.240]   Mm, interesting.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:19.520]   Well, now the question is, how do you monetize?
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.360]   So I really like Marco's take on--
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.520]   What did he say?
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:26.320]   He basically said that he's cautiously optimistic
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.360]   about the fact that Apple built this functionality
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.960]   into Safari, because he is a small one guy shop.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.360]   He has a really hard time explaining what Instapaper does
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.640]   and what the value is.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:39.160]   And he's pretty convinced that Instapaper is better
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.680]   than Apple's implementation.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.200]   So he feels like by Apple rolling this functionality
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.560]   out to more people, it'll get a much larger audience.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:49.000]   More people will understand the value of what it does
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:49.920]   and what Instapaper does.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.440]   And when they're hooked, they're going
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:53.040]   to look for something that's a little more powerful.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.840]   And that's going to open up the market for him.
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:55.360]   I agree.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.840]   I think that this is kind of a similar thing.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.000]   And I think that this is why Twitter went with--
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.920]   The like, use R1 canonical--
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.400]   Start with R1 canonical iOS app.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.120]   It is the best.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.280]   And this is what you should start with.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.880]   Because I think then, once you have power,
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.280]   users have multiple accounts and want different kind
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.520]   of functionality, then they start
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.600]   to look for the tweet decks and the echo phones
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.040]   and the kind of more advanced kind of power tools.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.720]   So you can look at it as like, this
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.960]   is a way to open up the market and make it easy on-ramp
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.840]   for newcomers.
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.160]   Or you can look at it as like, Apple just ate my lunch.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.960]   And I really-- I like that Marco said,
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.480]   I don't feel like Apple just ate my lunch yet.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.040]   I'm cautiously optimistic that this
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:34.560]   is going to make Instapaper more understandable by a lot more
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.200]   people and maybe open up the market.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.840]   Because his customer base, he feels like,
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.160]   is potentially much larger.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:43.800]   But because it's hard to explain what Instapaper does,
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.040]   and he's one guy.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.360]   Well, right, because there's a lot of Windows users.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.440]   There's a lot of Chrome users.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.680]   Just because Apple did it on Safari, it doesn't--
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.040]   I think he's absolutely right.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:53.480]   I have to say--
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.720]   I think especially the fact that it's just on Safari,
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:59.640]   it's just kind of so limiting.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:02.080]   It's a little annoying that they copied him.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:03.600]   Yes.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.200]   I'm sure he feels that.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.400]   He's got to.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:06.900]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:09.860]   But also, it's kind of a pat on the back.
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.940]   I mean, when the Gmail engineers looked at my extension,
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:14.620]   better Gmail, which is made up of user scripts
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:17.660]   by lots of other developers, I'm totally not taking credit.
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:19.900]   I just sort of bundled them together and said, oh,
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.500]   what we're going to build these into labs,
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.540]   because they're doing really well in your extension,
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.420]   I was like, that's great.
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:29.260]   I'm really glad I took it as a compliment in a way.
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:30.180]   In a way.
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.140]   Of course, I wasn't building a business on that.
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:33.140]   Right.
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:33.640]   You know?
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:34.780]   It goes both ways.
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:35.820]   I think Marco's done well.
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:37.700]   I don't think there's any question that InstaPaper will
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:39.460]   continue on and do well.
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:40.260]   There's no doubt.
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:42.940]   And the fact that people like us, I think I will always
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:46.260]   pay for InstaPaper and continue to pay for InstaPaper
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:46.780]   or whatever.
[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:47.620]   I mean, I bought the apps.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.300]   I didn't need to buy the apps, but I bought them just
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:50.140]   to support Marco.
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:52.860]   I think it's such a great thing.
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:58.780]   All right.
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.220]   So well, we'll see.
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.260]   The iOS won't be out till the fall.
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:05.780]   We have lots to talk about in the fall.
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:09.500]   I talked a little bit about Google's cloud service.
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:12.820]   Does this change Google's cloud music in any way?
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:15.260]   Does it change-- is it a threat to Google's docs
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.860]   and other Google cloud services?
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:22.980]   Or does this like InstaPaper on the Safari?
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:25.500]   Does this just validate what Google's up to
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:27.900]   and make a bigger business for them?
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.860]   It's so unproven whether this will be workable.
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:33.180]   Let's not forget about not me.
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:36.820]   I find that iTunes, in a brilliant UI company,
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:39.420]   I still find iTunes to be incredibly--
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:39.860]   Awful.
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:45.060]   --countering to it and it becomes the basis of all this stuff.
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:48.420]   Can I see putting all my documents and all this stuff
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:49.940]   through iTunes?
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:50.820]   No.
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:52.620]   It's not quite enough.
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:52.980]   No.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:56.220]   And so Google's far from perfect on this either.
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.780]   I mean, Dropbox, I'm not-- you've
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:02.820]   got to pry out of my dead hands in terms of the functionality
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:03.820]   of the cloud.
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:07.380]   Do you agree with Peter Kafka that iCloud music is a meh?
[00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:12.060]   I don't know yet.
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:12.380]   I don't know.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.180]   I think we don't know yet.
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:17.220]   He says, Google and Amazon dodge a bullet.
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:20.020]   What do you guys think?
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:21.060]   Yeah, it's hard to say.
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:21.980]   I'm not even sure yet.
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:24.660]   Actually, I didn't even realize I'm a bad technos follower.
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:26.340]   I didn't realize that 10-- 10, 3 is out.
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.780]   iTunes 10, 3 is out now.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:30.220]   So is iCloud is available in 10, 3?
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:32.220]   Supposedly, that's what it says in the upgrade.
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:36.420]   It's basically just the purchases.
[00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.940]   So anything that you've purchased,
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:42.140]   that being able to download it to all your iDevices
[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:44.860]   and Apple devices is live.
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:47.580]   But the iTunes match isn't live.
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:51.940]   And most of the iCloud stuff isn't live in it.
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.780]   So I'm looking at the new iTunes now.
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:58.100]   So you're saying, Adam, I can go to the iTunes--
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:58.500]   what's this?
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:01.180]   iBookstore now on iTunes.
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:03.900]   So I can go somewhere and say, download everything
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:05.860]   I've bought on other systems.
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:06.860]   I think that you can--
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:08.420]   Oh, yeah, look, look, look.
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:11.140]   Here's a new link purchased.
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:11.660]   Yeah.
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.740]   OK, let's click that.
[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:16.980]   So these are all the songs I've ever bought.
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:17.900]   And now I can--
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:19.100]   And apps and books.
[00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:20.340]   And apps and books.
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.860]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:22.820]   So and now I could--
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.060]   This has been a long time in coming, right?
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:27.100]   Yeah, it's about time for right now, well.
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:28.900]   Everybody else has done this.
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:30.100]   Not exactly innovation.
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:34.860]   I mean, this is Amazon's locker kind of, right?
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.060]   Or this idea that if you buy a digital thing,
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:38.700]   like that Apple will take care of it,
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.700]   will hold it for you between the devices.
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.020]   So here's a button that says, this is everything I bought.
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:46.340]   And this is the stuff that's not my currently in my library.
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:48.420]   So these are all the songs that are not currently
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.020]   in my library that I have purchased.
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.940]   Can I now just download them?
[00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:53.660]   Yes, I can.
[00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:56.420]   There's a little cloud icon.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:00.060]   And it says, yeah, you can download disco zones.
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:02.740]   Dragostia Dinte.
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:04.100]   So explain something to me.
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:07.180]   When I want to next sync my phone
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:09.900]   and get audio files on my phone, am I doing that
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:13.460]   through a cable or am I doing that through the cloud?
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:16.220]   Not until iOS 5, but in iOS 5, you know.
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:20.540]   In iOS 5, does it eliminate the sync cable?
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:25.100]   I would imagine that you still could use the sync cable.
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:27.900]   Just in the same way that with Google Music, you can--
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:30.660]   It doesn't eliminate it because they even say specifically,
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:34.700]   you can use iTunes or you can do it from via the cloud.
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.060]   Because part of what I do, obviously,
[00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:39.180]   is I have a limited amount of space on one of my iPods.
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:42.220]   And so I decree what goes there versus other devices.
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:45.540]   Well, you have some granularity, but not much.
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:48.140]   You can either do it song by song or all of the above.
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:49.020]   Whoop, that's the wrong picture.
[00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:49.660]   There it is.
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:51.900]   Song by song are all of the above.
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:55.380]   I get more granularity with the present iTunes.
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:55.900]   Right.
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:57.140]   Because you can have chat boxes.
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:57.640]   iTunes.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:58.740]   I'm assuming that--
[00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:02.460]   I mean, you can still sync to your iPod or whatever,
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:05.860]   selectively, if you so choose.
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:07.700]   It's feeling mad to me.
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:10.660]   This is all of the crap my kid has purchased.
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.820]   So you know, you definitely--
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:15.020]   I'm not going to want to download all.
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:17.740]   But if I say, oh, there's one song I like,
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.420]   that's the advantage of having one account for the whole family,
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:21.980]   right?
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:23.420]   So that's actually interesting because I've
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.020]   been playing around with Google Music a lot.
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:32.100]   And in Google Music, it's all based on your Google account.
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.580]   And you can only stream--
[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:38.380]   according to a Google Help page that I ran into when
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:39.380]   I was going through the JavaScript,
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:42.820]   you can only stream to one place at a time.
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:44.220]   Or that's what the page said.
[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:46.060]   So if my kid was streaming--
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:46.580]   I couldn't.
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:47.580]   Yeah.
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:50.300]   At least that's what the Help page was explaining.
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.220]   That makes sense.
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:52.380]   That actually makes sense.
[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:54.540]   But then it's problematic if you share a library.
[00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:55.540]   What do you do?
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:58.140]   You run multiple instance of the uploader,
[00:57:58.140 --> 00:57:59.820]   tied to multiple accounts.
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:00.340]   I don't--
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:03.940]   I think this is one area that Apple actually has done very well.
[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:05.380]   The App Store is a good example.
[00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:08.820]   Once you buy an application on the App Store on OS 10,
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:13.180]   then it's available to all your other computers as well.
[00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:15.540]   Basically, everything's a family license.
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:17.620]   And I imagine they'll do the same thing with music.
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:21.180]   There'll probably be a limited number of devices, maybe five.
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:23.620]   But I think that's something Apple's done well.
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:26.940]   And they can do that because they own the whole chain, right?
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:29.820]   They know exactly everything.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:32.020]   10 devices with a maximum of five computers
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:34.020]   can be synced with the service.
[00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:36.260]   So you can have your iPhone, your iPad,
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:37.260]   and five other computers.
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:39.660]   That's why you don't want a family license, though.
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:42.820]   Well, I mean, how many computers do you have?
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:44.420]   Well, but even the more devices, right?
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:47.620]   So I have a phone and two iPods.
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:49.620]   And now I have--
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:51.860]   So there's four iPhones in my family.
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:52.940]   In my family, I take up--
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:53.940]   iPads.
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:54.940]   Yeah.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:58.100]   But you're unusual.
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:59.020]   Family of four--
[00:58:59.020 --> 00:58:59.540]   Are you saying--
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:58:59.540]   We've all--
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:01.220]   We've all-- we're family of four.
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:02.420]   Let's say we've all got iPhones.
[00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:03.660]   That's four devices.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:04.500]   We've all got computers.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:05.980]   That's eight devices.
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:06.620]   And they're calling--
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:07.620]   You call them iPads.
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:09.860]   Well, if you all have iPads in your screwed.
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.820]   Exactly.
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:12.580]   So you can't--
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:14.580]   If you all have iPads, you can afford to buy--
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:15.260]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:15.860]   --in a separate--
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:16.900]   That's right.
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:17.420]   Just kidding.
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:19.820]   One of my students in my entrepreneurial class,
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:22.460]   this last term, a really good guy,
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:23.900]   had a great business where I don't want
[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:25.220]   to give the way to the business.
[00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:29.180]   But Fred Wilson and his wife, Joanne, came and they
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.180]   judged the class.
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:33.420]   And he had happened to use Fred's music
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:36.780]   to feed something wonderful out of his algorithms and systems.
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:38.140]   I'll just leave it there.
[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:41.220]   And in front of me was, as soon as he showed on the screen,
[00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:42.500]   Fred and Joanne are both there.
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:45.740]   And Fred said, well, that item came not for me
[00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:47.940]   because my wife-- because we share the same account.
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:53.140]   He said, if it's ridiculous, torch songs, it's all Joanne.
[00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:54.900]   And so what happens is if you want
[00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:57.180]   to get a picture of Fred's music taste--
[00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:59.580]   His taste is much is very urban.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:00.820]   You can't.
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:01.820]   Because they mixed it in.
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:03.380]   So there's a problem mixing it into when
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.700]   you get to an age of personalization,
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:08.180]   when these become signals of what you like that's usable
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.700]   elsewhere, you don't want to mix in with your family.
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:12.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.300]   You want to be you.
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:15.460]   I want to be me.
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.660]   But you also-- there's the other side of the problem
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:20.140]   where your kids are buying the same songs you've already bought.
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.540]   That doesn't happen very often, though.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:23.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.020]   It's kind of thinking that what does I think it is?
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:28.100]   Leo, the one time that I bought back in the days of CDs
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:29.340]   in the car, I bought a hip hop CD,
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:31.180]   my son just wanted to throw out the window that I'm not
[01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.140]   allowed to do that.
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:32.500]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.180]   That's my--
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.220]   --tear of feet.
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:35.460]   It was creepy for me to do that.
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.820]   No, I'm totally convinced the only reason my son
[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.740]   listens to hip hop is because it drives me crazy.
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.660]   That's good enough reason as any of your--
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:46.220]   Every generation has to have something, right?
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:47.420]   Annoy your parents.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:48.420]   Yeah.
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:49.620]   How do we annoy our parents?
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.460]   And I feel sorry for them because there's
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:57.180]   so few things in annoy us compared to our generation.
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:00.860]   Facebook has kind of, without much fanfare,
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:04.540]   turned on face recognition on your Facebook account.
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:07.460]   And the default is on.
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:10.300]   So I'm interested to hear what Jeff thinks about this,
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:12.060]   Mr. Public Parts.
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.820]   About the idea that someone--
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:18.700]   that Facebook can suggest to others, this looks like Jeff,
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.220]   do you want to tag him?
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:22.420]   It ain't easy to find this setting, by the way.
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:22.940]   You really--
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:23.540]   No, it's not.
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.380]   The day as usual, they mess that up,
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.540]   and you've got to go way down to find the setting to turn off.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:28.500]   You've got to dig.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.900]   But again, it sounds bad.
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:33.860]   Facial recognition is turned on secretly.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:34.860]   [GASP]
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:35.380]   What does it mean?
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:40.020]   Well, it means that it's not much different from us.
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:42.300]   The three of us have a picture together,
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:43.580]   four of us have a picture together.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.660]   And somebody comes along and they recognize any one of us,
[01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.820]   and they put it in there who it is.
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:47.180]   I can't.
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:50.620]   So the computer helps that process.
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:53.780]   I mean, it doesn't bother me, except that it--
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:56.100]   Well, you can turn it off, but you're on by default.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:58.260]   It's not the best.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:02.020]   Picasa on the desktop, actually, does that.
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:04.700]   It'll recommend facial recognition to you.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.180]   Google doesn't do.
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:07.940]   Oh, no.
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:15.180]   And I think those same things sync to Picasa web albums,
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:17.100]   I believe, if you use it.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:17.820]   Right.
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:19.620]   So it's the same, in other words.
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.580]   It's-- yeah.
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:22.900]   No, I mean, the difference, of course,
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:24.660]   is that you don't have to sync to web albums,
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:31.300]   and that convenience is local and not broadcast.
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:32.180]   Small difference.
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:32.680]   Or--
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.220]   Oh, here's the check mark.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.220]   But kind of important.
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:35.060]   Here's the check mark.
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:37.700]   It's actually right on the front page of privacy settings.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.820]   Let friends of people tag to my--
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:41.340]   no, that's not it.
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.260]   Oh, it said it.
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:42.740]   Is that it?
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:45.420]   Let friends of people tag to my photos and posts see them.
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:46.980]   No, no, that's not it.
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.380]   Where is it?
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:49.460]   Customized settings.
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.220]   Control how you share.
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.100]   I'm looking.
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:52.900]   Control how you share.
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.980]   It's privacy settings.
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:55.980]   Privacy settings.
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:56.460]   Privacy settings.
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.460]   And then I think it's--
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:57.740]   Privacy settings.
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.580]   And then customize settings at the bottom of that.
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:00.740]   Customized settings.
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:01.060]   Yeah.
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:05.220]   And then from there, you go down to suggest photos
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:07.140]   of me to friends.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.780]   In the areas of the share.
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:11.340]   Suggest photos of me to friends.
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:12.460]   Think about that.
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:13.180]   Suggest.
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.500]   And it does not show you what it is currently set to.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.460]   It just says edit settings.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.380]   You have to edit settings.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:17.820]   Yeah, I've been told--
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:18.820]   I've been told--
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:21.260]   And then it's enabled by default.
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:24.660]   So you have to disable it manually,
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:26.860]   because otherwise it's normally enabled.
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:27.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:30.100]   This is a PR move.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.900]   It's all stupid.
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:36.060]   As a reality, Mr. Private Parsons thinks that bad.
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:38.060]   What about you, Gene?
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.100]   Well, I think we've had this conversation before
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.460]   about how you can take certain measures.
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:45.860]   If you want to be private about where you live,
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:48.340]   or where you've been, or who your friends are,
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.980]   you can do certain things to protect that information.
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:53.340]   But you can't control what other people can do.
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:54.740]   And it's so easy for other people
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:56.660]   to kind of share information about you.
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:59.940]   And I think that this is just another way.
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:01.980]   And I think Adam's point is really good.
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:04.940]   Facebook makes it so easy.
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:07.820]   The whole Picasa thing is download, scan, upload.
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:09.660]   I mean, Facebook makes it really easy.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:13.700]   So listen, I'm not--
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:17.460]   I just-- it enables your friends to broadcast information
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.980]   about you, whether or not you necessarily
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:21.180]   want that to happen.
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:24.140]   You do get notified and can remove the tag.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:24.660]   Exactly.
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.540]   You have no control on Facebook.
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:30.060]   I could put up a picture of you on my blog, or on Flickr,
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:32.060]   or anywhere on Google, or anywhere on the web.
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:34.020]   And you can't do Jack about it.
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:37.260]   On Facebook, you have the ability to take off your name.
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:38.460]   This, absolutely.
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:39.940]   That is absolutely true.
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:40.980]   And I have to go to Flickr.
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.780]   Can you not remove tags from Flickr?
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:43.700]   What's that?
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:46.980]   Can you not remove tags from Flickr's when they tag people?
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.660]   I think it's just text, isn't it?
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:53.220]   But if I just put in searchable text, Adam Pash--
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.220]   Mm.
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:54.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.220]   Right.
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:56.060]   You just mean if you're a description.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:58.100]   Because you can tag people on Flickr now.
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:58.460]   Like--
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:04:59.060]   Yeah, you can.
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:01.260]   --people as opposed to just text.
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.140]   Anyway.
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.780]   But the thing about it is what it's doing
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.180]   is it's taking a feature that they can already do.
[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:08.980]   And it's not automatically tagging you.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:11.100]   It's automatically suggesting you.
[01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:12.740]   It's recognizing your face and saying, hey,
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:14.340]   I think this might be Gina.
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.460]   And I think at the end of the day,
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:18.140]   they're making it easier to do something
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:19.460]   that you could already do anyway.
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.340]   And it's not forcing anyone to do it.
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:22.340]   Yeah.
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:25.300]   And it tells you that somebody just tagged you in a photo.
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.900]   And so I click on that.
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:27.740]   And I go look at it.
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:29.540]   And if it's not me, or if it's somebody
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:32.340]   that don't want to be doing this, I can unfriend them.
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.340]   I can do all kinds of things.
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:34.860]   Of course--
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:34.860]   Right.
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:39.980]   And it still requires your friend to say, yes, this is Jeff.
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:40.420]   Yes.
[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:41.780]   Tag him.
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.940]   It doesn't address the larger issue, though,
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:49.060]   of people who have their Facebook friends tattooed on their arm.
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:54.140]   When do I get the notice that my friend got me tattooed onto her?
[01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:57.980]   Leo, I hope that I'm somewhere on your body.
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:00.300]   Oh, I've got a special place for you.
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:02.300]   We're going to make that happen in a few of this weekend.
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.980]   We're going to get the Jarvis tattoo.
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:10.580]   This woman apparently has all 152 of her Facebook friends tattooed on her arm.
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:12.220]   It is just so friggin'.
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:13.220]   Why not?
[01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:13.740]   God.
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:15.140]   Why not?
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:17.100]   You know?
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:18.740]   That's a sleeve, all right.
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:19.740]   It is quite a sleeve.
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:20.820]   It's actually kind of cool looking.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:21.460]   I like the--
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:22.260]   It does look good.
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:22.580]   It does look good.
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:23.740]   Gina, no.
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:25.900]   No.
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:29.100]   My question is, what if you want to break up with that person?
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:30.220]   Are you?
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.340]   Yeah, you don't unfriend.
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:32.980]   Once the tattoo's there, there's no unfriended.
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.780]   Friends for life, baby.
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:39.460]   I hope that the person notified everybody whose image she decided to make this off of itself.
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:42.460]   Ah, that's the ultimate tagging, isn't it?
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:42.900]   Well, you still--
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:43.980]   I have no control here.
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:46.660]   I can't untag.
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:49.500]   Honeymoon 2, the army bachelor party 2, right?
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:53.860]   The Tyson tattoo has a copyright around it.
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:55.220]   You saw that story, right?
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.220]   Yeah, they've got--
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:57.220]   Yes.
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.300]   They're suing.
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:02.460]   Right, so is that an appropriate use of my image on your arm?
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:03.460]   Honey?
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:05.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.860]   Just don't put it on your face, OK?
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:09.180]   Yeah.
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.220]   Then you might be in trouble.
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:14.900]   On the media, they had me on this week to do EG8,
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:18.500]   but they had a segment before that, which was kind of great, was saying that basically
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:19.780]   with the--
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:21.420]   we're under one of those way off cloud.
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.820]   But could the owner of the tattoo,
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:31.820]   if you had that tattoo on your face, keep you from ever being pictured anywhere?
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:32.820]   That's a good question.
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:33.820]   Yeah.
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:34.820]   And then, interesting.
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:39.020]   I saw some lawyers debate this issue, and it's really complicated.
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:40.020]   Yeah.
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:42.020]   So Mike Tyson has a tattoo on his face.
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:46.260]   And he has a license from the guy for this specific purpose.
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:53.300]   Well, the guy didn't actually trademark the tattoo until recently, OK?
[01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:54.300]   Oh.
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.180]   So Hangover 2 comes out.
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:57.980]   And I mean, Tyson's in Hangover 1.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:00.740]   I don't know if the guy-- I mean, it's Mike.
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:01.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:05.820]   But then the guy-- and I think this is maybe legitimate that in Hangover 2, they copy the
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:08.740]   tattoo on another guy.
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:11.900]   Right, and Tyson's in Hangover 2, too.
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:13.420]   I thought that's the whole thing.
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:16.260]   Well, apparently it's OK for Tyson to wear it.
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.740]   Because he has the license.
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:19.220]   And so Tyson is suing.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.220]   I didn't see the story.
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.220]   No, the guy-- the artist who created the tattoo for Tyson.
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:25.940]   He says, that's my trade dress.
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:27.900]   That tattoo, I own that design.
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:29.740]   You can't use it on another person.
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:32.540]   Tyson can appear in a movie because he's-- it's on his face.
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:37.340]   I guess just the virtue of the fact that it's on his face gives him a license, right?
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:38.340]   Right.
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:41.900]   And one lawyer said that if they're making fun of Tyson, then it's fair comment.
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:42.900]   For use.
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:43.900]   It's parody.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:44.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:45.900]   That's exactly the defense.
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:49.140]   But if they're making fun of the character in the movie, and they're using that tattoo to
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:51.060]   that end, then it's a use.
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.340]   Right.
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:55.180]   And if it's parody, it's another matter.
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:57.780]   And you seem like you have a lot of money.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:59.420]   And I could make some by suing.
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:01.140]   That's what it sounds like.
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:02.140]   Yeah.
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:07.700]   So there's a game going on right now, a two day long game on Google that gives you a preview
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:08.700]   of a Chromebook.
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:13.620]   I don't know if you get a Chromebook if you-- I didn't understand.
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:14.620]   OK.
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:20.580]   Plus, by the way, I almost did it on-- watch the call.
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:21.580]   For mentally.
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:23.900]   It was guilt, but it was no returns.
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:24.900]   Yeah.
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:25.900]   Oh.
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:26.900]   No, you got to be able to receive it.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:27.900]   You couldn't have the reboxing.
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:28.900]   No, go reboxing.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:29.900]   I got a guy.
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:32.900]   I reserve the right to rebox anything in life.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:37.100]   Yeah, I think they're absolutely right, including your tattoo.
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.820]   Yes.
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:43.460]   So you could be-- you could get a Chromebook early, I guess is the idea.
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:49.460]   And so there are a bunch of links that they've been putting up on the Google Chrome blog.
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:53.700]   You know, I don't know that people are just dying to get the Chromebook.
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:54.700]   I mean, this is the thing.
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:57.580]   Like, are there people clamoring to get the Chromebook early?
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:58.580]   I don't-- I don't know.
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:09:59.580]   I feel like--
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.540]   People are getting free stuff.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:05.820]   It's not like if they were in a contest to get an iPad 2 early or something like that.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:06.820]   Like, what is this?
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:09.820]   People participating are excited because they're going to get a free computer.
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:10.820]   Right.
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:11.980]   No, I think you still buy it.
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:12.980]   You just get it early.
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:16.220]   Oh, that's why you-- I don't know why anyone's going to participate.
[01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:19.380]   This is not-- maybe I'm wrong, but that's the impression I get.
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:24.020]   Well, one of the stories that I saw said something about how Google, I think, tries
[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:30.060]   to recreate the Gmail invite scarcity kind of thing with a lot of new product launches
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:34.900]   and nothing really quite has been like that.
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:38.900]   But I wish you well, Chromebook.
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:44.260]   Let's-- we're going to get to our picks of the week.
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:47.780]   Our tool of the week, our tip of the week, our number of the week, and Adam's got a tip
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:48.780]   of the week.
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:49.780]   I do.
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:52.260]   So an extra bonus tip this week.
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:53.940]   There's a good guest for you.
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:55.180]   Yes, a good guest.
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:56.900]   A guest who does his homework.
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:00.740]   But before we do that, I do want to just give a little plug to my friends at Netflix.com.
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:04.980]   If you don't yet use Netflix, if you'd like to know more about it, we have a 30-day free
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:05.980]   trial.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:06.980]   Whoa!
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:09.460]   Netflix just redesigned.
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.500]   Whoa!
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.740]   Netflix.com/twig.
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:13.820]   Go there.
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:17.340]   I'm on the-- I'm on the-- on the-- watch instantly thing.
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:19.540]   So now they've got big pictures of the DVD.
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:20.540]   Ooh!
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:21.540]   And it's slidey.
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:22.540]   Shmancy.
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:23.540]   Shmancy.
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:24.540]   Wow.
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:28.460]   I guess they want more people to watch instantly on the computer.
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:29.820]   I call that Apple-y.
[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:30.820]   It's very Apple-y.
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:31.820]   Look at that.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:32.820]   It's like cover flow.
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.660]   I'll tell you, I love Netflix.
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:38.980]   If you have not yet tried this, ooh, romancing the stone.
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:43.380]   If you have-- that's what I use this for is watching crappy movies.
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:48.380]   So movies you'd be embarrassed to rent.
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:52.420]   But there's no-- there's very little opportunity costs to this.
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:55.020]   You just press the button and you start watching the movie.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:56.300]   So I didn't have to go to a movie store.
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.860]   I didn't have to get a DVD in the mail.
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:58.860]   I just watched.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:03.620]   So I actually do watch more guilty pleasure movies, far more guilty pleasure movies on
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:04.820]   Netflix Watch instantly.
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.700]   That's a good reason to have it.
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.140]   Try it free for 30 days.
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:15.020]   Go to psc.com/twit on a PS3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, Blu-ray players, TVs, or on your computer,
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:17.420]   Mac or PC, and your iPad and your iPhone.
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.540]   And now some Android phones.
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:21.900]   You can watch your Netflix movies in high def.
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.340]   It's fantastic.
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:27.940]   Let's just sit back and watch a little bit of romancing the stone with Michael Douglas.
[01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:32.100]   And I don't know who had some lady on a fine.
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:33.100]   Who's in this movie?
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:34.100]   Who?
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.100]   Katherine Turner.
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:36.100]   Katherine Turner.
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:37.100]   Katherine Turner.
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:39.700]   That's actually she makes this movie.
[01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:40.700]   In the good days.
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:41.700]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:42.700]   Oh, I like her now.
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:43.700]   Does this make us ban from YouTube?
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:44.700]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:45.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:46.700]   Wait a minute.
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:47.700]   Thank you.
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:50.300]   It's a Michael Douglas production.
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:51.900]   A Robert Zemeckis film.
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.820]   See, this is what I love.
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:56.540]   I just, I'm, see enough.
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:59.100]   We just did a little bit.
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.580]   Fair use.
[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:02.460]   We're just trying to get people to join Netflix.
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.020]   Netflix.com/twit.
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:08.660]   You can see the rest of this movie and a lot of other stuff.
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:12.700]   I tell you, I literally every night now, I watch Netflix streaming.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:13.700]   It's so great.
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.180]   All right.
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:19.500]   Time for our tool of the week from Ms. Gina Tripani.
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:20.500]   Our tip of the week, I should say.
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:21.500]   Tip of the week.
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.500]   Tip of the week.
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.500]   Tip of the week.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:27.700]   Google Calendar rolled out a new feature called appointment slots, which lets you define
[01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:32.460]   blocks of time on your calendar where you're available to take appointments.
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:35.860]   So, and you can say what kind of time slots.
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:39.660]   You can say I'm available from one before on Thursday and half an hour slots and anybody
[01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:42.620]   can come and book a time, which is really cool.
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:43.620]   Something I really enjoy.
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:48.340]   I try to batch my meetings into groups so I can just knock them out one right after another.
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.900]   So you can set that up now.
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:54.020]   And actually, I'm looking at my calendar and I don't think I have this yet.
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:55.740]   Yeah, I think it's a slow rollout.
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:57.460]   I don't have it either.
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:00.060]   But I think it's one of those couple of weeks things.
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:04.980]   It's good if you're a hairdresser or you do manicures or...
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:08.740]   But you would use this, Gina, for making dates with people.
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.660]   Am I frozen on Skype?
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:11.660]   That's awesome.
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:12.660]   It's a good picture too.
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:13.660]   I like it.
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:14.660]   Oh yeah, it's really flattering.
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:15.660]   I love it.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.700]   I'm just going to leave it there for a while.
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:22.380]   John Wirthwick, a bigger works, used to use this all the time.
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:23.380]   I forget who it was.
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:27.020]   He did it with Nail Lemon in it, but he would publish his availabilities.
[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:29.020]   And he said, "Yes, let's meet."
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:31.820]   He would send you there and you'd pick a time and you put it in and that was that.
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:33.660]   Yeah, there are a lot of services that do this.
[01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:35.220]   Right, so it was convenient.
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:36.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:37.220]   I don't know that.
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:40.420]   The problem I have with the overload, I mean, Leo, if you did that, everybody would say,
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:42.220]   "Lio, I just want five minutes."
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.220]   Right.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:44.220]   I don't have a slot to stay here.
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:45.220]   I see you have five minutes there.
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:47.220]   Yeah, that's why I don't have slots.
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:48.220]   No.
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.820]   It's good for office hours.
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:53.020]   If I want to be available right now, I'm set at an appointment.
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:54.020]   That kind of thing.
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:55.020]   That's a good idea.
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.020]   That's a good idea.
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.780]   Where would it, how would I know?
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:59.220]   I don't even know.
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:04.860]   When you click to create a new event, it would show up as a possible option in that box.
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:05.860]   Cool.
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:10.220]   Did you know that you can send, you can create events via SMS text messages?
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:12.020]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:14.500]   Goog Calendar has a lot of like, hidden stuff like that.
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:15.500]   That's awesome.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:16.500]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:21.140]   So I can text my, I can text G-V-E-N-T and add something to my calendar.
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:26.180]   And you can text that short code today and get your list of appointments or tomorrow,
[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:27.420]   get your list of appointments via SMS.
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:28.420]   It's crazy.
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:30.220]   Sorry, my video is out.
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:34.860]   It's my button is- I actually pay for a service called Dial to Do that I might not need anymore,
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:35.860]   especially because of Android Dictate.
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:39.980]   By the way, it wasn't that interesting that Apple did not add that to iOS 5.
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:43.580]   I don't do some rumors that maybe they planned to and that weren't able to make a deal with
[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:46.420]   Nuance, but there's no currently anyway.
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:52.780]   There's no voice dictation to iOS 5, which is a big feature in Android.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:55.020]   They did add the notifications though.
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:58.260]   They totally copied the Android notifications, but I'm fine with that.
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.260]   They needed to do that.
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:02.780]   There was a terrible system.
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:03.780]   So you got no video?
[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:04.780]   That's all right, Gina.
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:05.780]   We're almost done.
[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:08.820]   Yeah, sorry, but then I'm messing with preferences right now and I'm getting the beach ball,
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:09.820]   which is not- Don't worry about it.
[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:12.260]   I can hear you and that's what I care about.
[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:13.260]   Good, good.
[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:17.860]   So Adam's going to give us double the money, double the tips, Adam Pash from LifeHanger.com.
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:18.860]   Go ahead.
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:26.740]   Okay, so you may have seen a few weeks ago Gmail and AOL got together to let you add
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:33.580]   AIM, AOL Instant Messenger, AIM users to your Google chat inside Gmail.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:38.340]   So if you use Google chat with, to talk to people, but you also have AIM buddies and
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:42.140]   whatever, you can import them into your Google chat.
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:44.060]   So you don't have to have a separate chat client.
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:45.900]   You can chat with them all from there.
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:56.140]   There's a mass importer at AIM.com/import-to-gmail and it'll import, I think, something like 38th
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:58.220]   of your most used AIM buddies.
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:03.780]   And the cool thing about it is once you import them into Gmail, Google talk, Google chat,
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:10.100]   whatever it's supposed to be called, you can also, I am those AIM buddies from talk on
[01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.260]   your Android phone too.
[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:16.780]   So it sort of adds a new protocol into what you can do with the default Google apps.
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:19.780]   So this is actually a AOL feature.
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:25.220]   Well, it's an AOL feature integrated directly into Gmail.
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:28.700]   Google and AOL got together to make this happen.
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:31.340]   That's great.
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:32.340]   That's great.
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:36.340]   So Google talk now.
[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:37.660]   It always supported AIM.
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:39.700]   You could log into AIM from Gmail.
[01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:46.060]   Now it actually puts the AIM contacts into your Google contacts so that if you're using
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:50.340]   something like Google talk on your Android phone, you can still, I am back and forth
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:54.500]   with those AIM contacts as well as your regular Google contacts.
[01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.300]   How am I do that right now?
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:57.300]   Awesome.
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:58.300]   Yeah.
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.300]   Awesome.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.860]   Jeff Jarvis, our number of the week.
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:03.100]   A little one here, 30%.
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:07.060]   And that is the increase in Arab Facebook users this year alone.
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:08.060]   Wow.
[01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:09.060]   And that's because the--
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:10.780]   The Arab Spring, I would guess.
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:11.780]   Yeah.
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:12.780]   Yeah.
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:13.780]   Home, I think that's wonderful.
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:17.220]   I went to the Personal Democracy Forum the last two days, which was great.
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:21.500]   And they had a lot of folks from Tunisia and Egypt and so on there.
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:26.580]   And I talked to one researcher who just come back from Egypt who said that there's kind
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:30.020]   of a little bit of a backlash here is that the revolutionaries want credit.
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:31.860]   They don't want Facebook to get all the credit.
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:34.660]   No one really gives Facebook all the credit.
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:37.380]   They're those who say that we do, but no one does.
[01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:41.500]   But she said you just can't tell this story without telling Facebook, without using Facebook
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:42.500]   as part of the story.
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:43.500]   That's awesome.
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.740]   That's really awesome.
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.740]   My tip actually, a piggyback's on a news story.
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:53.660]   I don't know if it's a true story or not, but a rumor from Engadget that the Google Maps
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:59.260]   tool would soon allow you to down-- or the Google navigation, I guess, is Google Navigate,
[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:03.460]   would soon allow you to download Maps and have another way to give you offline access.
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:07.980]   La Tom Tom or Garmin, it'll actually turn it into a real GPS.
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:11.900]   The only thing missing right now from Google Navigate is the fact that you have to be online
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:14.180]   to use it.
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:16.380]   If that happens, that's a stunner.
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:18.340]   Google Navigate can cache though, right?
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:19.820]   Like it will download and cache.
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:22.260]   It cannot charge you what it's doing.
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.260]   Yeah.
[01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:24.260]   Yeah.
[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:25.260]   That's just a rumor.
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:29.860]   My tool is actually only available for people who live in Brooklyn.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:30.860]   And San Diego.
[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:31.860]   And San Diego.
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:34.020]   They must have known you were there, Gina.
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:35.420]   I was like, this never happened.
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:38.860]   I was so thrilled because San Diego was never in the list of cities that these things get
[01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:39.860]   rolled out in.
[01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:41.540]   It's-- and in San Francisco.
[01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:46.380]   So it's a very useful thing in San Francisco because Muni is never on time.
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:51.020]   So now you can actually know how long you're going to have to sit at the Muni bus stop waiting
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:52.500]   for the bus to come.
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:56.780]   It's transit schedule information built into Google Maps.
[01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:57.860]   I think this is about time.
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:59.300]   I really am thrilled to have this.
[01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:03.180]   And I imagine they'll roll it out in other places soon enough.
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:04.580]   But what a nice feature.
[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:08.540]   I guess it probably isn't everywhere because the transit system has to somehow have some
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:11.380]   sort of way of signaling where the bus is.
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:13.380]   Is it just schedule or is it current location?
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:14.940]   No, it's current location.
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:15.940]   Yeah.
[01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:17.420]   So it's a little lazy.
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:19.820]   Each bus has to have some sort of transmitter on it, right?
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:22.020]   I mean, how else could they do it?
[01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.020]   Right.
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:25.900]   So that's the point is that I think it's only going to happen in municipalities where
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.700]   they've got that infrastructure already there.
[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:29.700]   But what a nice idea.
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:32.300]   In other words, Petaluma, we're not going to know.
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:34.740]   I think can I happen in the Petaluma bus system?
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:35.740]   You have buses in Petaluma?
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:36.740]   Yeah, we do.
[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:38.740]   They're little shirt buses.
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:42.020]   They're little buses, they'll be any buses.
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:43.020]   Nobody takes them.
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:44.020]   They're always empty.
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.020]   It's great.
[01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:46.020]   It's great.
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:47.020]   I don't even know what it costs.
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:49.740]   I've never taken a Petaluma bus, but somebody must.
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:54.140]   Ride a chicken.
[01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:55.380]   That's about it.
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:59.220]   For this particular program, Gina Trapani has lost her picture, but...
[01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:00.220]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:01.780]   Fortunately, she's still with us.
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:03.380]   I'm just a pinwheel of death.
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:05.220]   She's a disembodied voice.
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:06.220]   Yes.
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:07.220]   Yes.
[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:08.820]   Why does it seem to happen to me more than anyone else?
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:10.180]   I don't know what's up.
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:12.300]   That's because you live in the cloud, Gina.
[01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.300]   That's it.
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:15.820]   The connection here is sometimes wonky.
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:19.380]   It's your beauty breaks the camera.
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:20.380]   That's what happens.
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:21.380]   That's okay.
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:22.380]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:23.380]   That's how I'm going to put it.
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:24.380]   I will.
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.380]   That was awesome being...
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.380]   I love having Adam too.
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:27.380]   It was great.
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:28.380]   Oh, it's fun.
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:29.380]   Yeah, Adam, you must come back.
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:31.500]   Gina is at smartaward.org or thinkupapp.com.
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:34.540]   And of course her handle on Twitter is @ginaTrapani.
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:40.460]   We'll have to do this from now on because Twitter is now the official Internet identity
[01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:41.460]   service.
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.180]   Last by Apple, we must.
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:44.180]   Yeah.
[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:45.180]   I was watching MSNBC the other day.
[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:46.180]   They didn't do lower thirds.
[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:47.180]   They just did...
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:48.180]   They didn't do people's names.
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:49.180]   They just did their Twitter handle underneath.
[01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:50.180]   Service?
[01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:51.180]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:52.180]   Just the Twitter handle?
[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:53.180]   That's easy.
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:54.180]   I mean, it's...
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:55.180]   Might have been just...
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:22:00.420]   I was watching for a few minutes and it's Lawrence O'Donnell and it's just @Lorence.
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:05.340]   I mean, I was really interested that they would feel like that's sufficient.
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:06.340]   Now.
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:08.860]   Now, if they were in France, it'd be another matter.
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:12.340]   You heard that the France banned that?
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:18.540]   You can't say on French newscasts, "Follow us on Twitter or Facebook because it's anti-competitive."
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:19.540]   Oh.
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:20.540]   Crazy.
[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:21.540]   Wow.
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:24.580]   We want them in charge of the Internet, don't we?
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:25.580]   Yeah, really.
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:26.580]   Not.
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:30.260]   I guess you were right about Sarkozy all on.
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:34.980]   Gina, I will see you at food camp in the Sebastopol this weekend and we'll get you
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:39.100]   on Twitch right after if we can figure out the logistics.
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:40.100]   Right on.
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:41.100]   Look forward to it.
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:43.580]   Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York.
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:44.660]   He's a professor there.
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:46.660]   That means he's educated.
[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:51.100]   He's also a writer at Buzzmachine.com in his book, What Would Google Do and look for public
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:53.140]   parts in September.
[01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:54.140]   Brand new book.
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:56.380]   Great to have you at the galleries tonight.
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:57.380]   Really?
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:00.580]   So you finished the book, so this is just like making sure there's no type of--
[01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:03.260]   This is praying that there's nothing horribly wrong in it.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:07.820]   Yeah, whenever I would get that, you know, like editors copy, I would just go, "Yeah,
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:08.820]   that's fine.
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:11.100]   Oh, you know, I'm nasty."
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:15.260]   And then the book comes out and you want to jump off a bridge because you see a typo.
[01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:17.620]   No, I don't care.
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:18.820]   You know what Corey Doctorow does?
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:19.820]   It's great.
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:22.740]   Corey has kind of this crowd source typos.
[01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:26.700]   You get a free copy of the book if you find a typo and a footnote on that page.
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:27.700]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:28.700]   That's really neat.
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:29.700]   That's really neat.
[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:30.700]   Corey is great.
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:31.700]   Corey, Corey is amazing.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:33.700]   Good, good wuffy there.
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.500]   Adam Pash, thank you so much for being here.
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.180]   Adam is a writer for a little life.
[01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:38.620]   Actually, what's your title at LifeHack?
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:40.220]   I am editor in chief.
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.220]   Not merely a writer.
[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:42.220]   He's the man.
[01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:44.180]   He's the man at LifeHacker.
[01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:46.180]   Thank you so much for having me.
[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:47.180]   Thanks for being here.
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:48.180]   We really appreciate it.
[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:53.780]   Thank you all for joining us on this episode of This Week in Google.
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:58.700]   Make sure you tune in every Wednesday, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Time.
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:02.100]   That is 2000 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:04.740]   Of course, you get the show after the fact.
[01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:11.540]   In audio and video at twit.tv/twit, we are very close to launching the new website.
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:12.940]   I'm very excited about that.
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:14.500]   It'll make it much easier.
[01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:17.380]   Each show will have its own community around it, by the way.
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:21.620]   We will have a chance to have interaction with people who watch the show.
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:22.620]   Oh, cool.
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:23.620]   Get me in that beta.
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:24.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:25.620]   I bet.
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:26.620]   We'll get you in the beta, absolutely.
[01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:27.620]   Right on.
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:29.860]   In some ways, that's what these bricks are ending up supporting.
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:32.300]   It all goes into the same fun.
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:36.180]   The bricks are to help us build the studio, but money that we can save on the studio construction
[01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:38.620]   goes into the website design.
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:40.300]   We're hoping to launch them both at the same time.
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:41.300]   bricks.twit.tv.
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:43.940]   If you don't have a brick yet, I was actually very moved.
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:49.380]   I went through the first 650 inscriptions because they're about to, they laser them into the
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:50.620]   bricks.
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:51.620]   I was just so touched.
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:53.780]   There were memorials for people that were kind words.
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:54.660]   It was just really neat.
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:58.380]   I'm really glad we did it.
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:24:59.380]   Really am.
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:04.180]   bricks.twit.tv, if you want to get your name or your Twitter handle or your company's name
[01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:08.740]   or even your company's logo, because we have on the bigger ones, we have them for a logo.
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:12.580]   bricks.twit.tv, if you want to find out about it, if you're international, go to that site,
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:13.580]   you'll see a phone number.
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:16.460]   That's the number you need to call to get international sales.
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:17.780]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:21.380]   We're going to go on a tour of the Twit brick house right after this, by the way.
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:22.380]   So I hope you'll...
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:23.380]   -Shining.
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:24.380]   -Yes.
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:25.380]   -Yes.
[01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:26.380]   -Tune.
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:27.380]   -Well, we got a lot done.
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:28.380]   A lot done.
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:29.380]   TNT is coming up next, though, with Tom Marin.
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:30.380]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:31.380]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:31.380]   [Music]
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:38.380]   -Who's that?
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:46.380]   -That was my dog.
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:47.380]   Excuse him.
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:48.380]   -That's my dog.
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:50.780]   What's your dog's name, Adam?
[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:51.780]   -Buddy.
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:54.980]   -I'll see you a lot of geeks like Nick Bilton's dog is named.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:57.580]   A lot of geeks have dog names, geek dog names.
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:58.580]   -Yeah, he's...
[01:25:58.580 --> 01:25:59.880]   I'm going to call him Budman.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.880]   You can see him there about...
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.220]   -Oh, yeah, there's Buddy.
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.220]   Is he...
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:06.460]   What is that, a Pecanese?
[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:10.320]   -He is probably miniature pincher and maybe a chihuahua blend.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:14.660]   He was a rescue who showed up on our doorstep, so we don't really know.
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:15.660]   -He chose you.
