[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   It's time for Twig this week at Google at Prude has the week off Stacey Higginbotham's here Jeff Jarvis is here
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:13.360]   Stacey is going to explain project chips new name and why may this may be the greatest hope for home automation
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.320]   Then we'll talk about tiles sidewalk deal with Amazon. This could be a savior for tile
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.760]   We'll also say goodbye to type one fonts. That's the end of the line
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.880]   Plus we'll get Google to sing us the vaccine song. It's all coming up next on Twig

[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.240]   It's time for twig this week in Google the show we talk about everything but Google
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.400]   Stacey Hicomothom is here. She's our IOT and chip expert. She's also pretty good on bandwidth
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.600]   It's Stacy and IOT calm is the website. Hello Stacy. We missed you
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.360]   Yes, sorry, I was I don't know what I was doing. Oh, you were busy you were speaking yours
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.520]   You were speaking to Jeff's Jeff's
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.800]   Students, that was not my fault. It was not my fault. That was yeah, that was the day before we can't blame Jeff for that
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.360]   Well, well actually let me introduce Jeff that we can talk about Jeff Jarvis is also here Leonard Tal professor for journal
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.840]   Like a journal like a demonstration what I'm doing like journal licking
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.360]   Instabation intubation at the
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.960]   Craig
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.720]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York normally we would have Ant Prutes
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.480]   Baso Profundo joining ours Dalset tones, but he is on vacation
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.480]   Good for ant good for a ant
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.360]   We have to make our employees take vacation
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:53.640]   Partly because of Covid. There's nowhere really interesting to go. Yeah, I'm really glad that he finally this is first both he and
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.000]   Micar taking the first vacation since they started here
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.560]   Wow, I know
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.480]   so
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.920]   Scooter X in the IRC has voted for our top story. You didn't even know we were doing that did you?
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.960]   Project chip I thought it was in a democracy. It's not a democracy scooter X
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.280]   Who would you in charge?
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.520]   He is a dictator. That's why
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.280]   Project chip
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.160]   Gets a new name and so does the Zigbee Alliance Stacy on IOT. He's got the stories
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.120]   This has Stacy written all over it. It does
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.880]   Right. He was actually yeah, I man. This is all I've been doing all week long
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.280]   So is this is this is this just an a rename or is this mean something more than just that?
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.320]   So it is the same standard that we have been calling Project chip for the last two years almost 18 months
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.440]   It is now called matter
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.360]   And chips steps for something though, right chip was an acronym. Yes the connected home
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.280]   Over IP over IP which technically should be choice
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.400]   Obvious reason
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.880]   What is more interesting than matter?
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.960]   Yeah, I'll just be shook on a choice. Yeah, what is matter is that is a very generic doesn't even
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.720]   Tell you anything about what it is. Oh, it doesn't so I'd love for you to do a couple things
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.560]   So one of this okay, so let's finish up the story because there's two parts to this naming. Okay
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.960]   Project chip was part of the Zigbee Alliance
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.800]   So what happened two days ago was that both organizations got or both entities got a new name
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.320]   So the Zigbee Alliance because they're going to be in charge of this new standard for the smart home
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.240]   That was going to be such a big honking deal realize they can no longer be called the Zigbee Alliance
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.760]   Because this new standard is going to surpass Zigbee. Well, and all the zigbee sounds like a circus clown. So
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.080]   Well, I mean it's a standard. Yeah, okay. So now they're this is better
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.760]   The new one. No, it's very generic. You're gonna not like it if you don't like matter
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.960]   It's the connectivity standards alliance. No, I you know why I like this because that's exactly what it is
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.760]   That's that's a name that says what it is. It's a standard for connectivity particularly
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.880]   IOT connectivity or home automation connectivity
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.440]   Right. Yes. Okay. Yes. So actually it will be
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.640]   Yes home automation, but also smart buildings tied to mostly MDU's so apartment complexes
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.080]   So that's the connectivity standards alliance that used to be known as the Zigbee Alliance
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.600]   The project chip was a working group as part of that alliance and now project chip is called matter
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.840]   so
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.920]   I had to sit through a 30-minute briefing
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:53.640]   mostly focused on fonts because god knows when you develop a new standard
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:59.880]   And you rename your alliance fonts are the most essential elements. So what font is they are important?
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.200]   I'm curious they they created a font so they went to inner brands and the font is now called assemble
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.920]   And it looks like this
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:15.240]   Stacy has an example of assemble. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's the same as on the webpage. Oh, yeah
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.560]   Is this the tables on the website? Yeah, it's ugly. They're very excited about it. It's a hideous font. I gotta tell you it's okay. It's yours
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.840]   Oh
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.680]   We're here. There are fonts with ligatures. You know why you want ligatures. Why do you want ligatures? No one knows
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:36.520]   It's not ligaments the things. Oh, it is like ligaments. That's that was there. They were like it's connecting things and oh no
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.680]   No, no trying too hard trying just too hard. Please please just let me tell you
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:50.200]   There are 127 different ligatures. Oh, geez. And none of them follow any linguistic rules
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.720]   I just want you to know that it's completely random
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.360]   I'm like, okay, so the a and the am or ligature what there's no reason for the a and the am to be like sure
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:08.600]   Okay, I'm gonna give you a couple options here. Oh ice cream Oreos and toffee the r and the the r now looks like it's
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.120]   It's got an F. It's oh, these are awful
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.320]   so
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.000]   e and a
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.240]   In this one c and t but if you go later and you look at things the e and the a are not always done
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.840]   Yeah, because you don't have to use the ligature because some poor schmuck has to manually put it in
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:35.240]   So i'm familiar with like a in this in fonts because uh, it's not unusual to use ligatures in programming languages and terminals
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.800]   so in instance in the
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:44.520]   Some languages double you have two equal signs and the ligature would combine them into one long equal sign or for people who are writers
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.000]   You guys are writers the m dash
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.320]   You when you type two that regular hyphens you get an m dash and the ligature turns it into a long
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:59.320]   M dash things like that. Oh, is that how that? Thank you. Okay, that's nice
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:06.040]   So there is a real good purpose mr. Lina type nose for ligatures. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well, I mean you
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.040]   You and f and an f
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.360]   Really look nice together as like we're doing true, right? Um, but this is ugly
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:18.520]   Faces what's the name of this font again stacy assemble and it was created by inner brands
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.880]   Oh my god, how much money did they make off doing that horrible thing? Cheese
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:28.120]   I don't know, but you know what they're big so they're okay, so
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.800]   In our way, we have another fun for ikea
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.200]   better brand
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.040]   Um, no inner brand is a big branding company. Oh, okay
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:45.480]   Interbrand I think oh, yeah, they you know what they do brand agency what among other things they do fonts because they did a font
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.280]   for
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.640]   Uh, one plus it looks like they do some other fonts. Yeah, they do. I mean this it's literally what they do
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.200]   Oh, that's interesting. Oh
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.920]   God they don't do naming
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.400]   Inner brand a division of omnican
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.880]   That's like
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.400]   We have another font story. We'll come back to it. So it's font day font day on the uh
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:16.680]   So on twig more to the point because nobody really cares about ligatures in this special font. That was fun
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.760]   No, that was a fun little no no no no
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:24.280]   It was nice for stacy to have a detour for once. I know usually it's our fault not complaining by any means
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:30.440]   No, it was nice. I like that but you said something that that got me interested stacy. They the standard is final
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.520]   The standard is now at the point seven version. They're it's basically final
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:42.200]   They're gonna run it and now they're starting testing of devices. So things will be tweaked a little bit in testing but nothing
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:48.120]   Uh substantial will change could just be though that we finally reached the holy grail
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.160]   Of home automation. This is no
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:10:00.600]   I'm gonna let you finish this is plagued home automation since for at least a decade
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:08.120]   Was this proliferation of standards that are incompatible and you had to have a a hub for one device and a hub for another device
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.880]   And I mean it's just always been a nightmare and we've been hoping that this
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:18.520]   What was known as chip the connectivity standards alliance? No, no, that's because it'd be
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.160]   Matter what was known as chip. It is now matter is now matter
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.800]   Uh would solve this
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.840]   So here's what's gonna happen. Here's what it does today or well not today
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.120]   Here's what it will do at the end of this year when products come out. Okay
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:43.880]   We will see a small section of devices that it will work with so lights blinds TVs hvac security products bridges
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.560]   controllers
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.560]   um in like
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.840]   Controllers like smart displays and bridges are like things to bridge
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.080]   um like from
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.400]   like my hue bridge for example, so
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.160]   Those devices will work on the standard
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.440]   A lot of other devices that we might use like are any of our cameras will not be part of this
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.160]   appliances not yet
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.680]   um
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.400]   Those devices generally use Wi-Fi
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.080]   So that's so chip. Oh, sorry. So matter
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.200]   Uses Wi-Fi matter is an application layer protocol. So it's at the software layer
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.040]   So it doesn't care what the with the carrying protocol is whether it's thread or
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:32.040]   Zig day it cares. So today it's going to use Wi-Fi for high bandwidth and powered devices and
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:39.160]   thread for sensors and because that's low data rate. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, so
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.480]   technically
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.960]   You could run matter over something like bluetooth
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:51.800]   But apparently nobody is and the like the network topologies don't have that bluetooth is only going to be part of this in the sense that you can use bluetooth to provision
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.400]   for
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.280]   Matter devices, but not any other part
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.120]   I have to say I was skeptical when chip project chip was started because it was
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:06.600]   What was Amazon apple and google right means these big companies that have a lot of interest in not working together
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.880]   So I just thought there's no I was very skeptical about it, but it sounds like in fact they were able to
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.760]   Figure this out. Yeah
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:19.080]   I was going to so if we didn't talk about this, I didn't think everybody would care because you know
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.200]   Oh, this was this this was our top story of the week
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.840]   Oh, wow
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.920]   Um, but I was gonna say if you wanted me to we could do one of our little
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.400]   dis
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.840]   Cord chat things if people wanted to ask questions, but I don't know if you want to do that and I know it's not a democracy
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:43.560]   No, no, no, no, no, no, we can't so I will tell the people in the stage. Uh, we have a if you are in the
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.240]   discord, uh, we have a stage
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.880]   This is for the club twit members
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.320]   and
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:56.840]   We keep we keep this stage open jeff's there and states you can join and if you have a question you want to talk about this
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.320]   Uh, do raise your hand this particularly. We'll talk about this time
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:07.080]   Uh, we'll talk about uh, this chip thing. So, uh, which is now a matter
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.880]   And I can also take things from the, um, the chat. We just won't hear your lovely voices
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:18.280]   TDD has a hand up. Yes, I see that so I'm gonna put TD invite TDD to join the stage
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.280]   And yes, of course if you see something in irc feel free, uh, as well
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.720]   Um, so tdd welcome to club twit first of all
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:34.280]   Thank you so much nice to have you where you were you calling us? Where are you joining us from
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:39.320]   Missouri all right. Are you skeptical of this?
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:45.560]   He says show me. Well, this work with the nest head the nest hub
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.880]   Oh
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.200]   The nest hub we don't know yet, but google I actually had kevin poh from google
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:57.560]   He's gonna be on tomorrow's podcast and he says at iow we're gonna see more from google about this
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.840]   Oh good
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.400]   Because they're part of the part of the matter alliance, right?
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.040]   So yeah, that's and then how about apples home kit will this work with home kit?
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.080]   I expect
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.320]   These so my hunch and again, we won't know until fall
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:21.400]   How they're gonna put it in their devices because the nest hub has Wi-Fi they could implement it as
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.360]   Somewhat of controller home kit the nest sorry the home kit
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:32.360]   home pod mini is actually in a better position because it has both Wi-Fi and thread in it, right? So
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:37.960]   That means it could act as a bridge for the thread devices. You're gonna need something with that or
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:45.960]   To cross to thread to cross from my fighter tdd do you do any home automation now you sounds like you have nest devices
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:52.840]   Uh, I just got my light bulbs put in and i'm trying to set it up. Whose light bulbs are you using?
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.640]   Who makes you like?
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.480]   Okay, uh, ozir they actually deprecated their whole
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.400]   Have I think um are your light bulbs bluetooth?
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.600]   Are they zigby? Yes
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.240]   Yes, they're bluetooth so those are probably not gonna work
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.200]   No, this is this is you don't want to be sorry about that
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.840]   This is the heartbreak of home automation
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.760]   That's been this way for so long and I think there's a lot of people
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.560]   I what tdd I've been through the same thing where I bought this stuff and it didn't integrate
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:33.320]   I had a nest thermostat and then I have a hue lights and and it's just it's your hue lights are gonna keep working
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:39.800]   They will work so hue has said the phillips hue lights they also own a brand called whiz that will not work
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:48.200]   But or the existing stuff won't but the existing hue lights and this is what you should be looking for and asking your product manufacturers
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:55.400]   So the hue light bulbs use zigby and there's a hub the phillips hue hub that translates that zigby to wifi
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.880]   phillips hue is going to update that hub so
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:06.200]   It will be matter compliant which means all of your existing light bulbs will still continue to talk to that hub
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:12.520]   But they will also at that point get converted to matter data models and then they will talk to everything else
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.800]   That's great news actually that's so that's great for phillips hue people
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   Yeah, not so good for silvane
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.720]   Any of your brands that have like hubs or bridges
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.320]   Yeah, those
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.800]   You're gonna look for those manufacturers to say hey
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:31.800]   We're gonna flash an update to our hubs that allow your device that hangs off that hub to be
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:36.840]   Matter so yeah sounds like going forward. You should look for matter compliant on the box
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:43.080]   Yes, can you show them the logo? Do you see the matter logo if you go to the website weird font?
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.720]   It's it is interesting. I see it on this
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:53.240]   Speaker yeah, so and if you scroll down to that light bulb you'll see it on the light bulb and scroll down to the lock actually
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.480]   it looks it looks like um
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.520]   what it looks like is
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:04.440]   Uh, I don't know like three nails head to head or something like that
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:10.120]   I was gonna say make an arrow and then round your picture. Oh, yeah, yeah three arrows
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:16.440]   Three of them together pointing at each other rounded so it's a circular firing squad, which is a perfect logo
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.840]   For this for this
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:21.880]   company
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:29.240]   Um, so are you so let me ask our chatter are you is by the way? What's your name? I don't want to keep calling you TDD
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:34.840]   Tommy Tommy what's what do you think is this encouraging or discouraging?
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.040]   Yes very encouraging
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:43.720]   I like to I'm doing it wanted to do the bathroom in the kitchen. So when I have those
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:49.800]   Paws in the middle of night. I could say turn the bathroom light on or i love that. Yeah, yeah
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.840]   And that's nice when you go to bed to say, uh, you know good night or turn the lights off or whatever
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.400]   Yes, yes, I agree with you. Yeah, so I used to in my lights
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:06.440]   I actually I used phillips hue lights and I used a motion sensor and this will actually get easier now with the
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.120]   The matter if you buy the matter compliant sensor or matter compliant bulb
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:15.000]   And I would actually schedule it so my lights would during a certain time of day
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.560]   My lights in the bathroom would only turn on like to 10 percent. Yes. I do the same thing. Yeah, it's nice
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:25.480]   They don't blind you and it was on the motion sensor. So it would just like you walk in and they're like dim lights
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:30.200]   Tommy, thank you. Appreciate your joining the club. It's great to have you. Thank you very much. Thanks, Tommy
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.080]   Oh, we appreciate it
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.280]   Uh, I had some other requests, but uh, I invited them up
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.160]   But they didn't have anything they wanted to say so that's okay
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.640]   Oh, it's always fun though. If you want to do this we could do more and just keep i'll keep an eye out and if I see
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:49.640]   Stacy, I like I like this. I like, you know question mode the old course makes a career of it on radio
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:54.680]   Oh, it's really helpful because I you know we want to I know that people have questions about this
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.840]   Are you bullish overall on this Stacy? Is this good news for IOT?
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.000]   I am bullish. Um, I think it'll be good
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.920]   For a couple reasons
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.280]   I think it's going to be good for people who want to get into this and have been
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:13.400]   Hanging back because they're like, I don't know if I should well this work with this will that work with that kind of thing
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:19.960]   Yeah, and that that solves that dilemma for people going forward. I also think it's good because
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:27.960]   It makes it you have to add something special to provide value. So it's going to commodify a lot of stuff
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:35.640]   It will commodify like who cares about like generic hvac or generic locks unless you're doing something special
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:41.320]   Because you no longer have to you're no longer buying for like an ecosystem. You're buying for just like
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:48.040]   Is this the best door lock right and if it's better compliant, we go it. How secure. Oh, go ahead. Sorry
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.200]   Well, the final point is if you're an apartment or a renter
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:59.800]   This is great for you because apartment owners are going to be putting matter compliant like switches and stuff in their apartments and hvac
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.680]   And when you come in you'll be able if you want to control it using
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:11.240]   A controller you bring in and you could bring in your own devices and basically customize your apartment better. That's nice
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:17.960]   So how security wait wait wait wait wait, believe the department on the chief bastard landlords are really going to do that
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.280]   Is this going to be a silly?
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.920]   This isn't for slum lords. This is going to be for people who are trying to like get you know
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:31.080]   Higher end. Yes, these companies are already doing this because it has benefits to the two. Oh, yeah
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.760]   Yeah, builders are doing it too, which is very interesting when you're selling a new home
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.600]   To say this
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.920]   Supports, you know matter
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:43.000]   Probably matters and the landlords are going to be because if you think about it
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:50.040]   You can revert control back to them if like once the tenant leaves. Yeah, remember what a problem was once they see moved
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:54.040]   You know, what do you do with all this stuff you have in your house?
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:59.800]   Oh, no, no, no for the landlord themselves. So they can say like, okay, no one's in this apartment
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.280]   I'm turning the right ac down and you can monitor that and you also like with smart locks
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.920]   Many cities you still have to have a key right like New York made it a requirement
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.600]   but you don't have to read key things as often you can just
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:19.960]   That it's all software based now security, which is the next point because it is all software based
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.480]   Um
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.440]   And that's the biggest I think it's going to be the biggest problem with IOT
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:30.120]   Uh, we just learned for instance that there are security flaws and basically all Wi-Fi routers ever made
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.520]   Uh, Microsoft just my podcast for Microsoft just published
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:39.320]   Us published a report that found 25 vulnerabilities
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:46.200]   In I in a wide range of IOT devices. I mean, you know, all you have to do is look at the news and you can see that
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.360]   IOT is the next, you know kind of
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.240]   frontier in security
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.760]   Um, yeah, so
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:22:03.320]   For matter specifically what they're going to be doing is there's going to be encryption from device to device device to bridge device to cloud
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:09.240]   So it it's 128 AES encryption. So it's not like over the top, but it's it's decent
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:14.120]   Um, they're also implementing I think we talked about this before a blockchain based security thing
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:18.760]   Where it's it's not blockchain based. I'm sorry. Well, it is a blockchain, but it's not bitcoin
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.040]   Um
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.480]   It's a distributed ledger that says these are the devices in my home
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:29.320]   Oh interesting. Each device is going to have its own unique id that is sent to the ledger
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.840]   Intract there and then what happens is when you have
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:38.440]   Software updates that also gets sent to the ledger. So then you can programmatically look and see
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.680]   Hey, these 18 devices in my home are all up to date
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:49.560]   And if a new vulnerability comes out it becomes very easy to again programmatically look at that list and say oh shoot
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.640]   This one has this vulnerability
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.720]   It needs to be patched
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.880]   now that
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.320]   infrastructure is in place what needs to happen is companies like
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.320]   Uh, whoever's going to be like your hub the brains of your smart home
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.600]   So like a google and amazon, maybe it's your home assistant
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.240]   Those companies have to build that in
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.800]   But the infrastructure is all there for that to happen and i'm i'm really excited about that
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.080]   That's going to be really good
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.240]   And the reason I mentioned the the wi-fi uh, the frag attack wi-fi attacks
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:25.480]   Is because it could be used to get get into your network and then the iot devices
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:32.200]   Could be used to perpetuate it really could be a nightmare for people so security with iot is
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.240]   really important and um
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:42.120]   Not not really very well supported at this point and i think also really important you address it is the ability to update these
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.440]   So the frag attacks, uh, you know
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:49.720]   Many wi-fi manufacturers will have updated firmware many won't many won't be able to
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:57.080]   Anyway, many people won't know that their device needs to be updated so yeah all of that has to be handled with iot
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.560]   Uh, it's really critical good. Well, i'm glad to hear that this is uh
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:07.160]   This is one question from the irc. Yeah, and then i'll be done. Yeah, sorry
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:15.720]   Um because I get this a lot um people asking about the I call them the cda guys so the control for the instion the
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:21.160]   Subant all of those guys are they participating that sort of thing some of them are
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:28.680]   I think for them. It's a really interesting conundrum because what's going to happen is
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:33.160]   Their brains and programming they can totally take advantage of matter
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.640]   what it does for the distributors though, it's going to make it very difficult because
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:44.520]   It becomes harder to buy more of their proprietary gear, right? So if if you're a control for
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.480]   In your control for distributor
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:53.320]   You might be able to sell someone a control for brain and some cameras because those are not on better
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.800]   But you're not going to be able to sell them on kind of the lower value stuff
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.360]   So
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:05.320]   Then your expertise becomes less on selling the hardware and more on the programming and making that easy for people
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.000]   So that's just a shift to look for I want to take a short break
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.120]   But when we come back the stacey on iot show continues
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.520]   Yes, talk about other stuff. I do want to talk about other stuff, which is
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:20.840]   A big story, you know apple announced then shipped their air tags
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:30.040]   Which I think you know gives apple kind of a very strong position in this bluetooth tracker arena because they've got a billion
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:36.760]   iPhones out there and so whenever your air tag goes by one of those billion iPhones you you know at phones home and that's
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:41.160]   Gives you really a lot of people helping you look for your lost keys
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.000]   Uh, this was something that bothered tile a lot fact tile
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.080]   Testified in front of congress the ceo saying, you know apple zanyman
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.080]   You know it's monopolistic and it's going to put us out of business which may still be true
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:58.280]   But they've made a deal with amazon and I know you talked about this on your website as well and on the podcast
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.680]   They made a deal with amazon to in a way kind of maybe
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.160]   meet the
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.720]   iPhone network using amazon's sidewalk
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:15.080]   Uh, and so we've talked about sidewalk before this this might actually be very good for both amazon and for a tile
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.160]   So I want to talk about that a little bit
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.200]   I have opinions. I thought you might
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.920]   I thought you might
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:29.240]   But first I want to talk about my shirt actually i'm not wearing an untucket today. I forgot I wore it yesterday though
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.760]   I love
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.560]   My untucket shirts effect. We've just ordered a whole bunch more
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.360]   untucket shirts
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.000]   Are exactly what you need to make that transition
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.880]   Back from slopping around at home
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:48.680]   To the office you want to look good, but you know what you could disguise the top of the of the not real pants
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:54.120]   Yeah, yeah, maybe yeah, maybe you don't maybe you don't want to put a suit and tie back on
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.880]   Maybe you're going to take this opportunity to still t-shirts no war
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.560]   No, you can't do the t-shirt untucket shirts, right?
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.720]   Awesome, they're designed to not be tucked in they don't have those long tails in fact
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:12.120]   They're just the right it's a the the untucked shirt is a tough style to get right the untucket is just the right length
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.440]   It meets right I forgive me this but right halfway down the zipper
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:21.960]   Uh halfway down the fly and that's exactly kind of so you don't look like you've got this
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.960]   You know mumu on but you also don't look like you're wearing a t-shirt
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:31.480]   It's it's actually really great and I love the untucket shirts. They're really really well
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.080]   Made they also have like something like 50 different sizes
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.920]   Fits for all shapes and sizes because they have sizes up to triple xl
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.680]   But they also have different fits relaxed slim tall fits
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.120]   So you're going to find a shirt that fits well
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.880]   Looks well their wrinkle free products are in
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.920]   Incredible I have a bunch of the wrinkle free cotton
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.600]   And I've worn you know the shirt. I wore yesterday
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.640]   Or I guess I wore it on sunday. No, I wore yesterday
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.720]   I had worn several times before and still looked fresh as a daisy
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:10.280]   Amazing they have performance shirts. I wear those uh to the gym and it's been hot and I can go in california last few days
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:15.560]   They wick the sweat off you feel cool. You feel comfortable and you look good short sleeve button downs
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:20.920]   Polos made to beat the heat perfect for the summer time and now these new linens
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:25.640]   They've got teas as well. They've got handlies. They've got polos
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.440]   Uh, i'm a button down guy. I love
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:35.240]   The quality the fabric is great. It's heavy. It's they're well made the buttons are well sewn on
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:39.480]   They've got teas. I didn't know that. They've added teas. Look at that an untuck a tee
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.760]   Because you know what nothing looks dumber than tucking in a t-shirt. Can I just say please don't
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.560]   Doesn't make it doesn't make me look older. Yeah
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.080]   Oh, that's one of the reasons I love untuck it because my son always
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:55.400]   Comments on my wardrobe and is embarrassed. I used to go visit him at his frat
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:59.640]   He'd just say stay in the basement if you don't mind but with the untuck it shirts
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.960]   I get he says tange you look kind of hip you look kind of cool. Thank you very much
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.120]   Very high standards the highest standards in the industry every shirt
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.840]   Every aspect of the shirt is checked five times
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:16.360]   They want to make sure they retain the shape the color the strength and if there's anything wrong
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.040]   They have outstanding customer service too. They even have stores
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:25.160]   So if you want to go and try them on their stores are now open 85 stores nationwide
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.480]   I just may have ordered it because I was really happy they hit the wrinkle-free collection
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:34.680]   I really want you to check out and they have and this I don't even know this is some sort of
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.000]   textile magic
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   They have wrinkle-free linen
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.400]   Which is seems a contradiction in terms linen is famous
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:49.960]   For you look rumple then and and and wrinkle but no apparently they've found a way to do this
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.040]   Which is really exciting. I
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:58.120]   As soon as I found that out I would have at least that worded it before me. She chose them five wrinkle resistant
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:04.680]   I love linen in the summer. So this is really nice. Oh, I see they put a little tensile in there
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:09.240]   That's how they do it. That's how they do it and look at the plaids the checks the solids
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:15.800]   Really good looking. I can't wait to get my I'll wear them for you as soon as I get my uh my beautiful
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.360]   linen

[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.760]   This week in google
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.480]   So this was a story remember when we talked about
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:39.480]   Amazon we kind of mocked sidewalk because their initial first I did not what you did not mock it
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.040]   I did not okay. I mocked it just so you know
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:48.360]   But y'all keep going it was you were all excited because it was low rah the long range network low rah
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.320]   Even before then I was excited
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.840]   And we'll get to that
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.080]   So the idea it's not just because it's iot
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:00.520]   The idea was I mean again if you're competing with apples air tags
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.880]   You got to find a way to replace that billion phone network
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.600]   And so the idea is every echo device
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.520]   By default has sidewalk turned on a low
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:16.200]   Long range low powered slow network, but it can go half a mile
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:23.720]   And if so if you have enough people within that half mile to kind of propagate it you could in theory blanket an entire community
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:27.880]   They started selling a little sensor that you put in your rural route mailbox
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.960]   So, you know when the mail's in you know the the box has been open things like that
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.760]   They talked a little bit about lost dogs
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:40.760]   But tile doing a deal with them is I think very interesting. Do you what do you say Stacy?
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.880]   It's great. I'm going to tell you
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:50.360]   Project connected. Oh, no matter formerly known as project matter and amazon sidewalk
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:55.800]   Were the two most exciting things that are going to happen in iot of all of this year?
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.200]   Okay, so wow
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.200]   It's only been
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.720]   And it's only I said this at the beginning of the year. So I I do
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.680]   Okay
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.080]   The reason this is so exciting. I'm just like ah
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.160]   This news is great because it tells us two things
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:21.640]   One amazon is going to not just use laura for sidewalk. So you can use laura radios and it'll work with actually it won't
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.080]   um
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.080]   We'll get to that
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.760]   You can use and run sidewalk over bluetooth
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.480]   And you can use and run sidewalk over laura
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.560]   So that means if you have a laura device and you do the deal with amazon
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:42.360]   You will be able to have your device work on their sidewalk network and become part of their sidewalk network
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:46.120]   Same thing with bluetooth devices now. This is huge
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.600]   So tile is the just the first thing
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:53.800]   And then the second part of that announcement was that level a lot company is going to be part of
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:59.240]   This and I think they put level in there because they wanted to emphasize the security of sidewalk
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.880]   And this is really important for everybody because everyone's like
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.320]   Oh, i'm not going to let amazon use my echo for their sidewalk network
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:10.440]   But the sidewalk network and the reason why amazon is gone with a proprietary protocol
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.720]   Is it just that amazon's a giant jerk that likes proprietary protocols?
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.480]   It's that
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.760]   Sidewalk is designed to be secure. It's designed to
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:24.120]   So amazon doesn't know the packet that you're sending and the information in that packet
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.760]   It doesn't actually know the device that's transmitting it
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.680]   so
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.440]   All of that
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.200]   Let's us have this
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.200]   really big ad hoc
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.760]   Network that you don't have to pay a lot of money to use and it's really important
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:46.520]   You know with whether it's the iphone or the cell you're in a network or any other way you might propose to do this
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.240]   They're dumb
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.680]   They're intentionally dumb they they you know your phone knows everything about you
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:56.520]   And you have to trust that apple is not going to relay that information around
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:02.520]   Uh, you know because it's your air tag is tied to your apple account in theory if somebody saw my air tag
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:06.680]   They would know who I am and so it's really important that apple have its own security
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.680]   But sidewalks just too dumb to do that
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:13.240]   It's really designed to be kind of much more limited and that I think is a good thing in this case
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:19.160]   And the second part that's cool about this deal in this announcement
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.800]   Is that amazon showing that it's building a legit iot network
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:29.000]   And I say this because if you look and everyone's comparing it to apple air tags and that's great
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:33.160]   But air tags you look at the naming you look at how apple's done it so far
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:38.440]   Apple is thinking about finding stuff they're thinking about location tracking and asset tracking, right?
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:43.720]   Amazon is thinking let's build a data network. So yeah, you can send
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:51.160]   Location information on that network you can send sensor information about like mailboxes and just as a point of clarification Leo
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:57.880]   Currently the ring mailbox sensor doesn't use sidewalk. They have to enable that. Oh, they haven't that's hysterical
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:03.320]   I know it's ridiculous. Yeah, yeah, I thought that was the whole point of it
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:07.400]   It is the whole point, but it's not in able shit
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:13.480]   Well, and and this tile thing doesn't happen on june 14th either. So, uh, is there is there gonna be a change?
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:18.120]   No, it's june. I well, let me check the story, but I thought it was I thought they said june
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.560]   Okay, well you would know better
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.680]   According to cnbc. I don't know who they are
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.600]   But according to them tile will start working with amazon's network beginning june 14th
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.640]   june 14th, okay, hold on
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:38.040]   Oh, yeah june 14th. Okay. It's like let me go to the source. Yes. That's what amazon told me to
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.320]   an amazon product boss who is the
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.840]   Aptley or maybe in aptly named dave limp
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:52.600]   Told cnbc sidewalk is all about the next billion things interesting numbers. Yes that are going to get on the network
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.560]   Uh, I think we made a big deal about this and we showed people how to turn it off
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:05.720]   But you know nobody turned it off. Well, even if okay, even if people are audience who are you know, don't like this idea
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:11.320]   Turn it off. It's going to be on 99.9 of echo devices on by default, right?
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:17.080]   Well, it's on by default. It's not it's okay. So only a gen four echoes
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.240]   I can't remember how far down the echo shows
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:27.800]   It goes pretty it goes pretty far. Excuter x just point it pasted in often devices
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:34.840]   And that's okay. It's it's it's all the way down to the second generation echo show the echo spot
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.520]   the
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:43.240]   The dot starting with the third generation. Okay, so it's everything sold last couple of years
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:49.320]   Yeah, and they've been planning this so they announced it back again. They announced it in september 2019
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:54.600]   So and it so it's not thread. It's their own network. It's something. It's something they're doing
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:38:00.520]   Unis so again, and this is this is a trend god my entire show. I'm doing my whole show here. Yeah
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.600]   But this is a trend we're seeing because you look at matter
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:10.040]   That runs over different wireless protocols. It's an application layer. So at the software layer, right?
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.560]   Not at the radio layer
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:17.720]   And that's because in the same with sidewalk you can use different radios and what you're pulling on top of sidewalk is another
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:23.080]   application layer to to add security in this case has Amazon said how how
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:27.000]   You know like a coverage map if they said anything about how
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.800]   Widespread sidewalk is I mean I got to figure everybody in petaluma has
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:38.280]   You know that within a half. I mean it's half a mile, right? So all you takes is a couple of people every half mile
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:43.160]   I would guarantee that petaluma isn't completely covered with this. I don't know about Bainbridge island
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.160]   I think when you get to a rural area, maybe not
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:50.920]   Oh, dude, we're right outside Seattle. You don't have the people here work for Amazon. Yeah, we're fine
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.920]   Yeah, yeah
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:57.320]   So pretty much this is a universal network in at least yes, and it's so
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.000]   exciting
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.200]   And you won't have like this means if you're building some sort like let's say you want to build a garden sensor
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:09.320]   You know you could just build something to throw out in people's gardens on the sidewalk now
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:15.320]   I just assume it would work just work. Yeah, I mean this is what we've been waiting for
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:21.640]   This because I get a freaking ton of people asking me about helium and sidewalk and amazon and laura
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.280]   this is
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:31.080]   This is the trend that we're seeing but you understand hot cheap networks why people are not thrilled that it's amazon doing it
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:35.080]   I get it. I really do but amazon really tried to address this
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:40.200]   They've been very public with their white papers about the protocol you has steve gibson looked at the sidewalk protocol
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:45.480]   He has it, but i'll ask him to yeah. Yeah, he should i'm looking at the white paper right now the white paper is
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.120]   uh very interesting so it
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.520]   Um, it low-rise 900 megahertz
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:57.560]   Yeah, it's not good. It's 900 megahertz. That's good actually that means it goes a good long way. Yeah
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.480]   It depends I guess on how powerful the radios are
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.560]   But uh, but there's nothing they'll nothing that'll block it. Let's put it that way
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.240]   Right it goes through all kinds of stuff. Well your microwave might
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:14.680]   And uh, they're doing something apple does with uh with their mac addresses, which is smart
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:20.680]   They're doing a they do a 15 minute rolling id so that you can't track you can't say
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:26.840]   Oh, you know, let's watch as this person walks down the street because the id id transmission id's change
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.760]   Every 15 minutes. So this is good. I think that yeah, I mean they're obviously
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:34.920]   They're aware of the fact that people are going to be skeptical of anything amazon does
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:38.120]   They want to make you know how they sell a ws
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.680]   They want to sell
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:45.800]   An ios sidewalk is their a ws for iot activity. Yeah, very interesting. I mean that's that's what they're building
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.120]   Yeah, and I think it's way smarter than what apple's done
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.200]   apples
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.640]   Created a vertical
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:56.360]   Yeah, you have to have an iPhone. Yeah, but that's apple everything is is going to be within their ecosystem
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.680]   There's never going to be anything open from apple
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.680]   And there and what they will say
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:06.840]   Yeah, right. Well, what they'll say is but that's because we control it and so we can control security and privacy
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:11.320]   And that's our secret sauce duke and they'll also say do you trust amazon
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.040]   Um, we have a story they say about advertising
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:18.680]   I know and we have a story about that coming up in a little bit because I finally found somebody who
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:28.760]   Articulated what I have in articulately tried to say about this new apple id for advertising and app tracking
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.280]   A framework that they've put out, but we'll talk about that in a little bit
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:36.200]   So you think there are enough echoes and rings out there in the world
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.280]   To make this a
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:44.680]   Tiles now become part of this network. Oh, so they don't just receive they also extend the network
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:50.280]   Well, if you have tile the I would if you have tiles on the phone
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.000]   uh running on your phone that
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.680]   Oh the tile software on your phone. Yeah, ash should also get an update
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.200]   Oh, that makes sense
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:04.360]   Cause your phone may be a densification. Yeah, your phone may end up being a sidewalk device
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:09.480]   That's interesting if you use it to track your tiles and your existing tiles will work with it
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:15.080]   Well, sorry the more recent generations of tiles will work with this your ancient tiles will not
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:22.120]   So now I want to root for tile even though I I feel like apple's just about to put it out of business completely
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.960]   Well, I mean
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.640]   Does this rescue the end?
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:32.520]   Yeah, that's it's you know, it's interesting because apple a week before they announced air tags opened up the find by network
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:38.520]   And invited people like tile to participate and tile interestingly declined belkin chipolo
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.440]   uh
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:46.760]   Van move bicycles all joined the network. I met I imagine others do and I thought why would tile who's so worried about apples
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:51.400]   Ascendancy in this not at least take advantage of this now. We know why they had a better partner
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.040]   Amazon sidewalk
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.040]   So that explains a lot
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:01.000]   Thank you stacey. I'm glad I you know what I've been saving those stories for you
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.120]   Well, they just happened this week. I know so I'm gonna save them long. They're pretty fresh really
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:14.920]   All right, so now jeff let's talk some more panic because man. I just talked a lot. Let's talk about the colonial pipeline
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:21.080]   They by the way, they just posted a job for security manager
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:26.280]   Today, yep, you know, maybe we ought to have
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:34.040]   Somebody so jeff you're on the east coast, you know stacey and I are going to be impacted by this but colonial pipeline is
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:37.160]   It's a big is it a oil pipeline?
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:41.960]   It's refined products a hundred million gallons
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.880]   of
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:48.760]   gasoline diesel fuel heating oil jet fuel and other fuels go through the pipeline system
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.960]   Colonial transports 45 percent of all the fuel consumed on the east coast
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.160]   Uh, you know people don't realize this but in the east coast
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:01.160]   They still often use heating oil to heat homes
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:09.400]   And of course gasoline is important jeff fuels important all of this comes to the pipeline and colonial it was brought to its knees
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.600]   uh
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.280]   over the weekend by a ransomware attack and
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.280]   shut down
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:22.760]   And there's a considerable concern about how that's going to impact fuel costs and all sorts of things
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.160]   You know fortunately didn't happen in the winter
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:32.200]   The we talked on tuesday with steve gibson about the ransomware gang that did this
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:37.800]   Their dark side is a something we call now ransomware
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.920]   as a service
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:49.160]   They have i also like that their ethical ransomware is they have an ethics statement on their website
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:52.680]   jeez
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.680]   uh
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.320]   You know they have a website
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.880]   hospitals or
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:00.920]   Yeah
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.760]   But they feel bad about this hack y'all
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:09.000]   They feel bad about it does which doesn't mean they're not asking you know, they're not saying well here's the code i'm sorry
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.280]   Uh, in fact now colonial says they're not going to pay
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:19.480]   Uh, it's unknown how he also says they're they've restarted their operations. They've been able to restart. Okay. That's good. Yeah
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.600]   So can I make just a really quick point here? Yeah
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:32.920]   They didn't the hack did not target the pipeline operations it targeted the it operations and colonial shut down the pipeline because they were like
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.800]   Oh shoot. We don't know how deep this problem goes. We're
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.800]   We're trans
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:42.440]   Transmitting a natural or a gas that's highly explosive. We got to be better safe than sorry
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:48.280]   I just want to clarify that. Yeah, okay. Go here and then the problem here is a colonial has got a problem
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:54.120]   Uh, that's that's clear, but but the problem that affects people is media
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.080]   How says?
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.080]   Because they created panic buying
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.560]   Oh, I see what you're saying and there was no need
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:07.880]   You watch the picture with people have eight jugs of gas in the back lines of people and all that
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.360]   Um, so that now according to the washington post
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:16.760]   Uh 28 percent of north carolina's fuel stations. Otherwise known as gas stations in my day, but I guess that means i'm an old man
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:19.320]   Uh petrol stations
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:26.440]   Um, uh, are empty 17 percent of stations in georgia and virginia were dry wednesday according to gas buddy
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:31.080]   Um, that's caused by medium, but they did shut down the pipeline
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.680]   It's not that they didn't shut down the pipeline. It was so briefly so briefly and
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:41.560]   No, they shut it down for a couple days, but the government the uh, the federal government actually got involved in
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:47.880]   In told they they changed the laws to allow fuel trucks to travel over the highways
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:53.560]   At night and for more hours and they did that because they recognized there could be a problem
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:58.600]   And I would say jeff as a member of the media. That's a kind of story. You want to report
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.040]   You want to know that there's a way to do it. It's possibly happening
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:11.960]   Okay, so actually my child. I covered the uh 1970 oil embargo or 1974 oil embargo 73
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.720]   The gas crisis
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:18.920]   The gas crisis. I was the I was of an intern on chicago today the paper that had no tomorrow and I was the
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:22.680]   Uh, suddenly I became the energy correspondent
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:28.200]   That's a you know 20 graduations. You're young. You must know about gas
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.120]   Right. So, uh, I did all kinds of great features. I became friends with plats oil gram
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.760]   All kinds of stuff, right
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.600]   I was burning the problem then
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:42.840]   Right, we because you spread the news there was more reason to them. But one thing I learned is
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:45.400]   That the the length of time
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:49.160]   For if there's an interruption in the supply chain in in gasoline
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:53.080]   It takes a long time for that pig to get down the pipe before there's a problem
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:48:01.160]   It's a very long lead type of thing. So there was no actual shortage anywhere. There was no issue with setting the trucks is good idea
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:09.160]   That's fine. It's it's sure it's a little different than this from from because you were talking about the gas crisis was at the very beginning
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:13.880]   Of the of the pipeline even so with with crude oil
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:17.480]   Yeah, but this pipeline was bringing refined
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:22.440]   But it's bringing refined fuel to the northeast. I know but it still takes time
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.520]   It's the end of the line to get to the depot
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.600]   You get out
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:32.680]   There's there's there's plenty of supply and product in the gas stations unless you're crossco or they sell out all the time
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.920]   Um nevertheless, there's legitimate concern that ransomware gangs
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.720]   This that are attacking infrastructure
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:47.880]   And and the and the very legitimate concern that our infrastructure is fragile that's that the colonial pipeline is now looking for a security person
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:55.160]   Is some is evident either it's possible that they fired the old security manager and they now need a new one
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.680]   um
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:57.880]   But
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.480]   You know, it's just it's a little humorous
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:05.880]   The good news is if there is good news that and here's the ad this is from a Krebs on security
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.040]   For dark side
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:13.480]   Uh, they they were very clear. We're not political. We didn't attack it. We didn't even know it was infrastructure
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:15.880]   We just go where the money is
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:19.720]   Uh, this isn't Russia coming after our infrastructure. They may be Russian
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:24.120]   There's a lot of evidence that there are in fact Russian, but they are not the government of Russia
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:28.600]   Well, well, but what is it the government in Russia? Yeah, there's the other way. Look at it
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:33.480]   I think Biden's trying to soft pedal up to but but we shall see yeah
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.960]   Gas is the new toilet paper
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.680]   You know, it's it's it's it's so we you know, we're
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.520]   Nevertheless
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.040]   Okay, that's fine
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:46.920]   So there's one side of the story which is that that uh, the media can exacerbate the panic
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:49.320]   There was no reason to panic, but there's a problem here
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:54.760]   There is definitely a problem that your infrastructure our infrastructure is highly vulnerable
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.520]   But I think Stacy's point is really important that that it wasn't the the
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:02.600]   Work is the IT department. Yeah, that was it was the idea department
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:09.560]   So because that makes kind of more sense to me what I don't understand now is that if you're in security in any company anywhere
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:16.440]   What should you be doing to protect against a ransomware attack?
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:23.080]   I have answers. Oh good. Let's hear from Stacy Higginbotham
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:26.680]   God this show
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:31.320]   You're killing me here. Well, there is okay. So there is a new ransomware task force. Oh, you're loving that
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:38.280]   There is a federal ransomware task force. We've been talking about this on the security now
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:43.400]   There are it's got to be a multi-pronged defense. Yes
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.400]   You can't there's no one thing a company can do to fix this. Go ahead
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:53.880]   A lot of things companies are realizing all of a sudden especially as ransomware has been increasing in the last I would say
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:56.280]   three to five years is
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.560]   There are a lot of false positive or sorry
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.920]   There are a lot of hits on your systems
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:08.840]   Usually beforehand and if you go back to your log files, you'll see that people were trying to infiltrate
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:11.160]   But historically those have been ignored
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.280]   so
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:18.520]   First up is more robust detection and action and actually taking the action when you see something which
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.520]   That's easy
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:26.520]   The other challenge that's going to be way harder to solve is what companies are in the midst of doing is you know
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:30.200]   Digital transformation which is tying their it operations
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:37.240]   to their OT and OT is operational technology so that the equipment and gear that's running your pipeline
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:44.120]   and or your refining or any sort of manufacturing all of the the physical computing and
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:47.320]   I don't want to get into this too much there, but
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:55.480]   Those are coming together. So you have to think about ways to both segment that reasonably and also have the
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:59.480]   The infrastructure in place to detect when things go wrong
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:03.480]   And that's why you see Microsoft buying all of these OT security firms
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.680]   You see a lot of partnerships between like nozoomie and sisgo
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.240]   So you're seeing a lot of stuff happen on this
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:15.160]   And it's going to take kind of a mental shift for the IT guys and the OT guys
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:19.320]   To talk to each other and respect each other because like with colonial
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:23.560]   One of the things that maybe is under appreciated
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:27.800]   Is that they didn't actually know if their IT stuff would affect their OT stuff
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.280]   So they need to have that infrastructure in place
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:35.560]   Two is when you take something physical like that down it takes a long time to get it back up
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:42.040]   It's not like restarting a server like with ransomware you pay it, you know, you get your fresh you get your
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:47.320]   Data back you restart your good with something that's tied to physical infrastructure
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:51.960]   It can take days to restart like an oil plant. They have
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:55.400]   huge processes in place for this stuff and so
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:53:01.080]   It's a much more laborious process in much less forgiving of errors
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:04.120]   And it needs to be as I'd expect to deal with that
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:09.000]   Okay, so just in terms in terms of dumber dumber questions why specialty?
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.160]   um, okay
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.280]   How does back up and redundancy affects this?
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:19.720]   Can you put yourself in a position where they took down system a and find let them have it
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:24.680]   I got system b and I'm I'm going to interject you because this is actually a fairly high-end
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.840]   conversation and
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:33.080]   None of us are security gurus. So I will tell you what I've learned from security gurus. That's what I want you
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:38.840]   Yeah, but you're gonna talk about the Purdue model of security? No, but I but the the issue is yes
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:43.320]   It's might be time-consuming to get a pipeline back online
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.440]   And yes, you can always say oh if they only had good backups
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:53.400]   They wouldn't have to worry about this but it's a much more complex problem and it can take weeks to get back online because
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:54:00.840]   Not only is it getting the data back, but you have to make you have to make sure your whole you have to get all the systems back up and running and all of them are
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:04.280]   The integrity and sure the integrity of all the systems
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:10.680]   So for instance when north chydro was taken down it was almost a month before they were back online
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:15.880]   It wasn't merely an operations issue. It was an it issue as well. So it's not
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:20.520]   You know, it seems easy to say well all you need is a you know a good backup that's preserved
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:24.920]   And I know we have an advertiser for instance who says that but it is it really
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:29.160]   In defense of it people it is a very complicated thing to do
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:33.000]   And I will also say security is a very complicated thing to do we did it
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:38.760]   I would recommend it to anybody who wants to know more. We did a red team versus blue team
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.760]   special
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:43.960]   Uh in um, I think it was uh last october
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:45.880]   um
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:49.960]   And it's a great specials on our twit specials feed which we had really you know
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:55.720]   We had father robert and brian she as attackers and we have roosh nier who's legendary
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:00.760]   And uh the uh cto from uh log me in as defenders
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:04.360]   And we really talked about how difficult it is
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:09.000]   Uh and at one point snier who's absolute security guru
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.360]   Said it's almost impossible to defend
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:18.120]   You know security is a matter of layers. You have to try out do a lot of things
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.560]   I'm sure
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:26.280]   Infrastructure companies are sitting up now and taking notice as they ought to be and it's certainly the case that they haven't done a very good job
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:30.440]   In the past, but it isn't as simple as flipping a switch or spending more money
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:36.520]   It's a very complicated difficult thing to do especially with determined attackers and there's so much money in this
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:39.080]   it's estimated that uh that uh
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.320]   dark side
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:47.320]   Uh has made what was it something like 15 billion dollars or something like that? It's some huge amount of money
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.880]   uh these things are
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:55.560]   Incredibly lucrative and what does that mean? Well it means there is going to be a lot of people who
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:01.720]   uh want to uh do it and and the problem with things like dark side is
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:05.720]   It's ransomware as a service. You don't have to have any skills at all
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:09.320]   You just have to know how to get into it
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.840]   You know
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:18.520]   Um and uh and all you have to do is go to dark side and they actually advertise for affiliates saying when you want to run our ransomware
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.760]   You got somebody you want to attack?
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:24.040]   Uh, you know, here's here's the software you can do it
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:29.400]   So it's become easier and easier for even script kitties to do this kind of thing and so
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:35.080]   Yeah, you're right. Absolutely right stacey that you can't you can no longer ignore
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:40.680]   The attacks that are happening all the time but but but it's one thing to say, you know
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:44.520]   Hey, you're getting attacked. It's nothing to know how to defend against it and there's so many
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:48.440]   Venues for attack and stuff. It's very very very difficult
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:51.080]   Especially because these are targeted attacks
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:57.000]   We that's the other thing to understand is that we often talk about malware and attacks on iot and stuff
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.720]   But in almost every case those are mass attacks
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:04.600]   Uh, these are targeted attacks that they're going after colonial pipeline
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:10.200]   That's a lot harder to defend against you've got employees who might open emails that they think are from the boss
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:15.320]   There's it's really hard. It's extremely challenging. We had in here
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.520]   Uh last year before covid
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:24.120]   The guy who uh, he works for the nsa is secure. I guess it was a pentagon securing
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:30.280]   Uh military networks. He works out of west point. I said that must be a challenging job. He said you have no idea
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:32.920]   I can't say so
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:38.040]   And I can't tell you one of the one of the things the ot folks do actually really well
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.880]   Is they
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:43.800]   Teach their employees better about security and like their phone
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:48.520]   Remember that water company where the the guy was sitting there and somebody logged in and
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:53.800]   I'm not talking about the water company. I'm talking about like the refineries
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:58:00.840]   But they have they they literally like have campaigns where they will tell people not to pick up usb sticks and plug it into it
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:04.360]   They have to like well, they have to but we don't actually have that
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.480]   Like think about like when you're a new employee
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:14.840]   You don't get like details on fishing scams and things to look at necessarily you start to and a lot of companies are doing that
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:21.080]   Now you do and you offer training and this stuff. Yeah. Yeah, everybody understands the employees is a
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:24.200]   Vulnerable where the week is link or the weakest link
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:30.040]   It's you know, it sounds like it's an easy thing to fix. I think it's a hard thing to fix
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:35.240]   Oh, it's so hard and protecting infrastructure is really hard and uh, but but what's in a way
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.520]   This is good
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.400]   Because all the attention that that this is generating
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:48.200]   I would hope is making people who are on power plants and pipelines and water facilities think a little harder about what they're doing to protect themselves
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:55.160]   Uh, and that's why that you know, this is an industry tax force, but uh, that's why this industry task force. I think is pretty important
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.480]   Uh as well
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:05.240]   Because uh, they're also saying they're trying to get for instance the federal government to treat this as a very serious
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:11.480]   Of you know national security issue and things like that and all of that will help
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:19.720]   They're trying to disrupt ransomware payments. Um, you know, there there's a lot in other words. This is a multi
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:21.960]   faceted
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:25.720]   Defense that has to be implemented. We have to take it very very seriously
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:32.040]   I'm clearly it you know, we're vulnerable right now, but we've known that
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:37.640]   There've been there've been books and articles for the last six years talking about how yeah, but it doesn't
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:43.080]   It doesn't matter to people until it hurts them where they live. Right. I mean
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.880]   That's why in a way. This is a good thing
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:51.480]   And it's also so we just blame the media, but I will also say it's a terrible story for the media to cover
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:56.040]   Um, and again, you know, there's there's no dead babies. There's
[00:59:56.040 --> 01:00:00.920]   Until there's the dead babies. It's hard to do right. So now that's why we're getting so
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:05.560]   Much coverage because we have so many people who are right like it's
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.520]   Understand intelligible to normal people
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:15.000]   The the ransomware task force report which we we covered it also on security now
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.560]   I think last week of the week before
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.240]   Uh says
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:25.960]   Some of the recommendations are things like encouraging voluntary information sharing on ransomware attacks right now companies generally cover it up
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.440]   They they don't want to say, you know, it's embarrassing
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.120]   Uh public awareness campaigns on ransomware threats
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:36.680]   Exerting pressures on countries that operate as safe havens for ransomware operators
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:42.760]   Uh incentivizing the adoption of security best practices through tax breaks. There's a lot of things
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.680]   Uh
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:47.480]   Limit legal liability for isps
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:53.000]   This is a really interesting one that act in good faith trying to help clients secure their systems
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.480]   So isps can block traffic on on various ports
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.160]   Um, there's lots of things they can do uh to to
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:10.520]   You know mitigate a little bit create a federal cyber response and recovery fund to help state and local governments or critical infrastructure companies respond to ransomware attacks
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:15.720]   You know, one of the things that's happened. We saw last summer. We saw a huge number of attacks
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:23.560]   On uh city governments remember that in texas a couple of threes city governments brought down because they have insurance
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:30.680]   They they have they have ransomware insurance and in in many cases a number of cases
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:34.760]   The ransom was paid by the insurance companies
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:43.160]   Which just encourages more ransomware attacks and frankly encourages a little bit of laxness on the victims. Well, we got insurance for that
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.040]   Um
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:50.520]   Anyway, there's there's some really good recommendations in this task force. I hope that it's more than just
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.480]   lip service that they they uh
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.480]   They do some things about it
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.480]   Part of this is um
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:01.400]   You know part of this do some things do some things. Well part. There's a lot of things to do
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.480]   Do some of those
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:08.520]   Part of it is that cryptocurrency makes you know all of this goes through cryptocurrency in the early days of ransomware
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:13.640]   They asked you to go down to 711 and buy and do buy some money orders
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:17.960]   They've gotten a lot better now. Thanks to uh, cryptocurrency. So
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.080]   Progress progress
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:26.200]   Well, but that but that makes it easier for people to do this right and and else yeah, yeah
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:31.000]   So uh, you know, cryptocurrency exchanges could be required
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.520]   Uh to you know be a little bit more careful about who they do business with and so forth
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:43.000]   Anyway, yeah, i'm glad to know that the pipeline is back online
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.600]   It's going to be okay
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:51.480]   It will be fine. It's going to be the next crisis. You know, all you know, all you know, where
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.880]   Yeah, really um
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:57.240]   Uh, i'm having a senior moment. What's the where where was the um
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:04.040]   The the nuclear meltdown in russia, chadamoble charnoble chadamob. Yeah, there's some action there
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:07.240]   They'll be you know, it's just they don't know 2020 is over
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:12.840]   Uh, there have been some reactions in part of the bad part of charnoble. Don't know if they can get at it
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.720]   Don't know how bad it's going to be. You know, yes, not the next crisis
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.360]   Really? Oh, you know, we've got lu. We've got nuclear waste leaking in uh
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:25.640]   The middle of washington state so you know, that's cool here from science alert
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:31.400]   Chernoble's molten guts are warming up and scientists thought no way
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:38.120]   That's that's that's putting it in that headline in language that people can understand
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.400]   And get scared about it's scared about
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.440]   it could be they say
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.400]   Whoever wrote this mike mccray
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.040]   Two thumbs up
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:55.320]   researchers at the institute for safety problems of nuclear power plants in kev ukraine
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:59.080]   Are yet to determine whether the noted rise in neutrons
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:06.360]   noted rise in neutrons heralds pending disaster or is more of a storm in a nuclear teacup
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:11.320]   One of your students jeff
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.880]   I can be
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.480]   It's merely a storm in a nuclear teacup
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:22.840]   Uh, let's uh, let's see what more can we talk about oh lots more?
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:27.000]   So you got apples. I got apples. I got googles. Let me do one more google
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.960]   Uh story remember with all the we got fonts
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.600]   remember with all the um
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.960]   Fosse about google ai and the firings of the f from the ethics team
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.200]   Google has plans to
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:44.520]   Fosse is probably a light word. I would say scandal scandal. I don't say scandal fits. Yeah
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.520]   Uh, the ceo
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:50.760]   Uh is going to boost the operating budget of the etha ai ethics research staff
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:54.840]   And they're going to hire more people. But meanwhile
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:05:01.160]   Uh, one of the folks working on ai at google one of the big guys has moved over to apple
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.080]   Um
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.080]   Because of he had actually quit
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.000]   At google he was an ai scientist to distinguish
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.440]   distinguished
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.680]   Google scientists sammy benjio
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.320]   He quit after the ai
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:21.000]   Scandal and he will now go to apple and lead a new ai research
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.520]   Under another former googler john gendrea
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:29.960]   Uh, he was at google eight years when he joined apple in 2018
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:35.160]   So there is a consequence to uh more than just bad press
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:40.440]   To uh, not handling these things. Well, you're going to lose some of your best people
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:44.920]   He was benjio was one of the early leaders of the google brain research team
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:48.280]   Uh and an expert in deep learning
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:55.000]   Probably that generative adversarial network you're so fond of stacy
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.800]   Uh
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:02.280]   Love your gans. I know you do. I do love my gans. You love your gans
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:06.440]   Uh, let's see what else is going on
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:13.000]   100 million dollar fine a fund not fine fund
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.760]   It's good. It's good to be a creator
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:22.840]   It's good to be a creator. So you know, there's tick tock right so google saying what we're gonna do
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.320]   We're gonna beat tick tock so they create something called shorts
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:30.120]   Which uh are not in fact attractive pants that show your knees but
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:34.120]   Little short videos on google and google is going to
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.240]   Create a 100 million dollar fund
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.440]   for shorts makers
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:45.880]   Shorts are doing all right 6.5 billion daily views according to sundar patchi
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:49.080]   They the shorts fund they call it
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:55.640]   Is the first step in our journey thought that was funny until you put the other image in my head
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.480]   No, no, yeah, yeah
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:01.640]   Well, they could have called them squirts, but no the shorts fund is just
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:09.800]   Courts is just the one it's just the first step in our journey to build a long-term monetization model for shorts on youtube
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:12.120]   They're not going to tell you
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.920]   How to how to win it they're just going to award it
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:20.040]   Uh, if you create shorts that delight the youtube community
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:28.040]   Uh, you may you a company spokesperson decide declined to share details about how much creators can earn or the metrics
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:32.920]   Who will determine who gets paid and said what's the fine delight? Yeah, to find the light
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:40.760]   They'll do you don't even have to be in the partner program. They're just going to drop money from heaven. So make those shorts kids
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:44.440]   Horse courts one three two leo
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.840]   132
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.240]   Let's jump down in charge to the very
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:56.840]   Let me do my rule that all social platforms do what all social platforms do yes now all of them are
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.640]   creator economy platforms
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:03.800]   That well look how look how uh, well, that's done for youtube, right?
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.160]   Yeah, instagram doing great tick-tock
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:10.680]   Only i have a story on youtube. Yes
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:13.880]   Jeff you're gonna love this one
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:18.840]   Um, this was okay leo it's oh, it's line 69. I'm not gonna grin
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:23.240]   Are you a creator by the way you're a creator i'm a creator. We're all creators
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.320]   So it's a good
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:28.840]   Children are creators finally media recognize that they thought they were the only creators
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:33.080]   We're all creators. You know who else is a creator bait hovin
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:42.840]   That's a lead into your story stacey go ahead. I was like what is happening here
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:46.520]   so this story is this is both a
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:53.960]   People suck and a content moderation is hard story and also that youtube needs better practices story
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:58.840]   So this is from kori doctor. Oh, he let me get the name of the lady right?
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.880]   Sorry, let me let me open this up the marina
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.880]   Marina
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:10.920]   A piano teacher who publishes free lessons. I love kori and I love his blog pluralistic.net
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:17.400]   He uh, she creates a free piano lessons on her piano keys youtube channel
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:20.920]   Celebrated her fifth anniversary kori writes by announcing
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:26.680]   She was quitting youtube because her meager wages were being stolen by
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.640]   fraudsters
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:34.840]   She posted a video with a little bit of moonlight sonata, which you might remember
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.720]   bait hovin published
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.720]   No, actually
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:46.120]   bait hovin did not publish this in 1801 bait hovin wrote it in I don't know what 1762
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:50.680]   But it was published in 1801. It's in public domain in other words
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:54.120]   The copyright belongs to marina. She performed it
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.840]   Nevertheless, you play
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:02.280]   Or something you're gonna get that's for at least that's for at least not the moonlights
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.640]   I can't hum the moonlights sonata. I'm sorry, but it triggered
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:12.840]   And I might have just triggered it too youtube's automated right now, but then we're gonna get taken down moonlight sonata is very slow
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.040]   It's good
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.480]   It triggered youtube's automated copyright filter
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.880]   I'm amazed you recognize fearlies though and you name that tune four notes
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.240]   In the 90s, I had a phone that played it
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.880]   Yeah
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.760]   a corporate entity identified only by
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:35.800]   an alphabet soup of initialisms and cryptic llc names had claimed
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.840]   moonlight sonata as their own
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:42.040]   Calling it wickah moonlight
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:50.680]   The content ID flag marina's track is an unauthorized performance of wickah moonlight. She appealed the judgment
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.960]   The problem is you appeal we've had this happen to us
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.760]   then then they send a message to the
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.320]   copyright owners saying
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:05.720]   Uh, do you agree that no infringement took place? But of course they said no they they infringed it
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:13.400]   So you show she can now let this shadowy company monetize her video, which steals all of the revenue from her
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.760]   She can take her video down. We are faced with this by the way frequently
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:20.920]   Uh, no idea. This was happening. This is so inferior
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:24.840]   All the time. Oh, this is exactly the problem. This is exactly
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.600]   Well, I thought the problem was just that it took your stuff down and you couldn't make money
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:32.600]   I didn't realize there was a like a group of organizations who yes
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.760]   like
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:38.280]   Again, a lot of frankness and we've done this you can fight it
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:42.120]   You have to provide them with your full name and address and then they
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:44.920]   then they go and they uh, and they
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:50.840]   You go back and forth the ultimate legal end in court, but even prior to that and then the people
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:57.240]   We've had people I don't even want to go into it. We've had people make I mean the funniest things ever
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:02.760]   In their claims against us. We had uh, we had pictures of the nasa video
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:07.720]   You know, we had the nasa launch taken down by national geographic who claimed oh, no
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:12.440]   We owned the nasa video in the course that was an error they said but
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.560]   Anyway, this is content id
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.520]   Corey hates content id I hate content id
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.440]   Um
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:24.760]   And you know, it just doesn't work very well. Here is and I love this Corey published
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:30.440]   This from the eff navigating youtube's content id a little flowchart
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:37.080]   To help you help you understand why hollywood. Yeah, molly would folks
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:44.440]   Yeah blame hollywood, but also blame I blame the tech companies who thought we could solve this algorithmically exactly I agree
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:49.960]   Yeah, and it's the algorithm is the problem. Uh, it's easily game scale. Yeah
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:56.680]   Bad guys. Yeah, and I guess if you create something like youtube where you get, you know, 100 million hours of content every day
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:59.720]   How are you how else you're gonna do it? I understand
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:07.480]   Well, and you gotta be if you're going to be a platform one of the costs of being a platform is recognizing that people are going to game it
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:12.440]   And you have to respond in a way that benefits the core users google does it already for search
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:17.960]   They're like oh shoot too many people are using weird seo optimizations now. We're gonna change things
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.120]   But what they're not doing is they'll do it for their core businesses
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:26.920]   But then they put out these creator platforms and they're not doing it for those businesses and that's just
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:32.040]   It's a big chilling effect on everything we do, you know, I I try to tell
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.680]   Our staff don't worry about it. Don't worry about it
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:40.360]   But it really does create a chilling effect and we we have to constantly say oh we better not do that because they'll take us down
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:45.160]   Uh, Corey also points out that it's a really an uneven process for instance
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:46.760]   Uh
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:52.040]   An instagram takedown takes a few seconds to file but 28 months to appeal
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:57.080]   Uh, and we've had that where they'll take down a video and maybe we can get it back in two weeks
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:00.440]   But by then nobody's gonna watch the two-week old news show
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:04.120]   So it's really it's really a problem. There's a
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:07.080]   Warner Chappelle
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.240]   You know Warner music
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:13.400]   M- demonetizes videos that include the numbers 36 and 50
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:18.680]   Why they should have they should have
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:27.000]   Bad effects for doing bad things and they should be penalized for overzealous. Here's a twitch streamer and munition
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   good name
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:29.960]   Uh
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:34.040]   Her videos were demonetized over the use of the numbers 36 and 50
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:37.640]   To protect copyright holders the copy of that
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.760]   Did you get copyright you can copy write the number apparently
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:43.720]   the uh media company full screen
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:48.920]   Was simply the claim was simply over the number 36
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:52.680]   You know and you can appeal and maybe she's probably back
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:57.560]   Full screen is full screen is a social content company for talent and brands
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:01.320]   They're owned by otter media a subsidiary of Warner media
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:05.400]   Um, they claim the number 36
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:13.720]   I don't know I don't understand how you can copyright a number. Well, they also copyrighted 50
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:20.920]   And while the claims are active before the appeal is accepted they take all monetization
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:25.400]   So, uh, and you can also lose your account
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:29.000]   I mean at the long shot is you can get a strike and lose your account completely
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.320]   They should when they when they're knocked down they should have to give back 10 times monetization
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.960]   They should be some sort of yeah like treble damages for
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:43.160]   Yeah, they call it slap in law in the lawsuit world. Yes. Uh, there should be some sort of uh slap
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:48.440]   These are also the customers of the of the big companies and and they are the ones who have the lobbyists that the lawyers
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:51.640]   And so they would you know, you know what they they'd go run into capital hill
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:54.760]   And we'd have a soap of people fight again
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:56.760]   It's
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:01.800]   Pecuse what always pretty soap of people we don't want to go with soap of people
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.840]   We don't want to we don't want to soap a peepa again there. Uh, huh
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:11.480]   That's a good way, you know, we fight them, but uh, you know our the risk to us is that
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:16.840]   We would get a strike and too many strikes. We would lose our channels and that would be a big deal
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:24.120]   I hate I freaking hate you too. I I understand the value of it. It's very impressive that anybody can create video
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:30.600]   But it is also it's kind of a mess and uh, and I don't like it affecting what we do as our content
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:35.080]   You know, I mean I I can't even humphur at least without fearing that they're going to take it down
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.560]   Now I gotta worry about 36 and
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:45.320]   Jeff no numbers with 36 or 50. I'm just telling you okay. All right. Okay. Yeah, don't want to take that chance
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:48.920]   No, no line numbers 36 or 50
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:53.720]   This this this is an article. I thought uh crystallized my
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:17:00.040]   Inarticulate problem with what apple is doing everybody loves it 96
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:04.920]   Of people with ios 14.5 have said don't track me bro
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:12.040]   When they're offered that pop-up that says do you want to allow this app to track you the 96 percent say absolutely not of course
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:17.480]   But this article and I think it was really well written from eric benjamin suffert
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:23.560]   Uh apple robbed the mobs bank, you know, you don't ever want to rob the mobs bank
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:27.000]   Right because the mob will pay you back, you know the bank maybe not but the mob
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.960]   So what he's pointing out? I think this is really an excellent point
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:37.080]   Is that what google has done by saying no third party cookies anymore?
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:42.200]   What apple's doing by saying no tracking is merely giving first parties
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:49.560]   The people who can collect information directly and sell it like google and facebook and oh incidentally apple as well
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.560]   Priority over everybody else
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:58.840]   So uh, he wrote a blog post he called the privacy mirage
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.560]   Uh
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:02.760]   apple
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:04.760]   Is using a strategy?
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:11.560]   By artificially defining the word privacy as the distinction between first and third party data usage
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:17.880]   But by doing so they entrenched their market position google owns search right google owns chrome
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:22.120]   Apple owns the app store. They all have first part facebook owns
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:29.080]   Everything they you know, they all have first party data, which they can use to sell ads against
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:32.360]   first party data
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.360]   is so valuable
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.960]   That
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:41.720]   By saying you know, you can't use third party data. They're just making their beta more valuable
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:44.440]   They're not protecting your privacy in any way
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.080]   right
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:50.840]   And and look at the the ben evans thread right below
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:57.080]   Where apple's playing all kinds of games is we're not tracking you but let us now spend three pages telling you how we're tracking you
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.080]   We just don't call it tracking right?
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:03.000]   And it really comes down to that distinction between third party and first party
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.800]   Uh apple does of course, but it's still tracking track you now
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:12.840]   None of which by the way is surveillance which is an overused term that drives me up the wall almost as much as
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:17.320]   I nearly start going by saying the mp word when that happens
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:24.440]   And and partly I think there's some confusion like oh facebook is giving information about you
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:27.960]   to other people or google is doing that in fact
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:33.480]   They if they do they do it by accident. They they desperately want to control that. That's the secret sauce
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:35.720]   That's what they that's the the data
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:40.440]   They the knowledge they have a view is what is so valuable to them. They don't want to give that to anybody
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:44.920]   They merely want to charge an advertiser to buy an ad to to target you
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:51.160]   But they don't tell the well they do end up where you are. Well, they leak it. Unfortunately as we learned they can't unfortunately get
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.320]   But that's not that's not intentional. That's the last thing they really want to do
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:59.160]   They don't want anybody else to know this stuff because that's that's what they're selling
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:02.120]   Uh, yeah ben makes it really is a good tweet
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:05.400]   Storm thread thread
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.920]   Uh
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.600]   What's the difference between a thread and a storm?
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:18.120]   Well a thread I think anything under five tweets is a thread
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:21.400]   Anything above 10 tweets is a storm
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:26.760]   I thought it had to do with the emotions you had today. Yeah, it's attitude too. I think you're right
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:30.680]   Like I have really long threads. How many how many pretty
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:34.440]   How much so what do you do you write and then you get to 280 characters?
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:37.800]   So you say next tweet and the next tweet and next tweet and next tweet
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:41.880]   Well, I don't know when you were last on twitter, but now you can just add
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:47.240]   To them so you don't have to like oh they make it easy for you to do that. They thread them
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.640]   Were you up to a stopy
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:54.840]   So dopey write a blog post just like podcasts aren't dopey. Come on
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:58.680]   Well, at least it's all in one place. You don't have to oh dopey
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:02.840]   You don't have to see I don't talk for a half a paragraph and then say see next tweet
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:07.000]   No, you don't say see next tweet. It just goes to it
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.280]   It's a fault
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:13.320]   Yeah, and
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.800]   You should never write a blog post that's less than 300 words because google doesn't like
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:22.680]   Rank it right so if you know that you're going to go fewer than 300 words on something
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:28.840]   Then or you don't feel like two tweets and that's hence my distinction between a thread and a storm
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:31.320]   300 words could be like
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:34.200]   Depends on your words, man. It could be 10 tweets
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:37.320]   Well, why would you break it up artificially or you do so?
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:45.000]   You're just writing sentences. So yeah, so who breaks it up? You know what that? Who decides it's another tweet now?
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:51.160]   The writer does I the writer does I just said the thing you just read from gory.com. Cori doctor room
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.960]   That started out as a tweet. That's why those little
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:22:00.920]   Paragraphs those are those are tweets right there. That's a thread a blight on the
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:03.640]   our modern discourse
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.480]   Oh
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:06.680]   It is
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:11.960]   Twitter is not designed to write long blog posts. It's designed for short things bits
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:16.280]   Well, but no, but the advantage is then unlike unlike like essays
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:22.120]   There are times not calls them. You can leak I can have a progression of thought and someone can go to the fifth one
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:26.680]   I say I want to argue with that point of yours and they can respond wherever they want to it. It's more conversation
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:30.360]   And then you can write the blog post based on the
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:37.320]   The head like you have you're you're basically it's like conversing about something with people
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:42.680]   And then you're like all right now. I'm ready to to actually put this into formal thought and write it out
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:45.560]   It's actually respectful of the process of writing
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:50.440]   I think and actually thinking as opposed to like blithering on on a blog post and then being like bloop
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:55.720]   I blither on twitter. I write on my blog. You know who really gets this right? Yes, Donald trump
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:01.960]   The Donald trump doddle trump he doesn't write trump.com. Look at this every blog post
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.800]   tweet length
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:06.680]   It's well that one's two tweets nice and short
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.560]   Sweet to the point you you were gonna see
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:16.040]   Stop it. He's tweeting in a blog. You're blogging in a tweet
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:19.080]   Never the twain shall meet
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.800]   This is all I'm saying. I'm still tweeting
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.200]   my blogs are
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:27.560]   Supposed to be more thought you know what I love twitter more
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.800]   every day
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:34.200]   I think twitter every day you love twitter more. I love a twitter more. I
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:38.280]   I have my covid list. I have my book history walks list
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:45.240]   I just I went I went I did two-hour talk today followed a two-hour talk today about book history and the history of the
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:50.200]   Manufacturing of ink. I mean I couldn't have found that without twitter. I was in heaven
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:55.320]   I didn't glen flyshman. I follow one Twitter. See you in the comments. I follow I follow glen as well. Yeah
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.360]   Glenn's great, right? He lives in Seattle and friends
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:04.280]   In Seattle exactly. I I glen watch the show. Will you hi? Um, does he watch the I don't know
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:13.000]   Yeah, I find friends. I find all kinds of interesting things. I find books that I get. I love twitter. I love you know what I love on twitter
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.080]   the chinese army
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.960]   of g fake tweeters
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:23.560]   that amplify yes, let's shut it down amplify
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:26.200]   tweets from
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.600]   Chinese communist party leaders. This is the last time you saw a chinese tweet
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.240]   Well, I don't know if they're in chinese
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:39.400]   That's actually a question. Are they in chinese or are they in english? No, no, no. I don't see them. I don't care
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.280]   in english
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:41.880]   I see I see them occasionally
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:45.160]   I see them mostly as retweets though from my journalist friends who are writing
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:50.440]   Are they really from your journalist friends or are they perhaps from that army of chinese bots
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:58.360]   Millions of them in fact a seven month investigation by the associated press and the oxford internet institute
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:01.080]   from oxford university
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:05.320]   Find that chinese rise on twitter has been powered by an army of fake accounts
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:11.480]   That have retweeted chinese diplomats and state media tens of thousands of times convert covertly
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.160]   amplifying propaganda that can reach hundreds of millions of people
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:18.440]   How about that?
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:24.760]   Sorry y'all we knew this we knew it but that doesn't that isn't that bad for twitter?
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:30.280]   We had the russian bots is in fox news bad for news
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:35.080]   I figure of my 555,000 twitter followers at least half of them are bots
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.960]   Wow
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:41.000]   Yeah, probably but it's probably lots are following you
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:44.360]   It's it's it's who i don't like bots following me
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:47.000]   I don't know about you
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.400]   No, you're right. It's who you follow isn't it?
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:53.160]   It's who you follow that makes twitter so very valuable
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:58.680]   I love my followers. Well, I don't know if I love all my followers
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:06.520]   most of my followers are engaging fabulous people who have good i feel the same way about our discord and I think that actually
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:09.400]   In all seriousness because i'm just being silly
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:14.520]   But in all seriousness, I think discord is the next big thing in social
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:17.320]   networks because
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:19.560]   It's what facebook wanted to be which is a group
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:26.360]   It's fairly tightly knit group of people whether it's family or friends or whatever talking about stuff you're interested in without
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:33.160]   You know chinese bots or or advertisements for political campaigns or any of the complications of red
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:39.160]   Still come. I mean they'll come when the when it gets big
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:46.760]   In the discord ad break phoenix warp says I am I am propping up my twitter is the anti-christ thesis
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:53.960]   They're not the anti-christ. That's a lot. You want an ad break. You got an ad break. Go ahead stacy have some waffles
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:56.120]   I know where you're up to I know what you're up to
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:59.000]   Don't think I don't know
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.240]   Getting cookies
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:05.960]   Not sharing them with the rest of the podcast you want to go get some katyoi pay pay go ahead
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:10.920]   Short on my water, but go get some water you got a minute here because I want to tell everybody
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:13.560]   Who's listening to this fine show?
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:21.000]   About udacity way that the irc people don't like me saying nice things about discord
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.440]   They said discord is just a colored up irc
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:33.560]   Then the other guy started started up. That's the way they say they have colors
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.720]   Wait till you see the animated gifts. Huh?
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:45.000]   Our show today brought to you by udacity. I I think udacity is such a great thing started by a google engineer
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.560]   Sebastian thrun he saw a real opportunity because you know he's working at google
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:54.200]   He's seeing that there's a real need for people with a certain skill set
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:58.280]   But these these people coming to google aren't learning those skills in school
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:02.920]   He knows that big companies like microsoft and amazon google ibm
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.640]   need
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:09.880]   Employees with the right kinds of training, but they're just not getting it
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:14.120]   He started udacity and very early on their nanodegree program
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:17.880]   We talked about it on this show in fact I joined udacity back in 2012 when that happened
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:25.320]   The idea is udacity is the world's best way the most efficient the fastest way to master the skills
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:28.040]   Top employers are looking for
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:32.760]   It's all online. You can do it part time. You could do it on your own schedule
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:38.520]   It's designed to bridge the gap between what you might have learned in school and what your career goals are
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:41.080]   For as little as five to ten hours a week
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:47.560]   For as long as just a few months you can learn a suite of employable skills get that nanodegree
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:52.600]   Which tells your employers this this person knows his his or her stuff
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:59.640]   And yeah, and partly this is because udacity partners with the biggest and the best in the industry microsoft and google and ibm
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:05.240]   And a ws you're gonna learn the skills that are in demand today's tough job market
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:11.560]   Of course, you know, there's the videos it starts with that on demand videos. Look at this block chain developer
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:14.760]   When you like that's in the school of programming and development when you like to learn that
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:21.720]   So you watch the videos, but I think one of the best parts about this and I know it's one of the things companies really appreciate
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:26.040]   There's their c++ class in the school of autonomous systems. How about that?
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:31.240]   Is that you're gonna not only watch the videos, but you're gonna have to complete a series of projects
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:33.800]   Now you're gonna get a lot of support
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:37.800]   Projects are reviewed by qualified professionals. You're gonna have real human help
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:43.400]   Personalized code reviews access to mentors 24/7 so you're not on your own
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:49.240]   But you've got to you've got to get hands-on. You've got to demonstrate the ability to do this and that's really important
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:54.200]   Uh, there's also great free courses support courses designed to help you
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:30:01.480]   Get a job. You can you can build a portfolio on github or linked in to show perspective employers
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:05.080]   You can learn to network you can get noticed you can land the job you want
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.640]   So what are the most sought after?
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:13.720]   Udacity nanodegrees for consumers and business clients alike. Well, some of the top 10 include data engineering
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:18.440]   Data analyst we're seeing some right here programming for data science with python
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:22.280]   What a great class product manager c++
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:27.320]   Digital marketing here's one for you stacey deep learning in artificial intelligence
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:31.880]   Learn about deep learning neural networks use jupiter notebooks
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:34.760]   Gans baby Gans
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:40.120]   Gans you want to learn about that? Oh, the great way to do that. We should throw the audacity
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:47.160]   Course catalog at a GAN and see what it comes up. I bet I bet I bet somebody's done that maybe as a project who knows
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:52.760]   14 million people have taken courses at udacity in over 240 countries
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:58.840]   I think that's something to be really proud of because there's a lot of places you can't get these skills, but you can online
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:00.520]   It's so exciting
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:07.240]   Through industry leading programs designed and recognized by top companies worldwide and ai cloud computing data science
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:09.800]   autonomous systems programming
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:13.240]   I think it's just great flexible payment options
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:19.560]   You can put learn at your own pace on your own schedule because of course a lot of udacity students have day jobs
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:24.600]   Maybe jobs that don't completely fulfill them. They want to get the skills to get an even better job like francesco
[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:27.160]   Gaterres he couldn't afford a four-year degree
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:31.320]   But he participated in the grow with google udacity challenge

[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:54.200]   Exactly what i'm talking about start at the beginning intro to programming. That's a great course
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:32:01.320]   I've taken their python courses. I think they have great stuff technology is disrupting enterprises across every industry

[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:59.560]   So not unless she was cooking
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:03.240]   Hot spang you need a thermo mix
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:09.560]   Did I know I muted? No, no. Oh, I heard somebody banging. Maybe it was maybe it was me
[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:14.680]   I don't know. Um, I did not get waffles. They take too long. Oh
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:22.520]   Well, yeah, I did get I just I want a water. Oh water. I have a ball boring. I know
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:30.040]   I don't it's busy water. Is this the is my eat vicariously through you? I know. I know. Sorry. I know is this the
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.840]   Font story you were talking about corporate Memphis
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:40.440]   Why does every advertising I loved this story? This is from josh gabbard dorian and wired, but we'll get to the font story
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.040]   Uh
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:47.400]   It actually comes from a website called corporate memphis clear evans
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:55.400]   Uh site where she collects examples you've all we've all seen that there's all these ads now with the bendy people
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.840]   And uh, you know the the weirdly distorted people
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:02.040]   Uh playing with and it's all very flat
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:05.080]   It's she calls it corporate memphis
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:12.440]   And you can you can blame I guess the rise of uh adobe illustrator because it's very easy to create these there's a lot of
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:16.360]   Jack herli a leads based illustrator
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:21.080]   Says corporate memphis it really boils my piss to be honest
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:24.760]   You
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:31.240]   He said I was familiar with the style from facebook's log in page, but I started to see the illustrations
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:35.960]   With their sensible slightly strange characters while walking around his neighborhood as well
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:40.440]   I live in a student area and there are some real scumbag letting agencies
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:44.600]   And suddenly they all got this marketing with the bendy arm people
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:52.840]   They show me the bendy arm people here look here's here's some examples hinge designed to be deleted the bendy arm people
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:57.640]   You've seen this everywhere you can't visit corporate memphis
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:02.760]   Here's another one. You see this all the time. See she's wearing sensible sneakers
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:07.240]   She's got bendy arms. No face. No features whatsoever
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:10.920]   Yeah, okay. I got you now. Mm-hmm
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:12.920]   Mm-hmm
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:14.440]   Corporate memphis
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:18.120]   Allows these companies to offer the illusion of a world without hierarchies
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:26.440]   Where users are afforded the same access and privileges as those who control the platforms a playful world that values creativity
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:33.400]   But of course illustration is done in the corporate memphis style. I rarely have ever credited to the artist who produced them
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:40.600]   So don't don't ask for credit. That's all anyway. I just had to mention that so what's the fun story you were
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:47.960]   One three six it happens to be a story by Glenn Fleishman the Glenn Fleishman moments ago. I've heard about him on twitter
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:53.080]   Yeah, I thought he became friends with him on twitter because twitter is a wonderful place
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:57.480]   He's a sure senior contributor in mak world
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:04.280]   Adobe wow wait a minute is this to be black in history type one font support
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:09.560]   This goes back my friends my children to the 19
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.040]   um
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:18.520]   1980s really 1990s I think yeah, they'll start with the mac because you before the mac there were no such thing as fonts
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:27.320]   But once there were they there were such things no there were but but not not in the computers personal computer space
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:36.040]   And font I mean people discovered fonts everything started looking like ransom letters because they put 18 different fonts in their newsletters and things like that
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:44.680]   It settled down, but there was a brisk market in fonts and these were originally those type one fonts that was made possible by postscript
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:52.760]   And postscript was was revolutionary in publishing because no longer was an a and a and a was a description of shapes
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:57.560]   So it could be that it could be nine points or a thousand points and it would look great
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:02.920]   Yeah, and any any shape any letter any anything at all you wanted to postscript enabled
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:09.320]   And that's what you may be encountered with the pdf but we I encountered it postscript earlier with publishing entertainment weekly
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:15.000]   Which my wife set up all the whole network on so we had to buy all these fonts for our max they were expensive they were expensive
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:21.080]   Yeah, oh I remember because we would have the zip drives full of fonts when we built our magazine
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.640]   Oh right
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:30.360]   So that you have the font on that machine it wouldn't rent a park and you couldn't see
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:36.440]   Yes, oh my god. You're bringing back my college years. Why I love this story is great
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:41.480]   So apple which had a little falling out with adobe
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:44.040]   Uh, there's a long story behind that
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:49.000]   Uh, but uh in 19 what 91 said screw that we're going to create our own
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:57.640]   Font description called true type. They actually licensed it to microsoft. So when you see a font file. It's ttf. That's a true type
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:02.360]   font and uh, they were licensed for free. So
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:06.760]   It gave you all the benefits of a type one font, but you didn't have to pay adobe
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:11.160]   Uh by 2000 there was a new uh
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:16.760]   Architecture which you also also see commonly called open type otf
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:21.640]   So now frequently when you see fonts they'll be stored as otf or ttf
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:26.040]   Uh, otf and ttf. I think are fine
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:28.920]   They will continue on
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:31.720]   But type one fonts
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:36.840]   Are going if you have an old pdf that has type one fonts in it. It will not
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:42.840]   Fall apart what will happen still render. Okay. Mr render. Okay, because it's because it's already been
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:45.400]   Uh, exploded into the pdf
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:50.920]   So yeah, but photoshop will stop displaying type one fonts in the fonts menu at some point this year
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:54.680]   Which means you'll be able to you won't be able to start you continue to use them
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:39:04.920]   Uh, you'll be able to edit existing files that contain the fonts but not introduce new new new these fonts into new files and by january 2023
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:09.960]   None of adobe's products will let users author content with type one
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:12.600]   fonts
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.200]   so
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.800]   What do you do?
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:21.240]   You just delete them so you're you have you have to delete them and you've got to find you got to if you've built some old
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:27.480]   Design around it. God knows what exists still you have to go find an equivalent font and install that and redesign around it
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:32.600]   We yeah, type one fonts if you can update them to otf open type
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:36.840]   Or ttf yeah, you probably do that. Yeah, so in many cases
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.840]   It was a blast to the past
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:44.120]   Wow, Stacy that I gave Stacy a headache out of the memory of it right is oh my god
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:48.760]   My will this page look like anything. Oh no, they don't have the the huge zip drive
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.320]   Oh for it. Oh my god those were
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:56.680]   Yeah, we we built a magazine and we built it using dreamweaver and
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:00.200]   God font lab
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:07.880]   God font lab does sell a program called trans type four which will take type one fonts and turn them into otf
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:12.280]   Uh fonts so it's only a hundred bucks or if you're in education
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:14.680]   $48 mac and pc
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:19.320]   Convert legacy postscript fonts so I guess they're gonna make some money on that one
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:22.200]   Wow, so when we started
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:26.600]   Editing a weekly which I got my wife did the it was the first major all mac setup
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:32.280]   What happens Stacy
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:34.120]   Y'all
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:39.000]   I'm talking about the magazine that we started in college. You totally could have finished your story. I was just so excited
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:45.480]   It still exists. I started something all the way back in 1998 and it's still what's it called?
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.280]   Is it a ut?
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:54.440]   Yes, it's called orange mag dot co. Oh my goodness. My baby grew up. Oh
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:57.880]   Okay, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry

[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:07.320]   The dreamers beginning of the late 1990s. Look how modern it looks now. Isn't that cool? Oh, dude
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:11.240]   I will I have I have an old version of it. It looked modern then. I don't know
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:15.480]   I'll show y'all and y'all will be impressed with our graphic design. That's pretty cool
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:18.360]   They unfortunately are not keeping those old ones online
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:25.160]   Wait a minute. Yeah, they only go back to issue one spring 2014. Are you sure this is the same?
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:30.120]   It's yes. They if you go into FAQs, they stopped publishing for a while
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:34.120]   So then then they started up again. They didn't they started issue one
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:39.640]   Yeah, cool. Congratulations Stacy. You created something that lasts
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.440]   Handcrafted by ut students
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:45.720]   Nice
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:49.480]   So I

[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:05.320]   Jeff did you know professor dave garlock
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:10.840]   Did you take his magazine magazine management class and moody college's school of journalism?
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:18.760]   Okay. Yes. Are you making fun of no, this is the beginning. These were all my teachers. Are they still here? They're about here. This is in the about
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:26.200]   Dear lord, it was it was yeah beginning in the late 1990s in their old days
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:35.560]   Back when entertainment weekly still was originally class project. Yeah. Well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, wait a minute. That's a link
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:40.520]   That's a way. Wait. Wait. Wait. So stacy did click on the link there. Oh my god
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:43.400]   Here it is. Okay. Yeah, but this is it. Yeah
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.280]   Is that it? This isn't that
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:52.760]   This is not the course catalog which which which was your what year was your is your logo? I
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:55.400]   No, our logo was
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:00.840]   If you wait, I will actually say this is the oldest one. They've still got online, which is 2000. Yeah, this is not because ours
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:05.640]   It came out in 1998, 1999. Oh my god, you're old
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:08.680]   I know
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:13.000]   And we we actually had a fight with the daily taxon. It was crazy. You know what?
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.880]   I think it's a little bit influenced by something I think of as entertainment weekly
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:23.080]   Oh, yes. Look at this layout very entertainment weekly. Yeah
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:30.360]   Wow, it is. Yeah. Oh actually art layout looks just like that. Okay. Now I want to go grab it because our layout looked a lot like that
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:35.640]   Believe it or not. And you know what? All type all all type one fonts every one of them
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:39.720]   Yeah, because they're not they're not rendering. They're not rendering well at all
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:43.000]   The the hinting is not there
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:49.640]   That's pretty okay when we when we started the web was still very young
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:54.440]   Now is this a is this a woman's college because there's no man on this at all
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:02.040]   Um, our founders three of three of the four of us were women. So I see zero men on the mast. Oh, wait
[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:04.840]   I mean, there's a game. Well, it's about time. Yeah, that's fine
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:09.160]   What kind of world would only allow one gender to dominate like that
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:12.680]   Not a world I want to live in that's for sure
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:16.360]   Art here is that issue
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:18.360]   2009 spring 2009
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:21.240]   That's that's far back. That's a little fancier than ours
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:22.840]   Man
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:25.880]   Okay. All right. That was a little. That's really cute. That's been nice
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:29.880]   I was really excited. I'm so sorry. This has been the hig and botham show
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:32.280]   You need sure is
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:35.640]   I have a fine thing that is you need to have a reunion stacy
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:39.560]   Of orange veterans orgers or just
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:45.240]   You can email dave garlock. He's uh, and I have his phone number here too if you want to call him
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:47.960]   I could eat
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:56.040]   Worries me a little bit that this article says the latest issue is the fall 2011 issue
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:45:01.800]   Oh, yeah, I think what happened is there was a whole there was a hiatus. That's why I was like, yeah
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:08.200]   There was a break in publication. Yeah, but it's still the same magazine and look this one still exists. So cool
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:11.560]   I'm proud of were you the first editor
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:18.520]   No, the dreamers issue was published December 11, 2020. Oh, so I know that's just this this this is the old
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.960]   From the journalism. You text. I declined to be the editor. I wanted to do something different
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:26.760]   So I was actually jeff you're gonna love it. I was our
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:31.720]   What did they call that person the person who handles prints and publications?
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:38.760]   But that I also became the managing editor because that person flaked so but whoever had like I dealt with the printer and production and
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:43.400]   You know, did you have and I think it would have been a nice section if you thought a bit
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:48.120]   Right in the middle of that magazine something called the google changelog
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:52.120]   Oh, that would have been good. Wouldn't that have been good? Yeah, you would like that
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:57.080]   Google changelog
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:59.080]   Everybody would have made fun of Stacy
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:03.560]   Why is there it's a google changelog in the middle of my magazine
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:13.720]   Well, when you hear these stories, you'll wonder yourself google pay us users can now send money to users in India and singapore
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:19.640]   Congratulations
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:26.040]   To say that saves people a lot of money. Yeah, no, that's good. Yeah, because western unions are gone
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:28.920]   What do you do? You got a you know venmo? I don't know you can't
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:34.360]   It's hard. I had to send my my daughter money in mexico
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:40.760]   She had to go to a grocery store to pick it up. I mean it really is primitive and you know, it's it's it's not a good system
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:44.200]   So google pay will make a big improvement. Yes, ask your question
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:48.840]   Okay, no, you only answer questions. You don't get to ask them
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:51.480]   Google pay
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:57.080]   Existed exists, but there's now gpay and I put my credit card on google pay
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:00.760]   But do I now have to do it for gpay?
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:06.600]   It's a man gpay. Yeah, I think you do it. Is that like venmo plus credit? What is it?
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:13.880]   Yeah, it's a pain. I was hoping somebody here could tell me. It wasn't working the other
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:16.440]   It's a pain
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:21.880]   Okay, here's from tech crunch is google pay the same as gpay
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:24.040]   well
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:26.600]   Sort of it's a redesigned google pay
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:33.640]   Sort of that but it also pulls in all these weird data that I don't
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:36.760]   understand while it's gpay pulls in like
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:42.440]   Like the las vegas monorail which I hooked up using nfc like yeah
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:48.120]   I've seen yeses ago and I don't understand where that came from. It's not even on this phone. It's all in there, baby
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:51.880]   Uh, it's because they keep track everything
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:56.760]   The most credit card I put in there there's not in there anymore and I can't use anymore
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:01.160]   So google forgot that the most important new feature according to tech crunch
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:06.840]   Google is enabling what this update is indeed the ability to connect your bank accounts and credit cards
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:11.480]   To google pay so that it can pull in information about your spending
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:19.240]   It's basically it's basically mint light. We're just trying to make a service that makes your life better. That's all
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:23.080]   Well, I just want to pay with my phone. Can I use
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:25.960]   Do they have that?
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:29.160]   On monday, I'll show you how much you spent on the weekend
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:35.320]   Think of these almost as like stories in a way says the product manager
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:37.080]   You can
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:43.480]   Swipe through them so you can see your large transactions. You can see how much you spent this week compared to a typical week
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:47.320]   So really yeah, they're trying to create kind of a true bill or a mint
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:50.520]   Um true bill is all I see
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:54.120]   A ton of ads that are like
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:56.920]   Yeah, you can pay people
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:01.240]   I get cash back for a bunch of people and things but I don't care about that
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:04.200]   The rest of the core google pay features aren't changing
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:12.040]   You can still make your NFC payments at the supermarket with your phone just as before it's just google pay plus
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:19.640]   Well, yeah, it gets worse. So you gotta if you go to google pay, it says try the new google pay stop
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:22.040]   Chief
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:27.640]   Jesus can they hire somebody to do brands and fun? I'm telling you I you know, okay
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:32.440]   Was it mike algan who said center or patris actually a terrible ceo i'm starting to
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:37.080]   Starting to agree with him a little bit. It's not a well-run company. I'm sorry
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:41.240]   I'm sorry to disrupt the change log. I just I had such high hopes that I would understand
[01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:48.360]   No, that was good and it was almost as important as the second story in the google change log google fiber has a new logo
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:53.960]   Google fiber has a new logo
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:57.560]   whoop
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:59.560]   It doesn't even look like fiber
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:04.920]   It's the google logo deconstructed is what it is
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:08.040]   Or something. I don't know. No
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:11.640]   You have to put it together to get a circle for you to signal to come actually
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:16.920]   The big story is they actually reached they've started it back up and they've been putting two gigabit
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:23.400]   internet in existing cities and they even have started some new fiber, which I thought they weren't going to do anymore
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:28.360]   So maybe there is a larger story there, but at least they have a new logo and thank goodness
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:31.320]   Google brings
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:33.800]   I think that's the way to avoid the poor
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:40.120]   Perce, oh you can't kill us. We get at least six months with a new logo, right? There you go
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:43.240]   Yeah
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:50.280]   Google brings something your watch has needed for a long time a keyboard to wear o s
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:57.480]   It's it's actually the first major app launch on wear o s in years
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:50:59.320]   Yeah
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:04.760]   It is it is the you can't kill us before we have a keyboard. We have a keyboard Ruth. Look at that
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:07.400]   We're not dead yet. Oh
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:12.760]   Let me tell you this looks easy. Yeah, this looks easy because this watch is huge
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:15.160]   But really in real life you can't do that
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:22.200]   You gotta have no one wants a keyboard on their watch what google yeah, how dorky can you look?
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:25.560]   Well, it's just not effective
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:32.840]   as you type as if they're as if they're it weren't small enough as you type they actually take a top row to
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:35.400]   Predictions in
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:38.360]   Scrollable scroll over scrollable word suggestions
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:44.680]   A previous screen allows you to review and edit your message which suggestions and correct is corrections presented to you
[01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:49.240]   And you can roost you might want to go visit the where where team you know, it was just my one
[01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:53.880]   They actually had one before this is the old where keep board. Oh, it looks old too
[01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:57.640]   But it was using type one fonts so they've moved to the new
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:06.680]   Oh man, there's got to be a big story to wrap up the google change log, right
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:15.720]   Google assistant family broadcasts from smart displays can now appear on phones
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:23.880]   Oh, that's useful. Yeah, is it just a visual or is it uh audio?
[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:28.120]   Um, sorry
[01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:31.080]   Let me make you read the whole article
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:35.560]   You don't ask questions. No, it's just text. No, no, it's just text. No, it's just text
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:39.160]   Oh, I thought because you know apple has that very cool feature. I know

[01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:57.960]   Meanwhile family bells
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:01.720]   Can now be configured to ring across multiple home devices
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:04.200]   Instead of just one
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:10.840]   And you can say by the way now we mentioned this a couple of weeks ago stop instead of saying hey, you know who first to stop it
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:12.840]   Um
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:14.840]   And oh, hey, this is exciting
[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:20.040]   Smart to play displays are adding more stories from harry potter's wizarding world

[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:21.000]   Google stock just went down 20 percent
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:26.040]   You know what you know who's sad he's not here who ant?
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:32.280]   Ant would love this because you know how he loves the musical musicals he loves the musical
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:40.280]   Wow vaccines are safe and an important step towards opening up and shaking hands again
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:45.800]   Well, it's all true. Well, I don't want to shake hands. I oh shaking hands again. Stop with the shaking hands. No
[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:50.600]   Towards opening up and shaking hands again and going somewhere
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:56.680]   We couldn't visit for months protecting ourselves and the world at once. Okay once was bad enough
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:02.040]   Yeah, that was yeah true. That's the main. I now vaccinated. Joel. Happy uh, vaccine
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:05.560]   Now, uh, when did you get your most your last one?
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:07.560]   Uh
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:10.600]   Two and a half three weeks. Oh, you you're good. You're golden
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:15.720]   Let's go. Yeah, and Anna has a shot scheduled for this weekend. So excited
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:17.960]   Our 18 year olds getting his second shot right now
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:21.000]   Yeah, I know the world
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.120]   Yeah, well, I shouldn't say the world america is coming back. Unfortunately a lot of the world is
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:29.240]   Save you stole all the vaccines where where's ours?
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:33.080]   Meanwhile, I just tweeted this I found this vaguely offensive
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:35.000]   Um
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.640]   Ohio just announced according to a tweet
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:40.520]   Um, let's hope it's not wrong
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:48.600]   From a journalist that says that they're going to give away $1 million to five randomly vaccinated residents governor de wine announced
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:51.960]   Is that to encourage people to get vaccinated?
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:56.200]   Yeah, but it's just at a time when when people have to walk
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:02.200]   Miles in india to not get vaccinated and get oxygen. It just seems just ugly america
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:05.480]   The problem is that there are a lot of people who won't get vaccinated
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:12.280]   Erie county, New York to a neighbor the other night. Yep. Yep. Erie county, New York. They're they're giving you beer
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:18.280]   Uh, actually that's smart. Yeah, that's smart. I'm fine with that local micro brewery
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:20.520]   There was a line at the door to get vaccinated
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:27.160]   Next to his towering metal fermentation tanks. It was the first vaccine for beer pop-up
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:32.600]   In the county's aptly named shot and chaser program
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:36.920]   Shot and chaser get a shot
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:39.560]   Get your chaser
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:43.480]   That's good. That's good. Jersey did the same thing. That's a good thing. It works
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:49.240]   It's funny because it shows that even though people are resistant to vaccine their resistance is actually quite low
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:52.280]   Oh, you're gonna give me a beer? Okay, I'll do it
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:59.640]   It's like well it is a lot of young white people mostly men. So this is a good program. Yeah
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:02.600]   Yeah, that's fine. I'm fine with the beer, but five
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:09.560]   Five million dollars that could go to a better purpose. That does seem like an awful lot. It could they honestly mic
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:13.960]   I'm tired. I'm trying to buy the wine 100 bucks is all you need to give away
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:18.200]   People be thrilled that jump on that thing. You don't need to give away five million
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.680]   Can you can you get more entries if you get more vaccines like get like four
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:26.440]   It also I just got hit with a paywall by the Columbus dispatch. Oh, please
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:29.160]   But it also said that we're gonna give away five full ride scholarships
[01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:31.960]   Well, that's good again
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:34.840]   Then you should be giving scholarships. Don't have any way
[01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:37.400]   All right, all right
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:41.880]   Yeah, because everybody should just get the vaccine because it's the right thing to do. Yes for the community
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:46.440]   You should just do it and then a beer is a fine bribe. I know you know what it's not a bribe. It's a reward
[01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:52.120]   Yeah, I am absolutely fine with the beer reward. I think that's right. Yeah. I got cake after my vaccine
[01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:55.400]   Did you really?
[01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:57.400]   Oh, yeah, oh from home
[01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:00.360]   B I bought cake. Oh
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:03.720]   Okay, giving yourself cake
[01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:06.360]   Oh, no, that counts that counts
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:09.320]   That's okay. Yeah, and that's the google change
[01:59:09.320 --> 01:59:13.240]   I have to wrap that up
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:18.600]   Otherwise poor john has to hover his finger over that button and it just he's sorry. You get started
[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:21.240]   I'm gonna do it. What's he gonna do it? Yeah any minute now
[01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:24.760]   Um
[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:26.760]   Let's see
[01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:31.320]   We have the little girl who said google doesn't know me since we just did google
[01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:34.840]   That's a tick tock. You're you're into the tick tock, sorry
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:38.040]   Are you like this like you like
[01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:42.600]   It's about google so it counts. I put it in google. I put it in the google thing
[01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:46.760]   It's in the google tiktok. Yes, here it is. It's in the google here. It is a young lady
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:49.560]   And her response
[01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:51.560]   What happened?
[01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:54.040]   Google doesn't know you
[01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:56.120]   She doesn't know your voice that's why
[01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:59.080]   Oh, this is my husband google what

[02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:04.360]   My name
[02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:06.360]   She doesn't know my name
[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:08.360]   That's why she's not listening to you
[02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:10.360]   Okay, let's go tell google come
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:13.400]   Google
[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:15.400]   What do you want her to do?
[02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:18.520]   Say hi to jordy
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:21.560]   Say hi to me
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:26.200]   Say hi to jordyn
[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:28.840]   Hi jordyn
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:30.840]   Oh, she's so happy
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:32.520]   Isn't she
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:33.960]   Yeah
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:35.480]   My life is complete
[02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:39.960]   Mommy, what why are you pointing that camera at me all the time mommy
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:43.320]   Are you behind there or
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:47.960]   Is is the camera my mommy is the camera is google my mommy now
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:53.160]   Meanwhile the um the
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:55.960]   Amazon, you know who has been
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:59.080]   Revealed
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:02.920]   She was actually revealed a while back, but yes, well she
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:07.240]   Oh, we're gonna be healed by how Brad stone got it. Oh, all right. Never mind
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:09.880]   Well, Brad wrote that book about Amazon
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:16.760]   Yeah, he wrote a second book about that Amazon. Yes. It just came out, right? Is you brand new one? Yeah? Yeah. Yep. Yeah
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:19.960]   I liked his first one the the everything store. So in the new book
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:26.520]   Uh, he says Colorado based nina roll is the voice of a word
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:29.960]   He says it's never been revealed
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:36.760]   Roll is a voice over uh artist who's worked for honda jenny craig and chase bank
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:44.520]   She was selected after amazon spent months assessing various candidates and it took jeff bezos to sign off
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:47.240]   on uh, on roll at rolly
[02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:48.920]   um
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:51.160]   Rollie could not talk about the role
[02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:55.960]   When uh stone contacted her in february
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:00.120]   There is a woman on tick tock who imitates
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:05.480]   The a word no, this was okay. She does a good job
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:11.320]   I thought it was revealed as well, but you know what a series been revealed the lady did a series as well
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:17.080]   Oh, maybe that's what I was thinking. Yeah, that's okay. Yeah. Yeah, so we just didn't know who a word was
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:25.240]   But as you can tell no actually meet the woman behind amazon's battle a nbc news august 8th 2018 and is it rolling?
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:28.520]   Let's see
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:34.920]   Maybe they had to kill her then they bring me read to learn a little bit more about this pint size
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:40.600]   Oh, this is the person who created metame. I guess not the voice
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:44.520]   Okay, not the voice just the woman who created it
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:50.760]   Have I mentioned that google fiber has a brand new logo did I mention that yes? Yes, you did
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:57.960]   Trying to trying to make something out of it, but uh, just just can't just can't do it
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000]   Uh, let's see
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:08.280]   Did you see the guardian article about people mostly women who don't want to take off the mask
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:11.320]   They say it's an invisibility cloak
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:17.800]   They they don't they they and I kind of kind of understand my wife doesn't want to take her mask off. She likes wearing it
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:19.800]   um
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:23.560]   Even though yeah, you only have to put makeup on half your face exactly
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:29.640]   Becca marshal works at a bookstore outside chicago. She says it's a common consensus among my co-workers
[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:33.080]   We prefer not having customers to hear faces
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:38.360]   Oftentimes when a customer is being rude or saying off color political things
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:43.000]   I'm not allowed to grimace or make a face because that'll set them off with a mask
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.520]   I don't have to smile at them or worry about keeping a neutral face
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:51.080]   I had I've had customers get very upset when I don't smile at them
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:56.520]   I have I deal with any maskers constantly at work. They've threatened to hurt me
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:03.480]   Try to get me fired thrown things at me yelled f you in my face if wearing a mask in the park separates me from them
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:08.600]   I'm cool with it. I think there's going to be kind of virtual signal virtual signaling
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:11.160]   via masks
[02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:14.280]   We I mean I I keep my
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:19.640]   Mask on outside even though I know it makes no difference and I do it simply just to make sure
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:25.160]   One people feel like oh, yeah, like they feel better about it and then also
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:29.880]   To help encourage other people to do it because if everyone's doing that's good
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:37.240]   Bob hall a 75 year old retired researcher in new jersey. I think his real name was jeff jarvis with a self-described
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:45.640]   Naturally grim 75. No, all right, but you do have a self-described naturally grim countenance that set that tends to be off
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:54.040]   When you're a woman they call it resting bitch face. That's right for men. It's a naturally grim countenance
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:05:01.480]   He says in the United States there's an obligation to appear happy and I get told to smile and be happy a lot
[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:05.160]   Which is very annoying the mask that guy please
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:13.320]   That's been my whole life. That's what I was thinking. I was like, yeah, no one's telling these women to smile anymore
[02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:18.280]   Good for them. I think that that's a perfectly good reason to continue wearing a mask honestly
[02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:24.600]   Yeah, I got into a tiff with glenn reenwald on twitter today because he went after Kamala Harris for wearing a mask
[02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:31.240]   Oh lord, this was grizzly and I said you don't tell them what to do with her body, you know enough stop
[02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:38.600]   Um, then there's another funny story charlie wortzel tweeted it from um vice. I just put at the bottom of the other
[02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:45.160]   Anti-masters are ready to start masking to protect themselves from the vaccinated
[02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:50.040]   Oh, yeah, because we have the bill gates virus. Yeah, okay stuff on right
[02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:55.560]   That's that's propaganda to make sure they're they don't die of the coronavirus with they don't have a mask
[02:05:55.560 --> 02:05:58.680]   That's a good one or a vaccine. So that's good for them. Yeah
[02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:03.960]   Good for them. Yeah, uh, this is a reprehensible story that I think you'll enjoy
[02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:08.840]   Uh, there is a power plant in upstate new york the green edge
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.680]   This is a power plant. Yeah, that's been abandoned long ago
[02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:19.160]   It has been purchased by a private equity firm atlas holdings and put back online
[02:06:19.160 --> 02:06:21.800]   to
[02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:24.120]   provide bit power for bitcoin mining
[02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:27.000]   by the end of the year
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.400]   green edge will be up and running
[02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:36.040]   And uh, and atlas will have installed 18 000 bitcoin mining machines
[02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:41.960]   Actually, they got approval of their data center expansion plants. So they're going to add 10 000 more
[02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:48.280]   miners will be using 79 percent of the plant's capacity 85 megawatts
[02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:53.080]   And uh, the company actually is is proud of it
[02:06:53.080 --> 02:07:00.040]   Then the recent s4 filing with the scc they said quote no direct competitor currently owns and operates its own power plant
[02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:02.200]   For the purpose of bitcoin mining
[02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:07.960]   No other bitcoin mining operation of this scale in the united states currently uses power generated from its own plant
[02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:13.480]   fully for us say, uh, of course, it's a fossil fuel powered plant
[02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:19.240]   Oh, I was like, is it a fossil fuel power plant or is it? I mean because there's bitcoin mining here
[02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:24.840]   It's actually even worse. It's a coal fired power. Yes, it's awful. It's all hot
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:29.960]   The neighbors are complaining. It's it's belching smoke again. One of the reasons they closed it down
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:35.960]   Because it was so expensive to run. Oh, I'm sorry. It was converted to natural gas in 2014
[02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:43.880]   Um, so they so I guess in 2017 it was restarted to test its bitcoin mining strategy
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:47.720]   Less and less used on the grid more and more for bitcoin
[02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:49.880]   so
[02:07:49.880 --> 02:07:54.840]   And you know what elan musk who very a very short time ago said we're going to accept bitcoin
[02:07:54.840 --> 02:08:00.040]   In payment for teslas says we're not going to do it anymore citing environmental concerns
[02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:07.640]   They've suspended vehicle purchases using bitcoin because of fossil fuels used for bitcoin mining
[02:08:07.640 --> 02:08:11.800]   Which kind of makes sense if you're trying to sell a green car, right?
[02:08:11.800 --> 02:08:14.920]   Uh, yeah
[02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:19.640]   I don't know if he might just be like screw the earth because we're going to mars
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:23.080]   Well, and that's the funny thing because apparently he's he's got a
[02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:26.040]   plant to use dogecoin
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:29.960]   to fund a satellite or something
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:33.080]   So, you know, elan is confusing
[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:37.320]   Skip a trip to the moon. That's right. They want to go to the moon next year
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:39.960]   Um
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:42.200]   And they want to finance it with dogecoin
[02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:45.720]   Did you watch them on snl?
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:48.920]   I tried to watch the clips and it wasn't funny. So I just stopped
[02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:54.360]   Somebody said today thought it was the funniest snl one of our uh, one of our club members
[02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:57.000]   So there's a funniest snl ever
[02:08:57.640 --> 02:09:00.920]   So space x is going to launch a moon mush mushin
[02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:04.040]   A moon mission
[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:07.560]   Mushroom size popcorn which is weird
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:12.280]   It's very confusing because he just stopped taking bitcoin for cars, but now he wants to
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:16.600]   fund a moon mission with dogecoin by 2022
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:21.640]   Um
[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:27.000]   Geometric energy corp has planned a ride share mission of the moon aboard the space x falcon 9
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:29.480]   rocket which costs about 69
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:34.040]   Sorry 62 million to book which at its current value
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:37.000]   Is 129 million dogecoin
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:43.480]   Elan and and this is again why you twitter is so wonderful
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:45.320]   tweeted
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:47.320]   tweeted this saying
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:49.960]   to the moon
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:52.680]   to the moon
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:57.080]   And then apparently there's a you want to hear the twitter dogecoin
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:00.600]   The cryptocurrency that you should it best
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:04.600]   It's the people's currency. You know, it's the best
[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:07.560]   Taking dogecoin to the moon
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:10.920]   Okay, stop the first i hope alie brosh got money for that
[02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:19.880]   Okay, leo stop i'm probably gonna get taken down and that'll be the irony of that we'll get this whole show taken down and lose our youtube license
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:22.840]   Is dogecoin mind like others? Oh, yeah
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:25.640]   Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:30.280]   It's they haven't well is it as energy intensive? I don't know. I don't know. Should I look it up?
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:35.320]   I think it's all pretty bad. They're still using proof of work. I think dogecoin
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:37.160]   uses a roof
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:39.160]   Stacy love work
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:40.760]   Let me just check
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:45.960]   It's an open source to centralize peer-to-peer network that uses a proof of work consensus algorithm
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:48.680]   Which sounds just like bitcoin us
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:51.960]   I think really it's just bitcoin
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:55.160]   But anyway, okay, okay fine. Okay, fine
[02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:58.920]   Study finds no link
[02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:05.480]   Stacy no link between the time teens spend on tech devices and mental health issues no link
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:07.800]   told you
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:09.800]   No link. Okay. This is a good study
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:12.200]   30 year study
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:14.440]   430 adolescents in the uk in the u.s
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:17.720]   Use questionnaires dating back to 1991
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:23.800]   And there was they were unable to show any statistical correlation between mental health issues and
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:31.080]   It is a good one. Yeah, I mean, okay. There's some flaws. It's self-reported, right? So maybe they you know
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:33.800]   But still it's good
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:36.360]   eBay is gonna start selling nft's
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:43.000]   But this is an interesting twist you have to use dollars to buy them
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:46.760]   Oh
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:52.920]   So somebody somebody's figured that out. Oh, you know if we took dollars the whole thing could be just you know profit
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:56.840]   All right, um
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:11:58.840]   Is also doing an nft
[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:03.880]   Webster's the dictionary the twitter joke twitter joke because we finally understand what it is so we have one
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:06.840]   I don't know if they're selling the definition of nft
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:10.200]   That's actually what they should do. They should sell the definition of nft's an nft
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:15.560]   It would be like an inception be incredible. All right. Mm-hmm. Let's take a little break
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:18.120]   and
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:19.400]   Uh
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:21.800]   We will come back with our picks of the week, right?
[02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:24.760]   You ready? All right. Yes
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:27.000]   Pick of the week time Stacy is
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.120]   Ready because waffles awake. Go ahead Stacy
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:32.840]   All right. What do you want to do?
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:35.800]   You were gonna do that. She was away. She was away. She was like what's it?
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:40.120]   What's happening? Okay, um, I saw this on twitter
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:43.800]   Twitter and I got excited about it. So I just bought
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:48.520]   I'm gonna tell you what it is. It is the m5 stack core 2
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:52.760]   sp32 iot dev kit for a ws iot
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:57.640]   Education you're like what just happened. So here it is
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:04.200]   And i'm gonna pop the link into the I am Jason hates me because I never put the links in the right spot
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:06.920]   Hold on. I'm coming Jason
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:09.640]   Uh
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:11.640]   Boom there it is
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:13.000]   Um, okay
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:19.640]   So this is a dev kit so I can actually start using a ws and build something to flash my lights or something like that
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:22.760]   You know just oops just to play basically
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:26.280]   So most of y'all are probably likes t c what but I don't code
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:30.600]   So kevin's gonna support me on this. He doesn't know it yet
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:33.240]   and
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:34.680]   Yeah
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:40.040]   So this is both a sensor. It has a little led it has ports
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:44.760]   It has a speaker it's a raspberry pie. It's obvious
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:51.880]   So raspberry pie with with the link up to
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:57.240]   a ws is iot stuff so now it's got a radio and to uh,
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:01.400]   Yes, and what is the what is the it's not sidewalk
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:05.880]   No, no, no, it's Wi-Fi. I'm assuming interesting
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:08.440]   yes
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:15.720]   So it's the m5 stack court to esp 32 ios t development kit for a ws iot edu kit
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:21.480]   Yeah, so basically this is just Stacy's effort to like learn how to start playing with some of the things
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:26.760]   Because I talk about lots of things you know, I love about it. It has a leggo on the bottom
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:31.960]   It does yes, so I can build like a little robot. Oh, that's so cool. It's a it's lego
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:38.040]   Yeah, I'll show you the little lego that's so logo. That's so uh, pig leg. That's lego compatible. That's so awesome
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:40.200]   Yeah, although that is cool
[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:47.720]   Yeah, I just I don't know I wanted to play and I had time and it's almost summer. So that's really cool
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:53.160]   So what language do you have to use to control it? What do you what do you do with it? I don't know yet because I just got it
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:15:00.120]   So we're just gonna you know, it might be an arch we know it says it as it sports. Are do we know development frameworks?
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:03.160]   So it might be an arch we know yeah, I was like it's not a full computer
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:08.040]   Let's see that would make sense or python. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:12.760]   I don't think there's a lot of programming here. I think it's mostly about physical stuff
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:21.000]   Again, this is part of stacy buy stuff and then plays with it and is like oh here. I'm learning what I know and what I don't know
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:24.200]   That's good. So that's how you learn you gotta try
[02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:28.840]   You learn by doing that. So this is the amazon page is a
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:31.800]   long a lot of
[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:37.480]   Information here sample code and so forth. So that's really cool. I think it's a relatively new
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:45.480]   Product from them. I think it's an update to an older product. I don't want to play with this too actually. It's kind of cool
[02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:52.600]   So you put a command line in your host machine to remotely manage AWS. So it actually connects to AWS
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:56.920]   Right. This is gonna help me work with AWS IOT
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:15:59.800]   Oh, it has a built-in name fun
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:06.840]   It could it could make a cloud connected blinky, which is the apparently the hello world for microcontrollers
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:09.400]   Then you can do a smart thermostat
[02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:13.320]   Which is kind of neat smart spaces. How much is it?
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:16.920]   It's 50 bucks so 49 95 okay
[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:19.480]   um and I just I mean
[02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:22.040]   Or sorry 49 90
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:24.840]   Keep the nickel keep the nickel kid
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:32.600]   There you go. Oh, it has a battery built in too. So you don't you could actually take it off the grid out the power. That's nice
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:35.800]   So yeah, I just
[02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:39.560]   I don't know what i'm gonna do with it yet, but i'm gonna play and whatever I do
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:43.720]   I'll make up my thing of the week for that week and y'all can all be like oh, Stacy look at you
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:46.520]   Your blinky hello world. That's what I want to see
[02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:54.280]   So so yeah, oh you have to do plays with computers. Yeah cloud connected blinky application if you can get that working here
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:57.480]   You're there. Well, I I did have an I did
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:00.760]   T-shirt Arduino to blink
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:06.200]   A couple years ago. I had an Arduino kit that I worked with but
[02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:08.840]   Yeah
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:11.000]   Wow, this is cool
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:14.040]   Looks like a lot of fun runs on Linux Mac or windows
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:17.240]   Very nice
[02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:20.920]   I'll say it again because I know it went fast the m5 stack
[02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:23.720]   Core 2 esp 32
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:27.720]   Iot development kit for a ws Iot
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:31.000]   Edjucit from m5 stack
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.880]   Which I guess is a company
[02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:35.880]   Oh, they make other stuff
[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:40.360]   Yeah, it's built on the esp 32, which is one of the most popular
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:47.400]   Microcontroller ah so it isn't a far I it's or an argywino. It's an esp 32, but that's argywino compatible
[02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:50.040]   So that's cool neat
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:52.280]   Oh, they make a lot of esp 32 stuff
[02:17:52.280 --> 02:17:59.080]   Yeah, the what is the name of god? What is the name of the company that does those and then the 86 82?
[02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:01.480]   Oh man, I've had them on the show
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:04.600]   Nice they're very popular in the world of espresso
[02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:10.040]   Oh cool, that's the that's where the esp came from. Yeah. Yeah, nice
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:13.320]   Jeff free do you have a number?
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:15.960]   Yeah, I'll do this one
[02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:16.920]   So
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:23.160]   We often talk about how the platform is not paying enough taxes and I I agree with that and I scream that it's up to governments
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:25.000]   Decide what companies pay in taxes?
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.160]   Well, indeed the EU and EU court
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:33.880]   Just decided to throw out a three hundred three million dollar EU tax bill for amazon. Wow 330 million
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:38.360]   Because they had used the leksenburg double hitch sandwich
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:43.960]   Salkau defense. That's actually a big deal because if the EU regulators can't get the courts
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:48.120]   To prosecute that's going to be tough for them to continue the stagger
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:50.760]   Cakes yeah, yeah
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:56.920]   We just assume if a stagger says it it's going to happen, but courts have to sign off. That's interesting
[02:18:57.080 --> 02:19:00.280]   tossed out. Wow. What did they say they said there was no
[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:03.480]   They said that they hadn't shown
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:08.040]   That there was an undue reduction to the tax burden of amazon's leksenburg
[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:11.320]   subsidiary, that means I have no idea
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:12.760]   huh
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:16.600]   Uh, but as I say here it was a the verge says it was a significant blow
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:21.000]   Pre-U politicians had a big win for amazon now can still be appealed
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:27.960]   Uh to as a as an apple case it was also overturned in 2020 is being to the european court of justice
[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:32.600]   Uh, so we'll see but um this goes back to a case in
[02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:39.000]   2017 or 2000 that's when the commission ruled it goes back to 2006
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.360]   So they've changed all the all the tricks have changed since then
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:45.320]   But it's that's the precedent of saying
[02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:48.760]   No
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:52.280]   You get something to you to have the laws in place. You can't just make it up as you go
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:58.760]   Huh, so we'll see what happens. I mean, I think I think that we need laws to tax them better. I think we need
[02:19:58.760 --> 02:20:05.320]   Diplomacy so that the countries that uh, ireland muxenberg wherever the Dutch sandwich a lot of stuff
[02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:11.640]   Um, that's up to diplomats to get out so that we can tax them at an even in fair rate across countries
[02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:15.160]   According to what they earn in each country. It's not what happened now
[02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:20.680]   Do you remember a site called stumbled upon or stumble upon?
[02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:23.480]   Upon remember stumbling
[02:20:23.480 --> 02:20:27.080]   Yeah, that's that's a kind of nostalgic bit of the internet
[02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:31.480]   Well, somebody has kind of recreated it was stumbled dot
[02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:38.040]   CC stumbled through the internet discover the most interesting weird or awesome sites
[02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:46.040]   Apparently reviewed by humans. Shall we start stumbling? That's a good thing. I was worried about that. Yeah. Oh, this is good
[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:48.120]   I like this one. This is a great game
[02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:49.720]   2048
[02:20:49.720 --> 02:20:55.400]   I really like this game use the arrow keys to move the tiles they merge into one. Let's see if I can
[02:20:55.400 --> 02:21:01.080]   Oh now now that when they touch and you want to see if you can get all the way
[02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:03.080]   to
[02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:05.080]   2048
[02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:07.080]   Oh, this is hard
[02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:09.240]   Oh boy
[02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:14.200]   Can you do it? That's a fun game. Let's stumble again. Let's see what else we find
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:20.200]   Surprisingly slow environment detection build systems. Yeah, okay. I don't care about that
[02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:26.440]   Dissecting at the apple m1 GPU park. Oh, you know browsing just isn't what it used to be
[02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:29.960]   Firefox can't open this page
[02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:38.040]   Uh, well so far. This isn't that bad. Here is how editor paul maklas cut baby driver in real time on location
[02:21:38.040 --> 02:21:40.760]   That's cool
[02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:42.760]   I didn't know he did that
[02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:45.480]   Pattern radio whale songs. You want to hear some whale songs?
[02:21:45.480 --> 02:21:49.320]   Well using ai to explore
[02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:59.000]   That's kind of cool. That's a with google project actually bar talk
[02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:05.640]   Bartosh check check check check yeah check koski talking about the tesser act
[02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:08.360]   You remember that from a wrinkle in time, right?
[02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:11.800]   All right, let's see that from the barbell movies too
[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:17.720]   I don't know about marvel. I said that what they were looking for stuff create abstract art in one click
[02:22:17.720 --> 02:22:23.560]   This is actually kind of fun. You want to you want to create a ai generated abstract painting
[02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:28.840]   Sure, look at that. Isn't that beautiful? How much would you pay for that? I want to do an nft
[02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:35.080]   We can put it on a canvas. Let's put it on canvas. Look at this. Don't I miss cool site of the day
[02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:38.920]   It's only for I had a few cool sites. Oh, yeah, I did too. Yeah, you know
[02:22:39.160 --> 02:22:45.320]   So that 46 bucks. No, no, no, you buy the popcorn thing. Not the art. Yeah. Well, maybe we should generate another painting
[02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:49.160]   These are actually do look like modern art. I hate to tell you
[02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:53.880]   I think you could probably get a master's in fine art from the Rhode Island school of design with these
[02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:56.360]   I'm just saying
[02:22:56.360 --> 02:23:00.840]   Anyway, that's yeah, I like that one stumbled.cc. Oh, here's one melody maker
[02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:04.360]   This don't know what this is. This is a chrome experiment
[02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:09.480]   Is this funded by Google?
[02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:15.880]   No, but google does some of the most interesting sites on that. This is not funded by anybody. It's just they see a little ads up here
[02:23:15.880 --> 02:23:19.800]   Okay, fine fine
[02:23:19.800 --> 02:23:26.760]   Uh, this site cannot be displayed directly the no stats all star because it's guess what behind a paywall at the New York times

[02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:41.800]   It's just a little bit about the internet that it can't display
[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:44.440]   half of this because
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:49.080]   It's all behind pay walls pay walls now. That's really annoying
