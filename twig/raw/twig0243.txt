[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.520]   And how many views on Google+ do you have?
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.560]   We'll measure next on Twig.

[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.040]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show where we talk about Google,
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.120]   Facebook, the Googleverse.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.880]   Janet Trapani has the day off. Mike Elgin is sitting in nice to have you, Mike.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.440]   Glad to be here. I came all the way from across the hall.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.520]   So, glad to be here. Also from his book-lined study.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.120]   Where did you buy those books by the feeders?
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.320]   They're just props. Okay. The green screen.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.240]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis. Somebody was saying, I think this is true, that as we get to this digital
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.000]   world, books will become more and more precious. In fact, books will never be as inexpensive as
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.400]   they are today. So, bye-bye-bye. That's right. I'm a big book collector. I love books.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.120]   I've had them in storage for a long time. It's really a great time to go to bookstores by old books,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.520]   nice books, look up for acid-free paper because they'll destroy them.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.280]   But you raise a good, the exact point, which is I've got them in storage because it's not
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.520]   convenient to move them around. No, it is not.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.880]   But it is nice. I went to the Strand Bookstore the other day and I was wondering what their
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.520]   business is like now. What's the used book business like now?
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.400]   Well, I guess that's the point is that, in fact, it's going to get very good.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.080]   Because... But there's less... It's not a mass market anymore.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.120]   Oh, no. No.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.080]   But as a specialty market, it's going to be quite good. And I think that most...
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.120]   I should say most people, many people, certainly the three of us love books, right? So, that's not
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.560]   going away. The reality is that almost everything being produced nowadays will be with us forever.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.160]   You'll be able to find Gutenberg the Geek in 300 years and just like search for it, download it,
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.240]   and so on. But before everything was being scanned and digitized, those copies are the only copies.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.880]   And my wife buys these books that are about food production, making wine and stuff at home.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.760]   And the content, it is amazing. This is lost information.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.640]   And there are also a lot of books in lost languages.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.520]   And the internet is sort of killing off lost languages as well. So, it's a great thing to
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.840]   collect not only from a collector's point of view, but also from a cultural preservation point of
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.600]   view. But I think that's kind of the point is that it's not really killing it off. It's just
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:43.760]   as a mainstream interest. It is not huge. But in fact, I think the internet makes it possible for us,
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.360]   those small few who care about these obscure books together to find them, to buy them.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.880]   I mean, in a way, it facilitates that as much as it's killing it off.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.120]   Absolutely. I mean, in the old days, if you had to go to book from bookstore to bookstore,
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.560]   asking questions, where do you... Now you can have a running search for, I don't know, Craigslist,
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.760]   eBay, whatever, for a very obscure title. And you can wait for three years. I've done this.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.640]   And then boom, it pops up and you buy it. It's like, it's a great...
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.080]   Let's not forget him. That's how Amazon started was not only selling new books,
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.520]   but they quickly went into used books. So speaking of Amazon...
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.680]   I'm gonna go to my closet for one second. I'll be right back.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.680]   He's going into the closet, folks. This is a...
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.560]   Here come my closet.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.240]   Into and out of in one show. He's probably going to get a book.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.760]   He's gonna have a cape when he comes back.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.920]   I'm thinking, but let's take a look at Jeff's office. Well, oh, shoot, he's back.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.920]   That was good.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.800]   He has neither cape nor...
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.720]   You know, we interviewed on "Tragulation" on Monday. We interviewed Micho Caku.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.760]   And he has the most... It's a typical... What do you expect? The physicist's library would be with
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.880]   Professor Stax. He's at CUNY as well, right? Jeff, do you know Micho?
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.160]   No.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.040]   He is office...
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   Oh, the physics guy.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.400]   Dr. Caku, the physics guy. Yeah.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.080]   His books, like "Werson," I mean, like "Piled,"
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.560]   everywhere, your office is a pristine...
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.800]   Wonderland, compared to his.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.320]   But I could not help. I could not resist looking at the spines.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.920]   Seeing what is he reading? What is he reading?
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.800]   It's fascinating.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.920]   Spider-Man comics and stuff.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.400]   Mostly.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.480]   This is the stuff that gets me to. This was like...
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.000]   Breaking Game, folks.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.720]   Breaking Game.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.680]   Gutenberg.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.640]   Gutenberg.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.480]   printed in 1476.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.600]   So Jeff's now holding up.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.400]   You have a page from Gutenberg Press?
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.000]   No, no, Gutenberg era.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.520]   1476 out of Cologne.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.120]   Wow, that's so cool.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.760]   Somewhere there's a...
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.040]   Like Conrad Vintres.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.200]   Somewhere there's a Gutenberg Bible with a page missing.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.360]   So what is it a Bible? What is it?
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.160]   This is a page from the...
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.080]   Memotraca Superbibblium.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.520]   Oh, it's a superbook.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.160]   It's not the movie.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.160]   Early commentary based on sacred brochures.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.960]   But I just wanted to have it for that reason.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.440]   I just wanted to have something that was this early.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.840]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.240]   The printing press will be by the 600th birthday.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.360]   It'll be a museum piece.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.920]   Printing press.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.880]   Well, today, this morning at 11,
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.560]   I got to just a couple hours ago,
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.040]   I got to interview the man who made that all possible.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.000]   Vint Cerf, who was one of the architects of the internet.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.320]   The guy who with Bob Con created TCP/IP.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.120]   He was at DARPA in the earliest days of the internet.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.000]   He then worked at MCI,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.160]   where he created MCI mail.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.320]   One of the very early email implementations.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.440]   We talked a little bit about that.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.640]   Founded the internet society with Bob Con.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.120]   Founded ICANN and was the chair of ICANN for many years.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.240]   It's currently vice president and internet evangelist at Google.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.640]   And it was just really great to talk to him.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.600]   And I had to say it the end.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.760]   I teared up a little bit because at the end, it's like,
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.600]   I had to say, I just want to thank you
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.760]   because the work you and Bob and others did in those days,
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.520]   not so long ago, 30, 40 years ago,
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.360]   literally changed the world.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.640]   And sometimes not, maybe books aren't as big as they used to be or whatever.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.840]   But it really did change the world.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.640]   He said one of the things that became very apparent to them.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.000]   I said, did you in the early days, did you envision what's happened now?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.760]   He said, he said, the obvious, I tried to answer, be no.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.760]   But in fact, many of us, as we started to use this thing,
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.440]   realized that it was not about technology or even computers,
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.960]   it was about communication.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.560]   And then as we started linking up people,
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.360]   the power of what was about to happen was very obvious.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.000]   I think that's the key to it, Leo.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.480]   And we still, in my business and our business,
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.840]   we still see the internet in media terms as content and as publications and pages
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.240]   and things like that.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.680]   And that's not what it's about at all.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.720]   It's a connection machine.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.640]   That's the essential architecture of the net.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.600]   That's what it enables.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.640]   That interview will be out on a Twitch special.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.240]   And there's also a hand-
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.960]   It's already up on YouTube.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.320]   Yes, it will be instantly on YouTube because it was a YouTube Google Hangout.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.800]   You know, we've actually created a Twitch Google Hangouts channel.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.400]   You finally got to make Jeff.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.360]   And let's hang up, Chad.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.560]   I'll go back to my article.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.320]   I'm surrounded by Google+ fanatics.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.360]   That is a great technology, speaking of community.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.080]   It really is.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.680]   Especially Hangouts on Air.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.080]   If you think about what you can do with Hangouts on Air
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.920]   and compare it to five years ago,
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.080]   what it would take to do a live global broadcast in real time,
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.760]   capable of having an audience of hundreds of thousands of people,
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.680]   you'd need a truck and a license and a big van with the satellite dish.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.680]   It's astonishing.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.240]   Leo, if you started Quit Today, what would your technology choices be?
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.040]   Well, we're pretty much what we do now because we continually evolve
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.560]   as technology improves.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.320]   When we started doing the screensavers on Tech TV in 1998,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.240]   even then we wanted to have video calls on the show.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:44.880]   We actually got three comm to give us, I think, 10,000 of those little ball cameras.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.320]   And we called it the-- it was then ZDTV Netcam Network.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.160]   I said they wanted to call them webcams.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.880]   This is not the web.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.360]   You can't call it.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.240]   It's a Netcam.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.440]   You'll lost that one.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.240]   Well, I've lost them all.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.240]   NetCazz, Netcam, I can't win.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.680]   But I think, strictly speaking, it isn't a webcam.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:11.280]   And then it was such a primitive technology that we couldn't really get audio and video.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.200]   So we'd say, do the video and then be on the phone.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.680]   So all of our callers on the show were on a phone.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.360]   And then the video was one frame a second.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.040]   So you didn't lose lip sync as there was.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.640]   You could barely see their mouth move.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.920]   But it worked.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:28.240]   And then so as that was what, almost that was 12, no 16 years ago,
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.280]   as the technology is advanced, we're using Skype.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.960]   Now, are you on Hangouts or--
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.000]   Are you on Skype?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.120]   Because I listened to you, boss.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.480]   Well, we'd like to get something better.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.160]   We're always testing stuff.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.840]   The engineers are always in the basement.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.120]   That's what they tell me they're doing.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.720]   The biggest limitation with doing Google+ is that as a policy is that a lot of people
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.040]   that you're going to have on the show, you say, let's do a Hangout.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.640]   And then they're like, OK, so where is it?
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.160]   The interface discoverability for new users of Hangouts is not great.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.200]   And Skype is-- everybody understands it at this point.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.400]   So that's the only way.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.160]   That's a really, really good point because it's so ingrained and built into
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.440]   plus and mail and stuff.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.000]   But they almost should just make a Hangout thing just for people to get into it and understand it.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.560]   That's--
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.960]   The future really is WebRTC.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.920]   And this is actually related to Hangouts.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.560]   And I suspect that in a year or two, that's what we'll be using.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.440]   And the neat thing about WebRTC, which Google has been supporting,
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:27.920]   I don't know.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.560]   They didn't create it.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.040]   It's open.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.440]   But I think that they've really been the chief proponents of it,
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.560]   is that I could give you a website, a URL, and you'd go to it.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.480]   And the communication would call would be a suggestion.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.520]   Well, we did it on the show.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:41.760]   Right?
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.000]   If it was--
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.760]   --it was not easy.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   It was not easy.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.600]   Well, somebody wrote us an app for it.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.720]   That's the way it should be.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.160]   That is a webcam.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.960]   That's the web-- yeah, that's a webcast.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.560]   Actually, it's not really using the web, just the web for the--
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.280]   All right, all right.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:55.760]   All right.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:01.040]   But that, I think, is exciting because then any link can be a call.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.360]   You send people the link.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.240]   And that's done.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.160]   And remember Kevin Marks has been talking a lot on the last couple of episodes
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.600]   about Tontec, Sellec, and what he's doing to kind of create this,
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.400]   you know, mobile page that allows you to just press a button and call somebody.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.440]   It should be easier.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:19.840]   Yes.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.600]   You know, and so I think we're getting close to that.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.400]   But let's talk about--
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.360]   Tolls, a little struck.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:25.680]   Go ahead.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.200]   Last week when I was late for the show.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.320]   And before you got on air--
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.280]   That was amazing.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:31.600]   See it.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.800]   I got a call.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:38.880]   I got the call from Chad, and I was in the car, and my phone is installed on the dash.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.480]   And I hit answer, and there I am driving the car.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.840]   I said, I'm driving a hurry, and I'm hurrying.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.080]   But it's that easy to be talking to somebody.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.320]   From that mind-boggling.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.600]   It is.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.160]   Really is.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.040]   At 1965, and we're going to the New York World's Fair in AT&T,
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.400]   showed his famous video phone.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.600]   And on the future--
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:11:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.880]   Remember, in 2001, the future, we'll all be seeing each other in phone calls.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.120]   And then it didn't happen, didn't happen, because everybody said, you know,
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.800]   you don't want to see anybody in a phone call, because--
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.480]   And we want to start brushing here for a phone call.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.560]   And yeah, we see a lot of video calls all of a sudden.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.600]   Everybody's doing it all the time.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.480]   We do it all the time.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.160]   Um, I think we've made Skype work for us.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.840]   Wouldn't have a network without Skype, but there's going to be something to replace it soon.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.160]   I don't know.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:27.840]   To yesterday, 10 years ago, boy was at a revolution, and Harry McCracken,
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.680]   great job on Time Magazine's Technologizer site.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.040]   The 10th anniversary of Gmail, and he has the inside store with Paul Boohite,
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:43.040]   the architect, and others from Google talking about it, it was a near thing.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.360]   Almost didn't happen.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.320]   Folks at Google thought, well, we're really a search engine company.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.560]   I don't know about this email thing.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.760]   In fact, even when it launched, you remember how hard it was to get an invite?
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.240]   There were people.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.360]   I think Harry says in his article he bought and he invited on eBay.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.200]   There's a picture of Paul Boohite when he was first at Google.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.240]   He was employee number 23 at Google, then went off to start Friend Feed.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.600]   Who can forget?
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.480]   Which I loved.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.520]   Three of the Google Gmail folks went and--
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.880]   You and three other friends.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.000]   It was just me and my friends.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.880]   That was Friend Feed.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.400]   I loved Friend Feed.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.200]   Facebook bought it.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.960]   Yeah, and then the rest is history.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.160]   Swallowed it, digested it.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.800]   But there was so little support at Google that even when they launched it,
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:38.400]   it was running on 300 Pentium II computers that nobody else at Google wanted.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.680]   That's one of the things you learn about how Google works.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:49.040]   Everybody's jockeying for compute resources, and it's this big who gets what and where they
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:49.680]   move it around.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:55.840]   Google historically has always made huge use of old and busted and lousy computers.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.560]   They don't care how broken down and busted the computers are because one of their early
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.520]   innovations was to be able to use computers that fail with two digit percentages.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.760]   And so that was pretty interesting.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.480]   Failover.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.120]   I choose Pentium III computers, I apologize.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.600]   But one of the interesting things about this is that, of course,
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.200]   this launched on April Fool's Day, they did it on purpose.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.480]   This is something I didn't know.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.240]   Google did this on purpose, and Larry and Sergey actually wanted to launch it on April Fool's
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.840]   because they knew people would think it was a hoax.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.160]   And they thought, this is like a double April Fool's joke.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.400]   Sergey was the most excited about it, said Rakeshki.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.880]   The ultimate April Fool's joke was to launch something kind of crazy on April 1st and have
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.400]   it still exist on April 2nd.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.880]   And the craziest thing about it was it was a gigabyte of storage, which nowadays,
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.720]   even that was an automatic.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.960]   As Harry points out in his article, that was something like 300 times the amount of space Yahoo
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.680]   Mail offered.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.240]   Yahoo Mail existed, Hot Mail existed.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.320]   So it wasn't the first web-based email.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.120]   That was where the points Vint made about MCI Mail.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.320]   As soon as Mail became interconnected, charging for Mail went out the window.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:02.720]   He's talked about that.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.520]   I talked about that with him.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:08.160]   He was in his old office at MCI where he had invented MCI.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.840]   So that was kind of interesting.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.880]   I had an MCI Mail account.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.280]   I remember that.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:11.840]   That was pretty cool.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.600]   Oh, so the other thing that was interesting about this is that everybody,
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.600]   when you tell the story of Gmail, everybody says, "Oh, this is a 20% time project."
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.880]   And in fact, it wasn't.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.280]   This guy worked on it full-time for three years, more or less by himself.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.120]   He got help here and there, but it was essentially this single guy working on it.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.600]   And he had this personal, and again, this is a great story by Harry McCracken,
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.000]   who uncovers all this stuff very nicely.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.480]   But he has this obsession with making sure that whatever he's using is functional.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.120]   So after one day, he had a functional, essentially a search engine for email.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.520]   He said from him personally, but I think this is more than just Paul Bouche.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.200]   He said, "I find I lose interest in project if I can't use it right away."
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.560]   So my first goal is to immediately make something I can use,
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.480]   and then iterate on it to make it useful.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:04.960]   We're so used to good search from Google that you have to pause and realize how much
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.400]   bad search is out there.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.760]   Even today, the app just looked for something on the app store in Apple.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.480]   Forget about it.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.840]   Or, I mean, it's impossible.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.080]   Right.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.160]   I always think search has been solved.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.920]   Clearly not.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.840]   But this is the great thing about Gmail.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.840]   It's also the great thing about Google+, which is everything on Google+,
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.560]   everything in Gmail is essentially a search.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:33.840]   When you look at your inbox, you're looking at a search result that is set up for you by Google.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.000]   It's everything with certain attributes.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.920]   And that's how they go at these things, and it's brilliant.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.560]   And this is one of the reasons why Google's products like Gmail are so good,
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.040]   because they're rooted in search.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:51.040]   Well, the key to that, Mike, is it was really revolutionary to think that you didn't kill your email.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.440]   Save it.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.000]   No, you want to keep your email because you can search it,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.080]   and you don't need to put it in all kinds of folders and stuff,
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.840]   because you can just search it.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.280]   And so it really took search out of just the web into your life.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.000]   As I remember, that was one of the selling points.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.280]   Don't delete any email.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.120]   Just save it all, and we'll find it.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.280]   And that was a revelation, although,
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.200]   now how much how is it?
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.040]   Seven gigabytes, eight gigabytes, you get three.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.560]   Now they combine it with Google Drive, and so I have way over 100 gigabytes.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:20.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.760]   I have one terabytes.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.560]   I have one terabytes.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.480]   Yeah, because we both have six.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:24.880]   We both have six.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.520]   We both have one gigabytes.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.040]   One point, or one terabytes.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.400]   Another thing that time notes, Harry, I should really give Harry credit.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.840]   Harry McCracken notes in the time article is this is probably, for most of us,
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.440]   the first time we ever used a web app.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:46.160]   Unlike Yahoo, Hotmail, and other web pages, this was an interactive app.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.880]   In fact, really the debut of Ajax to the worldwide web.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.680]   Now I said this on Sunday, and somebody said, you know,
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.080]   Microsoft invented Ajax with an active X control.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.040]   I'm not talking an active X control.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.840]   This is the first web app most of us used that you could use on a Windows machine,
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.280]   a Mac, on a Linux machine.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.240]   It would work if you had a good modern browser that it wouldn't rewrite the whole
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.640]   page when you opened the compose window.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.440]   That was where Ajax came.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.160]   And of course, most users had no idea about that.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.320]   All they knew was that when you used Gmail, you know, 10 years ago, 8 years ago,
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.760]   since it's beginning, lightning fast, and just felt so good to use.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.080]   Because everything you did was really zippy, and it was really kind of thrilling to use.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.840]   And I think that most users assumed that it was because they had almost no interface.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.960]   It was all text and links with no typography.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.280]   Nowadays, Google's very good with the design.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.760]   In the early days, there was a spectacular absence of design of any kind.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:55.600]   And it was kind of nerdy for that reason, but the performance was so good that everybody loved it.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.040]   Or not everybody, but you know, nerdy types did.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.400]   The Kraken quotes Bucheit saying, "The ambitious use of JavaScript is another thing
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.880]   most people thought was a pretty bad idea."
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.960]   One of the problems we had was that web browsers weren't very good back then.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.400]   We were afraid we'd crash browsers and nobody would ever come back.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.880]   Just now, here's the big story.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.520]   There were debates within Google whether it should be a paid service.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.480]   And Bucheit and others, according to McCracken, wanted the service to reach as many people as
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.400]   possible, which was an argument for it being free and supported by advertising.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.280]   They wanted little unobtrusive text ads with Google search results.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.680]   Rokowski says, "We weren't going to plaster it with banners.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.920]   We committed to that from pretty early on."
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:51.600]   But the key was that the ads were keyed to the contents of your email.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:57.040]   And I was curious as to whether they knew what a
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.680]   explosive thing that would be...
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.840]   Bucheit says in this interview, I'm not sure if America is a Harriq.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.760]   "We thought it pretty hard before doing what we did.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.320]   We thought, is this thing a perceived privacy violation or a real one?
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.360]   And we decided it would be an issue of perception."
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.280]   So they think they knew that there would be an issue.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.840]   But they also knew that it wasn't a privacy violation because it was just automated.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.360]   Boy, they underestimated the reaction of the internet.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.520]   They underestimated the action of that.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.920]   But the funny thing is, and I've told the story before,
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.080]   when priority inbox came in.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.200]   Because all they were doing in reading the email was giving you ads.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.880]   And the truth is, I don't know how much they make from that.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.400]   I mean, I don't even notice the ads on Gmail.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.520]   No, I don't see them.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.400]   Never get that one.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:48.560]   Priority inbox makes some really critical decisions, obviously,
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.960]   understanding your email and who's important.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.240]   How many mentions that?
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.200]   Do you have any mention of that?
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.720]   Because the value was so great.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:00.720]   Well, in Germany, Google's own programming staff in Munich is a privacy programming staff.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.200]   And they've taken the brunt of everything about street view and buzz and all this stuff.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.920]   They said nobody complains even in Germany about priority inbox because it's valuable.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.480]   I disagree.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.600]   I think they don't complain because it's not to support advertising.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:19.200]   I mean, everybody understands that if you have anti-spam filtering on your service,
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.120]   as everybody does, mostly not as effective as Gmail.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.040]   But that means that something is reading your mail looking for keywords.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.480]   So people know that.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.880]   What they didn't like was that it was tied to advertising, Jeff.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.720]   I don't think it's well.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.920]   Well, yeah, yeah.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.240]   Okay.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.280]   I mean, I think that's a really good point in terms of how it ratchets it up.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.360]   But I know Leo, I also hear just this general complaint that
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.560]   Facebook knows too much.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.920]   Of course, you tell them.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.120]   They know everything.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.520]   They just know too much.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.800]   They're too big and they know too much.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.200]   So I hear that kind of generalized, yourish behavior a lot.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.440]   I don't think it's because it's tied to advertising.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.720]   I mean, spam filtering is a clear benefit where it's worth--
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.240]   It's the stuff of the benefit.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:07.920]   The reason is because you look in your people who notice the ads, unlike you two who don't
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:14.800]   notice the ads, you notice that you have in this conversation about snip hunting.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.120]   And then you have an ad there for snip hunting rifle.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.720]   And it's like, oh my god, they're tuning into our conversation.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.160]   It's the creeps that hurt.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.280]   And really, this goes back to search.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.680]   The way Google looks at it is that they have this huge advertising inventory.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.200]   And then they use the content of your message as the search query.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.200]   And they surface the most relevant search results within their inventory.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.160]   That's the way they look at it.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:40.640]   And they see that--
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.360]   That's the search.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.800]   They see that that's their job.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.720]   If they're going to serve up ads, they want to serve up the most relevant ads possible.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.480]   And it's a brilliant idea.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.800]   And it shouldn't freak us out and no longer does, by the way.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.320]   We've all gotten used to it and we've all gone on to be worried about much bigger things.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.560]   But it shouldn't freak us out because no human being is actually seeing this.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.600]   Here's another strategy for Mike that I think that these services could give us
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.280]   more value, but they're scared of doing this.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.880]   I talked to a journalist the other day who was calling me about a story about privacy.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.800]   And he told me that he has MS.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.880]   And on Facebook, it just private messages.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.080]   He was telling family, boy, you know, I have these weird symptoms.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:22.720]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.600]   I can't feel my hands.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.080]   I can't do this.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.040]   I can't do that.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.200]   And then suddenly up came ads related to local sclerosis.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.480]   It basically diagnosed him.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.440]   Wow.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.560]   That's kind of creepy.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.960]   Well, you look for your first reaction right here.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.760]   And problematic if they then inform and ensure.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.960]   Well, he's the actual problem with it was that they were for,
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.520]   for grapefruit cures and bad stuff.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:54.800]   But the larger point here is that in your communication, there's things about you that
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.840]   you don't know that a smart algorithm could discern that could be of value to you.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.120]   If it's your choice to turn that on.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:09.680]   And I think that the Googles of the world have to find ways to find these kinds of
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:15.440]   individual benefits and give people control over them so that it's not just in Google's
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.680]   benefit in their view that it's in people's benefit.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.800]   But you're going to have a real, you're going to have exactly what Leo's reaction was,
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.480]   which is the, you know, it's creepy.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:30.000]   The response from the world was quick and very angry.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.400]   Remember this came out April 1, 2004 on April 6, 31 organizations and advocates
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.440]   and cosign a letter to Larry Page and Sergey Brin raising a gaggle of concerns about Gmail
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:47.840]   calling it a bad precedent and asking the service be suspended until their concerns could be addressed.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.480]   This is the quote, scanning personal communications and the way Google is proposing
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.600]   is letting the proverbial genie out of the bottle.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:01.600]   California State Senator Liz Figueroa sent Google a letter calling it a disaster of enormous
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.240]   proportions for yourself and all of your customers.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:09.520]   And then went on to draft a bill requiring any company that wanted to scan an email message
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.360]   for advertising purposes, get the consent of the person who sent it.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.520]   And so let's now look back, folks.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.920]   Yes, Armageddon was torture.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.760]   Was 2005 was absolute torture.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.200]   There was no privacy in the world.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.480]   Everything fell apart.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.440]   Oh my God.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.360]   Everyone was wanting naked through the streets.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.800]   Oh, nothing happened.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.840]   It was okay.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.720]   It was fine.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.240]   We figure it out.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:35.920]   If Google had screwed everyone and done something horrible, they would have lost business.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.040]   They're too smart for that.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.440]   And it's the same guy who proposed don't be evil.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:45.440]   Do you think that people widely know that Gmail scans your mail?
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.240]   That's pretty well known.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.120]   Is it not?
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:47.840]   I think it's pretty well known.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.600]   But you know, I was just looking through some mail.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.440]   I'm hard to find it very hard to find an email that of mine that has any ad on it.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.680]   Yeah, mine tend to not have ads.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.880]   And I wonder about that.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.080]   I think they back down, frankly, a little bit, not completely, but a little bit.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.600]   But I don't think there's much more market for it.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.720]   I think that's the real issue.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.760]   I don't think they have to be...
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.480]   Advertisers have to want it for it to be.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.000]   I was wondering...
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.400]   The point is that 425 million people actively use Gmail now.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.600]   Almost half a billion people actively use Gmail.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.080]   Obviously, I mean, if you assume maybe even only 50% know about this scanning,
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.480]   obviously people have voted.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:27.600]   One of the things that Google does, the big companies like Google and Apple do for a living,
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.960]   is they build a better user.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.200]   And by that, I mean, they are trying to change our thinking and our behavior.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.240]   That's really nice, my God.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.200]   All these edging towards where we're going.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.360]   And this is a perfect example.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.320]   But I always wonder about people who complain about contextual advertising.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.840]   Advertising has a bad rap for two reasons.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:53.440]   One is that in the Mad Men days, when there were three channels on TV and television advertising
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:57.280]   was the leading type of advertising, they had to manufacture desire.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.280]   They had to tell you what you wanted because there was no way to know what you wanted.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:07.760]   And so advertising did and should get a bad reputation because they're always
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.440]   sort of trying to manipulate you into buying products you wouldn't otherwise want.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:16.480]   The other reason is that advertising tends to grow and go in new places where it hasn't been before.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:21.840]   Tattoos on people's faces, like billboards, every surface is covered with advertising.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.720]   This is bad and this is one of the reasons advertising is bad.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:30.560]   Contextual advertising in your Gmail is good because it will show you things you want.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.880]   It won't show you weight loss, creams and tampons.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.520]   It'll show you stuff that you probably really are interested in.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.280]   Now, the biggest problem with it right now is that nobody is good at it yet.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.280]   Not even Google, Facebook is terrible at it.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.480]   They show you stuff that you don't want.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.240]   They show you stuff you've already bought.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.440]   You know, it's horrible.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.680]   But the idea is a great idea.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.200]   It should get to the point where it's like, hey, every ad is like, oh, I want that.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:51.680]   Great.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.880]   There's a great price for it.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.440]   Click.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.240]   Buy it.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:54.720]   That's good.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.760]   We do buy things.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.040]   We do want things.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:03.920]   And so I think that in general, the complaints against contextual advertising is totally misplaced.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.040]   I think that's one of the good types of advertising.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:07.840]   I agree.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:13.280]   And not only that, but I know of news companies that spend a lot of effort to
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.080]   textually advertise and serve ads to you.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.840]   But don't do the same thing with content.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.480]   And I'm having-- I'm screeds about that these days.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.800]   And standard, you've heard of the show before, Google knows where I live and where I work.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.000]   My newspaper doesn't.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.640]   My newspaper gives me the same 300 to 500 pieces of content.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.080]   It gives everybody else in the world exactly the same as if I'm a member of a mass.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.920]   It needs to know me as an individual and serve me with greater relevance.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.040]   And so the skills that we bring to advertising, actually to some extent,
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.280]   we now have to bring to content.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.440]   But that's really-- I had the same conversation.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.480]   Any less hostile-- I mean, a more hostile environment on Sunday with Twit,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:56.160]   because both John C. de Vorek and Jolie O'Dell, was my colleague Angelina O'Dell.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.320]   Jolie O'Dell both feel like there's all sorts of--
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.480]   Jolie was practically crawling into a cave.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.800]   Well, she actually at one point retired from the internet, but then found out that her job as a
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.680]   managing editor at VentureBeat required the use of the internet.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.800]   So she changed her tune.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.440]   Thank goodness.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.680]   Remember it was a publisher, not VentureBeat.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.960]   The publisher said, "You know, you really gotta be on the internet."
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.760]   You do have a choice.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.880]   You don't have to use G-B.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:27.360]   You gave a really good defense of the internet to the two of them, I think, on Sunday.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.120]   I just feel like we get so much out of it.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.680]   I do want targeted ads.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:39.840]   Well, I'm inspired by you, Jeff, because you're the one who's hammered this into my brain.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.120]   You know, this is moral panic.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.200]   What might happen should the government get this or insurers get this or whatever?
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.760]   Well, that's the great example, though you just have from Harry's piece,
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.400]   is that all the cries, this is disaster.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.880]   What Gmail is doing is disastrous.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.120]   I have to pass a law to stop this right now.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.800]   I have to say, stop the entire service, because this is so terrible.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.000]   That's techno panic.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:10.640]   And the final point on this is that what a success Gmail is not merely a number of customers,
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.120]   but can you name another app that you still use basically unchanged?
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.120]   And this is the point that many of the developers made with Harry.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.040]   It's pretty much the same code for 10 years.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.880]   There's not a lot of apps like that where you just get, you know,
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.880]   yeah, it's worked and worked well for 10 years.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.680]   They built it right.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.120]   They built it to last, and it has scaled like crazy.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:38.320]   And its competitors like Hotmail have completely reintroduced totally new apps,
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.760]   totally new sites.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.600]   And this one they haven't, they haven't had to.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.600]   But at the same time, they've upgraded it for the modern world.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.360]   I like the new features, many of the new features a lot.
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:47.440]   Right.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.080]   It's still fairly ugly.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.880]   Harry was singing the praises of it, and I've always thought it was
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.040]   too many buttons, too difficult to use.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.000]   I never really quite understood why they called them filters, not folders.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.240]   But that's that search mentality.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.480]   This isn't a search, not a folder.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:13.920]   Speaking of filters, I can't leave Gmail now, because I have so many filters holding back
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.960]   the ocean of spam.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:22.480]   If I were to ever go without those filters, I just couldn't function.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.640]   Well, and the other thing that they've done really well is, of all the email services,
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.000]   I use the only one that really stops the ocean of spam.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.560]   Yep. And they've really nailed that.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.880]   Anything with Dr. Oz in it gets through, though.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.840]   I don't know why.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.280]   They think you like him.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.880]   I think the world is trying to tell me I need to lose weight or something,
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.840]   because I get a weight loss.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:45.360]   We talked on the Change Log last week about the new promotions tab,
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.520]   and I applied, then I finally got it.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.200]   This is what it looks like now.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.000]   Remember, if you use the primary mailbox, and by the way,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.760]   the priority mailbox didn't work quite well for me,
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.360]   but these tabs, social updates, and forums.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.360]   I never did them, and so I forgot to--
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.160]   I like them.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.360]   And now this is promotions.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.080]   I don't even know.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.760]   It turns-- oh, it's a setting.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.680]   It turns the promotional emails, all of which--
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.880]   these are not spam because there's newsletters.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.960]   I said, OK, two, things like that.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.880]   Turns them into kind of a Pinterest-y magazine layout,
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.920]   which makes them a lot easier to scan.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.960]   Yes, I know they're, for the most part,
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.320]   bacon, which is spam I signed up for.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:28.800]   Sure.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.400]   But I can go through it quickly.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.680]   It doesn't bother me as much.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.400]   And the fact that it's not in my primary inbox
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.520]   really solves a problem for me.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.560]   I think this Gmail's gotten better and better and better.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.520]   Jeff, it's the gear icon, and then choose Configure Inbox.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.360]   I tried the tab--
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.400]   You don't like it.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.360]   Neither of you are using that.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.080]   I don't like it.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.080]   I tried it for-- I really tried hard to like it.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.200]   You use it, Jet, either.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.000]   I love it.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:50.560]   Yeah, me too.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.120]   It's the only way that I can manage my inbox because--
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.040]   If it gets to primary, it's almost always a person.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.400]   Primary, a person.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.960]   Right. And if it goes by accident to one of the others,
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.320]   I just make it primary.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.720]   And then it really-- and vice versa.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.280]   And it really-- I have a lot of filters.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.960]   As you see, I have a lot of folders.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.360]   I actually usually use a desktop client,
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.280]   Apple's Mail client to read this,
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.960]   because I fetch it from Gmail.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.720]   So it has its own rules and folders.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.520]   But this works.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:21.040]   In fact, frankly, when I need to see what's in my inbox quickly,
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.800]   I don't go to my Apple Mail.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.600]   I go to this.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.280]   I go to the interface on the web.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.080]   I'm a former fan of getting things done, the book.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.440]   Yes, former.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.280]   Well, I veered so far away from the whatever.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.880]   But I use my inbox as my one trusted place
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:37.840]   where I put things.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.400]   And so I want one trusted place for everything.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.080]   I don't want three or whatever.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.720]   So I just use-- I don't want promotions.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.640]   I don't want the things that are in the other tabs.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.320]   I don't want them to ever come in.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.760]   Well, that bugs me.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.360]   Maybe I'm anal retentive or something.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.960]   But it bugs me to know that they're there.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.280]   I want them to not be there.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.560]   I want-- you know what I mean?
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:55.920]   It's--
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.000]   Oh, I'm confused.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.200]   And I'm also a zero inbox.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.920]   Oh, we've ruined Jeff's mail now.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.840]   Yes, you have.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:01.600]   Oh, I did it.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.240]   Now my priority inbox is gone.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.600]   Now I don't have the important and everything else.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.280]   Oh, no, it doesn't do priority inbox.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.120]   It does primary--
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.120]   Oh, screw that.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:08.640]   --estit.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.280]   Oh, screw that.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:09.840]   That's off.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.280]   I hope you could turn it back off.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.000]   Look at the benefit.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.200]   You don't have to any priority inbox email to worry about.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.240]   They've deprecated priority inbox.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.320]   Just don't worry about it.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.320]   Oh, it's going to be OK.
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:19.880]   Oh, no.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.720]   It's gone.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.040]   Is it gone?
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.400]   I can't get it back.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.480]   You can get your priority inbox back.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.480]   Yeah, all you have to do is hover over your inbox.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:33.280]   And then on the right side, there's a drop down.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.560]   And just choose priority inbox at the bottom.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.600]   There it is.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.040]   I see it.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:37.880]   You could show mine, Chad.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:38.400]   That's OK.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.480]   Chad, you saved my life.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.440]   You're welcome.
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.040]   Inbox type.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.960]   And then it says, try them all.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.160]   Keep what fits so you can have default, which
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.480]   is what I'm using.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.520]   Important first.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.320]   See, I don't want--
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.480]   I want a chronological order.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.160]   Me too.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.160]   Unread first, starred first, or Jeff's
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.040]   a Katka priority inbox.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.680]   Priority inbox is the--
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.640]   I think beyond spam, priority inbox is the brilliant thing.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.880]   It's the misrate.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.920]   But I look down at everything else.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.640]   The things that I ever want in there are nil.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.640]   And it's not just bacon.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.160]   It's stuff I don't-- people I don't pay attention to.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.240]   Right.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.160]   I use this star feature of the starting email.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.680]   And I have filters that automatically start
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.120]   certain things to determine what goes into Google Glass
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.040]   and what doesn't.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.480]   That's all I use it for.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.960]   Or you are the super user.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:27.440]   Yes.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.200]   Oh, why?
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:28.920]   Yes.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.200]   Glass hole number one right here.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.920]   Unfortunately, you can't combine the tab
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.520]   interface with the priority inbox.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.640]   Yeah, because priority inbox is the lifesaver for me.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.200]   Anything that does that--
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.240]   It's funny to you you say that because I could never
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:45.160]   get behind it because I was so afraid that it would use
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.640]   what your-- an algorithm that would miss something.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.280]   And that's why I love the tabs.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.280]   Do it for-- no, no, I'm telling you.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.200]   Do it for a week and you will be amazed.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.400]   You don't do it.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.880]   I didn't do-- I mean, the moment that an email from my
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.000]   grandmother is sent to Away because it's a check--
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.920]   It'll catch me everything else.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.560]   No, no, just check to everything else.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.920]   But that's an extra step.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.840]   If it's in the tabs at the top--
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.920]   This works perfectly.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.360]   Yes.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.120]   So Twitter goes to social, YouTube goes to social.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.080]   Promotion is bacon.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.240]   Update is exactly what I expected.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.560]   I'm totally in Leo's camp.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.640]   I feel like these are two different products for two
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.040]   different types of people.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.600]   And me and Leo are one type and you and--
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.240]   This is-- Mike Elgin or another.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.200]   Leo's an old fart.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.600]   Don't be a young fart.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.680]   That's what I am.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.280]   It's like Chad and I are the young farts.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.240]   You guys are the old farts.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.320]   I'm telling you, I trust the algorithm more.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.080]   I trust the algorithm priority inbox.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.440]   This is a better algorithm.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.760]   Well, I mean, I don't think it's an algorithm.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.280]   All it's doing is categorizing and you're never
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.480]   going to miss anything because it's still going into the
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:46.960]   folder.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.320]   I don't trust algorithms.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.840]   That's why I like Twitter over Facebook is I followed people
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.760]   because I want to see what they write.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.520]   I don't want Facebook to do its stupid Facebook algorithm.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.480]   This old fart likes the new way.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.480]   I'm just telling you.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:00.960]   Good.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.840]   I'm using the new fart filter.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.080]   And it takes care of everything for me.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.400]   We're going to take a break.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.920]   Mike Elgin is here, ably filling in for a Gina
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:13.000]   Trepani who has the day off.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.480]   And Jeff Jarvis as well, we're talking about Google,
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.920]   Facebook, the cloud, and more.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.200]   Lots more to talk about.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.040]   No change log though because without Gina,
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.280]   it wouldn't be a change log.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.480]   So we'll just have to leave that for next week.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:27.920]   Our show today is brought to you by 99 designs.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.760]   Actually, that's such a bad name because there's so many
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.120]   more than 99 designs.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.800]   It's an unlimited number of designs.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.440]   Look, the world deserves to be a better looking place.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:40.320]   And if you're a restaurateur or you're a plumber or you're
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:46.120]   a web designer or other website guy or an app guy, a gal,
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.440]   don't do your own design.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.800]   Just a tip.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.840]   So many people think they can both cook and design,
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.440]   program and design.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.080]   Designers, it's a different breed.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.160]   They're not really human.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.640]   They're a new species.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.320]   They have aesthetic sense.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.600]   They could tell mauve from purple.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.520]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.440]   They use macotoches.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.240]   They use macotoches.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.520]   They know what curding is.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.680]   Why theory, Leo, is there is no such thing as mauve?
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.440]   It is a color made up by women to fool.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.000]   That's why you should not do your own design.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Right there!
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Right there!
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.440]   You look like I need more protection.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.600]   A 99 design.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.760]   If you don't know what curding is, don't do it.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.640]   And you should go to 99 designs.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.480]   There's a designer waiting to help you.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:34.920]   Actually, there's 291,742 designers there waiting to help you.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.800]   The way it works, you put up a design contest.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.720]   That is, you say, hey, look, I need a menu.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.960]   You say something about what you do, what you're looking for.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.200]   Then designers will submit ideas to you.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:50.240]   You go through them, you've refined them, you pick the one you want, and you pay often
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.800]   very affordable prices, low as $199.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:59.360]   Right now, if you go to 99designs.com, you'll see there are 2,280 open contests.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.800]   They have paid out, and sometimes people say, well, come on, does anybody get paid?
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.840]   They've paid out $2.2 million last month.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.600]   Last month to designers.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.960]   So designers, this is a great way for designers to get work and a great way for you to get
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.960]   a great design.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.000]   This is how we did our Twitt hoodies.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   We've been doing a lot of stuff at 99designs.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.600]   In fact, we got so many great designs for the Twitt hoodie.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.960]   We bought five of them.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:21.960]   We made the hoodie.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.960]   We're going to make some t-shirts and other things.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.800]   Wouldn't it be great if you could start your next design project right now, have dozens
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:31.800]   of designers to choose from in just a few days, selection, speed, creativity, just a
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.320]   few of the benefits of having these designers work on your project.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.560]   When you launch a design contest, you'll get lots of ideas.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.560]   You'll give the designers feedback.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.240]   You end up with a perfect design.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:45.720]   Within a week, the process is fun, fast, and 100% satisfaction guaranteed.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.160]   So do me a favor.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:53.840]   Go to 99designs.com/twig and get a $99 power pack of services free.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.600]   A power pack gives you more design and time and attention on your contest.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.800]   They will bold and highlight and feature your design project in their marketplace.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.320]   You'll get nearly twice as many submissions.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:09.960]   And that's all for free because you went to 99designs.com/twig.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.600]   Don't.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.400]   Don't current it yourself.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.120]   I'm a professional to it.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.240]   You wouldn't do your own open-heart surgery.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.240]   Why would you do your own design?
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.240]   I can't wait for the font, sir.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.240]   I can't wait for the font.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:24.960]   I'm getting a step away from the font.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:31.680]   It's really, I have such respect for designers because they have just some sense that I just
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.960]   don't have that gene.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:39.320]   I heard something amazing yesterday at lunch that IBM is hiring 200 designers a year.
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.320]   Wow.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:44.360]   That the belief is the technology is going to get easier and easier and easier and all
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.800]   those yes to praise.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.000]   But experience and design, design broadly defined as texture and such.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.760]   I think it's very, very important.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.520]   And young students should be learning more design.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.520]   It's unfortunate.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:02.920]   And somebody like Steve Gibson, an old timer like Steve Gibson will say this.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.400]   He hand codes his stuff for its tight, its fast, it's small.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.960]   He writes an assembler.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:12.920]   The problem is that programming has become a little bit more of a hack profession because
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.400]   you just throw more power at it.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.000]   Oh, don't worry about it.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.200]   There's plenty of memory, plenty of power.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:25.600]   And so programming is not the tight craft and art that it was, but design still is.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.600]   So and UI still is.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.600]   You know, that stuff still is.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.240]   So I mean, I'm going to get in trouble.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.560]   I'm going to get some nasty emails from programmers.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.560]   But there are plenty.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.760]   I remember back in the day, I used to work on these things called Coyote terminals.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:42.120]   I remember somebody called SII, way back in the newspaper days.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:47.680]   And what a huge deal it was when somebody wrote H&J, hyphenation justification, to fit
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.320]   inside a terminal.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.680]   This was just beyond belief.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.480]   Genius to be able to, it was like high-coup to get that in there so that you can decide
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.400]   where to put the hyphen in a word.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.400]   Wow.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.320]   We were looking at, where was that?
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.320]   Was that Mac Berkeley?
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.040]   Was his original schematics and designs for the floppy drive?
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.040]   Oh man.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.040]   I missed.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:13.280]   He was it because in those days, every chip, you know, meant it was huge.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.320]   And he was so proud of the fact that he got the entire design into one, I guess it was
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.320]   with Gibson.
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.320]   Gibson, yeah.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.320]   Gibson was talking about that.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.320]   Just amazing.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.080]   So what happens, we should have Gina here for this, when code becomes, when space isn't
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.840]   an issue and code becomes voluminous, is there an issue to that?
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:33.320]   Is it all just become, you see like my house?
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:39.640]   You know, I would guess that half the security issues we see that they come from that poor
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:40.960]   programming.
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:46.480]   Something as simple as using, when you're copying a string into memory, using stir-copy
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:53.040]   instead of stir-end copy, where you don't check the size of the string.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.880]   Sloppy programming or the assumption that, well, we don't need to worry because we got
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.800]   lots of RAM.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.120]   That's where you get these buffer overflows that are a huge problem.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.720]   So yes, sloppy programming leads to bad security.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.720]   Absolutely.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.120]   Just look at go to fail.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.080]   That's all you have to look at.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:14.320]   One other thing Google has added, but not to Gmail on the desktop, but Gmail for Android,
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:19.680]   apparently, according to Engadget, they're considering allowing you to snooze and pin
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.680]   messages.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.880]   I love that.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.280]   I need to snooze messages.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.280]   I do it.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.760]   I use something called follow-up then.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.360]   Have you ever heard that?
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.360]   Yes.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:33.760]   It's a very simple way to make things go away and then come back later.
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.680]   It would be nice to just be able to do it in the app.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.880]   I'd like to see this on the desktop, too.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:43.680]   According to geek.com, Google's testing an army of new features for Gmail.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.680]   They always do.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.680]   That's why I always look in the labs to see what's there.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.160]   Pending would make it sticky, right, so it would never go away.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.160]   What's snoozing?
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.360]   I don't get snoozing.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:55.520]   Just something comes in you want to deal with it after tomorrow, so you just basically
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.440]   say go away for two days and then it comes back in your inbox.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.840]   It doesn't stay in your inbox.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.320]   It reappears in your inbox.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.320]   Right.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.320]   I would assume that that's what it is.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.320]   That's not close to me.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.600]   I've got a problem here, Mike.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.760]   When it rolls off the screen, I'm screwed.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.760]   Right.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:11.760]   If I don't deal with it.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.760]   You'd love snoozing.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.040]   I think I would.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.600]   But then what's going to happen is I'll just, I can see it.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:21.960]   I have this picture of my mind of 3,000 emails at my window like--
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:22.960]   Zogging the window.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.960]   Let me in.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:24.960]   Let me in.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:25.960]   Right.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:26.960]   This is bad.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:27.960]   I don't know.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:28.960]   Everything's done, right?
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.600]   Is the idea that you don't, you know, so--
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.080]   Right.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.080]   You can defer it.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.560]   Here's the tyranny of email.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.960]   The tyranny of email is that the sender controls, not the recipient.
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:40.360]   Bob Wyman at Google taught me that lesson years ago.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.360]   Right.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.160]   Once the sender controls, it's screwed.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.440]   You know, you think about it, it's actually pretty rude to send somebody a message and
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.160]   expect them to respond.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.280]   Just like it would be rude to just show up out of nowhere in your front door and knock
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.480]   on the door and expect them to answer and let you in.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.480]   Does that email?
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:57.480]   That's email.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.480]   Well, we're beremmer.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.480]   I know.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.480]   That's a little more open.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:04.040]   Because remember, people didn't want the telephone in the house because it would ring
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.040]   it.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:07.880]   And you couldn't stop it.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:12.840]   So imagine a bell in your house that anyone in the world could ring at any time for free.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.840]   Actually, that's a terrible idea.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.840]   It's a terrible idea.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.840]   It's a terrible idea.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.240]   Chad, what you're saying that you sleep with your phone and answer things in the middle
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.240]   of the night?
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.240]   So what I--
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:24.480]   All good Android phones do this.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:29.960]   The Moto X has a do not disturb that you could set either for a time or when we're in a meeting
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.960]   or you could say, don't ring the phone.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.760]   I use do not disturb the HTC One.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.400]   It's not quite as elegant as the Moto X, but there's a do not disturb.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:40.960]   And I've actually written a schedule seven days a week for what times I don't want this
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:41.960]   phone to ring.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:42.960]   And some of it's when I'm sleeping.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.960]   Some of it's when I'm on the air.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.800]   How are you with the HTC versus the--?
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.360]   Because you love Moto X.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.360]   I did.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.360]   And I'm going to talk about at the end of the show.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.360]   Okay.
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:51.360]   Fun.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.560]   It'll be my pick of the week this week.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.560]   What's the latest with Turkey?
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.960]   Mike, I know you cover this on TNT every day.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.960]   It seems to be an automatically updating story.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.280]   The Prime Minister of Turkey got a little upset with social media.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.000]   He started blocking Twitter.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   So the graffiti on the walls of Turkey had Google's DNS 8.8.8.8.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.040]   So you could just basically, instead of using the officially broken Turkish DNS, use Google's.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.560]   But now that's not working anymore.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.560]   That's right.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:22.560]   What they did was-- so first they blocked Twitter, then the viral campaign.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:28.000]   Then Turkey blocked Google DNS and some of the other DNS services.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.760]   And then they did something pretty astonishing.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.200]   They spoofed it.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:37.520]   So they had the-- the actual DNS servers were in Germany and other countries.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:43.480]   They spoofed it so that at the ISP level, any attempt to go to some of the major-- you
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:48.160]   know, Google Public DNS or some of the major competitors to that would be rerouted to a
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:53.200]   fake DNS page within Turkey at the telecom level.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:59.960]   And there was-- this not only prevented people from going to YouTube and Twitter, but it
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:05.680]   also enabled them to harvest the IP addresses and so on and essentially spy on whoever it
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.520]   is was trying to use the service.
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:12.280]   So it's really an astonishing thing because this kind of thing has only been done at the
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.960]   large scale by the Chinese government, but not in this exact way.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:23.600]   This is the first use of this particular approach to spoofing it and it's called-- let me see.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.600]   It's called DNS tampering.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:30.120]   First time it's ever state-sponsored DNS tampering has ever taken place.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:36.160]   And so at this level-- in this particular way because of the way they're doing it.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.960]   And so it's really-- you know, it's the horrible thing about it.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.280]   It's really effective.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:48.320]   It's really a great idea if you're trying to control information to make-- to hijack,
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:53.320]   essentially, the thing that people are using to get around your block.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.880]   Here's a question, Mike.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:48:00.960]   So because of the graffiti, Turkey knows that 8-- everybody's going to that.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:06.160]   But they can't control every DNS or can they make every single DNS in the country go to
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.160]   their DNS?
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:12.280]   They're doing the major ones, so they've hijacked-- they're two by Google.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:15.040]   There's level 3 DNS and open DNS are the big ones.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.680]   So they're going after 80% or 90% of the usage.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:23.880]   And of course, what they're really tapping into is they're tapping into the viral information
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:27.360]   about-- people are sharing it and saying, hey, everybody go use this.
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:29.680]   And then they're tapping into that information.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.680]   And then they're going after it.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.680]   So that's just the way.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:36.720]   So what I feared when I saw the graffiti on the street saying, go to 888, that you're
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.800]   just saying to the government, OK, we know what to block.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:50.760]   Is there-- the idea that if there were an explosion of good DNSs around the world that
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:55.400]   people in Turkey can go to, does it become a game of whack-a-mole for the Turkish government
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:56.400]   then?
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.400]   It would be.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:02.000]   The problem is that they're trying to-- they're both playing it for the masses, essentially.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.080]   And the masses are going to be slow to find these more obscure services.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.000]   So it's really a question of communication.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.360]   Plus, there's a lot of censorship in Turkey anyway, over porn and things like that.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:18.080]   So they've really got quite an infrastructure to tamp down on this.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:22.320]   Now, the government itself is divided as well.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.840]   So it's really a problem.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:28.200]   And it's probably going to lighten up after their election, which I think is in a couple
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.080]   of days or something.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.400]   But this is a really ham-fisted attempt.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.880]   Once you figure out how to do this, it's tempting just to keep it up, right?
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.800]   You really want to-- that's the problem with this is the slippery.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.640]   Oh, we'll only do this till after the election.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.600]   And then, of course, they keep doing it.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:50.560]   I asked a vent surf about this specifically, and also about the move to end the US Department
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:54.280]   of Commerce's contract with ICANN.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:57.960]   This whole notion of the internet, somebody controlling the internet, says, "Control's
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.960]   a funny word.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.400]   You can't really use the word control when it comes to the internet."
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:05.640]   But what he did say is the extremities, the endpoints of the internet can be controlled
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.960]   within a nation you can control the internet.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:13.880]   Or your internet service provider can act inappropriately with regard to net neutrality.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:20.000]   But the internet itself heals itself, protects itself, is designed to not to be susceptible
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   to this kind of stuff.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.120]   So no one can-- no, Turkey can't screw up our internet, but they can screw up their
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.360]   own internet.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.360]   That's right.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:35.040]   Yeah, because the government-- the ISPs are just companies that have to function with
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.840]   permission by the government, theoretically.
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:41.840]   And China has done-- if you're going to be a connoisseur of fine authoritarian--
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:42.840]   They're good at net.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:43.840]   The great firewall of China.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.160]   They have multiple things.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.960]   They have the great firewall of China.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.840]   They really go after the intelligentsia.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:52.200]   They don't worry about the bumpkins in the countryside and so on, but they really crack
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:56.480]   down on the eastern side of the country and the southern part of the country.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.560]   They have this 50 cent army where they have just huge numbers of people out there just
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:04.520]   saying nice things about China and criticizing anybody who criticizes Chinese policy.
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:08.000]   Plus they have huge numbers of internet sensors on social media.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:16.080]   So they're censoring social media, Twitter-like sites and Facebook-like sites, painstaking,
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:21.200]   like huge numbers of people going through all these messages and just blocking and ratting
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.200]   out people.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.200]   And just it's a daily--
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.840]   On top of all of that, they have intimidation.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:26.840]   Yes.
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:31.320]   Those are all the known and seen things, even though we don't know exactly how many, but
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:36.600]   those are the explicit activities of censorship, but there is the more heinous implicit activities
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:39.400]   of censorship, which is government intimidation.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:40.400]   That's right.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:46.000]   And combined, all of that combined is what makes their control information so effective,
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   essentially.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.240]   My thought has always been this, you're going to see this in localized areas, but it also
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:58.600]   hurts the country so much in terms of-- because the internet really is about free communication.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:59.800]   It's good for a country.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.560]   That's why we want to preserve the internet.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.560]   It's good for innovation.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:03.560]   It's good for consumers.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.560]   It's good for commerce.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:08.200]   It's good for so much stuff that you only do this at your own peril.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:15.160]   So I believe ultimately that the Chinese government will back down on this because ultimately,
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.160]   it's not good for China.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.520]   China wants to be a part of the global community.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:22.000]   But the Chinese Communist Party, which controls the government, doesn't.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.880]   What they're concerned about is other political parties entering in and participating in
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.880]   their government.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.200]   And that's really the same thing in Turkey.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:35.120]   It's a political party doing this to defend itself against another political party.
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:38.360]   So you don't really have democracy in most countries.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:41.920]   You might not have it in any country, but in places like China and to a certain extent,
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:46.160]   Turkey, you have political parties who are competing with other political parties and
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.160]   using censorship.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.880]   So the party can control it.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.680]   But ultimately, it's bad for the country.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.360]   And if it's bad for the country, it's ultimately bad for the party.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.200]   And of course, you're going to have to-- you're going to have to--
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.760]   it's a totalitarian regimes.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.200]   Those aren't good for people in any respect.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.880]   But I think that the internet is a great threat to those in the long run.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:08.040]   And it's just-- I feel like it is such a democratizing power.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:11.000]   And the people always seem to get around these things.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   Well, as they're learning in Turkey, Turkey is a functioning democracy.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.840]   And the party that's doing this is just going to get hammered.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.840]   Absolutely.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:24.360]   I mean, it's just in addition to the fact that they were committing the censorship to
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:28.320]   cover up some apparent graft and so on.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:31.080]   But in China, it's a different story.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.040]   There is no alternative political party in China.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.040]   So that's a different story.
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:35.680]   However, what we're really learning--
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.040]   And there's no history of democracy.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.040]   That's right.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.400]   But what they're really learning in Turkey is you can't do this.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.400]   It doesn't work at all.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.680]   It makes you a laughing stock.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:47.440]   It brings attention to the things you're trying to hide.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:52.200]   We're sitting there on this tech show talking about a really inside baseball, Turkish political
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.200]   thing.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.200]   And that goes about this corruption.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.200]   This is a strange and effective.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.600]   We wouldn't have been talking about Turkish corruption unless they did this.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:00.000]   So this is a horrible idea.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Nexus 10 might be coming back soon, listing on the Google Play Store.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.720]   Maybe that's a mistake.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.720]   Coming soon.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:10.280]   Still says coming soon.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:13.160]   Does that mean the old Nexus 10 and they're just going to--
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:15.640]   They're out of stock.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:19.040]   It's been gone for some time.
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.960]   We've been waiting for a long time for a new Nexus 10.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.200]   And they kept the price up there.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.640]   So if they were going to come up with a new Nexus 10, then you think they would take
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:30.400]   some details out and just say coming soon.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.920]   It's a bit odd.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:35.560]   It's hard to know what it means when they say coming soon.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:36.760]   But it's got to be a new one.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.640]   It's got to be revamped.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.160]   But the specs currently are not any--
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:45.680]   Still says 13 gigs for $49.16 gigs for $399.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.720]   Five megapixel front.
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:50.480]   I mean, five megapixel main camera in one point and nine megapixel front.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:51.480]   It's funny.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:54.720]   I have zero desire for a big tablet anymore.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.280]   No, I like my Nexus 7.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.280]   Plenty good.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.280]   I'm a 7.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.280]   My 7 is--
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.280]   Yeah, it's just the right size.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.280]   Cats meow.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:05.520]   Cats meow.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:11.520]   Google normally-- in fact, I gave them a little trouble for this last year.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:15.520]   Really goes wild on April Fools.
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:18.600]   Do you think they back down a little bit that they realized it was--
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.920]   I think it's even more than that, Leo, because I hate April 1.
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:22.920]   Who does it?
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:23.920]   I just want to be April 2nd.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:24.920]   I can't stand it.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:25.920]   Yes.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:29.920]   This year, my Twitter feed had virtually nothing.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.360]   I didn't see any of the usual stuff.
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:36.360]   I just think maybe last year was the Armageddon of April 1.
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.600]   And this year, it's calmed down.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.600]   Thank God.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:39.920]   May not just be Google.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.520]   I do have to say that the Matt Conspin was cute.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.200]   What was the Matt Cuts one?
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.360]   It's a video.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:46.360]   It's a video.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.520]   All right, let's say it's a visual game.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:49.120]   It's not going to stop changing.
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:53.640]   It's a visual gag, so you probably won't--
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.080]   Or our audio listeners.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:57.040]   For our audio listeners, it's not going to be much fun.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.800]   But I'll give you the play by play.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.440]   Here's our much beloved--
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:01.680]   We have a question from Dave.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.680]   The UK.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:06.120]   Dave asks, when will you stop changing things?
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:08.800]   Look, I'm sorry, Dave, but I can't do that.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:10.600]   The web is always changing.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:13.240]   The thing that we think we need to do for users
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.120]   will always be changing.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:18.280]   And of course, spammers and their techniques are always changing.
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:19.840]   So we're always looking at the audio listeners.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.520]   What's happening is this shirt is just constantly changing.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:22.920]   It is?
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.040]   I didn't even notice.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:24.520]   Yes.
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.640]   There will always be change.
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:27.520]   Oh, it's gray.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.640]   It's a purple.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.960]   How do they do that?
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.000]   I don't know how they did it.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:31.760]   It's kind of brilliant.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:32.960]   Basically what its users are looking for.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:33.400]   That's it.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:33.720]   It's all--
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:34.560]   It's starting to do more.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.320]   It's all blather and all.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.760]   It's all blather and all about it.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.160]   I didn't even notice it.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:40.200]   It just changes colors.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.040]   That's it.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.560]   That's the gag.
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.560]   OK, that's pretty subtle.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.000]   For Google, that's very subtle.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   Let's see what else they got there.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.960]   I thought the Hasselhoff thing was great.
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:50.320]   Oh, I got huffed.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.680]   I got huffed summed.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:52.800]   I couldn't get it to happen to me.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:53.640]   I wanted it to happen to me.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:54.800]   I mean, I made a picture so what happened to me.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.880]   That was kind of the beauty of it is you can't force the huff.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.320]   And they had a huff bought.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.200]   They have a Hasselhoff bought that would--
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:05.080]   if you mentioned David Hasselhoff in a post on Google+,
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.840]   he would respond.
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:09.920]   And then I'll show you some of the things that happened to me.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.200]   Did you see the pictures?
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.760]   They-- they Hasselhoff to me?
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:14.800]   Let me see if I can find these.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.800]   It was awful.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.040]   It was awful.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:20.560]   So here's-- well, here's some obvious ones.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.640]   Let me just show you the obvious ones.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:25.200]   First, the first one that happened to me--
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.080]   what is that, Chad?
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.240]   Who's that?
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.040]   This is my only huff.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.040]   Hoss-a-huff.
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:30.960]   I got three.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:31.520]   Yeah, no.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:32.160]   So here's one.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.400]   I was testing out the HTC One camera.
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.960]   Took a picture of Jason.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:36.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:37.440]   That's pretty funny.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.520]   I thought there must be a human doing this
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:41.800]   because this is too perfect.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:45.400]   Jason's looking mournful and the haph is looking--
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.000]   like huff-ish.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:46.680]   Something.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.600]   And then-- but did notice that where it would have
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:51.760]   the Auto Awesome mentioned, it says April Fools.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:54.280]   And then this photo was created by adding David Hasselhoff
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:57.880]   to your photo, which is so random as to be hysterical.
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:00.920]   And then I got another one because I was testing this camera
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:01.440]   out a lot.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.640]   This is John Slanina.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:03.240]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.520]   This is a new one.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.280]   Yeah, it is.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.000]   This is one I hadn't seen before.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.360]   So there's new stuff because this is the one I saw earlier.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:15.000]   So they've put more Hasselhoff with the Jamer Bee.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.400]   And if the listeners and viewers
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:20.280]   want to check out what has happened to other people,
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.160]   you can go to huff-some.
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:23.240]   They hashtag huff-some.
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.240]   You'll see them all.
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:24.840]   And you'll see.
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.600]   But this one was my favorite.
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:31.600]   And I thought, my god, this has got to be a human.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:34.160]   Because you see this chest set here?
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.200]   Zoom in a little bit.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:40.000]   And you'll see Hasselhoff is peeking out
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.320]   behind one of the bishops.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:45.280]   A little tiny Hasselhoff.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.760]   I mean, he has some great algorithmic work, man.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.960]   Well, I figured it has to be algorithmic
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.800]   because these are not public photos.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.280]   So there's no way Google's going to go into my photos
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:58.960]   with some humans going to go in and modify my photos, right?
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:58:59.680]   Tell me that.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.920]   But how do they do that?
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.480]   Well, they do some amazing things
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:05.920]   with computer image recognition.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:08.040]   For example, they know the difference between a dog
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.560]   and a cat.
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:13.440]   They know the difference between a baby and a child.
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.560]   They know smiles.
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:15.320]   It smiles.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.440]   They know facial expressions.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:20.640]   So their image recognition algorithms are killer.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.160]   I will submit that this is--
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.000]   I got the best huff-some.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:25.760]   That is amazing.
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:26.760]   That is killer.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:27.840]   That blows me away.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.280]   He's exactly the same size as the chess piece.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:32.200]   And he's peeking out from behind one.
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:34.160]   How can a computer know that?
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.480]   Because a computer has to--
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:39.400]   silhouette, the chess piece.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:42.040]   And behind his hand is behind another chess piece.
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:43.200]   Right.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.560]   It layered the photo.
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:45.560]   It layered it.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:46.360]   It layered the photo.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:50.400]   In this case, it may have made what they would consider an error.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.640]   It may have thought those chess pieces were actual people.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.560]   It may have recognized them as humans.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.120]   And just thought he was putting them into a group photo.
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:59.280]   But it's brilliant the way it looks.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.400]   It's perfect.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.560]   If you were to do this by hand, it would actually be kind of hard.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.560]   I could.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:04.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:04.920]   Exactly.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.440]   Exactly.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.080]   That's right, Mike.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.440]   Wow.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.680]   Wow.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.520]   That is-- anyway.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.960]   The stuff was-- nothing was really--
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.880]   Oh, there was one more good one.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.000]   And I have to pull out my Android-- actually, I
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.200]   could show it on Google+.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.400]   That's maybe that's the best thing.
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.600]   And I wonder if it's still in here.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:25.120]   They added a new translator to Chrome.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:28.960]   So if you go to a text page in Chrome, oh, it's gone.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.120]   Oh, it was only there for one day.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.800]   How sad.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.600]   You could translate a page into emoji.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.320]   I'm glad I captured this.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:43.240]   I went to Andy and Notco's blog on the mobile.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.560]   And I translated it to emoji.
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.000]   And ah, they should have left that in.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.120]   I'm so disappointed.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.480]   And how do they do this without updating Chrome?
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.760]   I didn't get a Chrome update in either respect.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.240]   It's like magic.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.760]   These guys at Google are good.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.280]   I didn't see some of these Waze dates.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:06.400]   Waze will show you a single person ahead.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:10.400]   OK, that's another hot sum off looking out from behind people.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.280]   So maybe I'm not the only one who got that.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.400]   But are there any other chess sets with Hasselhoff on the board?
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.080]   That's a good one.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.400]   It didn't realize that that was her hand.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.600]   Oh, he's eating her hand.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.240]   He's eating her hand.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.440]   It caught the edge.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.200]   That's Hasselhoff.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:23.960]   Zombie.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.680]   Not quite.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:27.720]   Grewson.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.840]   Yeah, it didn't realize the table that--
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.480]   OK, that makes me does feel better.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.760]   You're slipping off the huff.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:34.280]   Oh, sorry.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.040]   Yeah, I didn't even realize the content.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.240]   You young people.
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.240]   You just didn't-- sorry.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.240]   --end a profanity.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:44.080]   Anyway, I thought that was pretty good.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.680]   But again, we didn't see the massive number of Google
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.480]   April Fool's jokes.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:52.800]   And I, for one, am thrilled.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.040]   And the ones they did were pretty good.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.080]   I was delighted.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.440]   Remember the toilet internet?
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.440]   I mean--
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:01:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:01.940]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:09.380]   Um-- let's see.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:09.980]   Oh, there was one.
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:14.780]   There was a Pokemon game in Maps that was kind of cool.
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:19.260]   Google is going to focus on portrait shots and effects
[01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:25.340]   by offering in a camera app for everyone on the Google store.
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:26.180]   And then you fancy it.
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:26.680]   And then you fancy it.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.060]   HDC1 people won't feel so--
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:31.420]   I'm feeling already ripped off.
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:34.020]   They're also working on raw support.
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:37.380]   This is clearly one of the big differentiates--
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:39.900]   the big battlegrounds in smartphones
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.500]   is not just the quality of the camera,
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:44.820]   but computational photography, taking the photo
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.380]   and modifying it.
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.180]   Well, they say they're going to be able to do what your new camera
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:50.980]   does without the second lens.
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.340]   They're going to understand depth.
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.900]   Actually, Nokia does that with their refocus app.
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:57.460]   And actually, it does a very good job.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.340]   We did a review on Before You Buy yesterday.
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:02.780]   Brian Burnett had the icon, the 929.
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.860]   He had a picture of raindrops on a windshield.
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:08.980]   It did actually-- I mean, arguably a better job than the HTC
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:09.700]   one.
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:10.380]   Really?
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.380]   Well, but the problem is you have to have a Windows phone
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.220]   to use it.
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:15.220]   And I don't know if I'm willing to give up everything else.
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:17.100]   Yeah, right.
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:18.940]   The important thing, though, I think
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.180]   that companies like Google are realizing
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:25.220]   that 98% of what people want from their smartphone camera
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.500]   is to take a picture, upload it to social media,
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:28.820]   and have it be like, wow.
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.260]   Just have a wow effect.
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:33.340]   Instagram, that's what Instagram realized.
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:37.220]   And Instagram isn't doing it as well as Google is doing it.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.220]   Really, Google+, they auto filters.
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:43.260]   The auto modification on Google+, is really astonishingly good.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:44.220]   It's really so good.
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:47.300]   I take all these lousy pictures with Google Glass,
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:49.020]   and I'll take multiple-- and stitch them together
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:52.180]   and do all kinds of really amazing things.
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:54.460]   The subtle improvements that it makes.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:57.380]   And hopefully, this feature of the blurring feature and so on
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:59.380]   will make it to Google+, as well.
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:01.420]   Because they have the auto backup thing.
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:04.100]   So every picture you take just goes right into Google+,
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:06.620]   you can have every picture on your laptop just go right
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:08.260]   into Google+, they'll modify it.
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:10.540]   You can undo the modification with a single click.
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:12.460]   It's really, really nice the way they do that.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:15.100]   And it's really improving photography, which is great.
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:18.340]   Because the Instagram process, Instagram
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:20.820]   wrecks your pictures, Facebook wrecks your pictures.
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:25.060]   We've done a lot of side-by-side pictures of what Facebook
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:30.420]   does to your photographs with its aggressive compression.
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:33.660]   And this is the direction we want to go in.
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.820]   Improvement of pictures, rather than denigrating them
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.940]   and making them look lower, res, and all that kind of stuff.
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:39.580]   They are smart.
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:45.140]   I mean, the combination of Google+, a great Android app,
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.300]   it's, frankly, almost so good that you don't even
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:49.940]   want to use your camera anymore.
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:51.100]   Yeah.
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:54.660]   So 4.4.3-- oh, I'm sorry.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:55.460]   That's not right.
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:55.940]   That's out.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:57.900]   It'll be, I guess, in 4.4.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:01.020]   No, the camera stuff is supposed to be a separate update
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:03.100]   from Android update.
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.860]   And do you have to have a Nexus 5, or--
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.660]   I don't know.
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:10.620]   But increasingly, they've put the Google apps on the Play Store,
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:13.500]   which is really great for those of us who don't have.
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.820]   Yeah, I mean, it'll become a default thing in 4.4.3.
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:19.420]   But in the meantime, they're going to come out with a--
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.020]   standalone app, which is great.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.540]   Awesome.
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:24.060]   We were up early this morning.
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:25.740]   It's been a long day, 8 AM.
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:26.820]   Actually, you were up early.
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.540]   I got here late.
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:31.660]   Mike Elgin and Peter Kafka from Recode
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:40.820]   watched as Amazon revealed a set top box, the Fire TV $99.
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:41.700]   It is Android.
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.500]   It looks like they didn't say the word Android,
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.940]   but it's pretty obviously Android powered.
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:45.500]   It's Android.
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:45.780]   Yeah.
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.260]   Peter Kafka said that you talked about--
[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:48.460]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.260]   Yeah, good days, just Amazon didn't say it.
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:51.740]   But of course, it's just like the Kindle.
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:54.660]   And it will have a quad-core processor.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:55.780]   They didn't name the processor.
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:57.420]   And a dedicated GPU.
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:01.420]   And that's important because unlike the Roku and the Apple TV,
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.580]   all Roku has some gaming.
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:05.260]   But this is going to be a significantly larger
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:05.940]   amount of gaming.
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:09.740]   In fact, Amazon has a game studio they've put together.
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:12.860]   It will have all of the requisite Netflix, and obviously,
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:14.700]   Amazon streaming.
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:18.060]   Hulu Plus, they mentioned Vivo.
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:18.900]   I think they mentioned.
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.300]   So it's another streaming box.
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:23.900]   And it's the same price as the Apple TV and the Roku.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:25.860]   Yes, with some benefits.
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:29.940]   One of them is that it's an Xbox-like game controller
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:30.460]   that you--
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:31.940]   For an additional $40.
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:32.660]   Yes.
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:35.380]   But to play casual and mobile-style games,
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:38.180]   as opposed to call of duty and so on.
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:41.380]   The other thing that I think is kind of a killer feature
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:44.740]   for parents is this parental kind of thing.
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:47.780]   You can sign your kids up for all you can eat content.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:48.820]   Free, isn't it?
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:50.340]   Is it free and content?
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.420]   It's a special page channel.
[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:52.420]   Yes.
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:56.340]   But then they already have it for tablets, for the Kindle
[01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:57.260]   Fire.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:59.900]   And there are parental controls and all that kind of stuff.
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:01.420]   But now they're extending it to the TV.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:03.900]   So now, if you have small children,
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:08.740]   you don't want to expose them to the horrors of TV commercials,
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.620]   you can sort of turn them loose on this.
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:11.860]   They could choose their own content.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.020]   And it's a great idea.
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:16.020]   And we don't really pay a lot of attention to this
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:18.380]   because it's like children's culture to a certain extent.
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:22.380]   But they really are hitting it hard in the same way
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:25.140]   that McDonald's did with playgrounds and Ronald
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:26.740]   McDonald and all that kind of stuff, which really
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:28.260]   the secrets are for McDonald's.
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:31.780]   Is you get small children loving your brand.
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.300]   And then it makes a lifelong--
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.060]   They're hooked.
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:34.860]   Yes.
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:36.860]   And so this is a big--
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:38.020]   And they're kind of under the radar.
[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:40.660]   Because who else is really targeting children so aggressively?
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:41.660]   Right.
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:41.980]   That's the point.
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:43.820]   Plus, there's the voice command and stuff,
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:45.500]   which I don't know if that's a gimmick or not.
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:46.900]   So a lot of things have voice command.
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.060]   I was pointing out that my television, my Samsung TV,
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.780]   has a remote control with a microphone.
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:53.860]   Of course, the Xbox One is a voice command.
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:55.300]   This is not unusual.
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:58.780]   But overall, performance is something they're touting
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:00.500]   and saying, you know, everything's zippy.
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.620]   The voice search is very fast, they say.
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:05.220]   And we'll see the reviews.
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:06.180]   And of course, you're going to hopefully--
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.260]   Here's a question about that, Mike.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:08.060]   I'll have one tomorrow.
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.060]   Yeah.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.420]   I'm just going to be here tomorrow.
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:14.020]   But I guess I'm coming in.
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:14.660]   You know what?
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:16.420]   I'll tell you what, Mike, it's coming here.
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:20.620]   If a box from Amazon arrives here to me,
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.180]   you have my permission to open it and demo it.
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:22.700]   OK.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.220]   That's for you.
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:24.020]   Great.
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:28.380]   So with any luck, we'll have it on TNT, if not on Technos tonight.
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:29.900]   Here's a question.
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:37.940]   After the Netflix-- was it Comcast deal?
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:41.980]   Were you stream to the Amazon box?
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:44.700]   Are they going to have to be paying pureeing fees?
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:45.660]   We'll make it perform well.
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:46.980]   That's a very interesting question.
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:47.700]   I mean, probably not.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:49.260]   Roku doesn't.
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:51.860]   But Netflix does and gets the benefit on Roku.
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:54.060]   Those Netflix goes to the Amazon box.
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:56.820]   Does that look to Comcast like it's Amazon or Netflix?
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:58.060]   It's Netflix.
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:59.020]   That's what I believe.
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.780]   But that's what's different about the Apple TV
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:04.140]   is that the Apple TV, Apple has its own CDN
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:08.180]   and all content in the Apple TV comes from Apple CDNs.
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.060]   I believe these-- come on.
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:12.500]   So that's very pricey for Apple.
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.180]   But it gives a much better user experience,
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:18.820]   even if you're on Comcast, prior to the deal.
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:20.940]   And Amazon-- and that brings up another thing
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:24.100]   that Amazon is doing, which is that they have a recommendation
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:24.460]   engine.
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:26.980]   So at any given time, they say, based on what you've
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:29.500]   watched so far, probably based on what the books you've
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:32.380]   ordered and things like that, here are the TV shows
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:33.220]   we think you're going to like.
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:35.460]   And it starts to download them in advance.
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.620]   So when you choose one, it just plays instantly.
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.020]   We know you're going to want to see this.
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:41.020]   And here we go.
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:42.500]   I'll tell you what you are going to want to see.
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.500]   This crazy Gary Busey.
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:47.460]   Is Gary Busey actually crazy?
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.420]   Or is he just making--
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:50.540]   I think he has a business.
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:53.540]   I believe he has some brain damage from a motorcycle accident.
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:55.380]   He does, but he's also just--
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:56.700]   Well, he's making-- hey on it.
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:58.820]   I mean, he was-- was it on to Raj where he appeared
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:01.820]   and was absolutely cray-cray?
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:04.060]   He mostly plays himself.
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:07.100]   If you're like me, you like talking to things.
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:09.100]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:13.700]   Like--
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.220]   [BEEPING]
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:16.420]   Hello, Lab.
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:18.180]   How, Gary?
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.340]   See?
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.660]   Hello, Prince.
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:27.620]   Maybe the weirdest ad a major American company has ever made.
[01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:29.260]   Thank you, fish.
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:30.260]   We're being here.
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:31.540]   What if that's really his house?
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:34.620]   It's frustrating when things don't listen, especially
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:37.900]   high-tech things.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.060]   Find Gary Busey.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:42.140]   Find Gary Busey.
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:48.740]   But this new Amazon FARC TV listens to me
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:51.660]   and does exactly what I say.
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:54.660]   Gary Busey.
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:58.580]   See you press and hold the button.
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:02.460]   Yes, Amazon FARC TV.
[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:04.140]   Well, it definitely gets your attention.
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.140]   Yep.
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:09.380]   Oh, wow.
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:10.220]   Wow.
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:13.860]   Why do they pick on Roku specifically?
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:15.580]   But that's the direct competition.
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:17.460]   I know, but it's kind of--
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:20.060]   The truth is, this is just another--
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:23.300]   it's a MeToo product.
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:24.900]   I submitted, but I think I was wrong,
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.100]   that maybe this was just Amazon saying, well,
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.940]   we've got to get the starting point
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:31.420]   so that we are equal to all these other companies,
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:34.060]   so that when the big deals come down the pipe,
[01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:37.900]   we can basically replace cable, we want to be there.
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.260]   Yeah, I think the streaming boxes
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:41.020]   are going to get much more compelling this year,
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:43.860]   and I think they're afraid that people who are using
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:46.580]   their streaming services are going to say, you know what?
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:49.300]   I don't need Amazon anymore because I get better deals
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.140]   with this other box.
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:52.340]   Now they have a box with games, and they're
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:55.500]   hitting all the high points, and a couple of vaguely unique
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:59.500]   features is enough to keep people and keep growing.
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:02.460]   They brag to the beginning of the event of how fast they've
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:03.420]   grown, and so on.
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:05.700]   And they want to keep that going, and they want to sort of hold
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.660]   off the competition, and who knows?
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:10.180]   I think the real play here, ultimately,
[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:12.300]   as we were saying on the broadcast this morning,
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:15.300]   is they want to get people using their TV to shop,
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.580]   to engage with Amazon content, to see
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:20.500]   advertisements and promotions on Amazon,
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:24.900]   to cross pollinate across the various Amazon--
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.340]   It's not a big market, I remember.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:28.860]   I mean, the total, if you include Apple TV, Roku,
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:32.500]   and all these set up boxes, well under 20 million units.
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:33.340]   How about the--
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:36.540]   And Google, which entered this market, and has left it.
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:39.060]   I mean, the Chromecast is something completely different.
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:41.220]   It's almost as if Google thought about it and said,
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:42.700]   you know what, nobody really wants this.
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:46.300]   What they want is media--
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:48.420]   Yeah, you like the Google TV, Jett.
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:50.260]   I like the Google TV, but it's dead.
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:50.940]   Yeah, I know.
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:52.820]   But it's one of the reasons I brought--
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:54.900]   I wore this shirt today is because--
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:55.420]   You knew.
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:57.140]   I knew the Amazon announcement thing.
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:00.780]   It was just like, hey, Amazon, don't forget that--
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.660]   But the Chromecast-- It's hard space.
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:04.980]   The Chromecast is a different idea,
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.020]   the idea that it's whatever's on your smartphone
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:10.100]   or your computer or your Chromebook, Jeff,
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:11.740]   can be sent to the TV.
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:13.860]   And that really, the responsibility for it
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:17.780]   lies in the device, sending it to the Chromecast.
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:21.660]   If you want voice, you do it on the device, right?
[01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:23.020]   I'm happy with Chromecast.
[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:26.340]   I don't know why I just bought the Amazon box.
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:28.540]   Oh, you bought it too, huh?
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:31.700]   I was bomoning the fact that I'd have to buy it just to review it.
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:32.300]   I don't want it.
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:32.980]   I'm canceling it.
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:38.300]   Last thing I need is another thing attached to my TV.
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:38.700]   I don't know.
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.860]   They show advantage.
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:42.540]   They certainly have the means to market the crap out of it.
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:45.580]   And I know that people will--
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:47.140]   Amazon has some real fans.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:48.140]   People love Amazon.
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.540]   They love the prime service, the shipping
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:51.820]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:55.220]   And this is a way for them to leverage that kind of fandom.
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:57.540]   You can imagine little pop-ups popping up
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.940]   and saying your package is going to arrive in the next 10 minutes.
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:01.260]   And weird stuff like that.
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:02.740]   Amazon is moving to having their own trucks.
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:04.620]   That would be interesting, wouldn't it?
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:06.700]   But so there are a lot of opportunities everywhere.
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:08.380]   Stop watching the Americans.
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:10.580]   Your packages arrived.
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:11.420]   Would be interesting.
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:12.300]   And that's the other thing.
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:12.860]   There's data.
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:13.940]   There's a lot of data here.
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:16.620]   And they'll be able to look at people's habits.
[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.100]   They'll be able to-- remember, this
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:22.820]   is a company that not only came out with a tablet,
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:25.140]   but its own silk web browser.
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:27.460]   Because they want to harvest data that more and more data.
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:29.980]   And they were the original data harvesting company.
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:32.260]   Their book recommendations in the early days
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:37.260]   was the first real glimpse we saw of the world of contextual
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:38.940]   marketing and advertising, essentially.
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:40.700]   Because they said, hey, you're going to love this book.
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:41.580]   And you're like, how do they know?
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:43.500]   That's exactly the book that I would love.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.300]   And they do it through these algorithms and so on.
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:46.700]   And they just want a lot more data.
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.980]   If you're paranoid, this is just another device watching
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:51.380]   what you do in your house.
[01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:53.700]   They can deliver the Washington Post, right, to your TV.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:54.340]   I do wish.
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:56.620]   I keep waiting.
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:58.260]   Because we own it.
[01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:01.860]   I do wish that that flood of Chromecast apps
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:03.700]   that we keep expecting would happen.
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:04.700]   Yeah.
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.140]   Well, if there's more coming, there
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:07.620]   been the last two weeks.
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:10.260]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.100]   Yes.
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.940]   Yeah, YouTube--
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:17.220]   Yahoo wants to capture a little of the YouTube glitter
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:21.620]   by luring YouTube stars over to a new video service,
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:25.180]   presumably that they're creating this according to recode.
[01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:27.260]   And they'll give you more money if you do it.
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:30.220]   They haven't come to me yet.
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:31.060]   I'm a YouTube star.
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.220]   Oh, no, I'm not a YouTube star.
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:33.900]   There's the problem.
[01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:35.220]   What do you mean you're not a YouTube star?
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:35.700]   Oh, god.
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:37.540]   What is our total downloads on YouTube?
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:38.900]   5,000.
[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:40.900]   Because you have your own YouTube.
[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:42.460]   I need to start--
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:44.060]   Chad and I both tried to figure this out.
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:45.460]   Chad wants to be a YouTube star.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.140]   I know that.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:47.740]   I know that fact.
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:50.180]   Chad's crazy because you can't come make any money on a YouTube.
[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:50.700]   But maybe the--
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:51.940]   Oh, there's a lot of it.
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:56.140]   The thing is I was watching something Jim Laderback
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:58.780]   had to talk about, can you make a business on YouTube?
[01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:00.500]   And he had a whole panel about it with all the people.
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:01.060]   Of course, he thinks so.
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:03.020]   Revision 3, that was their model.
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:04.860]   At the end, the panel was no.
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:05.820]   No.
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:07.900]   At the moment, you can't create a business on YouTube.
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:12.380]   I think that individuals can create a business for themselves.
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:12.820]   Barely.
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:14.340]   With a lot of work, you might make a lot of--
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.460]   With a lot of work.
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:18.340]   You might be working 50 hours, 60 hours, 70 hours a week,
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.420]   and you make 100,000 of your--
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:20.220]   You're not going to get rich.
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:21.580]   Somebody like Marcus Brownlee.
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:22.100]   Right.
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:24.140]   But he is the exception that proves the rule.
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:28.940]   I'm sure MKBHD pulls in six figures.
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:30.580]   But I'd pay him six figures to work here,
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:32.140]   and he wouldn't have to be editing all the time.
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:33.220]   But the point--
[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:34.420]   He wouldn't be able to--
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:35.660]   But he wouldn't be his own thing.
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:36.740]   He wouldn't be his own thing.
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:38.540]   He wouldn't be his own thing.
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:41.780]   I think that's a lie that's being told and propagated right now.
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:43.780]   I'm not by Google because I don't think they need to.
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:47.140]   But just that's the notion that you can become a rich YouTube
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:49.340]   star if you just make videos in your kitchen.
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:50.340]   Right.
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:52.780]   It's a-- everybody talks about Marcus Brownlee.
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:57.580]   And even his success-- and he's one success story who
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:59.580]   you have to compare against-- a million--
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:00.860]   much less success people.
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:02.380]   We'll say with walls.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:03.380]   Right.
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:05.020]   That's not a bad thing.
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:05.520]   Right.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:08.300]   But the point is that even his income is very--
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:09.580]   He deserves more.
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:11.100]   Well, he could get less.
[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:13.660]   If when you succeed in an environment like that,
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:15.420]   there are going to be 100 imitators.
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:19.340]   The economics of advertising in an environment like that
[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:21.380]   are just completely unpredictable.
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:25.700]   And they always tend downward toward less and less valuable.
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:28.540]   And there's such a glut of content on YouTube.
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:31.540]   It's just it's not anything you can really build a business on.
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:34.980]   You can't really count on it because you can't control the market.
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:37.260]   If there's another recession or something like that,
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:39.300]   you just never know what's going to happen.
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:41.740]   It's not a good, reliable business model.
[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:44.540]   It's great if you're in college and you're making a ton of money
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:45.820]   and you're going to buy a convertible.
[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:48.100]   And it's like, it's great.
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:52.220]   But it's really not a good place to build a business.
[01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:53.860]   I got to say, I really--
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:56.820]   the more-- as much as I poop with this,
[01:17:56.820 --> 01:18:01.020]   I still think YouTube is a million years better than mainstream.
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:02.340]   Hello.
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:02.840]   Hello.
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:03.860]   Is that me or?
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:06.500]   Yeah, that's on your computer.
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.460]   Just your funnel ring here in just a second.
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:08.820]   You know what?
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:10.260]   The problem is Hangouts.
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:12.020]   Now everybody knows my Hangout address.
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:16.500]   So did you see the story on Tesla in 60 minutes?
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.500]   So once again, mainstream media--
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.460]   let me play this, see if I get this video going here.
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:22.460]   Well, if you play it, we're going to hear Hangout music.
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:23.740]   I don't know where that's coming from.
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:26.260]   I don't have a Hangout open.
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:27.860]   We can just do the audio.
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:30.380]   Well, if I just closed everything.
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.100]   That'll fix it.
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:34.500]   Nothing's making noise.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.380]   Let me pull that up again.
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:42.020]   So apparently 60 minutes did a story on the Tesla in which they
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.780]   added car sounds.
[01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:47.380]   Because it was too quiet.
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:49.060]   It was too quiet.
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:51.060]   And 60 minutes even admits this.
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.860]   They said, well, it was an editing error.
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:55.060]   B.S. an editing error.
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:56.820]   Can't tell me that's an editing error.
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:57.300]   What's the week?
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:57.820]   What's the week?
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:59.580]   Actually, how did you figure?
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:01.260]   You were going to start a car company.
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:01.700]   And these are the--
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:02.820]   It was a good spotlight.
[01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:04.740]   Well, I didn't really say you lost those.
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.580]   I feel like 60 minutes is the laughing stock of all--
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:08.420]   It shouldn't be.
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:12.140]   It's almost prestigious television news.
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:13.820]   That's CNN show.
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:14.740]   CNN's the laughing stock.
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:17.980]   By the way, let's switch to CNN.
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:19.540]   Oh, that jet's still missing.
[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:20.620]   OK, thank you.
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:21.700]   We still know nothing.
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:23.380]   We still know nothing, but let's talk about it.
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:26.660]   But in a semi-related story, the EU
[01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:28.980]   has just ruled that all electric cars
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:30.860]   have to make artificial engine noise.
[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:33.260]   That's because French people like to wander in the streets.
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:34.740]   Three miles on a charge.
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:35.220]   Is that why?
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:38.820]   And Musk is building a network of charging stations
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:41.620]   where the driver pays nothing for a fill-up.
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:42.300]   Do we miss the--
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:43.620]   He hopes to make the stations--
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:45.660]   Now they leave solar powered one day.
[01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:48.340]   I have to drive forever on pure sunlight.
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:49.340]   That's not the end.
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:51.060]   That message we're trying to convey.
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:52.140]   So even if this is all--
[01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:53.660]   It's still a great ad for Tesla.
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:54.500]   Yep.
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.620]   But come on, you don't have to add car doors.
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:58.140]   I thought this would be like--
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:00.140]   He's going to drive into the future.
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.620]   No.
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:02.140]   No.
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:05.220]   I guess it was over here somewhere.
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:07.500]   That looks like Google's charging stage.
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.420]   That's the superchargers.
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:09.980]   Right before that.
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:12.420]   250 miles on a charge.
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:13.420]   Right here right there.
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:14.420]   Right here right there.
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:15.540]   That's not what it sounds like.
[01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:17.300]   50 miles on a charge.
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:19.940]   Or it's the sound of a chase car with a camera on it.
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:23.900]   We'll go about 250 miles on a charge.
[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:27.220]   And Musk is building a network of charging stations.
[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:28.100]   Yes, indeed.
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:29.140]   That's-- there you go.
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:32.460]   Thank you, 60 minutes for that.
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:34.980]   In my day, you didn't edit footage
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:38.340]   and add sound effects to it.
[01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:38.900]   I think.
[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:39.620]   Maybe we did.
[01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:41.820]   I just forgot.
[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:44.020]   Did you cry on camera?
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:44.540]   Yeah.
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:45.420]   What was that?
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:46.260]   Broadcast news.
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.620]   Broadcast news, that's right.
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:48.300]   That was a movie.
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:49.500]   That wasn't real, right?
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:49.900]   No.
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:50.420]   OK.
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:54.260]   Well, it's more real than CNN news.
[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:59.900]   I rarely do this, but I wrote a spoof post, not April 1,
[01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.060]   just saying that they were going to rebrand CNN,
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:03.300]   the missing network.
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:04.060]   Yeah, I saw that.
[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:04.860]   And you're right on it.
[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:05.860]   I've never been missing people.
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.420]   Jesus.
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:11.380]   I've seen it has been disgusting me.
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:12.620]   Well, I mean, obviously, they found out
[01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:15.700]   that people want to think about this jet 24/7.
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:19.180]   It seems to be the only story they're covering.
[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:26.660]   There was a really good piece on Wired by an amateur pilot
[01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:30.420]   that I actually think is the true story.
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:32.060]   And I don't know.
[01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:34.500]   But they want to think space aliens.
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:35.260]   Black holes.
[01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:35.780]   Black holes.
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:36.500]   Black holes.
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:37.100]   Black holes.
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.740]   Now they're saying it's a criminal investigation.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:43.660]   But this piece in Wired seemed pretty straightforward.
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:44.460]   The guy's a pilot.
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:47.980]   He said, well, first thing I saw when this plane took this hard
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:51.540]   turn, I looked to see what was on that trajectory.
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:54.380]   It's the nearest landing strip that
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:57.660]   has sufficient capacity to land at 777.
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:00.060]   He said, as a pilot, of course, one of the things you always
[01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:01.780]   keep in mind, always keep in the back of my mind,
[01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:03.060]   is should anything go wrong?
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:05.340]   Where's the nearest place I can land?
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:06.940]   They train you to do that every minute.
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:08.020]   You say, where do I land?
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:08.980]   That's your job.
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:12.300]   So he says what it seems likely is there was a fire.
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:14.820]   There have been several cases of fires and tires.
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:18.980]   And then working their way up through the plane fuselage,
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:23.060]   taking out the electrical system sequentially.
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:26.860]   He says it makes perfect sense that once a fire was detected,
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:29.620]   they immediately made that turn towards a safe landing
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:30.540]   place.
[01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:33.500]   And he believes that they then were overcome by smoke inhalation.
[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:34.940]   And the plane continued on its course
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:37.860]   until it ran out of fuel and crashed.
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:41.300]   That makes no sense to CNN.
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:43.900]   Slate says, Slate said this makes no sense either.
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:45.820]   So OK.
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:48.180]   I guess we're now succumbing to this.
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:49.500]   You go to CNN right now.
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:50.740]   Guess what they're talking about?
[01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:52.740]   Oh, I have it in my office.
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:54.980]   And it's almost comical.
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:58.100]   It's all they'll talk about.
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:22:59.140]   All right.
[01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.740]   I think it's an al Capone's vault.
[01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:06.300]   And the problem is it's a tragedy.
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:07.500]   It's a terrible tragedy.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:08.980]   It's a terrible tragedy.
[01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:10.020]   It's a real tragedy.
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:11.500]   There are real lives.
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:12.860]   And it's being exploited.
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:15.460]   And wow.
[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:17.700]   By the way, the Google connection of the Goodfellow
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:20.420]   Story and Wired is that he used Google Earth to find out
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:23.140]   where that plane was headed.
[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:27.300]   I think the bigger issue with news, just coverage like this,
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:31.780]   is that they used to be, for a while, the mistake that network
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:35.020]   news organizations made was that the amount of coverage
[01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:39.420]   the time they spent on a story was how big of a story it was.
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:42.700]   That, to me, is kind of a mistake.
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.500]   If there's no information, you shouldn't
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.380]   be spending hours on a story with everybody
[01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:48.020]   tap dancing and making stuff up.
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:51.300]   But now it's like, instead of what's the most newsworthy thing,
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.100]   it's what's the most solutions?
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:53.740]   Or what's the most--
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:55.220]   Totally ratings driven.
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:58.420]   And it's to the problem is that you attract more people.
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:02.540]   But they're people who don't buy stuff from a business model.
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:05.660]   They're trying to boost their advertising and so on.
[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:08.420]   But people who spend the whole day hearing people speculate
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:11.260]   about black holes swallowing the airplane are not--
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.540]   They can't watch the whole thing.
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:13.340]   They'll watch the whole thing.
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:14.660]   They'll watch the whole thing.
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:17.420]   Microsoft Build Conference going on in San Francisco.
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:19.700]   Our Build coverage is going to really happen on Friday
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:22.820]   when Mary Jo and Paul come in here and do Windows Weekly Live
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:25.620]   from 1 to 4 o'clock Friday afternoon.
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:28.380]   I think we have a full house already.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:30.620]   But that's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:32.700]   Windows Phone 8.1 was announced.
[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:35.420]   It'll appear on Windows Phone Hand Sets
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:38.420]   at the end of April, early May.
[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:43.980]   And it will have a very Google Now-like Cortana.
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:46.260]   I think they might compare it more to Siri than Google Now.
[01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:49.900]   Google Now doesn't have a personification.
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:52.620]   Cortana, though, does some interesting things.
[01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:54.420]   It sounds like Rich Corinthian leather.
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:54.900]   Yes.
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:57.940]   We were watching Joe Belfior do the demonstration
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:24:59.260]   in his sister called.
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.820]   And he says, oh, yeah.
[01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:04.580]   And Cortana is reminding me to ask about her dogs.
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:07.180]   And what they didn't show you is, how does Cortana know about that?
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:09.060]   That's creepy.
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:12.660]   Now, Dev, the creepy line.
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:16.580]   But I pointed out at the time that while Apple, because
[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:19.820]   of their conscious decision of respect, users' privacy,
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:24.700]   cannot do a Google Now style feature very well, Microsoft
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:25.220]   can.
[01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:25.740]   They've got Bing.
[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:27.140]   They've got a search engine.
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:29.100]   They've got ways to gather those signals.
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:31.420]   They could conceivably do a Google Now style.
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:31.780]   They could.
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:33.580]   And I think the public is ultimately
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:36.140]   going to embrace that kind of thing, because it's just so cool.
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:37.060]   People love Google Now.
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:39.060]   The problem with Google Now is they still
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:40.900]   are not really putting it in front of you.
[01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:42.180]   And when they do put it in front of you,
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:44.020]   they don't really give you enough stuff.
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:46.620]   I want a torrent of Google Now.
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:47.180]   I want more.
[01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:47.660]   Yes.
[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:48.180]   I want more.
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:50.820]   I want to keep on my face the whole time.
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:51.940]   But there's some flaws.
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:53.420]   And maybe they're still working on those.
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:54.700]   I keep getting told.
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:59.020]   I searched once a long time ago for a window, a glass
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:00.060]   replacement company.
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:02.620]   And I still to this day, my Google Now cards,
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:04.980]   it's only eight minutes to cut his windows.
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:06.900]   I didn't want to go there in the first place.
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:08.100]   But now I've already with a window.
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:09.060]   Enough with windows.
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:11.860]   And there's nowhere I could turn that particular thing off.
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:14.500]   I had a really interesting experience the other day
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:18.100]   where I got information about a flight in Google Glass, which
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:20.540]   went from the Google Now app in Google Glass.
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:22.420]   And I said, oh, flight so and so is on time.
[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:23.540]   And it's going to be leaving at this time.
[01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:24.900]   And I'm like, what flight?
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:26.300]   So I asked my wife about it.
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:27.860]   And she said, oh, yeah, that's--
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:29.740]   Her brother was flying.
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:31.340]   She had to receive email from her.
[01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:33.780]   So now they're not only looking at my Gmail,
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:36.140]   they're looking at-- they know that my wife is my wife.
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:38.180]   And they're looking at her Gmail to tell me about--
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:39.140]   That's weird.
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:39.500]   Yeah.
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:41.380]   How do they know she's your wife?
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:42.860]   Well, probably because I have her designated--
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:44.420]   Didn't appear in your Gmail?
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:46.060]   How do you know that's her wrong moment?
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:47.900]   I'm pretty sure it didn't.
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:48.620]   But they--
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:49.940]   That's strange.
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:51.860]   They tend to know that--
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:53.420]   I mean, I'm also--
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:56.980]   I've also got her brother circled.
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:59.380]   I've got her-- I have a lot of communication with her brother.
[01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:01.900]   So they also know that I have a relationship with my brother.
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:02.900]   That might be my brother, you.
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:04.340]   So it's kind of-- I don't know.
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:05.660]   They're doing some goodies there.
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:06.660]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:08.740]   I think that's one place you do get a creepy line.
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:10.020]   That's where you do get the creepy line.
[01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:12.740]   When you can't figure out how they know,
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:14.500]   that really frees people out.
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:15.780]   That's key.
[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:18.940]   They have to reveal that and you control over it.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:21.100]   Otherwise, you creeped.
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:22.540]   So there's another thing at the build conference
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:23.780]   that we cover this morning that I
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:25.620]   thought it was kind of interesting,
[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:27.900]   which is that a website popped up yesterday
[01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:29.300]   called windowsondevice.com.
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:31.060]   And I don't know if they've announced this yet
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:32.740]   at the build conference by Microsoft.
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:36.300]   But this website called windowsondevice.com popped up,
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:37.020]   and then it went away.
[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:37.980]   But the fort went away.
[01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:40.420]   People went through it and found all kinds of stuff
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:43.420]   about talking teddy bears, robots, smart coffee mugs,
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:44.740]   the internet of things running Windows.
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:48.500]   And this is going to be powered by Intel's Galileo platform.
[01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:52.940]   So they're going to do something roughly equivalent
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:55.860]   to Android Wear, but less about wearables
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:57.980]   and more about the internet of things.
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:00.260]   And it seems to be aimed very squarely
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:02.580]   at makers and builders and educators
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:07.260]   and the hardware hacker market, which I think is great.
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:10.380]   And in fact, it has to be said, and it's probably
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:11.900]   more coincident than anything else,
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:14.180]   that ever since Satya Nadella took over Microsoft,
[01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:16.340]   they seem to be a much better company.
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:17.700]   I don't know if you guys have perceived that,
[01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:19.420]   but they seem to be doing all kinds of stuff.
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:20.620]   It's because they're right.
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:28.060]   I mean, this is the Queen Mary, and so it got you on with a new
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:29.260]   paddle.
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:31.900]   I think that's wishful thinking.
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:33.220]   Well, could be.
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:35.100]   I mean, the thing is that Microsoft--
[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:37.340]   the frustrating thing about Microsoft is they're always
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:40.260]   working on great stuff, and they withhold it.
[01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:44.060]   One example is Microsoft research, which just is one
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:46.180]   of the best research labs in the industry.
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:48.340]   And you never see this stuff.
[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:51.180]   They withhold it somehow, either the internal politics
[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:54.900]   of the company or something prevents them from executing
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:58.220]   on many fronts that they really could hit home runs.
[01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:00.900]   And just for the last 10 years, just year after year,
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:04.860]   they just fail, fail, fail to execute on the stuff they have
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:06.220]   and have been working on.
[01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:09.260]   And so here, I don't know how much it takes to just turn things
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:12.260]   on, to let things go forward, to announce things that have
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:14.060]   been in the works for several years.
[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:19.180]   I really don't know. One possibility is that Balmer
[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:21.900]   suddenly achieved enlightenment in his last year and got a
[01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:24.220]   bunch of things in motion that are now such in Adele gets to
[01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:25.180]   take credit for.
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:28.860]   But another one is that such in Adele is basically things
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:37.860]   like not squelching Android Nokia devices, things like having
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:42.780]   an announcement almost entirely about an iPad product.
[01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:44.020]   I mean, that was--
[01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:45.940]   They didn't see that even mentioned Windows.
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:46.620]   Yeah.
[01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:48.340]   I mean, that was--
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:50.700]   and is that-- can Balmer be given credit for that?
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:52.460]   I'm not so sure.
[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:54.300]   Heck, Balmer was one holding back.
[01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:56.820]   I think this is such in Adele's coming up, was such an
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:58.020]   Adele's coming up party.
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:29:59.660]   But it's a longstanding tradition in technology.
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:01.620]   Remember the book Fumbling the Future?
[01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:05.060]   How Xerox invented the first personal computer?
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:07.340]   Woz went to Hewlett Packard and said, I've just invented
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:07.940]   the Apple One.
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:09.460]   Would you like to sell it now?
[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:10.860]   They did that twice.
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:12.540]   It's a longstanding tradition.
[01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:17.620]   They HP purchased Palm, which had the WebOS, which was a
[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:20.940]   third alternative multi-touch user interface, a very
[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:21.740]   innovative one.
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:22.300]   Beautiful.
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:25.540]   Different from the others that had this huge future on all
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:27.700]   devices, even into the desktop.
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:30.060]   Once again, they had the future of computing in their
[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:31.820]   hands and they're like, no.
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:33.020]   We spent a lot for it.
[01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:33.540]   But you know what?
[01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:37.140]   We just can ignore it and then just sort of let it go away.
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:37.620]   Idiot.
[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:38.340]   It happens a lot.
[01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:38.860]   Unbelievable.
[01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:42.500]   Anybody as old as us has covered it long enough, we've
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.460]   seen it happen time and time again.
[01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:45.820]   Chad, you'll see it too someday.
[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:46.820]   Maybe with YouTube.
[01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:49.180]   When you grow up, you'll see it all happen.
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:51.380]   Fumbling the Future.
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:52.260]   We're going to take a break.
[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:54.140]   Come back and get our number or our tip.
[01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:58.900]   Anything you'd like to submit, Mike, to our pool of stuff.
[01:30:58.900 --> 01:30:59.420]   Sure.
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:01.420]   In just a second, our show today brought to you by our
[01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:03.860]   friends at Personal Capital.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:06.020]   I had Personal Capital's founder on triangulation a
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:07.660]   couple of years ago, Bill Harris.
[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:11.380]   He was a former CEO at Intuit and PayPal and learned a
[01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:13.980]   lot about how people use money, keep track of money.
[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:17.020]   He wanted a solution for people to track their
[01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:18.340]   investments better.
[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:21.380]   And he realized that before you can even talk about
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:24.620]   wealth creation or investing, you've got to understand
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:25.780]   where all your money is.
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:27.780]   And that's so hard.
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:32.380]   You've got bank accounts, charge cards, stocks, 401k.
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:34.180]   Do people still call them charge cards?
[01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:35.620]   I think I just did it myself.
[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:37.620]   Charge cards?
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:39.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:41.340]   Credit cards, 401ks.
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:42.980]   They're all on different websites with different
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:44.860]   usernames and passwords.
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:45.780]   You can't see it all.
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:47.340]   You want to see the landscape.
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:49.300]   So he created Personal Capital.
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:52.140]   You set it up and within minutes, you're seeing live, real
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:55.740]   time dashboard of your financial situation on your
[01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:58.540]   tablet, on your phone, and of course on your desktop.
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:01.460]   And then, of course, you get an investment checkup, see if
[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:05.900]   you're paying too much, you're in fees and investment advice.
[01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:08.860]   They'll give you tailored investment advice.
[01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:12.420]   So you could start building your retirement, building your
[01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:13.260]   future.
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:15.660]   And best of all, and this makes sense, it's free.
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:16.500]   It ought to be free.
[01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:18.180]   Why spend money on this?
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:20.660]   Well, you should be putting that money in your savings,
[01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:22.100]   your investments.
[01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:25.060]   Personalcapital.com/twig.
[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:28.340]   I think he created a great adventure, a great idea.
[01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:31.460]   And if you're curious the way they monetize, it's just like
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:34.060]   Mint and other products by giving you recommendations, by
[01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:36.540]   giving you personalized recommendations, and taking a
[01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:37.860]   commission if you decide to buy it.
[01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:40.260]   It's very unobtrusive, they do a very nice job.
[01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:42.180]   And they give you great advice.
[01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:47.580]   Personalcapital.com/twig.
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:49.900]   Replicant in our chat room says, "Too bad Mike Elgin can't
[01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:52.740]   share his brick pizza oven on twig."
[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:54.180]   I could bring it in, I think.
[01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:56.460]   I think it'll fit in the Prius.
[01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:58.300]   Mike and I were talking yesterday about me.
[01:32:58.300 --> 01:32:59.140]   I want to build one.
[01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.580]   Yeah, it's a great idea.
[01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:02.980]   Well, when we moved to Petaluma, we looked at a lot of
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:06.940]   houses, and there are some my wife liked, and this one, I
[01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:09.500]   just, when I saw that pizza oven, I'm like, "This has to be
[01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:10.260]   the house.
[01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:12.580]   We're getting this house."
[01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:15.300]   I don't even care if the roof keeps rain out or whatever.
[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:17.380]   It's outdoors, you throw wood in it, it heats up, and then
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:18.580]   you can just cook, cook, cook.
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:20.340]   That's right, he's got a big steel door when you open it,
[01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:21.340]   and he's like, "Growr!"
[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:24.140]   And then you'd shove pizza in, it's like, fans 700 degrees,
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:25.220]   it's fantastic.
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:25.740]   It's awesome.
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:26.220]   Yeah.
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:27.580]   Really awesome.
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:31.100]   Yeah, so Jeff, I think you need to come back.
[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:32.100]   I'll make a pizza.
[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:33.620]   Pizza party is at Mike.
[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:34.620]   Yeah.
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:37.300]   Are you coming back?
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:39.260]   Oh, look at that, it's his Google+ page.
[01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:40.260]   What about the hat?
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:42.100]   Tell me about the hat.
[01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:43.100]   What is that?
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:44.300]   Is that a chef's hat?
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:45.300]   That's a chef's hat.
[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:46.300]   You're wearing a chef's hat.
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:48.340]   I want people to know who's in charge of this oven.
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:50.500]   Do you actually own a chef's hat?
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:51.500]   I own a chef's hat.
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:52.940]   No, I have to have a chef's hat.
[01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:53.940]   You've got to have a Google+ hat.
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:54.940]   It gives you authority.
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:57.340]   Is he wearing glass on that picture?
[01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:58.340]   Yeah, Google+ Glass.
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:33:59.340]   Of course he is.
[01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:01.780]   And I posted a Google+ Glass video of the whole pizza
[01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:03.740]   process as well.
[01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:04.740]   So it's really--
[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:05.740]   I really want to film it.
[01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:06.740]   Yeah, keep going down here if you want to play.
[01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:07.740]   I don't know if you want to play.
[01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:11.220]   If you don't follow Mike on Google+, you're missing one of the best, most prolific posters
[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:12.220]   on Google+.
[01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:13.220]   Keep going, keep going.
[01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:15.900]   He really-- now have you looked at your views?
[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:16.900]   This is--
[01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:17.900]   Yeah, 333 million.
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:19.620]   Jiminy, krikey, Christmas.
[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:20.620]   That's a lot.
[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:21.620]   It was so astonishing.
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:22.620]   I saw that.
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:24.620]   It's like, what the heck?
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:25.620]   I can't.
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:26.620]   That's amazing.
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:29.820]   But you know, of course, the king of all this is Trey Radcliffe.
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:31.540]   Let me see if I can go to Trey's page.
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:36.140]   Well, we see it if I go to his page or does only Tracy--
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:37.140]   Yeah, you'll see it.
[01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:38.140]   No, you'll see it.
[01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:39.140]   Yeah.
[01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:40.140]   Oh, they put followers back up.
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:41.140]   They took followers down for a while.
[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:42.140]   No, that's back up.
[01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:43.900]   Now they have both, I think.
[01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:45.100]   I think they switch it up.
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:46.700]   Sometimes they don't show any numbers.
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:47.700]   Look at that.
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:48.700]   333 million views.
[01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:50.700]   I've got 43 million.
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:51.700]   Wow.
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:54.340]   I'm some pathetic number.
[01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:55.940]   I don't even want to mention.
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:57.460]   Really puts things in perspective.
[01:34:57.460 --> 01:35:00.780]   Google+ is-- there are also some recent reports about--
[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:01.780]   And a negostown.
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:02.780]   I take you back.
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:07.780]   So Trey has 4.5 billion views.
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:10.900]   He's 7.3 million followers.
[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:12.060]   He's probably the most followed.
[01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:14.140]   I don't know who is, but he's probably one of the most followed.
[01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:16.820]   Did I tell you about my Morocco story and Trey Radcliffe?
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:20.900]   When I was in-- I went to Morocco about a year ago and just was--
[01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:25.300]   everywhere I looked, I thought, Trey Radcliffe of all photographers that I know of should
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:28.140]   come to Morocco and I posted some stuff saying, you've got to come to Morocco.
[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:29.140]   He just went to Morocco.
[01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:30.140]   Good.
[01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:31.140]   Oh my god.
[01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:33.940]   The pictures he posted from Morocco were just stunning.
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:35.340]   Larry Page has more followers.
[01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:38.700]   8.1 million, but he's only got a paltry 29 million views.
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:40.420]   Well, he doesn't really get Google+.
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:41.900]   That doesn't do.
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:44.020]   Like Trey and I do.
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:45.180]   I think he needs to work on it.
[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:47.260]   He needs to spend more time just posting.
[01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:51.740]   What was Trey-- pardon me for asking this question, but how well-known was Trey before
[01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:52.740]   Google+?
[01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:56.260]   He was well-known, but Google+ really helped put him on the map, I think.
[01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:57.260]   Yeah.
[01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:58.260]   Yeah.
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:35:59.260]   Yeah.
[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:00.260]   He's got 29 million views.
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:01.260]   It's so pathetic.
[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:03.860]   And I don't understand how you all get millions of followers.
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:05.660]   I have half a million followers on Google+.
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:07.060]   I've never been able to crack that.
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:08.620]   I don't know why that is.
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:10.940]   I was on a recommended list for some time.
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:11.940]   Yep.
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:12.940]   I'm still on it.
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:13.940]   It's--
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:15.180]   No, apparently I'm not on a list.
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:17.780]   I just-- well, I feel better about myself.
[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:19.260]   Gina was on it too.
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:20.260]   I know.
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:22.660]   You all have millions of followers.
[01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:23.660]   It's not like I don't post.
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:24.660]   I post all the time.
[01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:25.660]   But you know what?
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:26.660]   But it doesn't matter because--
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:27.660]   What?
[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:30.820]   The algorithm still decides what to show to home.
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:32.700]   It's very much like Facebook.
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:33.700]   You can still have huge--
[01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:35.780]   But it's not business-oriented.
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:36.780]   And you know what?
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:38.100]   And it works both ways.
[01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:41.740]   Of course, I only see what the algorithm chooses to show me.
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:47.380]   One feature-- hey, Google, if you're listening, one feature I would like to have is the ability
[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:50.580]   to turn on all for the people I follow.
[01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:51.580]   Yep.
[01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:52.580]   I agree with that.
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:54.380]   Because you can't-- like Facebook, you don't see everybody's--
[01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:55.380]   It's all of everybody's posts.
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:56.380]   Oh, that's not good.
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:57.380]   I thought that slider.
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:58.380]   But you can't go all the way.
[01:36:58.380 --> 01:36:59.380]   You can do the slider, but it doesn't go to 100% because--
[01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:00.380]   It's not to be still low.
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:03.940]   No, it goes to a lot, but not everything.
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:04.940]   I agree with that.
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:07.660]   The other thing is there's a 5,000-circle count limit.
[01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:09.460]   You can't circle more than 5,000 people.
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:11.860]   And that bugs me to no end.
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:15.740]   Every other day I have to go in and uncircle a bunch of people so that I can circle the
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:17.420]   people that I want to circle.
[01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:19.460]   So if you're listening whoever--
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:20.460]   More circling.
[01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:21.460]   More circling.
[01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:22.460]   Here's the real test.
[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:25.860]   How many do the scoble have?
[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:26.860]   Followers or--
[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:27.860]   The interesting--
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:29.420]   Oh, no, scoble only has 91 million views.
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:31.420]   He's not even in the ballpark.
[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:35.180]   The interesting thing about Google+ though is that there's no automatic traffic.
[01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:38.700]   Like, as Jeff was saying, you really see it in the comments and the engagement.
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:40.340]   If you put a boring post up there--
[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:41.340]   No, it's real.
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:42.340]   --which I do all the time--
[01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:43.340]   It's genuine.
[01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:44.340]   --you get hardly any traffic.
[01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:45.340]   Yes.
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:46.340]   Yes.
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:48.260]   If you put something that's really hot, it goes crazy even if you don't have a bazillion followers.
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:49.260]   So he's--
[01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:50.260]   Here's what gets three.
[01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:51.260]   Yeah, he's got five million.
[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:53.860]   Scobles got five million, 91 million views, which I think that that's a low number of
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:56.140]   views for the number of followers he has, frankly.
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:58.940]   I mean, when Trey's got seven million, he's got-- what was it?
[01:37:58.940 --> 01:37:59.940]   Four billion views?
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:00.940]   Four billion.
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:01.940]   Yeah.
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:04.860]   I can give Scoble a hard time about that.
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:07.100]   I got 333 million views.
[01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:08.100]   See?
[01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:09.100]   So--
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:11.380]   See, you got a third of a billion, dude.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:12.380]   You really work it.
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:13.380]   He--
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:15.020]   But that's how we got into this.
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:19.380]   One of the most prolific and best posters on Google+ and that shows you it really is
[01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:20.580]   the quality of your posts.
[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:21.860]   You do good posts.
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:23.140]   You do consistent work.
[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:24.500]   People will follow you on Google+.
[01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:27.260]   Mike, you have a pick or a tip or something you'd like to share with us.
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:28.260]   I do.
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:32.900]   Things a little birdie-- a little bird told me, which is the new book by Bizstone.
[01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:37.180]   This is-- it's not getting a lot of buzz, but I think it's really a great book.
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:42.300]   We recently saw the excellent book, "Hatching Twitter," which gave us the origin story of
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:43.300]   Twitter.
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:44.300]   This is about Bizstones.
[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:49.940]   It's a mostly-- it's like a cross between a manifesto and an autobiography.
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:56.460]   He talks about how he ended up as a billionaire, almost by accident, at multiple stages in
[01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:57.460]   his life.
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:39:00.580]   I wanted to point this out here, which is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a book.
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:04.860]   It says, "If this book were limited to 140 pages, it'd be over.
[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:05.860]   It would end here."
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:08.580]   How many trees had to die for that page to choose?
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:11.460]   Well, and by the way, it continues on for another hundred pages.
[01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:12.460]   That's right.
[01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:13.460]   Yeah.
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:16.140]   But it's an engaging book.
[01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:18.700]   It's pretty well written, and I'm really enjoying it.
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:19.700]   It's a nice--
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:20.700]   Really?
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:23.940]   This is by the way why nobody's talking about this book and why people don't hear about
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:24.940]   it.
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:28.420]   Their impression of Biz that he may be a little bit of an egotist.
[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:32.060]   The first chapter has his business card, "Bizstone Genius."
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:37.580]   Well, he actually tells the story of why he had that business card, and he got it from
[01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:41.500]   where most good ideas come from, which is Roadrunner cartoons.
[01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:46.620]   Wylie Coyote had a business card, I think, that said, "Wylie Coyote, comma genius," something
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:47.620]   like that.
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:48.620]   That came from.
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:52.180]   He talks about how he has-- it's a very personal book, actually.
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:54.180]   He says that there are two Bizstones.
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:58.940]   There's the introspective, nerdy Bizstone, who just is kind of self-effacing and so on.
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:03.460]   And then there's the ego-maniacal Bizstone that he turns on when he needs to.
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:08.420]   And he needed to when he was hungover and had a bunch of interviews at Google.
[01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:09.660]   And he was like, "Oh, yeah."
[01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:12.460]   And started telling him, you know, started interviewing him.
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:17.580]   But it's a really interesting book that talks about how one person made it from just an obscure
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:20.540]   blogger to becoming this gazillionaire.
[01:40:20.540 --> 01:40:21.740]   So you recommend it?
[01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:22.740]   I do recommend it.
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:23.740]   It's very enjoyable.
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:24.740]   It just came out Tuesday.
[01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:26.240]   Well, you know what?
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:28.820]   We'll try to get him for triangulation.
[01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:29.980]   I think that'd be a great idea.
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:35.540]   Stephen Colbert says, "In things a little bird told me, Biz gives away all his secrets
[01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:36.740]   to success.
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:38.580]   I advised him against it.
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:42.540]   If you're not inspired and formed by this book, then you haven't read it."
[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:44.580]   That's pretty good.
[01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:45.580]   High praise from Colbert.
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:46.580]   Thanks a little bird told me.
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:48.580]   All right, good pick.
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:51.900]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:57.980]   So Google has 49% of mobile advertising.
[01:40:57.980 --> 01:40:58.980]   Wow.
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:40:59.980]   You marketer.
[01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:02.460]   Who has the rest?
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:03.460]   Facebook has 18%.
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:05.460]   Oh, is that all really?
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:06.460]   Wow.
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:07.460]   3%.
[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:12.500]   Now, they say that Google has 18% time spent, Facebook's 17% time spent.
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:13.500]   Oh, that's terrible.
[01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:14.780]   Well, but I'm not so sure.
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:20.220]   I question, I don't know what the methodology is behind that because it's the same problem
[01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:25.180]   with saying the time spent on Google.com, Google puts ads in lots of places.
[01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:26.180]   Right.
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:29.260]   So their numbers brought down by the fact that people see it in search results and they
[01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:33.860]   quickly don't really know what methodology is, but I would just wonder.
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:38.420]   So Google brought in 14.5 billion in mobile ad revenue.
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:41.380]   Facebook generated under half of that or $6.8 billion, but let's not forget, Facebook
[01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:44.620]   was zero with mobile not very long ago at all.
[01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:48.180]   And now it's stock has going up because it's doing so well in mobile.
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:50.260]   So I think that's important.
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:53.820]   Here is Wiley Coyote's business card.
[01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:55.220]   Just in case you're interested.
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:56.220]   Does say genius.
[01:41:56.220 --> 01:41:57.220]   It certainly does.
[01:41:57.220 --> 01:41:59.780]   Now, Biz didn't put that half brain wheel travel.
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:01.580]   Yeah, that's a good line too.
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:03.820]   It's going to be on my business card.
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:04.820]   Might have brain.
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:07.980]   What was Zuck's CEO sucker?
[01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:10.020]   I'm a CEO, bitch.
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:11.020]   Right.
[01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:13.900]   I'm CEO, comma, bitch.
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:19.700]   There's another guy who had a Google business card and he was a kind of an academic type.
[01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:22.580]   And he was told at Google that he could make up his own title.
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:27.260]   So he came up with the title Jolly Good Fellow, which I think is a great title.
[01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:29.580]   I think my title, Chief Twit, is pretty good.
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:30.580]   It's pretty good.
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:31.580]   Yes.
[01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:34.940]   It's both grandizing and deprecating at the same time.
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:35.940]   And it's true.
[01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:36.940]   It's true.
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:39.860]   And it's who I am.
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:43.900]   The Twit, the Chief Twit, which carries no power.
[01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:48.460]   So I'm sorry, Gina is not here because remember last week we were talking about the new HTC
[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:51.340]   one, the M8, I guess is what we'll call it.
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:56.820]   And she had her old one had broken and she bought the Google Play Edition, but she hadn't
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:58.300]   checked out yet.
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:01.340]   Now if you do get the Google Play Edition, it's still going to be a couple of weeks away.
[01:43:01.340 --> 01:43:03.380]   So this is actually not a Google Play Edition.
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:07.060]   This is the one and all its HTC Sense Glory.
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:08.380]   This is the Verizon one.
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:12.500]   And I would tell Gina, don't, let's see, I've told her this before, she still doesn't
[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:13.500]   buy it.
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:18.340]   Don't be put off by the sense skin because actually it's pretty tolerable.
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:21.100]   It's much more googly than the original HTC one.
[01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:25.460]   Well, for instance, the original HTC one had those capacitive buttons at the bottom.
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:26.460]   They were non-standard.
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:27.940]   Now they've gone to the standard, you know, back.
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:30.020]   And by the way, Leo, stay right there for a second.
[01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:31.340]   As I remember.
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:32.340]   I hated that.
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:33.660]   Yes, you hated that.
[01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:36.260]   You were the one who wanted the physical button.
[01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:37.860]   I did and I was wrong.
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:38.860]   Okay, all right, fine.
[01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:39.860]   Thank you.
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:40.860]   I did.
[01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:41.860]   I was wrong.
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:42.860]   I didn't like the HTC one.
[01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:47.540]   I at least wanted, you know, I didn't want something completely non-standard either.
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:48.540]   Yeah.
[01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:53.020]   But I did like the fact that all my phones up to that point had a home physical home button
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:54.540]   that I knew where the home was.
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:55.980]   But no, I was wrong.
[01:43:55.980 --> 01:44:00.220]   I guess my complaint was I don't want to waste screen space with a menu on the screen.
[01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:03.620]   These screens now are so damn big that you can afford it.
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:09.540]   And the HTC menu bar at the bottom is actually smaller than the standard Google KitKat menu
[01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:10.540]   bar.
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:11.780]   So it doesn't take up much space.
[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:19.060]   And I do agree with the thinking behind it, which is as you rotate the phone and so forth.
[01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:21.540]   Originally I thought they would move the menus around.
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:23.620]   The menus stay where they are.
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:26.740]   And that was my big complaint is you don't want menus moving.
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:27.740]   Remember that?
[01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:29.180]   And they don't.
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:30.820]   They stay where you expect them to be.
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:31.820]   They're always here.
[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:32.820]   So that's fine.
[01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:33.820]   I'm not sure if I'm going to do that.
[01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:34.820]   The screen is gorgeous.
[01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:36.340]   It's five inches.
[01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:37.540]   That's what the Nexus 5 is.
[01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:41.300]   It's bigger than Gena's old HTC One.
[01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:43.780]   Still 1080p, 441 dots per inch.
[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:46.100]   Really gorgeous.
[01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:49.700]   And I think the camera, but that's what we were talking about, is pretty remarkable
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:50.700]   in this.
[01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:53.140]   In fact, I wasn't crazy about the original HTC One camera.
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:54.420]   She liked it.
[01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:58.300]   It's four megapixels and the ultra pixel ID, better low light photography stuff.
[01:44:58.300 --> 01:45:00.460]   They've done things to tweak it to make it better.
[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:01.860]   So I actually am pretty happy with this.
[01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:05.420]   Now you asked the right question, though, Jeff, do I give up the Moto X?
[01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:10.620]   Which Mike and I both are Moto X fanatics.
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:12.300]   The Moto X camera is so bad.
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:15.220]   I think it comes down to how important is a camera to you?
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:18.460]   If a camera were not important to me, I wouldn't give up the Moto X.
[01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:20.740]   I really like the always listening.
[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:23.300]   I like that it knows when you're driving, when you're in a meeting.
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:24.540]   It will read you it.
[01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:26.860]   This is how I'm going to really miss this on the HTC One.
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:29.420]   When you're driving and the text comes in, it reads you the text and says, do you want
[01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:30.820]   to respond and respond?
[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:31.820]   That is great stuff.
[01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:37.900]   If somebody came out with a phone that was essentially the HTC One with the Moto X, always
[01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:43.540]   listening stuff and that plus the Lumia camera, the Lumia 1020 camera.
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:44.460]   Then you've got something.
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:46.380]   I would pay anything for that phone.
[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:48.700]   I would pay $5,000 for that phone.
[01:45:48.700 --> 01:45:49.700]   Let's be right.
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:52.180]   It's easy to say because they're not going to do it.
[01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:53.740]   I'm going to say that.
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:59.100]   But I want, you know, it's a great, why do you have to pick between a good camera experience
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:01.580]   and voice command?
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:08.220]   I do think there's hope for you because Lenovo has said, or somebody, I don't know, whoever
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:12.900]   owns Motorola now, has said that this summer there'll be a Moto X.
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:17.500]   If I were Motorola, if I were Lenovo, that's exactly what I would do is I would say, okay,
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:18.500]   we got it down.
[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:20.900]   The Moto X was great, but the screen wasn't great and the camera wasn't great.
[01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:21.900]   We want to make those better.
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:25.060]   If they make those better, I might go back to the Moto X this summer.
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:26.580]   For now, no, I've made the choice.
[01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:27.860]   I'm going to carry the HTC One.
[01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:32.780]   It's hard to give up that great camera, that great screen, which is, it's hard to give
[01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:33.780]   it up.
[01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:37.780]   So, all right, we found somebody with even more page views.
[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:40.180]   I don't know how this is possible.
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:43.580]   Bert's found a guy named Romaine Guy.
[01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:44.580]   Who's that?
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:45.580]   Romaine Guy.
[01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:46.580]   Romaine Guy.
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:47.580]   You guys don't follow Romaine Guy?
[01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:48.580]   Who is he?
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:51.340]   He's got 15 billion page views.
[01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:53.060]   He's a guy from Romaine.
[01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:54.660]   He works at Google.
[01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:56.660]   He attended, oh, he's French.
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:57.660]   No?
[01:46:57.660 --> 01:47:00.100]   He's 6,000 followers.
[01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:01.100]   Is that 15 billion?
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:02.100]   It is.
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:04.980]   He must be a very, oh, I actually follow him.
[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:07.740]   He's in my photographer group, so I guess he's a photographer.
[01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:11.020]   It's not surprising that the great photographers are the ones who get the most attention on
[01:47:11.020 --> 01:47:14.980]   Google+, it's such a photogenic sight.
[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:15.980]   Wow.
[01:47:15.980 --> 01:47:17.500]   Is he number one, Romaine Guy?
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:18.500]   I don't know.
[01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:19.980]   It's a stomach shot.
[01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:21.380]   15 billion views.
[01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:22.380]   He's following you too.
[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:24.620]   That must make Trey feel terrible.
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:25.620]   He's following me.
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:29.380]   The arrow goes both directions, which means he's following you.
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:32.580]   Well, and now I feel better, even if I don't have a lot of followers or views, at least
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:35.260]   I have Romaine Guy.
[01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:37.660]   I'm not following him and he's not following me.
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:39.140]   This is outrageous.
[01:47:39.140 --> 01:47:41.820]   Hey, it's so nice to have you.
[01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:44.500]   Mike Elgin, Mike is our news director here at Twitter.
[01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:45.860]   Can I say what a great job?
[01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:47.660]   I know that people are going to say, oh, that's self-serving.
[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:48.660]   You hired him.
[01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:50.260]   No, you're doing, you're not going to have the park.
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:51.740]   You're doing exactly what we brought you in.
[01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:52.740]   He is doing a great job.
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:58.860]   Just to really raise the tenor of conversation here, if you don't get watched the new TNT
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:04.100]   every Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern time, 2000 UTC, you're really
[01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:11.180]   missing what has become a deep news show with great guests, great insight, and it's exactly
[01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:12.700]   what I was hoping we would get from you.
[01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:13.700]   Well, thank you.
[01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:17.580]   I am loving it because I am such a fan of great journalism.
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:22.140]   Every day I get to haul these great journalists in and we talk about the news and we also
[01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:24.260]   talk about the journalism.
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:27.180]   It's really a joy and I'm really enjoying it.
[01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:28.180]   Good.
[01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:32.340]   I know, again, this sounds self-serving, but I'm really very, very happy with what you've
[01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:33.340]   done.
[01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:37.460]   Mike also runs the entire news operations, so Tech News Tonight, while Sarah Lane hosts
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:42.820]   it, is also Mike Elgin joint.
[01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:46.780]   All the breaking news stories and the live news stuff, and we're going to get better
[01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:47.780]   and better.
[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:51.500]   In fact, we're going to build a little set for Mike in his office so he can feed us quick
[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:52.500]   breaking news hits.
[01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:54.220]   Keep me out of the general office area.
[01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:59.380]   Well, if you'd wear shoes, I wouldn't feel so bad, but I'm going to do it.
[01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:01.420]   It's the pants I would feel.
[01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:02.660]   Good country man.
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:04.420]   He's got glass.
[01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:05.940]   He's got a chef's hat.
[01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:06.940]   Shoes not so much.
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:07.940]   I'm not.
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:08.940]   He's not.
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:09.940]   He's got a chef's hat.
[01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:10.940]   Shoes not so much.
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:11.940]   He's got a chef's hat.
[01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:15.340]   And of course, it's always a real pleasure to have Jeff Jarvis on.
[01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:20.900]   Another guy I really consider, not only a great friend but a brilliant and wonderful commentator
[01:49:20.900 --> 01:49:22.620]   on this world around us.
[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:24.460]   Jeff's blog is Buzzmachine.com.
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:29.100]   His book is Public Parts and Gutenberg the Geek.
[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:30.100]   And anything else?
[01:49:30.100 --> 01:49:31.100]   He's a professor of journalism at CUNY.
[01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:32.540]   Anything else you want to talk about?
[01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:33.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:35.700]   You're working on using scribble scribble scribble.
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:36.700]   You're writing something?
[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:39.780]   I'm working on something for the school, but later.
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:41.940]   And we do have to get together and talk about the basics.
[01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:42.940]   Yeah.
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:45.420]   Well, in fact, we're probably going to be back there on May 15th.
[01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:46.420]   Oh, all right.
[01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:47.420]   Deal.
[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:48.420]   We are going to negotiate.
[01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:49.420]   We're stronger than so we can.
[01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:50.420]   We're desperate to do this.
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:53.460]   The more I think about the more you're like, we are telling people, but we are absolutely
[01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:55.140]   desperate to do it.
[01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:56.140]   Thank you, everybody for watching.
[01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:57.140]   I'm watching email.
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:58.140]   Say again.
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:00.380]   I will send you and Lisa email to schedule the whole.
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:01.380]   That's the problem I never read.
[01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:03.020]   You'll end up in your promotions.
[01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:05.220]   Lisa will read her updates.
[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:09.220]   If you have a priority inbox.
[01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:11.780]   We do this show one PM Pacific, four PM Eastern time.
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:15.020]   Wet Nesdays on the Twit Network.
[01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:17.260]   Please watch live, if you will.
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:18.260]   That is 2000 UTC.
[01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:24.900]   If you can't watch live, please do watch after the fact on the Manonio and video available
[01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:29.420]   anytime at twit.tv/twig or wherever fineric that casts are aggregated.
[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:36.020]   I realize I told people the wrong time for TNT 10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern time 1700 UTC.
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:37.340]   So please tune in for that.
[01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:39.420]   Thanks, everybody, in the chat room, everybody live in studio.
[01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:41.740]   And thanks to all of you watching at home.
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:42.740]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:44.860]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:54.860]   [MUSIC]
