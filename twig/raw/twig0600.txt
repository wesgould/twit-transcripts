[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.520]   So uh paul thorat and brad sam's had their thousandth episode of the first ring daily show yesterday and
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.840]   Though and their wives hosted
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:26.560]   Wait, and Andrew would never hosted this week. I think Andrew leesa neither would my wife and queen prue. It'd be great. No
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.920]   I would join queen prue it any day of the week you and queen prue it'd be a show that'd be a show
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.200]   And i'm like, I don't know if she's uh interesting to say the least
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.640]   So a key she's a heap of fun a heap of she is we had a lot of fun with her
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.680]   Uh when they first moved to town we took them out to dinner and then we had them over and do as a party
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.000]   A party
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.080]   So we did have fun. Yeah, it was really fun. We got to do that again as soon as we can uh, conviviate
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.240]   Then of course, yes and covid hit and now we don't see anybody anymore
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.040]   uh, so just to recap
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.600]   the long
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.280]   Todry story
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.200]   Of australia and the internet
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.040]   So rupert murdock who is of course australian and i you know kind of coincidentally is also 600
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.600]   he is the uh
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.560]   publisher
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.520]   Well, he's pretty he's pretty all i don't know he's very close very close
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.320]   Mephusala
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.640]   Methusela of journalism. Rupert rathusela. Did he start it was where's his first newspaper australian? I know he is australian. I think
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.720]   Well, yes. Yes. He inherited from his father. Oh, okay from kenin murdock and then he bought like the son in britain
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.840]   He brought some eventually he ended up in a battle with with robert maxwell
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.800]   And won that to get the son but no he built his empire first in australia and of course now the wall street journal fox
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.960]   uh
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.000]   He is your post uh times of london the son a media baron
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.240]   and apparently has quite a bit of clanton loss in uh australia because he
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.920]   Yeah, he convinced the australian parliament to consider a bill which was likely by the way to
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.800]   Be voted on this week and pass
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:15.120]   Uh that would essentially establish a link tax to companies like google and facebook who published news snippets
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:22.560]   They would not the the value they sent to newspapers and magazines would not be
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.400]   Compensated anyway, it merely the fact that they're using the content some a small amount of that content
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.360]   Uh in their search results or in their links
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.920]   Uh that the parlant said well or is going to say you've got to pay for that
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.120]   Uh google was the first to capitulate first threatening. We're gonna we're gonna retract search
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.320]   We're gonna if this passes we're gonna leave australia
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:50.560]   Apparently they that really didn't either didn't work or they didn't they lost in their nerve because shortly thereafter they made a deal
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.440]   For paying some unnamed some to murdock and other publishers
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.800]   Thought to be at a fairly hefty amount of money
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.520]   Uh tens of millions of dollars to the major ones tens not hundreds but tens all right
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.520]   Well, but
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.400]   More two platforms times tens times five years or something
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.760]   That's up
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.640]   But it was one of those deals where there's a face saving going on as well because oh we're gonna work together
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.160]   We're gonna create stuff
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.360]   It's gonna be a joint venture that kind of thing instead of just here go away take some money
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.040]   Which is what it really probably is which is what it really is uh facebook however
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:31.120]   Uh actually did what google's threatened to do they took they withdrew news from the facebook
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.040]   News feed um in australia
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.840]   That was a couple only a couple of weeks ago
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:45.360]   Uh a lot of upset in australia like only like a week was that long though last week was a lot of upset in australia over that because
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.160]   Some government sites also lost their pages
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.200]   Um, Brianna wu was telling us law
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:59.440]   interpreted news broadly so facebook chose whether petulently or not to use that interpretation of news in in in fact
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.480]   But then put australia and health backup health authorities for among others were pulled down
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.360]   Uh and apparently when shutting down
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:14.880]   Uh stuff in australia they accidentally shut down us versions of that as well. It was you know, it was kind of messy
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.520]   Well all of a sudden
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.000]   Facebook is following google's pet they did a deal
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.160]   Jeff, i'm sure you're covering this so what was the deal?
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.120]   So the change yeah, I think this is this is all this is all kabuki
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.440]   um the
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.920]   But they got they want to change in the law
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.000]   And so the law now has an escape hatch
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.120]   if the minister of
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.960]   murdock
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.960]   decides that
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.840]   um
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.480]   He's actually been called out of the media if the minister of murdock decides that the
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:58.880]   Plattley only two platforms twitter for some reason didn't ever get in this it was only facebook and google is the major big bad platforms
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.720]   If they were in good faith negotiating with
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.440]   Lots of news companies then they wouldn't be subject to the law
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.800]   So the problem here is that is when you call it a link tax
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.560]   No, they weren't paying one for one for the link. So that's 10 cents. That's 10 cents. No, they weren't doing that
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.360]   But the issue was if you link you pay
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:26.320]   So that's why facebook said then fine. We don't link and australia said you're threatening us and facebook said nah
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:36.800]   so now basically there's more time to negotiate and um facebook started doing some deals and if they're seen to be um
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.440]   Sucking up to the publishers efficiently then then the law though passed
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.960]   Doesn't come into effect for them including other difficult
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:55.120]   Um clauses like one is that the law would have them notify the publishers and only publishers of algorithmic changes in advance like every two seconds
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.960]   Um the law would require them to cover news facebook maintains
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:08.960]   It's right. It says to say no, we'll do this again if we don't if we if you know you can force us to try to negotiate
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.280]   But if we don't come to a negotiation deal, uh, then we'll we'll leave again
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:20.880]   And the law also called for arbitration and facebook just gosh. I don't know why didn't trust the arbitrators to be assigned
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.280]   To this case
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.600]   Is that a clear explanation has the law passed now?
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.360]   No, it's about to it's about to this week they expect
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:35.280]   Uh, so facebook was fascinating capitulated essentially they did they do roughly the same thing
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.840]   Google did but yes, they made a deal
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.080]   Yeah, um
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.560]   And and you know, I wrote a piece. I've had a long long long relationship with the guardian
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.880]   I love the guardian, but I wrote a piece that I tried to present to the guardian they ignored me but I put in krikey
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.760]   How disappointed I was that the guardian allied themselves with the devil of mordock
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:59.440]   The when the guardian went in australia a rich guy said we need you here because we have mordock and
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.000]   One other company that's even worse than him
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.800]   Um, and so you're supposed to be the opposition to mordock and then they ended up
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:14.960]   Doing the deal with mordock which I found very disappointing but they got money too krikey didn't back the legislation but still got google money
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.760]   so
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.080]   There might be a consequence to making this deal for both facebook and google because
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.280]   Canada says it wants to do the same thing the eu says
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.960]   It wants to do the same thing. They may be making deals globally
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.360]   This may end up causing them a lot of money
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.080]   And microsoft basically should just shut the heck up. Oh shut up. Yeah
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:45.120]   Has decided any Haskell of tech companies they've decided aside with the european publishers against their arch rivals facebook and google
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.720]   mrs cleaver i noticed that
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.360]   Wall-e
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:58.560]   Is there's not willing to pay the publishers? I would be happy to mrs cleaver. Oh lord. Nothing. I know but
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.520]   They sucked up to the eu
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:07.120]   So, uh, do you think strategically this was a bad move on the part of facebook and google?
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.240]   It, um, I don't think I had any choice
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:17.520]   Yeah, I said last week that this is the process you threaten you threaten you end up negotiating and you come to some sort of agreement
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.280]   That is tenable to both sides here. Here's an interesting that's what i was on the ass
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.920]   Isn't this more of a win win for both parties here?
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.720]   No, it's a lose for everybody except mordock
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.040]   We're actually only one who wins because now the platform is going to have this happening all around the world
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.240]   Uh, there is a precedent now for a link tax
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.560]   uh publishers
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.760]   Sidel up next to mordock and got some on them
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:46.800]   Um, I think it's a lose that's what i've been saying. I was on the abc again saying it's a loss from the australian broadcasting company
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.760]   Not the american version. Yeah, they're i shocked them with my american bluntness
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.320]   I thought australians were blunt, but evidently i'm blunter
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.880]   Let's just let's just watch a little bit of it. We'll call that new jersey right there
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.720]   Yeah, it's all good because in decad that it will be restoring
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.960]   News to its australian
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:10.240]   What is he what is he what is he what is he sitting in front of it's australians like a giant plow? What is that?
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.440]   What's that?
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.680]   Down significantly. She's a journalist and analyst so they're not doing that
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.680]   This is a lose for ever so
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.080]   Everyone except as usual rupert mordock. Oh facebook says oh
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.920]   krikey
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.280]   so um
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.720]   I'm probably gonna get so here's the one here's the one on a tennedy consequence aunt that I think could do this
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.960]   Is
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:40.000]   My friend erin pilhopper at temple university tweeted this morning. He said, you know
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.640]   Facebook news tab and google news showcase were just
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:51.120]   Drawers in which money was there to launder it to hand it over to publishers to shut them up for their lobbying
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.480]   And before all they did was link to the publishers, right?
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:01.360]   But now they're actually licensing full content. They have full news content on google
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.560]   They were forced to create a wall garden
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:10.400]   So my friend erin said, you know, it may not happen, but what if google said well hell we're paying for all this
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:16.080]   Why don't we make a really good news site out of all this complete content, which has got to screw the publishers and
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:22.480]   Yeah, it's only going to be careful what you lobby for people you also brought up a really interesting point in your tweet storm
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.040]   Jeff because you pointed out and I had forgotten that mordock wanted to be
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.920]   Facebook he bought my space
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.880]   He created he's done a number of things dark mode. He bought delphi internet
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:42.480]   He yeah, I like dark mode. Jeff just you know in full disclosure. I was the head of content at delphi internet
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.440]   Under mordock for one month before I had the sense to give the hell out. I was at delphi
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.600]   I guide
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:55.920]   Yeah, that's right. I guide was was a waste of unbelievable millions of dollars with mci
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.880]   mci at old phone company you kids
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.640]   Pulled out a week or two before the launch. Oh, you had died
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.600]   They did a big fox thing it died. He bought my space for half
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.440]   for 580 million dollars and sold it for 30
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.400]   35 lost his shirt. He
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.120]   He started the
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:22.160]   The ipad newspaper the daily you remember that daily. Yeah started a search entity thing died
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.280]   He has failed at the internet at every case
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.120]   So what he's doing now is he's a sniper hiding behind the newspaper press
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.080]   Just shooting at the internet because he couldn't tame the internet
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.520]   He tried and tried and tried and tried again and failed every time
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:41.920]   And that there's a chart that I put up that's from 2010 those were his failures up to that date there were more sense
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:48.560]   It's kind of amazing. So this is uh, you know, you say we should investigate Rupert mordock
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.240]   and certainly he's kind of a but not a not a he's kind of a
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:58.560]   Bailful influence on the the news industry worldwide. That's that's an uh, you're master of understatement
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.520]   uh, he uh, he uh,
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:07.280]   So if this is going to happen now in canada and europe can we just assume this is going to be a global phenomenon
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.360]   Everybody every government will pile on and say oh, how do we get how do we get some of that?
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.920]   That juicy
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.920]   Yeah, how we win our beats
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.960]   Well, I
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.840]   I mean the question is how low does this go right? So so kreiki said
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.880]   That 90 percent of the tech money will go to the two biggest companies two or three biggest companies
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.600]   Uh, and by the way that money ain't going to journalism
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.160]   If it happened in canada the largest chain there post media, which I used to be an advisor to
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.000]   Is owned by a hedge fund the same hedge fund that owns the national enquire money ain't going
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.440]   Wait kreiki is a person. Oh, that's kreiki's a site kreiki.com
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:45.680]   Slash you every time you i've just been i'm like, oh, it's like australia and pro. Oh kreiki kreiki
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:52.080]   It's both. Okay. It does go do the proper noun kreiki.com that a you says
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.920]   Uh, that uh, the deal 90 percent of the cash goes to news corp
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:02.800]   Seven west media and nine three companies owned by two folks rupert mordock and kerry stokes is that right?
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.400]   Yes. Yes. So what's going to happen world around?
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   Yes, the guardian or supposedly got ten million dollars in the guardians the one place that will put it into into journalism good for the guardian
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.800]   But the world around
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.240]   Um, you know if this happens in in in um in canada again
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:24.000]   It goes to a hedge fund it goes to the owner of the national enquire. Is that really what you want? Wow?
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.600]   um
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.600]   and uh, but
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.320]   You know the one thing i've been saying in all by many media appearances
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.800]   If you want to tax
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:38.720]   The platforms more get more money on them. Okay, you know, that's that's your pass a tax law and do that
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.400]   But then who is to say that that money should go to entitled old?
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:49.600]   Screwing up never figured out the internet news poem on the the i'd have it go to internet access or education or health or lots of things
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.320]   kreiki points out that half of the money will go to far-known media won't even go to an australian owner
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:00.080]   So which is a big point that mordock had to when he when he wanted to buy tv stations
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.800]   He had to become an american citizen and right relinquish his australian
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.000]   um
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.640]   Citizenship there was there was amazing testimony from kevin rudd former p.m
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.120]   Of australia who together with makam trombol former p.m. Of australia
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.800]   Is trying to get the australian government to start a royal commission on media read bordock monopoly
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.360]   And it was amazing because because he sat there this is a former prime minister
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:31.120]   He sat there in front of these senators the politicians and he said let's be honest. We're all scared of mordock
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:37.120]   I was scared of mordock. You're scared of mordock. Nobody disagreed with him for a second. We're all scared of mordock. That's how this happened
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.600]   And that's what's happening in the uk
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.560]   tom watson who tried to fight mordock there is now out of government
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.080]   um
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:49.520]   In the us, you know, i'm trying to get journalists together to do something about mordock, but we're nowhere there though today
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.960]   There was a hearing in congress trying to put pressure on
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:59.600]   Cable systems to get rid of oa and n and and fox and so on though I you know as much as I love that pressure
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.680]   I don't want the government to put the pressure on
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.960]   Um mordock is a big problem world around and that's the part of this story that gets lost
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.480]   I'll i'll stop now so stacey can wake up and join us again
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.040]   i'm here
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.840]   I i don't know if you were boring you terribly
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.040]   Nuggets such as wait what craicke is a person
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:25.520]   Well in other news game stops stock went up 100 today
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.800]   Yeah, what ball what the hell
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:35.680]   I got it. I got a breaking news. I was like what why this the stock trading was high
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.000]   Halted twice for volatility ahead of the closing bell up 104
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.400]   before
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.000]   the close
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Little profit taking after that
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.120]   No one knows why for a tie. Oh, yeah, but still to hurt the hedge fund people or what?
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.840]   What it's who knows what's going on?
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.480]   It's stonks whole house of mirrors, and it's the way ironically and I think
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.280]   Unrelatedly reddit went down entirely about one o'clock this afternoon
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.320]   Yeah, I heard that
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.720]   Also heard something happening with the federal reserve fed reserve was down this morning as well
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.720]   Which means no a ch's
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.960]   No wires that's back up. They say it was an error
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.200]   in
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.960]   You know one of their somebody screwed up
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:28.160]   Reddit is back up as well. So I don't think it's related to link save to stonks
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.360]   Um, what a weird world we live in
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:36.560]   What a weird weird world we live in all right. Well, I think we can stop with the um
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.200]   with the
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.840]   Facebook and thank you for for dealing with that that was that was good um
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.760]   Anything well, there is another one other facebook story
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:53.120]   Uh, as you know, the oversight board at facebook is reviewing the
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:59.280]   the uh, de-platforming of president former president trump apparently
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.160]   um
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.720]   They're they're deciding now on it. I thought they'd already decided to decide on it
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:14.160]   But no was they have I think 90 days former president trump has appealed directly to the oversight board to rejoin the platform
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:20.560]   According which they said, you know, he had a perfect right to do he could submit that's who does it right the person who's de-platformed. Yeah
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.680]   Yeah, um all right
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.840]   Can you imagine
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.840]   all the facebook news you ever
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:36.000]   Want it? I can't oh y'all I can't get into my facebook account. I want it my drop. Yeah, really lucky
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.200]   I haven't I haven't been there in two years
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:46.480]   Oh, you didn't kill it you just suspended it or no, I just I just ignored it didn't go but um my
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:52.960]   My theater teacher from when I was in high school. Oh, she passed away and so I was you know, yeah
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.200]   You want to go there and memorialize your show right?
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.920]   but apparently
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.040]   in
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:03.680]   Because I logged on last from a computer that I no longer own facebook was like well
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.400]   We don't know if it's you so we're gonna have to have you authenticate but the only way to let me authenticate is by
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.640]   I know it is
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:15.200]   You have to hold up a Rupert news near murdock newspaper with the current date on it
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.280]   There we go and my birth certificate. Yes. No, I have to
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:24.560]   Facebook wants me to call some of the friends that selects for me. Oh, yeah
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.520]   Yeah, ask them for a code. Yeah, but the people yes
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.400]   One of them is my husband, but the other two are
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.920]   Like not people I actually have phone numbers
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:40.480]   No, I just I'm like oh your acquaintances. I don't even have a phone number. Isn't that ridiculous? Yeah, that's that facebook recovery process
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.640]   So you know this you might want to look this gift horse in the mouth
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.360]   And say all the teas is there i'm buying. Oh, no, no
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.760]   Well, I can't I mean now I can't get it to deactivate it
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.160]   Oh, you can't you have to log in deactivate it
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.640]   So i'm just gonna be in this facebook limbo your limbo and facebook limbo
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.840]   with all the babies
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.760]   Oh
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.000]   I thought they were in purgatory. No, they're limbo
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.280]   Okay, you gotta get your
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:22.880]   I was not catholic so they go to limbo because they're babies they ever had a ch there's original sin, but they didn't do anything
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.240]   So I don't know how to get out of limbo
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.680]   Yeah, I'm like I feel like babies should go to heaven but that should be and we're we're not going to argue theology
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:36.080]   I kind of agree with you. I kind of agree with you. That's why I remember all this fun facts
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:43.360]   Uh from catechism class sharl sandberg and top facebook executives silenced an enemy of turkey
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:49.520]   This is uh quite a uh quite a accusation. This is from pro publica
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.600]   um
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.320]   During the 2018 turkish military campaign
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:02.560]   The turkish government demanded that a page of a mostly Kurdish militia be blocked on facebook sharl sandberg
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.920]   wrote in an email. I am fine with this that was her one sentence message
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.800]   To the team that reviewed the page
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.920]   There's still down three years later
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:21.760]   So this is the problem is that it's very hard to do what facebook does and not weigh in on these right
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.960]   true, yeah
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:30.720]   And and following nation's laws gets you in trouble with nations that have better laws, right, right?
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:36.480]   This is again why I think that in a way, I would bet I have not heard this many one of it
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.720]   I would just bet that there were people inside facebook who said
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.960]   Let's just leave it alone. No news. No news fine
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.920]   Puppies parties getting laid. That's what we are. It's not too bad. Let's go back to my roots
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:53.200]   It's a good life. That is society speaking to somebody who's lived that life. That's a good life
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:25:00.320]   All right, let's take a little break. That was our entire bundle of facebook news our facebook news bindle
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:07.440]   I mean, I'll just have my bell hands. That's the hands on for taco bell is back in the news. Taco bell news
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.760]   This is a major tease. Yes
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:16.240]   No, I want to know but I can't because it's time to tell you about forward networks
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:22.240]   I'm suffering here. No, actually I love forward. It's not that. I just want I want the taco bell story
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.240]   Oh, well
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.240]   Stay tuned. It's coming up
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.160]   your network, you know, it's kind of coinky dink
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:34.400]   Federal reserve board down read it down
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.800]   Uh, your network is kind of mission critical right in some cases
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.680]   The network being down if you're you know the federal reserve board. That's a big deal
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:49.600]   Maybe we should send them a little note about the forward networks. This is really cool
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.320]   I talked to the guys who created this they were stanford
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.840]   phd students the four of them and
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.840]   Worked on they were actually they actually kind of felt the pain
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:05.040]   Network operators felt by the mystery, you know if you've ever run a network a big network, you know
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:10.400]   There's a lot of mystery. There's that big puffy cloud that we talk about that that hides a lot of details
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:16.320]   It's a mystery. What's going on sometimes in the network? So they decided look we can use software. This is so cool
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.480]   to create
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:25.120]   a software generated digital twin of the network literally completely accurate mathematical model
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:31.520]   Of your network when we can send you know, kind of like google does send spiders out to
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.760]   Find every corner of the network find every device on the network and map it out
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.800]   And then present this on the screen as a single source of truth. So you know exactly
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:48.320]   What your network's doing? What could you do this? You can determine if your network is in compliance with the your policies
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.560]   If it's configured properly if it's behaving as you thought it would
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:58.960]   And even maybe more importantly you can figure out what's going to happen to the network if we make some changes
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:08.000]   Forward networks calls this behavior diffs. It's like a text diff except it allows a side-by-side comparison of your network as it is right now
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.880]   And what it will be like with those configuration file changes you're you're contemplating
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.280]   You can you can actually
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:20.240]   In one view you can see all the changes for any device between any points of time and know exactly
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.800]   What's going to happen?
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:29.760]   So so that's the problem is somewhere like the federal reserve board a guy comes in changes a configuration file or a routing table
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.000]   Suddenly the whole thing goes down
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.040]   If they'd had forward networks they'd be able to accurately predict the impact of those changes across every possible traffic path
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.880]   And and once they verify it's going to do exactly what they want on the forward network
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.840]   simulation
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.520]   On the model they could say okay now we can do it and they can do it with confidence
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.560]   Keeping your network healthy keeping your network agile. This is so cool
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.720]   You get a beautiful dashboard if you're watching the video you saw but I'll tell you if you go to the website
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:04.080]   You can see it for yourself forward networks.com/twit you you'll see
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:12.880]   Visualizations that you can immediately understand what's going on you can export them you can send them to the boss to the board
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:18.880]   You can automatically create and always accurate network diagram full details about the topology of your network what's on every
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.440]   Every node
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.400]   It's search network behavior configuration and state network wide. It's got a really nice
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:34.240]   Search tool you can do end-to-end path analyses across your network both on-prem and in the cloud. I mean everywhere your network is
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:39.600]   So you can verify that it's behaving as you expect on-prem cloud virtual overlay networks
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.720]   You can set check and customize policies for the whole network
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.360]   This will give you on average 50 percent faster resolution of network trouble tickets
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.720]   90 percent faster fixes related to audit processes
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.960]   33 reduction in a board of network updates due to identified errors
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.800]   Wouldn't it be cool you could do a search to see what's causing the problem
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.240]   Forward networks. It's actually a great story
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:07.600]   Goldman Sachs they they led the series C funding route last October
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:13.200]   Along with mark and dreason over dindreason Horowitz who thinks forward networks is amazing threshold
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.080]   65 million funding round
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.600]   Forward networks worked with paypal
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:25.360]   Paypal was doing that thing that the dance that all of us do design versus
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:31.520]   Build they were going to build their own instead they found forward networks. They said oh, this is it. This is it
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.960]   They worked with Bank of America with Verizon
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.080]   If you're down under they worked with Telstra
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:48.400]   For this is something every big network needs network automation and verification for an intent-based network with forward networks your business depends on it
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.600]   Federal reserve board get a demo at forward networks.com/twit
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:30:00.880]   Forward networks.com/twit. They also have a podcast if you want to listen to it. I love the name seeking truth in networking
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:06.880]   It's wherever you get your podcast you get a copy check it out forward networks.com/twit
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.640]   I almost feel like especially times like this. This is a public service announcement
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.440]   Everybody needs to know about this no more
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:19.680]   No more configuring your bgp routing table so that all the internet traffic goes to main no more of that
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.560]   Forward networks.com/twits time has come
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.680]   Ah
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.680]   All right, you teased us with Taco Bell
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.960]   What is the story? Everybody which line which line oh here it is. I found it
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.640]   It's on eater.com
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:42.800]   Everybody has to have an entry into the chicken wars and Taco Bell's held back to decide just the right thing
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.320]   And I think they might have done it. They have their entry into the chicken. What's this?
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.640]   What's this who dripping out of the end?
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:55.600]   What is always a special sauce? You got that one special sauce? It's mayonnaise. It's always mayonnaise. It's gross. Well, but just call it me
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.360]   There's food coloring
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:02.080]   But but I think I think a pickled jalapeno is a notch above
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.640]   Oh pop eyes pickle
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:11.840]   I think it's a major advance in the form crispy chicken chipotle sauce cradled in a folded flat bread
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.680]   Not approved. I can't believe you called it a jalapeno
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.840]   jalapeno
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.840]   What kind of nonsense is that?
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.080]   jalapeno
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.680]   Um, you know what I had I finally went to pop eyes. I made my uh
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.160]   My wife tried me to pop eyes
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.600]   Those biscuits. Did you have the sandwich? I had the sandwich
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.360]   It was good. What do you think it was very good? That's good. Yeah. Well
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.400]   Okay, so very stuff one thing is
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.840]   And this is I guess a pro they're using real chicken
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:48.160]   The problem with real chicken is it doesn't have a consistent uh size shape texture
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.880]   So it was a thick part in a thin part exactly there was a big lump of chicken in the middle
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.080]   And then there was like crispy around the it was good one issue
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:01.040]   See so you've experienced this bolus the chicken bolus issue. Yes, but chicken
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:07.920]   Let's let's call that just a feature of chicken y'all. I mean, do you really want?
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.920]   Well, and that's the advantage
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.360]   Thank you, thank you. Thank you
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:20.160]   I mean, yes, they could they could pound it part, but even when you create a like a cutlet
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.400]   They could butterfly
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.600]   Yeah, but that is too thin for a good fried chicken. It was good
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:31.520]   And then the fried chicken we got some fried chicken too. The fried chicken was very good. The fried chicken is great. Yeah, it's good as a meal
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.960]   I haven't had the biscuits. I got the slaw
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.600]   The small had a little too much special sauce in it
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.920]   So I could have done without that. I I want to try the biscuits should have gone with the beans and rice
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.080]   I should have gone with the red beans and rice. Is it good there?
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:49.840]   I thought they can't possibly have good red beans and rice at a fast food establishment, but really it was worth yesterday
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.920]   I celebrated my second shot by getting the sandwich. Yes, I was very happy. Yeah
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:33:00.160]   Oh, you did really you got the vaccine and a chicken bolus and a chicken good deal. Yes
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.120]   Good deal
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:10.000]   Um or go to taco bell you like taco bell, right? It's that's my memory. Well, you know, I got a confession to make
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.240]   um
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.440]   When I got my first shot, I went back to a taco bell to get my I used to just get my two
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.000]   Get a vaccination have some junk food. Is that your life story?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.040]   Yeah, save yourself. Clear yourself. Yeah, so I had my standard order of taco bell is a very humble order of two bean burritos
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.400]   I'm quite happy with them. I kind of admit they were not cool
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.520]   No, oh they were banned
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:42.800]   Yeah, thanks to karstin the whole time. I've been making every day. I make my um, oh you like being you've spoiled
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.360]   You got homemade now to compare it against
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.160]   Yeah
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.120]   He said she's straight
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:55.120]   Look on her face like a problem with that
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:01.680]   Um, so just do all tacos the same thing every day for lunch
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:06.000]   She has an egg and guacamole on toast and I have a quesadilla
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.600]   Do you have a choice at all?
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:15.760]   There's jalapenos jalapenos not for lunch. Why do you want to do vegetables for lunch?
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.760]   I
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.720]   Have so many
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.720]   What am I gonna do make some Brussels sprouts for lunch?
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.360]   That's what Lisa does believe it or not
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:34.240]   And I come home and the place just smells like uh chicken's been farting all over the place because
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:39.520]   The funny thing about breast crust they taste fantastic, but the but the no they don't
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.640]   It's like roasted broccoli. Yeah. Yeah, just like oh
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.360]   What does free mile island? I mean we make a
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:53.840]   We'll make a sweet potato sometimes we'll have like a little like chickpea and spinach coconut milk thing that we put on the sweet potato
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:58.400]   But I'm more there. There's the vegetable component, but there's also the same food every day
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:03.120]   That's by the time the pandemic is I'm gonna be years
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:09.920]   Steve gives it used to have a ham sandwich every day sandwiches peanut butter and henny there you go
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.640]   Every day better
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:17.200]   Peanut butter honey and banana and I was like oh let's try this it's been years and I was like
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:22.240]   Not good peanuts are not p. That's kind of our vegetable. They're legumes
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   Yeah, you're yeah, they're not enough. He's not having a peanut butter quesadilla anyway, let's talk about
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:34.880]   Well, wait a minute. No, I haven't thought to finish the story because I don't want to set everybody up as scooter x is reminding me
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.280]   the special
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.160]   Taco bell chicken sandwich taco will be tested
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:46.880]   Select locations in Nashville, Tennessee and and you're gonna be sad when you hear this charlotte north carolina
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.760]   I'm at it starting March 11th
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:55.040]   A nationwide rollout is planned for later this year. You're gonna let charlotte have it, huh?
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.440]   Okay
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:02.160]   This is not I want to take a victory here a victory lap that leo tried to say what you liked it
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.920]   I loved it. I actually really loved it. It was really good. Yeah, it's really good
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.720]   They you know what though. I gotta say and stacy's probably gonna agree with me on this
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.080]   There's something pop eyes does to that batter
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:19.120]   Because it's very crisp and sweet and it's my guess they put sugar in it
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.960]   Oh, probably that's not unusual. I thought about that
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:29.440]   Sugar if you don't put sugar in a cake or a cookie you don't get the christmas you can use honey and a cookie for instance
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.000]   But the thing about the sugar when it bakes it crisps
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:38.800]   And honey won't do that and I'm thinking that probably pop eyes is putting some nice white sugar in that bag
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   That wouldn't surprise me. Yeah, you know, I'm I'm in those hush puppies
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.800]   Yeah, we're talking a little bit of sugar. I'm sorry a little bit of sugar right
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.680]   Put a little sugar in there. Yeah, and when you fry it up it does christmas gives it a little bit of a
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:55.600]   Lucky crispiness for a hmm edge. Uh-huh. Perfect kitchen science
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:06.480]   Sorry chat this week in google. Um, yeah google did some other crazy stuff, right? As long as we're talking about cooking
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:14.720]   Nice try aunt. I just want to tell everybody about harold mcgeade. You know about harold mcgee stacy
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:21.040]   I do I have I oh I used to have his cookbook and now I have all his cookbooks of people who were influenced by him
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:24.400]   Yeah, like world men. Yeah, so yes. He is the guy who
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:32.960]   Really told the world that uh that cooking was chemistry. Oh my god. Is he dead? No. Oh good
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:39.600]   I don't think so god now you scared me. No, he's not he's young man 69
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:45.200]   I just thought you know since we were talking about this sugar in the pop eyes. That's kind of a harold mcgee trick
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.000]   Science he has a new book out actually y'all
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.720]   It's about smelling
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.200]   See smelling is 99 percent of eating
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:38:01.520]   A nosedive a field guide to the world smells. I got over that. Yeah, I got over that get on it y'all nosedive
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.120]   What a good name
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.000]   You know
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.840]   When they talk about covid 19 they talk about all the horrible things you can't breathe you you feel like you're drowning
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:15.360]   You know and all that but both both my wife and I agree that the real side affected
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:20.240]   I don't none neither of us want is that you lose your sense of taste and smell losing taste and terrible
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.160]   Terrible nightmare my uncle
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:30.160]   Caught it a month or so. Oh, I'm sorry. It's your case. He's fine. Yeah, he's fine
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.920]   Um
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:37.600]   But he just that's pretty much what he said he was a miserable because he couldn't taste food that would just kill me
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.600]   And that last a long time
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:47.040]   Mm-hmm did the taste come back at it did. Oh, you know, he he felt fine after you know being air quotes sick
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.280]   But for a little while he still didn't have taste and it was just driving him nuts
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.360]   You you tell him the southerner they can't taste their fried food. That's that's a problem
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.400]   And this just in from the editorial department
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.720]   There is no chicken in pop eyes chicken
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.400]   I mean
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:16.080]   There are 690 calories 42 grams of fat
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.040]   14 hundred
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:23.200]   Killjoy good for you chick-full a sandwich
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.480]   440
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:33.120]   I might point out there is there are sugars in the chicken sandwich class against spicy. It's probably in the bun though
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:41.120]   Maybe not it's in the bun not in the because you if you just get a chick piece of chicken there's no sugar in that
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:51.120]   So thank you editorial department making a big and one more thing there nose dive the book by harold mcgee
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:55.920]   There's also a gastropub in greenville, south carolina called nose dive
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:01.840]   And wow, yeah, we'll get it up state getting all the love today on this week and good look at that, huh?
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.280]   It's kakalaki time on this week and googie
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:11.600]   Okay
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.600]   Oh
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:18.720]   God I've been avoiding this story, you know what that's why
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.640]   Because another ai ethics researcher fired
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.920]   We had you know, remember tim rek gebber who was fired and then
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:30.720]   Margaret Mitchell we tried the story a few weeks ago that she was in trouble because
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.160]   Uh, she apparently was exfiltrating
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.560]   Uh email
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:41.440]   From her account google was investigating. She was fired on friday afternoon tweeted
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.720]   merely
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.880]   Two words i'm fired
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.040]   Google confirmed her employment had been terminated after conducting a review of this manager's conduct
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.480]   We determined there were multiple violations of our code of conduct now
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:57.440]   As I always disclaim before we do these kinds of stories employment law
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.160]   it's tough because
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:04.000]   Employers are very limited what they can say about a termination
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.480]   We will never get both sides of a story on on any termination
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:13.120]   So we just should say that up front, but it does not look good for google once again
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:19.840]   Um, you know having trouble with their the people they brought in specifically to run their ethical ai team
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.240]   Have now both been fired. Yeah, this is not this is not cool looking
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.880]   Yes, they say the optics are bad. Yeah
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:36.960]   Um, well knowing that optics are bad yet they continue to proceed with this so it makes you wonder what exactly did happen on both sides of it
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.800]   I mean the research I will say the research they put out that kind of
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:49.840]   Made google's birt birt social, uh, sorry search algorithm look biased
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:53.520]   I can see and maybe not as effective. I can see google being like, uh, yeah
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.560]   Please do not publish the paper that makes us look bad
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:03.360]   But I can also see the argument in favor of that especially into the in like the current climate of
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.560]   being aware of bias in ai
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.400]   And the I will say the way that google handled this
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.240]   Is incredibly clumsy. I feel like they could take a page from like
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.600]   Lobbyists for the telco industry for really like
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.480]   Coming in and co-opting somebody else
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:25.520]   And in making it, you know, feel bad without looking quite so bad to the rest of the world
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.280]   but
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.160]   There you go google's young they're learning and at the same time they come out with a new policy
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.800]   on diversity and
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.760]   These actions have an impact on on that statement
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.720]   Uh, they're changing its diversity and research policies the head of the
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:47.520]   company's head of ai apologize for the handling of the margar mitchell and timnet gobrew
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.240]   situation
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.240]   um
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.240]   And you know
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:59.280]   It's it's complicated. It's it's I don't know what I mean. It's just so hard to know what's happened
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:03.200]   Yeah, it's hard to know what's happening on the inside, but I will say firing
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:08.480]   an african-american woman and then another woman because they disagreed with your
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:14.080]   Yep, male management team. Yeah, I mean I've been there
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:19.360]   I've not been fired, but I have disagreed and I have left companies because I've disagreed and
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:27.920]   Yes, I didn't I mean the reason why I would have gotten fired is because I didn't toe the party line
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:34.640]   And so then the question needs to be like hey google are you self-aware enough to change your party line?
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.840]   Yeah, if you hire strong
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.520]   women
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.320]   to
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.760]   Oversea your ai efforts and you don't like what they say
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:51.440]   Maybe there's other solutions than firing them. I it just it seems like that's why you brought them in watch dog
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.680]   Yes, right there. Yeah, there to be a watch dog and then if you don't let them watch the dog. Yeah
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.080]   Now they're a canary
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.520]   And they have just fallen over on their perch
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:07.440]   Uh, there is though we do have some testimony from a guy who was at google and
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:11.360]   Left the founder of ways wrote a piece
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:15.200]   Uh at pay go which I gather as yet another
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:19.280]   Subscript yeah medium slash subscription thing
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.320]   Uh, no, i'm bardine
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:27.200]   Said why did I leave google or why did I stay so long?
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:32.720]   He talks about uh ways being acquired by google seven years ago
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:38.880]   How he was promised autonomy as you know google and other companies always do give it a they love
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.120]   Okay, this guy's post
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.680]   I was like buddy
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:51.040]   What kind of fairy land where you live in it? You thought this company would buy you and leave you completely autonomous? I mean
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.240]   I don't know that happens anywhere
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.160]   It doesn't because it's not tenable for the acquiring business
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.600]   Oh, right and they left it more independent than anything else
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:07.440]   Any normal company would have just merged it into google maps and that's that the fact that they left it as a separate entity
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.240]   To do honestly was kind of in israel
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.160]   Yeah
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.360]   And then the other thing I would say is in here he talks about
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:21.120]   Running from his existing board because they had conflicts so it was like instead
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.120]   They were running away from their current board to google thinking that was going to solve some of their problem, but
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:34.160]   You cannot grow your startup as a startup in the midst of a big company
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:39.920]   His biggest complaint was and this is common in a big company. He couldn't hire in fire as he chose
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.640]   Oh boy. Yeah
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:50.160]   Gosh, I hate that. Uh, you know, and you know why because bigger companies have larger legal liabilities
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:55.360]   They don't necessarily do a better job as we can see but they I mean
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:58.240]   That's what they're there for in
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:08.480]   Okay, well, I'm basically basically this guy just read is entitled in super naive and i'm just like what
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:13.920]   You're a successful entrepreneur in this again. Yeah, I don't know sometimes. I'm just i'm bitter
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.400]   They had great technology
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.480]   Uh, they managed to develop it a lot more. I mean, I still use ways instead of google
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.760]   Resting a huge fan base ways did not lose its personality
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.720]   It's still very much like it was right
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:34.160]   Oh in this guy in this guy also complained about, you know, he had used a four letter word while speaking on a panel
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.160]   His analogy wasn't pc
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.160]   His language wasn't pg
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.320]   So he stopped speaking
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:45.120]   And people like he got his wrist slashes by him and yeah
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.160]   Can I didn't use the word cancel in here anywhere?
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:53.120]   No, but he did say he did say tolerance has gone at google and the words
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:47:00.480]   Are and words are bigger than or greater than content. That's the new silicon mally mantra of political correctness
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:07.280]   So you can say terrible with that said as long as your pronouns are correct or you can say super important things
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.840]   But use one wrong word. It's off to hr
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.640]   With you it does seem a little naive
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.960]   um, he also
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.920]   published a brand report which showed that ways
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.640]   brand all by itself
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:24.400]   Was better than bandaid hp south western hrs
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:32.160]   Although I have some question about this top 50 brands because okay apple google amazon netflix pinterest
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:37.760]   Oh people love pinterest beating and red spotify pix art disney's number nine
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.240]   Okay
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:44.640]   Where do you think disney should be well disney's a pretty respected brand don't you think?
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:50.960]   Or who's yeah, that's why it's number nine. I don't know where this ranking the brands dot com. What the heck is that?
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.600]   Okay, you're right good point
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.320]   Some guy's idea of what a brand is
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.720]   Okay
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.960]   That's I guess that was my point is my brand ranking for you next week. Yes, i guess i guess
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:07.680]   That was kind of my point is like I don't understand this list at all
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.560]   It doesn't make a lot of sense to me. So yeah
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:13.040]   Somebody likes question for you all yes
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:19.360]   with with all of this stuff going on from firing the ai ethics people
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.720]   does
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:30.400]   Google's been doing where actually a lot of the tech companies they've been doing all of this woke stuff and and making all of these different contributions to
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.640]   to help
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.200]   unfortunate people especially in the lines on the sides of being people of color and
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:41.680]   yada yada we've seen all of these campaigns where we're giving back we're trying to you know
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:48.640]   Invest more into to allow kids of color to get into the stem field and yada yada yada
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:53.200]   They're saying all the right things and I think I said a couple a couple of weeks ago that
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.600]   I want to see more action and then stuff like this happens
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.800]   um
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:02.240]   Does all of that lip service just get diminished based on
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.720]   uh, these recent firearms?
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:10.560]   Well, that's really a question more for you aunt because all of this is is aimed at you
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.320]   It's like oh really trust us. We like black people
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:20.160]   We we you know we're we're all in you know on black people and then but you do have to judge somebody by their actions
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.240]   The words are easy. Yep
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.640]   I think part of it is also
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.920]   women
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.080]   Women too. Absolutely. Yes women too
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.560]   yep, I
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:31.840]   I think
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.560]   When I talk back or argue with a man
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:39.200]   A certain kind of man not just shut up stacy. I don't want to hear it
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.240]   Here it goes
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:51.040]   I would be interested in the responsive aunt and I got together and argued with the same individual
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.840]   because
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:50:01.280]   Like I I mean, I think in lord help black women because yes, that's probably even worse
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.840]   Um and black women attack
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.320]   probably makes it
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.080]   worse yet
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.880]   Yep, and so I I think in in some of it
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:16.960]   I will say if i'm google and i'm actively trying to recruit
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.880]   black women
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.120]   People of color women in general
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:29.040]   These are not good stories to tell and to see and it's people are very I mean, it's clear. They're not walking the talk
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:33.440]   Is that the right? Yes, that's exactly right. Yes. They're not walking the talk
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.200]   um
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:41.760]   And they did appoint the woman they appointed to replace market Mitchell or meg Mitchell was a black woman
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.680]   marion
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.680]   I want to say
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:51.280]   call see colotar a colot colot or something anyway, but
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:55.280]   I look at this and i'm like I would never want to work there
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:01.920]   I mean you would have to defend yourself not only to everybody within google but to everyone who's probably your support network
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:07.440]   Yeah, why would you go to work for them? They're awful. Yeah, they don't have a nice track record at all
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:10.320]   just so
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.000]   I just
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   And it's unfortunate because you see it's
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.640]   Google Google is so important in terms of
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:25.680]   How people it's a frame through which a lot of people see the world so it's important to get more people
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:30.240]   Who resemble the rest of the world in there, you know
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.840]   this is actually the
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:34.880]   what
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.280]   Margaret Mitchell said in her tweet that I think
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:43.200]   She believes and others believe was the proximate cause of refiring not the emails that she was going through
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:47.280]   Say you have a problem she tweeted with consistently alienating black women
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.840]   And have caused serious damage in their lives. You could a try to undo that damage
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:56.480]   Or be try to form more black people to like you the tokenism approach
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.120]   Good luck
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:01.680]   So she's saying that exactly
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:07.920]   And that's that's one of the things that it was right after sundar said he was going to go to the historically black
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.480]   and try to recruit but
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.920]   I mean
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.440]   Having someone
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:21.760]   This is this is tough and this guy who wrote this entire aggrieved blog post basically a good portion of his message
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:27.120]   Was like I left after seven years because I told it like it it was I was too real for google real
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.680]   That man lasted seven years right right right point
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.240]   Yeah, yeah, I'm here to report things
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.880]   Things that google are pretty good for white men. I just want to say, you know, we're doing our right there
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:40.480]   Just want you to know
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:46.720]   And he felt like so justified in writing this fan and this like and he left he wasn't fired he wasn't fired
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.720]   He left he left no
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.880]   And people were like
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:57.120]   So surprised and he was like I just was tired because I'm kind of a confrontational person
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.240]   And I was tired of not being me and
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:04.880]   The minute we're both attitude we're both reading between the lights
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:13.440]   This ad and don't give me wrong. No, he wrote that in there. He wrote those words
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:18.880]   And and don't give me wrong. This isn't just me attacking google
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:23.920]   I I say this about pretty much all of these large corporations out there because it's
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:29.520]   There's a bunch of corporations doing the same behavior that we don't hear about
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:36.000]   Smaller companies, you know under the fortune 500 of whatever so this is just
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:43.440]   You gotta if you're gonna freaking talk about what you doing you need to walk the wall too is our chat room sit there. Yep
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:46.880]   Yes
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:49.680]   Is is facing
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.680]   It's one matter to be a person of color a woman of color a woman
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.720]   Inside the behemoth that Ann talks about
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:03.440]   But the key here is about the lesson that I'm not god knows i'm a white man and i'm gonna learn lessons every single day
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:06.080]   But the thing that i've learned most in the last two years
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:12.640]   Is the need to truly share power and it's a lesson i have to learn how to think about that every single day
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:15.280]   um and in this case
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:21.040]   Google didn't share power right they they said you're in charge of keeping us honest in ai
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.400]   ah
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.080]   not that honest
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:26.960]   And and that's the problem that don't have the job
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.200]   Then don't have started the job in the first place
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:34.800]   And don't put a black woman in that job if you're not going to mean it that to me
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.800]   Right is right key issue
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:39.920]   Yeah, if you're gonna put a token up there and say
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:44.960]   And then tell the token that it's actually a meaningful player when it's really just a pawn then yeah
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.200]   And of course they're going to be pissed
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.480]   Yeah
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:52.720]   And i've been on the other side of this coin as well that I think should be addressed and
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.880]   It's basically what we said at the beginning is we got to know both sides of the story
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:01.120]   I've been in a situation where I was terminating somebody that was working
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.200]   on my team and
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.560]   Black person
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:09.680]   And they wanted to throw the race card at me yada yada yada yada and i'm like person i'm black too
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:13.760]   And these rules that that are in place these protocols that are in place
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.840]   They were set by me
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:19.440]   So that's why yeah, not because you're black
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:24.160]   It's because you didn't follow my protocols and I lived by my protocols
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.080]   So it's still
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:29.200]   We got to understand it is still going to be two sides of the story and
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:36.960]   Don't always assume that it's just a company being idiotic and racist because sometimes there are just some flat out rules being
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.360]   Broken and procedures not being followed
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.840]   Yes
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.280]   I will say
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:47.760]   Not in your case aunt but in many cases the rules are there to protect the established class
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.840]   So sometimes you're like, uh
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:54.160]   But I will also say the rule the reason google said they fired both of them
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:58.080]   Um, the excuse in both cases was
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:59.840]   Involved
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:05.120]   Not following the rules and in transferring large files was one in both of their cases
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:09.680]   And that's one of those rules where you're kind of like that's in the that could be
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:15.040]   Really nefarious like Anthony leven dowston nefarious, but it can also just be like yeah
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:17.680]   I wanted to you know take some work home or something
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:19.200]   Or from home
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.000]   Right
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   It's just trying to work home
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.800]   I look at I look at their excuses in this case and i'm like
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:28.960]   Okay
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.960]   And the google is totally fine protecting people too
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:36.720]   When they fire someone that has done something well andy ruba
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:42.480]   Yeah, egregious somebody did somebody say 90 million dollars was that what you just said 90 million?
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.760]   All right
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:47.600]   So, I mean if we look at all the people who were fired because they probably got a little too
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:50.640]   happy with their assistance or
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:54.800]   You know actively harass people, but just we're left to you know, oh, we're gonna let you go
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.760]   You know and maybe they get a 90 million dollar severance
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:03.200]   Maybe they don't but google doesn't throw them out in front of the you know throw them under the bus with some stupid
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.200]   We're firing you because of xyz
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   So, right
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.200]   But you're right we should we but we're never going to hear both sides
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.760]   So in this case all we have are the optics
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:17.760]   Can I ask to take that a completely unrelated but meta question
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.480]   Of you journalists because i'm curious
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:23.920]   We never you never have the whole story, right?
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.040]   Right, how do you handle that?
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:30.960]   You write I mean
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:35.920]   I have always written when I write about things I write about it for
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:40.240]   The consumer, right and this this doesn't
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:43.440]   In this case, it's a little less
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:51.520]   A parent but you write about it from that you understand who has the power and I err on the side of the people who don't have no
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.760]   That's a good that's a good attitude. I think yeah
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:56.960]   I do too and that effect that's behind
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:02.160]   It's important in the in the field that I'm in of tech journalism because it's very easy to be a tree
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:05.360]   Pardon me punditree
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:09.200]   Sorry, I lost my head for a moment
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:15.520]   That it's very easy when you're doing that to favor the big companies to favor the tech companies
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:19.440]   You know they're gonna spiff you with free stuff and you know you want to go to sources
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:24.000]   Same thing I suppose in belt weight journalism when you know your sources are all members of congress
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:26.640]   You kind of don't want to burn your sources access
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:30.160]   But access is so important, but at the same time really what were you representing?
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:33.680]   You're representing those not in power you're speaking truth to power
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:37.120]   So it's also but but we also get full of ourselves
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.200]   um
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:46.000]   And think that you know we set the agenda we shouldn't the public should that we know right how things happen
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.920]   And so it turns the other way part of me can I just get a license to say this just once in the show then I won't say it again
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:59.200]   Um, you know, it's the problem I have with the switch from utopia into dystopian moral panic and coverage of tech
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.840]   Neither is true
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:06.080]   And and and so the credibility of the coverage so often now
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:11.200]   Thank you a little flash of moral panic there a little subliminal moral
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:15.200]   I asked for permission. Well, actually no, I asked for forgiveness
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:17.760]   um
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:24.400]   You know where I think that that one of the words we love in journalism and my friend j rosen says we always use it wrong is narrative
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:29.040]   You know, we think we control the narrative that we have the story. We know what's going on. We know how to put it in the context
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:31.360]   But oftentimes we don't
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:35.600]   Um, you know, I'm sure we've all had the experience to have been interviewed by journalists and it's awful
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:39.520]   because they take the one thing they need to fill in their story and
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:43.280]   Um, you know, you understand why people don't trust interacting with us
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.040]   Um
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:47.200]   I we've got to change the form of what we do
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:50.880]   That's why I have students to do that because i'm too old
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.920]   By the way in a related
[00:59:53.920 --> 01:00:01.840]   To the australia update apparently according to roder's alphabet is in talks with spanish publishers to bring google news back
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:07.840]   I don't understand this story because that was a law that gave no option and no choice. Yeah
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.040]   So i'm not sure what's happening
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.400]   The spanish cultural ministry says the government is working on a draft bill
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.120]   So they're trying they're looking at changing
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:22.160]   Chained, you know, okay. This is the famous case publishers. Yeah, there's a famous case a publisher to demanded
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:29.120]   Payments for snip. It's google says screw you close google news in spain and it hurt the publishers badly that was lat back in 2014
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.680]   So, uh, I guess now
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:35.680]   Uh spain is going to do something about that google might come back
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.640]   Uh good good good talk everybody. Thank you very much
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.320]   Pundit that's what I am. Pundit actually stacey to be fair in my
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:52.480]   Am I buy it service journalism? No, no, no in my bio and uh to i'll show you my bio that I use
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.880]   I use it on twitter. I use it most places
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.280]   Uh, this is my bio. This is what I say
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:04.960]   Let me see if I can get it here. I am a podcaster broadcaster and tech pundit. I claim no more than that
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.920]   That's what I thought you said you were
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.800]   Appundant. Yeah, you say that now after you slap me around
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:18.880]   That you said that no, I'm teasing. I absolutely absolutely I did not consider myself a journalist
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.840]   That's why I said I want to ask the journalists on the panel
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.240]   What do you do if you have insufficient?
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.520]   You know and you know you have insufficient information, but that's just the nature of the world
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.840]   You never have perfect information
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:34.800]   Well, yeah, and you could always call more people. Yeah, I mean at a certain point you do have to file
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.880]   Yeah
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.880]   Always be
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:46.240]   Uh, are we going to talk about the shortage of chips and the looming executive order? Dacie bait
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:52.640]   I think I think it is and I think it's exactly we should talk about when we return
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:57.600]   After this word from our sponsors. No, that is that's the fact I was very
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.800]   Surprised to see that coming out of the white house. I thought wow
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.120]   Yeah, um, I'd love to get your take on it in a second, but first a word from gabby
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.040]   I have so I'm so this is the story
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.840]   I'm sitting I'm watching tv
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:17.680]   Uh, Lisa is going to hair on fire says they just raised our home insurance eight thousand dollars
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:23.120]   And I said oh yeah, I guess because we're in the wild fair area and stuff like I said, oh my god
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.840]   I said, you know what I really should do I should shop around
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:31.200]   Because I bet you we can find a better price and I started you got to log in to each individual company site
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.840]   You got to answer a whole ton of questions and it's very repetitive
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.200]   It's the same questions, but you got to answer them over and over and over again
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:43.200]   And I thought gee there ought to be a better way and then on the tv this guy comes on
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.440]   I said I gotta try this download a gabby long story short
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:51.520]   Uh, we saved two thousand dollars on our home insurance
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:56.160]   So put the ad app on my phone what it's really quick very fast
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:02.080]   They say on average if you were shopping around it's about 1100 keystrokes per insurance
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.440]   Company that you'd have to fill out forms and so forth
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:13.120]   So this they go to the 40 top insurance providers progressive nationwide and travels and really what gabby did what hano did
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:16.880]   Which was really interesting he convinced them to have an api that they could scrape
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.360]   He said you've got to make this
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:24.160]   Easier for people to shop around you you know this this going to each site is crazy
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:29.200]   So gabby actually has it has kind of influenced the industry to make this possible
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:34.480]   The what'll happen is you go to gabby, uh, they do homeowners and they also do auto and I did both
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.880]   And I want to warn people about this because I got a couple of emails from people saying did you know they do this?
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.920]   Yes, I do and this is this is how they save you keystrokes
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.840]   You log you give them the logins for your insurance current insurance
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:50.160]   That way you don't have to type anything they get everything all the underwriting information
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.440]   From your current homeowners insurance and your current auto insurance
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:58.240]   That's one of the ways they save you a lot of keystrokes by the way, absolutely private
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:04.400]   They are that they make their money and commissions from the company that you end up using if you end up using them
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.120]   They don't sell your information. They keep it absolutely private
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.240]   They you know, so it's completely safe to do this
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.440]   Uh, but by so I entered that in
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:17.040]   You link your current insurance account or accounts
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:22.480]   And within in most cases it's going to take you just a few minutes to get the to get a quote for the coverage
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.240]   Exactly the same coverage you currently have that's why you want to log into your existing account
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.280]   You want the same coverage. It's easy to say oh, I could save you a thousand bucks
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.360]   But only if you promise never to drive your car. That's no good
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.720]   Uh, so this is you're going to get the same coverage
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:42.720]   You there's at this point you spent nothing. There is no obligation if you want to move forward with one of the quotes
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:45.200]   You say, uh, you know
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:50.480]   I won't I don't want to name any particular insurance company. So I won't but we've we found one we say wow, that's great
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.640]   Yes, let's move forward with this
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.640]   Uh, then the insurance company you select reviews your details to confirm the final price
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:02.640]   They have to do the full underwriting thing in some cases that may involve a phone call with gabby or a phone call with a company
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:10.240]   Uh, we didn't have to do any phone calls, but we did have they did adjust the price. We ended up saving just about two thousand dollars
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:15.280]   I think one thing I really loved they looked at the car insurance and they said, you know what you're getting the best deal
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.280]   We could find good job
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.680]   That was kind of nice too. They didn't try to you know
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:23.200]   Uh, bait and switch or anything that you said look you're already getting the best price
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:30.080]   So that made me feel good. We had a good we had good car insurance. We got a great deal on our home owners on average gabby customers save
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:32.880]   961 per year
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.760]   961 dollars
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:39.200]   In your pocket on average on car and home insurance
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:43.680]   If they can't find you savings as they did with the auto insurance to let you know
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:46.480]   So and actually that's a nice feeling, you know, hey, I got a good rate
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:49.200]   They never sell your info
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:52.880]   Uh, I used a special phone number and a special
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:58.160]   Email address as I always do when I try these things out to see if they're going to sell it
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:03.040]   Never not one call no spam. They really do keep it private
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:07.600]   This is a great thing. I want you to know about it. I want you to try it
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:13.600]   If you're not overpaying it'll be nice to know but if you are overpaying and on average most people are by as much as
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.760]   961
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:19.360]   Gabby can save you gabby.com/twig
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:25.120]   Gabby.com/twig as I said, uh, we got the uh, we got the insurance pack at last week in the mail
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:32.400]   Signed off save 2,000 bucks right off the bat. That's fantastic. That is a nice feeling. Thank you gabby.com
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.720]   slash
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.640]   Twig we appreciate your support of this weekend
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:39.600]   Gabby. Gabby is the new gift. Gabby. Gabby
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:49.760]   Is sent me saying it's pronounced gabby. Well, they said it's pronounced gab. I and I said, okay. Good. Thanks. Thanks for clarifying
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:58.000]   I think they don't mind either way. Hano says gabby. How would you say with an australian accent?
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.240]   Gabby might get it get it. Gabby Gabby Gabby
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:08.960]   Um, all right. All right. All right. What did you want to talk about? Oh, yes, the White House has said
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.920]   Yes, there's an issue
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.720]   Uh with uh chips with a shortage and we want to see what we can do about it. Tell us about that Stacy. You can
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:19.520]   about them
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:28.960]   I hear him you did say here's I hear nothing. I just see her. Sorry. Okay. Okay
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:32.240]   Tell us about that Stacy
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:35.840]   All right for those of you who are not just riveted by the chip industry
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:41.040]   There has been a huge shortage of semiconductors not
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:45.760]   The New York Times actually reported it early on the automotive side
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:51.600]   So people actually can't make cars right now because they don't have enough. It's amazing. Isn't it? Yeah
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:56.720]   Yes, and this is happening in Europe and so everybody's going to like TSMC and other
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.520]   fact cases are audience knows it because they can't get graphics cards
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:05.040]   Uh, they can't there's a whole bunch of stuff. That was the next thing. So it's not just cars
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:11.680]   GSM chips are in short supply. Why buy chips are so hard to find so like your wise can
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:18.160]   They actually were like we're not going to do it. He's in launching more Wi-Fi products for a while because we can't get the chips
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:24.400]   Some of this is cobia actually there was though and I didn't know about this until Alex Lindsey told me
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:28.720]   And maybe you didn't either Stacy. I don't know if there was a big fire
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.680]   at one of the
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.760]   big chip
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.760]   factories october 20th
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.880]   in japan
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.880]   This is the a kg
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:51.200]   Audiosemiconductor factory they make dac digital analog converters and adc's analog digital converters used almost everywhere
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:55.200]   All the employees got out, but the factory was destroyed
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.160]   And and that's another source
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:01.920]   Uh, it's going to be offline for at least six months
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:09.680]   So in the next for that was in october so october in of ember december maybe it'll come online next month of the month after
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.280]   but
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.080]   That affects tons of stuff including cars
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:21.840]   Yeah, that's like a basic component because exactly you're analog. Yeah, that's the real world digital is your computing world and you got to translate
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.080]   to anyway
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.440]   so
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.760]   Biden administration's coming in and
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.000]   Europe is actually doing the same thing they're they're trying to figure out well, what do we how do we tell?
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.560]   You know the chinese government
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.760]   Please
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:41.680]   Get get Taiwan on the you know, how do we tell china? How do we tell Taiwan?
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.600]   How do we tell Japan to get their factories?
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:49.440]   Not only operational but sending the products to us and not their own customer or not
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:55.200]   Not their local customers. So this is one of those executive orders. They're a little controversial
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:01.920]   Uh this afternoon biden is going to sign the executive order. He did he signed it. Oh, he did sign it. Okay. He signed it now
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:08.400]   Do we have the actual language of the executive order? Yeah, the order includes I do have it. I'm a this is from cnbc
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:14.480]   Uh biden signs executive order to just chip shortage through a review to strengthen supply chains
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.680]   The order includes a 100 day review of key products
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.680]   semiconductors and advanced batteries in electric vehicles
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:25.440]   Followed by a broader long-term review of six sectors of the economy
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:33.440]   Uh allowing for policy recommendations to strengthen supply chains with the goal of quickly implementing the suggestions
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:40.160]   This action follows calls from bipartisan members of congress and industry leaders warning about the potential consequences
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.720]   Of the semiconductor shortage
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:47.840]   So and this is a big deal and right now just to add a little bit more context
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:55.120]   There is actually a group of activist investors coming after intel saying they should divest themselves of the manufacturing
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.280]   capabilities
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:57.760]   Uh
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:04.240]   Intell famously their new cdo pack gelsinger is the one that's going to decide that at some point so I think so
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:10.640]   Having this sort of political, you know, it's the opposite of a tailwind helping them
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.600]   You know, then that off will be good. But here in the us we have actually
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:23.920]   Several high-end plants. Sam song has a 300 millimeter fab that's running at a pretty high process node micron
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.880]   They make memory. They've got excellent fabs here in the us
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:32.400]   But we don't actually have a lot of the smaller components. We have a couple
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.920]   Really ancient fabrication plants
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.360]   Uh
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.840]   That do some analog chips, but we
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:44.080]   79 percent or almost 80 percent I believe
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.720]   Of the chips made
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.920]   Today are made not in the us. They are made in
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.800]   Taiwan or china or Japan
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:57.840]   And so only about according to the semiconductor industry association 12.5
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.720]   Of semiconductors are made in the us
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:08.160]   Speedy there you go 79 percent are in asia. Yeah, but can you solve this with a stroke of a pen stacey? I mean
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:13.760]   So what you're gonna have to do is build or retrofit more fabs and I will tell you right now
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.080]   We have fabs in this country that people are not
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:23.520]   That that have just lying dormant or getting transitioned to like they're not shopping malls, but data centers or something else
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.480]   Um, the other thing is fabs are very expensive. Yeah, even
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.520]   And
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.440]   They take a long time to build you need access to a lot of fresh and clean water
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:42.320]   So there's a lot of like new york is really big into this because they actually they poached it from austin y'all
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:48.720]   They stole semi. Uh, it was the innovation center that was established in the 80s in austin
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:53.040]   It helped create actually austin as a tech map or tech kind of juggernaut
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:59.360]   And it was the equipment and manufacturing industry association for the semiconductor industry
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.600]   New york stole it
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:07.040]   Um, and now new york is you know gonna try to finagle some money and whatnot to probably
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.920]   I'm guessing produce or build fabrication plants there
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:17.360]   We talked about this last week did we the tsmc bought a thousand acres of land in north phoenix
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.600]   In december, they're gonna start a 12 billion dollar fab
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:28.480]   Uh, which won't go online as you exactly as you said it's expensive and it takes a long time to build for a few years
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:34.400]   But we'll make as many as 1900 jobs there and but this is you know, that's a few years off. I mean
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.520]   This is the kind of problem. I don't think you can solve right real quickly. Can you?
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.480]   So what when i'm talking to my sources who are having trouble a couple things and actually my guest this week on the podcast is talking about this
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.880]   um on the consumer side
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.680]   For like consumer devices
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:59.280]   What they're having to do is put down more like order more in advance. So that's why apple is not suffering a shortage
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.320]   They went to tsmc and bought their entire production
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:06.560]   They said we'll take it all and they bought so much they could lock it in
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:15.920]   So smaller so what's going to happen is if demand doesn't so they're gonna they're buying more chip like a year and a half's worth of chips
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:20.400]   So in another year or so if demand hasn't you know
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:27.440]   They demand his fallen or is it meeting what they thought they would you're gonna see some great sales on electronic devices. That's it
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.440]   So
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.360]   From a policy perspective. I mean
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.240]   The old point is obviously that you can't solve this overnight
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.920]   but if you're trying to have over the next few years a
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:46.160]   Policy that would help our strategic requirements here. What would that look like? Any idea? Is it just tax breaks? Is it?
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.720]   Yeah, you you start building in the us right
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:52.000]   So there's a couple things you
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:59.840]   Like arizona is a terrible place to make chips. It's great because the land is cheap. You mentioned the water. Water is expensive. Yeah
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:06.800]   So you see them in like Idaho origin is where intel has been making theirs, right?
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:13.520]   They have they have fabs they have fabs in both actually their their next generation fab is actually in Chandler, Arizona
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.960]   um
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:21.280]   So yes, you should but cities already do this like in Austin when we were vying for fabs
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:28.000]   We gave them everything when samson was looking at their advanced 300 millimeter fab that they put in Austin
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:34.320]   the city was like uh, yes, you want land will give you a land you need guaranteed access to water
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:38.320]   We'll give this to you by the way in texas during the power outages
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:43.120]   We lost a samson plant. We lost a t s or not a t s sub to the ti plant
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:48.160]   We lost actually a couple semiconductor plants for like a week because they were offline because of the power shortage
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.160]   Is it a power? It's not going to help. Yep
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.720]   and water
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.720]   taxes
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:58.240]   I know but yeah strategically all you can do is I mean
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:05.120]   Hopefully this will get the activist investors off of intel's back. I guess. I mean like you don't want to fight
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.360]   You don't want to fight the government, right?
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:10.560]   um two tax breaks three
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:16.800]   Even even pinpointing and saying hey, this is going to be a focus of ours is going to help
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:22.480]   And then some of these things we can't solve like access to rare earth minerals for batteries, right?
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:24.880]   I mean, we don't have those stores
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:28.960]   So maybe we stop pissing off china quite so badly. I don't know
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:35.840]   Yeah, this isn't there is no short-term solution and that's what the auto industry's saying and there's going to be big shortages and cars this year and so forth
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.440]   but
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:42.800]   Of course, that doesn't mean you don't do anything. It just means there's nothing you can do that's going to help in the long short term
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:46.560]   But you could start thinking in the long term about how do we solve this?
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.120]   Uh, and I think that's what the hundred-day review is
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.680]   uh designed to do
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:58.000]   Um and acknowledging that we can't make everything here too. You also have to work with your international partners as you mentioned for rare earth
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.160]   Materials and so forth. Uh, it's important for defense as much as uh, it is for private industry
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:11.760]   So administration officials will met with automakers are in discussions with foreign counterparts on ways to increase increased
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.320]   ChIP supplies in the near term
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.400]   um
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.600]   Detroit
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:22.160]   General Motors has shuttered three plants in north america
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:25.440]   From february 8th to at least mid-march
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:30.720]   Four to seen production disruptions in the past several weeks of its pickup the f-150
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:36.800]   Uh, I guess i'm lucky. I got the car id it because it has a lot of batteries in it and a lot of electronics
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:42.080]   But they built it uh late last year and I wonder
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:48.160]   So this is uh, yeah, i'm glad I look it's just i'm just
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:54.960]   I'm glad that we have somebody in the white house who at least is paying attention to this stuff anyway, yeah
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:00.720]   Whether they can make a difference well, that's gonna depend
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:06.720]   Uh, we can put some fabs in coal lines in west virginia, but we can solve a few problems
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.800]   There you go. Put the miners to work
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:15.440]   The pixel four saved an unconscious man from being trapped in an overturned vehicle for hours. No, not tiger woods
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.400]   Uh, the a reddit user
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:22.480]   You post no spam his real name is chuck walker
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:28.240]   Posted on reddit about his experience with car crash detection on his pixel pixel phone
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:34.400]   He was in an accident on his property in mazuri with a bobcat lower not a car a bobcat lower
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.040]   You have a machinery rolled off
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:42.080]   ledge and fell into a small ravine landing upside down you want to see the picture
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:45.040]   Wow
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.280]   Upside down he was trapped
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.000]   um
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.360]   Injured
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:55.200]   The emergency exit was blocked on the bobcat the main exit blocked
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:19:00.880]   Seven broken ribs four broken thoracic vertebrae. He had a pixel four xl
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.600]   By the way, I got a fine mine
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.560]   Now that i read this
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:13.040]   Even though the phone was thrown out of reach during the accident it was enough to trigger trigger car crash detection
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.760]   the phone uh
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.760]   contacted 911
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.440]   It's awesome. He was unconscious
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:23.360]   But when he woke up he yelled for help only to hear through his bluetooth earbud
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.920]   Which apparently survived the rollover that an emergency dispatcher was connected
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.800]   And it already sent rescue services
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:36.080]   And you say technology is a bad thing. I do not
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:42.720]   None of us have ever said that jeff never not once i say facebook's a bad thing
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:46.960]   I really want to find my pixel. I like start carrying that around
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.360]   So if you have it if you have a pixel phone
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:54.240]   Look for the safety app
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:20:00.720]   And in that app settings there's an option for car crash detection is not on by default. I guess he had turned it on
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:06.080]   Um, it was originally exclusive to the pixel for public service here. How do we turn it on safety app?
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.960]   Open it up
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:12.560]   And in the settings for the safety app there's a car crash detection option
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:18.960]   I've never turned an pixel three four at idea five four a four a five ga
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:24.080]   This this article from nine to five google implies that you already have the safety app
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:28.640]   But if you don't see it, maybe you do have to I don't see it, but I don't know. I also don't see it
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:31.200]   Downloaded is it a setting
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:37.040]   Uh, maybe it's in settings here's a picture here's a picture personal safety
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:42.080]   Send status updates during emergency sharing and then turn on car crash detection
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.160]   Um
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:47.440]   I'm going to settings. Yeah, maybe you have to maybe you have to download the
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:52.400]   Personal safety there is no app to download. Well, I don't know what they're talking about
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:55.840]   I looked for the safety app and did not see anything
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:00.960]   I don't know
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:05.680]   I thought it was a personal safety. Wait a second. Wait a second. I went to
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:09.680]   Uh open no, I went to
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:15.280]   Settings I then searched for safety and I see a personal safety app here
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:19.120]   Continue as me. No, why would I don't want to continue as me? I'll continue as me
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:23.360]   Me is it under?
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:27.600]   Where is it under settings? Yeah, I thought it was in all I thought it was in a wist contacts
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:33.200]   Oh safety my uh, I just found out that my pixel four is at home. So I can't help you here
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:36.160]   Thank goodness find my phone works though
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:39.680]   I know no where it is
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:41.520]   I
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:45.840]   Forgot I had that are you are any of you neurotic like I am if I go out to mail
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:51.520]   Okay, just find it stays
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.920]   I found it, but I had to I had to search for safety and it is called personal safety
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:00.160]   But then the dentist AC I didn't find the I didn't find the auto thing in there
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:07.040]   So minus some settings minus enabled already. Oh good permissions contacts. Oh good all my
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:12.800]   Oh, but I am denying it my location. So it won't help me. Yeah, he'll send them the wrong spot
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:17.920]   That's right. They say that in the article too. Make sure you turn on location permissions. Yep
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:24.160]   And I also denied the microphone yours is already enabled. Maybe so it starts set up
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:28.160]   And physical activity access
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.360]   Interesting
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:36.480]   All right
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:42.080]   What were you saying when you are wife and she'll think it's a spam call and not answer it
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:46.080]   Yeah, were you saying jeff you don't even go to check your mail without your phone?
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:52.240]   Yeah, just in case I have a heart attack in the yard. It's a good idea. I'm neurotic. That's a very good idea
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:56.000]   Yeah, I can't actually this is my car key. So I
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.440]   I can't go anywhere without my phone because it opens the car for me and starts the engine
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:06.080]   Which is a nice fancy really uncomfortable
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:12.480]   Like if you lost your phone you have a key though, right? Yeah, so you get so this is where this is that new Ford Mustang Machia
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.560]   I got you get one fob
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:21.440]   And I said what this is it. They said yeah, you only get one because you can have up to four phones act as a key
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:25.920]   But I thought but yeah, I had the same thing like well, what if the batteries did
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:30.880]   So it turns out the car also has a password that you can use to drive
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:36.320]   So when you so you set up when you get in the car the first time you you give it a there's a
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:39.840]   Keypad on the door that you can notice open the door that won't start the car
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:44.880]   But then there's a button you can push on the car and you type in the password on the key on the on-screen keyboard
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:49.120]   And then the car drives. So I feel I feel like I leave the fob at home now
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:54.800]   I don't feel like I need the phone is the phone is it talking to the cloud because like if you're in a parking garage where there's
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:56.800]   No service blue tooth. Okay
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.400]   So now I just doesn't have to talk to the cloud when you set it up
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:05.200]   It's setting up a it set us up a secured token on here, but that's only where we're setting it up
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:07.280]   Okay
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:12.720]   Because like I can't start my tesla from my phone without a cloud connection. Yes. Yes. I know yes
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:16.640]   I remember that the tesla app will let you start the car, but this is different
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:21.360]   This is like apple has a similar process. It only works with a couple of BMWs right now
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:24.800]   Uh, but that the phone is a car key using bluetooth le
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.360]   So as I approach the car with my phone the car lights up
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:36.080]   Um, I can push the button open the door. I get it happy to see you. It's like it's happy to see you. It actually is kind of cute
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:40.640]   It's a nice feature. You would you would like this Mustang?
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:43.200]   Stacy, I think it's a very
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:47.360]   Uh, it has many it's like they learned from the tesla. I think they probably stole everything they could
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:51.520]   All right, what are you driving?
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.320]   A purple Jeep. What are you driving?
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.320]   No
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:00.880]   My my car still requires an actual key. Yeah, there's no key
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:07.200]   There's no key for the door. There's no in fact, you know the fob will have that emergency key you can pull out of the fob
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:10.720]   On mine. It's just there's nothing. It's on it's on it's on
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:13.520]   Stick
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:15.840]   I know there's nowhere to put it
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:18.160]   Fancy fancy
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:23.120]   Kids today and they're like what is this? What's that? What's that? Is this how you open that the front?
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:26.960]   It is if you think of it a key is very medieval
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:31.120]   Like yes, I have machined this metal in such a way
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:36.400]   Only only it can open this door is it's a crazy idea
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.880]   Really
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.880]   It worked for a long
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:45.840]   Worked for hundreds of years sure did yeah, but I drive a Chrysler 300
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:51.840]   A nice car too. I always say oh somebody fancy's visit in the studio and when aunt pulls up
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.240]   That's a fancy guy
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:26:00.320]   It looks fancy. It looks fancy. No my car is a beater. It looks like a limousine
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:08.960]   It's like you think the dark ages or dark ages they're not the key was invented between the years of 870 and 900
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:13.360]   Wow attributed to an English craftsman theodorus of Samos
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.920]   Oh, that's what I often call my kid invented. I'm sorry. It was invented
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:22.480]   The first full all metal locks appear between 87900
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:27.760]   The key was my samos of Samos in the sixth century BC BC BC
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:31.360]   BC so it is more than medieval it's
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.120]   Almost prehistoric prehistoric yeah
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:46.240]   Portland has decided they don't want a smart city either you remember google sidewalk smart city was rejected by toronto now
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:49.280]   the google smart city plan for portland
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:51.840]   Oregon also sidewalk labs
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.640]   It well is this phenyl technology called replica replica
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.240]   Yeah, so it's yeah
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:03.520]   They spun out a company for mobility data called replica and kind of the same reason why they just rejecting yeah
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:08.560]   Because replica did not want to share data with the city at the level the city wanted
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:12.240]   Well, it didn't want to share how it built its own place
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:18.160]   Portland was the wrong place. It was also rejected by Kansas City
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.520]   Oh, wow
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:23.440]   Why you're getting all hottie about Portland replicas told the bbc
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:28.240]   It was unwilling to share data to the level of detail requested by the city at replica
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:32.480]   We believe better insights should not come at the cost of personal privacy
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:40.880]   We were not willing to compromise our privacy principles which frustrated our portland metro client and ultimately led to an early end of the project
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:43.680]   Bye bye
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:49.680]   You know, that's interesting that the it wasn't the google spin-off that was trying to spy on people
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:52.720]   Well, I guess it was but they didn't want to share with the city
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:58.400]   It was I think they were worried about their algorithms. They didn't want to share how they were
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:02.800]   Deriving the insights that that's not what they're saying. They're saying the city wanted the data
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:10.000]   Okay, the software used unidentifiable non-identifiable mobile data location
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:13.840]   Mobile location data show people show people move through a city
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:17.840]   The plan was to use the data to make policy decisions about where to build bike lanes
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:23.360]   How and when to repair roads? This would be great and then make sure bus services were be would be efficient
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:28.880]   And reaching all communities fast company reported there were concerns about a lack of transparency
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:31.520]   around how the technology worked
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:37.760]   So maybe you're yeah, maybe we're hearing stories from different stories from each side
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:42.160]   Like google's google replicas saying they wanted all the information
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:46.240]   And the city's saying we wanted to know where that information came from
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:50.960]   Is it too expensive to just put things down throughout the city?
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:56.000]   It's a lot more expensive if everybody's carrying these things and think about it. You don't have to do anything
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:01.120]   You just have to you got this phenomenal you get the location data much better than those little rubber by the way
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:04.960]   Ironic that's how that was bill gates first business
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:08.640]   draft old data he and uh
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:15.440]   Paul allen when they were in high school created a company remember you've seen those little rubber
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:22.480]   Things on the street. Yeah, trapho data was a built partnership between bill gates paul and a paul gillbert in the 70s
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:28.480]   To read the data from those traffic counters so that traffic engineers could decide what kind of
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:35.840]   You know use the road was guess okay. I figured these two those things still work quite efficiently and effectively
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:37.840]   Yeah rubber hoses
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.160]   They create. Oh, yeah, uh air pulses
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:42.800]   recorded by a roadside counter
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:46.800]   In the 70s it counts for mechanically recorded on a roll of paper tape
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:51.520]   When they were in high school paul on and bill gates
[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:56.320]   Decided they could process the data cheaper and faster than the local companies
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:59.200]   So they had classmates
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:04.800]   nerds classmates to read the whole patterns in the paper tape
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:14.240]   Transcribe it onto computer cards and then used a computer borrowed a computer time at the university of washington to produce the traffic flowcharts
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:19.360]   Paul allen's father was a librarian at uw. That's how they were able to get that computer
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:23.040]   Of course of course. Yep
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.040]   Yep
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:28.320]   Uh, anyway, I know how how we oh yes sidewalk replica
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:35.840]   Portland yeah, there's a so there's a red red tail media. Dot org though a woman who has been covering this since I guess day one
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:43.120]   It looks like a he said she said yeah, and if you read that this story is epically long, but it goes into a lot of depth
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:48.400]   Damage to trust
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:54.400]   It's damaged to trust you know this sounds very much like the he said she said in in uh in toronto
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:58.320]   There's just these there's just some sort of mismatch between
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:05.120]   City government and these uh these uh, I think it's because cities cities have to do two things
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:11.120]   They have to provide a service that their people their their constituents can understand
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:13.040]   and two
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:16.720]   They are accountable to these people so they have to provide
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:22.000]   Information about what that is and if they can't get those things they don't want to do the project
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:28.160]   But I have to point out sometimes cities are a little grasping also because for instance
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:35.440]   Uh, it's happened in a number of cities that the the data about mass transit like subways and buses
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:43.200]   Which really should be public data the cities are withholding from google maps and others because they want to make their own app
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:46.720]   For when the subway or the bus is coming next
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.320]   Uh
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.720]   Instead of letting this be part of a map app
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:54.720]   And that's but I my opinion that's public data. They should they don't own that data
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:32:02.720]   That's uh, that's everybody's data and if google wants to put it in our case there's there's there was a wonderful case where
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:09.280]   If you go to pen station for a train you see a whole bunch of people like this
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:11.680]   Ready to run
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:16.320]   Because they never tell you where the train I hate that he's coming in until like two minutes before
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:20.640]   So everybody runs down. So this guy came along with this great thing and he said, okay
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:27.680]   I'm going to look at the history of where the 476 to run cock-a-mock comes. That's actually long island, but it sounds fun
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:29.280]   um
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:31.280]   And i'm going to tell you the odds
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:38.160]   Of you know, you have 93 percent odds that you're track three so you stand by track three so 93 percent of the time you win
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:39.680]   the
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:41.680]   nj transit tried to stop him
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:48.400]   And sis that was coming to like private data owned data and the courts said uh-uh no
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.040]   So he still has a service. It's great
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:59.200]   Good. Yeah, the cities are not necessarily always acting in the best interest of their of the voters. I was you're in privacy
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:02.320]   I always say that government is not your friend when it comes to privacy government wants
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:06.000]   A trove of data and you don't know what they're going to do with it. I'm
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.760]   libertarian
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:08.800]   but
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:15.840]   Good news. Sam's I was just announced that galaxy phones and other products like tablets launched in the last two years since 2019
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.720]   Will now receive four years of security
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:24.400]   Updates that's better than google which only I think does two years. Oh, that's really good. Thank you samsung
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:27.360]   balls in your court google
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:29.840]   Did they um explain why they're doing that?
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:34.240]   Uh, I don't know but I guess it has something to do with
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:40.880]   Loss of market share to apple because people think that android phones aren't very safe
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:46.480]   Uh, and they're right in some cases, you know that these these patches are important
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:50.560]   Um, I would bet it's also the business market stacy
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.480]   I would guess you know because the business
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:58.400]   Samsung's trying to get you know businesses because I think knocks and so forth are you know trustworthy reliable
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:05.040]   And this probably has a lot to do with it as well. Go ahead. Well, I wondered if because the eu is actually looking at adopting
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:06.880]   the
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:10.000]   Planned obsolescence law that france had enacted
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:16.720]   A long time ago. So the eu has been talking a lot about that and one of the things under that law is actually
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:24.000]   Dictating how long a device should be useful for so I I just wondered if that was maybe driving
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.320]   Something like this
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:32.880]   Because theoretically it could your pixels were go out of support after three years three years our pixels I should say
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:35.600]   Yeah with the with the iphone
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:39.360]   What's what's their service? Is it forever because I don't know
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:42.480]   I don't think they have an official policy
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:47.760]   There gets to be a point where you can't put the latest operating system on an iphone
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:50.320]   And I that you know that happens
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:56.720]   That happens with android too. Yeah, it happened, but it's it's I don't know if apple says we're not going to support it after a fixed
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:00.640]   Period of time. I think at some point they say oh you can't put ios
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.400]   14 on a iphone 4
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:13.920]   Actually the iOS 14 is for thank you scooter x it's five years on ios ios 14 is iphone six s or later
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:16.400]   Okay
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:21.040]   Cool so security goes on that's for os update security go on so goes on a little bit after that
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:26.000]   It's good to see that sam sung is doing this because a lot of people
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:33.840]   Just can't afford to buy phones especially thousand dollar phones and when they opt to buy those less expensive phones
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:41.040]   Security is always the the topic of discussion and you know people are saying well panned extra money for that
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:47.280]   iOS device is giving me peace right because i'm going to continue to get the security that's right
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:49.760]   uh actually
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:54.480]   Interestingly sam sung has had that four-year policy in place for enterprise devices
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:57.920]   Four over a year so that it was it was
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:03.840]   In response to enterprise, but it now is to all it's for all users, which I think is really good
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.640]   And I bet you google adds a year to there
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:11.840]   Many many uh android phones don't even have two years, you know, it's like
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:15.200]   All right
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:19.920]   They're low cost devices. I love to not be able to get rid of my phone. I know which you have a three or four
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:24.320]   I have a three a but I still like it. It's a great phone. I remember it's still works
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:28.560]   It is it's ridiculous that we have to get rid of these phones every couple of years
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:32.960]   That's just not it's not good for the environments not good for us. Would we move to the blob?
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:35.920]   The blobs
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.320]   And we're gonna call it stasis blob
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:45.760]   Stasis blob excellent stasis blobs got it going on there's even a song for it. It's great already
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:50.320]   Uh, would you like to do a changelog?
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:54.000]   Or do you want to talk about twitter?
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.440]   What about one little story here?
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:01.440]   Yeah, go ahead twitter the twitter's good
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:04.320]   What's that and and
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:06.160]   TikTok twitter
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:08.160]   What is it? What do you want to do?
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:11.840]   We're fries fries. Oh the end of the line on fries. That's so sad
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:15.760]   Fries electronics, it's only important to people in Texas in California
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:21.360]   They didn't fries jeff used to be a grocery store at first and then they moved to electronics
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:28.720]   Uh, and then all the fries the fries stores in the Bay Area anyway had a theme like there was an Egyptian one
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:31.840]   Cowboys
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:37.120]   Southern California was to do that too. Okay. Yeah, sad sad to see here's a list of the
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:40.720]   Thank you again scooter xr unofficial producer
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:44.480]   Here's a list of all these store themes in phoenix
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:49.760]   It was an Aztec temple in Anaheim. It was the space shuttle in burbank 1950s
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:52.560]   science fiction ancient egypt and campbell
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:56.000]   ruins of ancient roman fountain valley
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:01.040]   For the freemont fries store, which I think was the first one the 1893 world's fair
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:07.200]   What a good idea. This was such a cool store. It geeks would go there. I have to admit
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:12.720]   Maybe that the products necessarily weren't the greatest ever
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:15.600]   um, I remember
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:17.920]   they
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:20.720]   People were buying refurbished hard drives
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.800]   fries
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.320]   Yeah
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:26.320]   Things like that
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:31.840]   Almost a hobby of supermarket. So it was 1972 charles fries sold fries supermarkets
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:37.120]   In california to dillens. He gave a portion of the proceeds brought people a million to each of his sons
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:38.960]   john
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:41.840]   And randy and w rand all yeah randy
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.520]   um
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.520]   And then they decided to open
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:52.000]   An electronics store. Oh, and so it's been around since the mid-80s. Okay, sunny vale was okay first
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.720]   I remember going to this fries sunny vale all the time
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:56.880]   So much fun
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.960]   What was the last time you went into one sir? Oh ages. I haven't been in a store
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:10.000]   You know, I was all I was online last night and I kept seeing breaking fries as close as breaking fries as close
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.280]   I'm thinking
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:15.280]   I'm not even from here and never been into a fries
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:19.680]   But from what i've been here and as people haven't really been going to those stores
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:27.840]   For these amazon and new egg. I mean, right. You don't need to go to what you expect. It's not breaking
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:31.120]   I mean, i'm sorry who's going into live fans to make a pc
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:37.520]   Yeah, I used to do their ads in san francisco your best computer buys are always
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:39.440]   at fries
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.960]   guaranteed
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:42.960]   those pipes
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:49.280]   I tried to get the the whole you know, all the fries account for all fries stores
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:53.760]   But I never got I only got the san francisco stores this bay area stores
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:57.280]   But I love doing those ads they would write like
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:00.960]   A little moment they would write 3,000 words of copy in a 60 word ad
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:03.440]   You would be going so fast
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:09.120]   But he always had time at the end and say your best computer buys are always at fries guaranteed
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:11.520]   hmm
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:14.080]   Sad sad sad
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:18.480]   Uh, let's do the well, okay, but before we do the
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:21.760]   I guess you want to twitter. I wish you probably do some twitter stories
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:25.760]   I don't know I feel like I don't want to do any anything short shrift
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:29.680]   Birders are fighting over celebrity birds on twitter
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:32.800]   That's not the one I would have gone to
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:36.640]   So the problem is it's got born minting in here
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:39.520]   So
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:44.240]   So we have celebrity birds and like the mandarin duck in new york and people take pictures of it
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:50.160]   And and on the one hand that that increases the the ranks of birders who love birds on the other hand
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:56.720]   hordes come to watch the poor duck and scare that it's the instagram problem. You can't go anywhere
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:02.000]   Famous anymore without people barging in and taking instagram photos of it
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.480]   It just can't be a fancy duck anymore. It just doesn't want it can't be a fancy duck anymore
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:10.640]   Dorsey says twitter needs to go all in
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:14.400]   On i thought you were gonna do subscriptions
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:20.080]   Yeah, I think i will you actually i'll go ahead
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.600]   So I have a loyal following
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:28.080]   I would think of moving my newsletter and doing it with twitter they'll have a newsletter right they bought that newsletter review
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:32.560]   And I was already evaluating it before they bought it so I was like that
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:38.560]   Um, I'm seriously five bucks a month you do that right makes sense. Keep your keep your oh wait
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:44.640]   No, it depends on if I can keep my ads. I don't actually want to do a subscription. Never mind. I don't want to do a subscription
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:49.360]   No, no, no, no, no, but this is this is my issue. We'll fix it in post
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:42:02.640]   So is the idea I mean look they can't make you pay for twitter that's not gonna work
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:05.360]   Right. Maybe they make you
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:12.720]   Last week this artist i would pay for a premium level right of curation
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:19.200]   Um, I died especially pay a special filter. That's what we were talking about last week. Yeah. Yeah
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:21.280]   Um
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:24.800]   Here's the twitter twins. Do you want to see the twitter twins will put
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:32.320]   Oh, I have to log in there. You know, it's marketing SBS. You got to download it. No, I never mind. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.400]   No, don't I should have taken them out of there
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:38.560]   It's like people care about their health. Oh, really?
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:42.560]   California
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:48.240]   After health hashtag after adjut pie robbed us of our net neutrality regulations
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.120]   Was that 2017
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:53.600]   2018
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:56.000]   California enacted the open internet law
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.400]   Uh
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:02.080]   But it was immediately challenged in court by take a guess
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:04.960]   Who might have challenged that?
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:06.800]   18 t
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:11.280]   Comcast for rise and yeah, they don't like they didn't like that
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:14.640]   So and by the way the trump your adjustis department
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:17.440]   sued to block them
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:23.440]   Uh, there were lawsuits all over the case has remained in legal limbo for years
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:30.000]   Uh until the democrats took control of the white house just as department withdrew the case
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.800]   That's the beginning on tuesday a federal judge in california
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:39.360]   Sided with the state in a ruling that net neutrality supporters saw as a major win
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:46.640]   The judge found the law is on solid legal foundation that isp's trying to overturn it are not likely to prevail
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:50.640]   She rejected a request for injunctive relief
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:56.240]   from the communications association the cti a the ncta and us telecom
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:58.400]   and
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:02.720]   Incidentally, it always sounds like you have pink eye. I know I want injunctive relief, please
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:05.360]   There's a salve for that
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:08.000]   um
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.800]   So jessica worsen worsl who is besides having the best name in the world
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:15.680]   Rosen rosen worsl said
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:18.480]   Oh
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:26.320]   Oh, it's rosen worsl. Oh, that's not it's rosen worsl. I thought it was rosen worsl. Okay. Anyway, I think rosen worsl is a pretty good thing
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:30.320]   She's didn't know I love the name and I and actually she's a great she was a great commissioner
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:34.560]   She was the only commissioner, you know who really got it as far as I was concerned
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:38.720]   And she of course was very much against the fcc withdrawing net neutrality regulation
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:40.560]   She's now the acting
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:45.680]   Chairwoman of the fcc hailing the decision in a tweet when the fcc
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:50.080]   Over my objection rolled back its net neutrality policy states like california
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:56.480]   Sought to fill the void with their own laws tonight at court in california decided the state law can go into effect
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:58.800]   That's right. It hasn't been in effect
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:02.880]   Two whole years
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:07.200]   This is big news she writes for open internet policy and by the way
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:11.440]   Gotta love an fcc chairperson who understands hashtags
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:14.640]   Hashtag net neutrality hashtag open internet
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:24.320]   She's also doing she's put forth an effort to do a better broadband map. Go Jessica rosen worsl rosen worsl
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:29.840]   rosen worsl rosen worsl rosen worsl rosen worsl rosen worsl rosen worsl rosen
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:38.240]   She is incredibly well informed and she's really good. Yeah, she's why is she not the chairman
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:41.840]   What what is that? Why is she the acting chairman? What is the deal there?
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:48.480]   I don't think they can do a chairman until they get their next commissioner and oh, yes commissioner is a while off
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:51.040]   Yeah, so it's supposed to be
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:57.520]   Two democrats two republicans and then the president gets to name the chair, but they have to fill all those seats first right something like that
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.680]   I believe so okay
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:03.600]   But she's I mean she's doing an auction so I mean
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:10.320]   As much as she can she's doing she's created the $50 credit as part of the it's about time. Yeah
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:13.040]   Yes, what about rick clow
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:18.800]   So he has a new job. He is the california state chief technology innovation officer. I love rick clow
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:21.440]   rick clow rick clow

[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:47.200]   And really good rick is i've known rick since feed burner days. He was very supportive of twit really nice guy
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:53.200]   And he's now the chief technology innovation officer for the state of california bravo rick

[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:59.600]   It's nice when the the good guys uh the good guys win
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:06.000]   Uh, feeburger that man a taco bell chicken sandwich. Mm-hmm. Is feeburger still around?
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.440]   I don't think so. No, I thought the way of uh
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:15.600]   Rss reader I thought it all went with that. Yeah for some reason when I go to feeburger
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000]   It does welcome me back
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.400]   in japanese
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:26.800]   Wow, it's still around this is it looks exactly like it did when rick was running the place
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:29.280]   copyright
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:30.880]   japanese
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.880]   refresh it
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:38.400]   Because i'm getting the same page, but not the japanese. Oh, see it just throws it. It does different stuff
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:42.720]   I see that's a saying my feet think the rotation doesn't look
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:47.840]   That's interesting. So you can this was the first podcast I ever created the tech guy
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:52.880]   I wonder if it's got the actual this turned things into rss
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:53.920]   Yeah
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:59.840]   So when I when I first started podcasting back in 2004 feed burner was an easy way to create the feed
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:02.480]   But obviously yeah, no one subscribes to it now
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:06.640]   It still exists. Yes google forgot to kill it
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:09.360]   Krugal apparently
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:12.640]   No
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:14.640]   Porat no
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:16.800]   Charby leave me alone
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:20.160]   Wow
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:22.240]   That's wild
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:25.280]   Somebody just had an alert go off in their office
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:32.080]   No, you're right. That's probably right. It's probably an app running on the
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:34.720]   Google code and
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:36.400]   Nobody's used it in
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:39.440]   10 years and all of a sudden they're gonna say well cut that thing out
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:43.520]   It's time for the google change log. Uh, yes
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:46.320]   change log
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:51.680]   Nice time in jammer. I wonder if stacey
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:54.560]   Will like this idea, you know, there was google
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:57.280]   Had youtube kids they still do
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:00.880]   But what happens when your kids get to 13 years old?
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:04.400]   Well now google has added a new supervised mode
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:08.000]   So I asked for this so long ago because I was like
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:10.560]   Every tech company out there is like, oh
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:18.640]   When you're 13, you're just suddenly an adult in the eyes of the tech room because of the and that is not true. Mm-hmm. So you got a tween
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:23.040]   Is she still a tween? She's a teen now officially
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:25.600]   officially
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:28.800]   A teen and so I mean I think that that's really true that
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:34.320]   Even at the age of 14 there's stuff on youtube you probably wouldn't want her to see so this new restricted mode
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:37.760]   Will allow you stuff on youtube. I don't even know
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:39.760]   I don't want to see yeah
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:47.840]   YouTube collaborated with parents and experts and child safety child development and digital literacy to develop the supervised account offering
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:51.200]   So how do you get to it?
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:53.200]   That's my question
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:57.520]   Uh, oh it's going to launch in beta in the coming months in more than 80 countries including the us
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:01.520]   There's oh, this is going to be part of a supervised google account
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.600]   So if you go to google for families help you can see how you can create a google account for your child
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:13.040]   That's nice because we were actually just I had created an email account for my daughter
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:17.360]   And I was asking her just like a couple weeks ago. I was like, hey, you're
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:22.800]   You're a 14 now you're a young woman. Do you want your own email account that you
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:26.320]   You're a woman now
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.960]   gotta sign up for the g-man account
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:34.800]   And and that was that was actually something we sat down to do so this is a little late for us
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:38.160]   But I mean I don't want to read her emails anymore
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:42.720]   But I do want to be able to check in every now and then and make sure does she not have a school
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:46.400]   Google account because somebody schools use google classroom for yes
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:48.400]   She does but google classrooms
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:55.040]   They you can't see it as a parent you don't get any access to that and that's all they don't do anything right fun there because no
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:57.040]   It's just class teachers can see it. Yeah
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:03.840]   So this is good you get search chrome gmail. You can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them and soon added
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:08.480]   This will be a version of youtube with some supervision as well. I think that's a really good thing
[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:13.840]   Google has some I didn't know this some lightweight html 5
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:16.400]   games
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:18.400]   They're calling game snacks
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:22.800]   They launched them last year by chicken and alipinos
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:26.000]   Does it have that alipinias
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:30.960]   Yes, there's not a tilde though over the end
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:34.640]   I think there is a jalapeno
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:36.080]   No
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:41.840]   Yeah, yeah, it's a male or a jalapeno. No, I can't I can't sit that's wrong. It's jalapeno

[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:07.760]   Pickles

[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:38.720]   Coming to androids. I guess androids 11. I don't this is the spring 2021 release
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:45.440]   Uh kind of like point releases on iOS where you get new functionality and features outside of the large
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:47.840]   You know yearly cycle
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:50.400]   A feature called password checkup
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:54.320]   Will be uh additive devices running androids 9 and up
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:58.320]   To alert you to passwords you you're using that have been exposed
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:01.120]   Uh that will work with autofill
[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:06.240]   You'll have to have autofill enabled to use that the scheduled send feature
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:10.800]   On google messages will allow you to compose a message ahead of time
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:13.360]   Oh, this is great
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:14.560]   if uh
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:16.560]   If you want to sneak around
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:22.000]   You can send or like if you're going to murder somebody you can have it have it send a message right
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.160]   You know your wife
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:33.680]   Have said a message right at the time when you're murdering the person saying oh, I'm stuck here at the gas station
[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:39.040]   But i'll be home in a bit. I just there's a long line and then you're you're golden
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:42.320]   Okay, just a little hint
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:45.760]   Did they talk about this on all about androids? I'm sure they did
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:48.000]   Uh
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:53.520]   To use this feature write the text as usual press and hold the send button to select a date and time to deliver the message
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:57.680]   You do have to have the latest version of android messages to do that
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:05.600]   I am interested in this in fact. I i'm gonna go home and try it my I have the new chromecast with google tv that new one with a remote
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:09.040]   They've now added an apple tv app which is wild
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:12.320]   My experience. Yes. What wait what?
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:17.040]   So now I can watch Ted lasso on my google tv such a great show
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:19.760]   Yeah, isn't it is a great show
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:20.800]   Um
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:25.360]   Starting tomorrow, I guess users with the 50-dollar chromecast with google tv adapter
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:29.840]   Will be able to I guess you'll have to install the apple tv app
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:32.240]   um and you and uh
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:35.280]   Do you have to subscribe? I think you probably do
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:38.640]   Um
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:43.760]   Yeah, that's not the same thing as the apple tv's set top box. It's the app for apple tv plus
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:46.880]   I guess so you get those shows, but that's nice
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:54.160]   Jetpack compose enters beta making android ui development easier enough said
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:57.440]   about that
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:59.280]   No idea
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:02.080]   google is bringing games to android auto and uh
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:06.480]   Just in time you can now play game. You know, I have android auto
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:09.120]   I should try this while you're driving your car
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:12.560]   There's trivia crack
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:16.320]   Not the best name
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:22.320]   I remember that game trivia crack. Yeah, you could play. I think do you really should you be playing this while you drive?
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:24.320]   That would be no
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:28.240]   It seems like say uh from now on say hey, you know who play a game
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:33.840]   And uh why he left because he couldn't play games on uh ways. Oh, that was it
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:40.480]   This is terrible. Well, you can't I mean no, uh, maybe it's voice only
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:45.040]   I don't care like especially with younger drivers
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:52.000]   You should not be distracted while driving in actually when you're older you are also bad because you think you're so confident
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.800]   But your tesla doesn't have uh, don't you have space invaders or something on your tesla?
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:00.480]   I don't know because I don't play games while i'm trying to drive
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:09.200]   Oh, you miss goody two shoes. Let me be playing games and I try to drive well, excuse me
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:15.520]   Um, I'm with you. Yeah pay attention. I agree. No, I agree 100
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:19.120]   Uh, I'm frozen in a pig
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:23.760]   Google calendar now lets you set split work hours
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:31.120]   And uh repeating out of office entries. That's good. This is really uh an acknowledgement of work from home. I think
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:35.440]   So you can uh, you could set an out of office entry
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:40.400]   That repeats over and over and over again
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:43.920]   I'm playing trivia crack go away
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:51.040]   Uh, this makes it a lot easier. So you know, I'm gonna always be being lunch at noon. You can have it automatically. Yeah, do that. I think that's good
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:57.840]   And I don't know if you've noticed on your gmail, but google chat suddenly popped up
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:04.640]   Yeah, not thrilled about that. Not thrilled about that. Lisa was all excited. She said we're getting rid of slack
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:09.920]   We're gonna all use google chat and then uh, I talked her out of it
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:17.760]   No, I still have hangouts on mine and I want chat. Yeah, like give me chat. Give me chat
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:25.040]   Yeah, it's it's right because we used to have hangouts there that chat and meet will all be there with your google uh gmail
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:27.680]   Uh, also on the mobile app apparently
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:30.880]   Oh, you know why you don't have it. Do you have a paid?
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:36.880]   Uh, google works base account. Yes, I do. I I want to kill it. This must be Andrew's idea
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:40.400]   No, it it was mine, but I'm
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:45.440]   Changing up all of my systems. It's I hate it. What would you prefer?
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:48.320]   Do you think?
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:56.320]   This has been my issue like am I gonna go off at office office 365 god? No, no, right. You know what you need
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:59.360]   super cute
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:05.920]   Okay, I can't decide why y'all think this is funny
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:08.400]   You're laughing too
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:12.480]   Well, it's just really random. I just don't know why it's all about the timing. Why?
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:15.520]   Oh, okay
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:17.680]   Don't you know comedy
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:24.640]   I am not funny. I'm just sincere. That's right. She is really sincere and I apologize
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:26.480]   Horribly sincere. We should not be
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:32.400]   Fooling around but you're like that teacher. You know this comes in the substitute teachers
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:36.560]   You're really serious. We just can't resist egging you all. I know
[01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:41.440]   I closed that tab. I will not be able to do it again
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:46.640]   It's okay. I promise for a few minutes
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:57.600]   He's right back
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:00.080]   Okay up in the tab again
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:10.080]   Don't you change stacy you be you
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:18.640]   Serious. I I will I will continue to be my sincere unfunny. We love the way you are
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:22.320]   Indeed and that's the google change
[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:26.960]   The word that be as funny. I think of another word that would be as funny as alipanyo. No, there's something about
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:32.400]   jalapenos is funny. Is it funny? Yeah, yeah, it does. It's surprising
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:39.680]   I'm with you. I am not happy with either workspace which we use here at twit. Although we use it really heavily
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:40.880]   I mean I
[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:44.320]   Getting rid of it would be hard. We use slack and that's why Lisa's saying well
[01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:49.120]   Why are we paying for slack? We could just use chat in the google workspaces. We already have it
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:51.120]   It's we're already paying for it
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:54.400]   Uh, but you pay by seat. It's not cheap once you add up all the people
[01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:57.600]   It's probably you know, what is it five bucks per seat per month or something? But
[01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:04.160]   Office isn't you know that I wouldn't especially for just a small business like yours stacy. I wouldn't do office
[02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:08.480]   Yeah, so how about zoho? What do you think about zoho? Do you like zoho?
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:12.640]   Well, really all I need if I look at my google services
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:16.960]   It's mostly email. I have google voice. I would keep that right
[02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:22.240]   I just want to take email out of the equation which I could do with something like superhuman
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:28.480]   Um, because it's only me and Andrew. Yeah, Kevin is not on it because he doesn't want to be
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:32.800]   Yeah, he's like I would like to not have that hassle in my life. I'm like
[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:38.480]   Zoho does all of that so you want to have your man you would still use gmail
[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:41.040]   But just something else for everything else is that it?
[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:48.640]   Well, yeah, we don't I mean I write in google docs, but I can do that anywhere. Yeah with anything. Yeah
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:51.360]   There are better right?
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:56.960]   Yeah, and we're doing I mean there's we're I'm actually evaluating trello for trello's cool
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:02.640]   Yeah, yeah, because then the new version of trello looks really good base camp. You ever take a look at base camp
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:05.520]   Oh a long time ago. Yeah
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:10.240]   Basically, I just need the email email and yeah
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:16.000]   Yeah, mostly I was thinking of chase changing they just announced base camp chasing free just announced
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.880]   That you know their hay.com email system
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:23.200]   They're gonna set up a blog that you could email use that email your blog
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:28.080]   And they would run the blog and I you know, I love these simple blogging platforms
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:30.080]   You know why but I keep trying those out
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:36.800]   Um, it's still hard to write. That's why yeah, like if only something would just lower
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:40.320]   More fun. Yeah, you're like, no, you're right. It's not
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:43.200]   No, it's hard writing is just hard
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:49.040]   Uh, I actually run a static blog that I use emacs to write in
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:54.880]   And that's oh it's cool. It's pretty old school. It's okay. It's okay. Wow
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:02:00.160]   Um, you get used to emacs you get the keystrokes and I've used it for a while you kind of it's kind of a natural
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:05.360]   Flow, but the real problem is not the tool. It's hard to write. That's the problem
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:13.280]   I'm gonna I'm gonna make mine in word star. Are you where it's a control age control age? Yeah, yeah
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:17.440]   What did I just read about where oh yeah, I know what I just read
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:25.040]   Spotify's doing a deal with word star so that you could take your word star that word star word press never mind
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:29.520]   I was like word star still around never mind
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:31.440]   Actually
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.800]   Actually, wow
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:34.880]   There is a word star story
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:37.520]   Seymour Rubenstein just passed away
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:41.040]   Do you know who he is jeff you're the only one who would know in this group
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:43.680]   the inventor of word star no
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:45.280]   Oh
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:50.320]   He but he was very tightly connected with the word star because he was the distributor of word star
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:56.400]   He uh, that's arcane knowledge. Well, yeah, probably is yes it is. Yeah
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:01.680]   He um, but without him there would have been no word star. Let's put it that way. He found a micropro
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:09.520]   Do you know that name micropro international? Yep in 1978. He made a deal with rob barnaby who wrote word star
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:11.840]   um
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:13.680]   and uh
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:17.920]   So they distributed it super sort was another other programs. Anyway, rumin stein who
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:19.200]   uh
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:26.320]   Was a early computer pioneer very uh, I think important in the computer industry passed away at the age of 87 a couple of weeks ago
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:27.840]   so
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:29.840]   You know what track changes
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:34.240]   Track changes. I was just like track changes rate book that is all
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:36.640]   You Christian bound track changes talks all about that
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:39.520]   Seymour's in there. Yep
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:43.200]   Yeah, that was you recommend that a while ago. What were you saying? I'm sorry state. I really liked it
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:47.760]   Oh, no, I was gonna say that word star was invented the year I was born
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:51.920]   Is the fun
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:57.520]   Incidentally
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:03.600]   Jeff and I probably still remember how to what's the save command in word star? Do you remember? It's in your fingers
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:06.480]   Control s
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:10.800]   It's that control ks. You're right. It's two ks. Okay. Yes control ks
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:15.440]   Mm-hmm. Once you and you know, those those things don't go
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:23.040]   Um, all right. I think we could probably do our last ad and get you guys out of here with your picks of the week in just a second
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:25.440]   How do you how do you feel what say you?

[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:35.440]   Now you're getting it
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:38.480]   Are you
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:42.560]   Rotten you by it pro tv
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:48.480]   Don pazette timbrum two guys. I have such respect for met them first many years ago
[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:55.120]   They were it trainers the traditional classroom setting and they came to a panel that I was on
[02:04:55.600 --> 02:04:57.600]   I think adam corolla was on the panel
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:05.360]   Um, it was it was about internet broadcasting basically at the nab show in las vegas
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:08.160]   And they watched us talk about
[02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:13.120]   You know this new world of internet media and they said you know instead of a classroom
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:20.400]   What if we did kind of like what twit is but just for it training and it pro tv was born
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:24.880]   Now that was in 2013 now they are just
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:27.600]   Taken off like crazy
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:32.640]   Seven studios count them in their Gainesville facility open and running
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:37.280]   Making live programming money through friday 8am to 6pm
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:39.920]   But by the way, I should say
[02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:43.680]   Yes, you can watch the live programming in fact it's free to watch the live programming they have a chat room
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:50.960]   But the reason they're doing so much is because they're creating a library of it training in every area of it
[02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:53.680]   5800 hours of it training
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:58.000]   Not just for the certs of course, that's a big part of their business
[02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:05.680]   That's what that you know they started doing to get a job in it to get that first job, especially when you don't have any experience that you can talk about
[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:12.240]   It's helpful to have those certifications. They just showed you got you have the knowledge and of course there are many many certs
[02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:21.920]   Out there the best known probably especially for for you know entry level it jobs are the a plus network plus security plus certs from comp tia
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:24.800]   actually
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:29.120]   IT pro tv is the only official video training partner for comp tia, so they've got the best
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:36.400]   Courses in that area, but they're there's also training in microsoft and in sysco and an apple and in linux
[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:41.120]   There's so much to learn. They don't just teach you it skills
[02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:46.800]   They they teach you the knowledge you need to be an it professional
[02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:51.840]   They get the in-demand skills. They'll help you choose the part. There's all kinds of it
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:54.400]   you know, there's security there's
[02:06:54.400 --> 02:07:00.240]   Desktop it there's networking they'll help you pick the one that works best for you
[02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:05.200]   At great time to get an it last time I looked four million open jobs in it
[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:09.920]   Especially in security an it career could be rewarding and have longevity
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:16.160]   If you're looking for a better life for you for your family it pro tv is the affordable fun

[02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:25.840]   One reviewer on the site said this site has helped me with two certifications
[02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:29.760]   Also as the supplemental material for my grad school classes
[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:32.480]   Wow, give it a try you won't be disappointed

[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:17.920]   uh time for stasis thang
[02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:22.480]   Stacey my thing this week is ting
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:27.040]   Ting i'm gonna have y'all it is not no it is not the two cows
[02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:32.000]   mobile service. Oh, okay. Let's see. What is it ting fire risk hold on ting plug
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:37.760]   Hold on. I I'm terra ting fire dot. It's fire safety
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:40.560]   Yes
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:45.040]   So this little doohickey you've invested a lot into here
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:47.280]   Let me turn off the audio so you don't have to
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:50.880]   I was like, what is happening? This is the ting video
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:54.080]   That's the this is the out
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:59.280]   This is an outlet that detects weird behavior in your electrical
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:03.200]   It's electrical and it tells you hey
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:07.680]   You have a risk of fire. So i'm going to show you the app if you want to see it
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:11.840]   So it's not a fire alarm, but it protects you because of problems in your wiring
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:15.840]   Right. So here's what it looks like most of the time. I'm getting this
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:19.280]   I love this idea. Yeah, show it you were doing it right. Yeah
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:21.440]   All right
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:26.240]   So this is showing the voltage coming in and around my house and it it
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:29.040]   Tell me when things get weird. It's a spancy
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:31.920]   It is $50
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:34.960]   Uh, this says $349
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:42.720]   Oh, no, that's the service leo that the actual device itself should only be oh so you
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:44.880]   Don't have to get the service 40
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:50.240]   Oh, do they only do it as a service now? Oh, I think so
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:54.000]   I think
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.480]   I think you got I mean $349
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:58.800]   Look
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:02.480]   Electrical fires are nasty and this you plug this into the wall
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:06.080]   And then it has a sensor and they monitor it too apparently
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:09.120]   Yeah, but I
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:12.960]   Like they must have just changed this because it was $49,000
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:17.520]   Oh man, let me go to Amazon see if I can buy a ting fire sensor
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:21.920]   Let's see
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:25.600]   I don't think so
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:27.600]   They must have just changed it
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:36.160]   So state farm you may if you have state farmers you're insured they offer this they should they should subsidize it you bet
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:40.560]   So I was really excited to get this and the reason
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:49.280]   Why is because I have a I do a lot of wiring on my house and I live in fear that I'm going to like
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:56.240]   Much copper exposed and it's gonna mark in some of those getting what are you you're doing wiring
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:02.240]   Yeah for all the light switches and things. Oh, I guess you are aren't you of course this yeah
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:05.600]   I mean, it's not fancy wiring. No, but that's of course, you know
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:11.520]   I think about we have all of this uh solar we have batteries
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:18.160]   The wiring was a little janky because our house was a grow house before we bought it. So I think this
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:25.280]   I think this would be a I'm gonna buy even a 349 that includes the monitoring. I'm gonna buy it. That's a great thing
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:28.160]   Do you ever get a strange? Yes
[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:31.040]   Amen
[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:32.720]   Dave here man
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:35.520]   Dave's not here man. No, man. Dave. I'm Dave
[02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:42.000]   Dave's not here man. No, man. I'm Dave all the time. I got these stuff man
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.960]   He's not here man
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:47.040]   all the time
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:51.840]   Sorry go ahead. Nope. That's okay. So I was really excited because it
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:58.880]   It's like two minutes to set up you download the app you connect it to you plug this thing in you connect it
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:01.520]   the two things together and boom and
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:07.680]   It has already worked like if power like I was turning off a circuit in another part of my house and it was like
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:14.160]   By the way, something your power was mildly. Oh, that's good. You know, so it it notice it notices that
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:15.920]   um
[02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:20.800]   Yeah, and you have to plug it directly into an outlet. That's the only thing you can't stick it into like
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:25.520]   That's why I could find an outlet, but you know, there's no particular outlet just any outlet, right?
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:28.320]   Any outlet in your home. Yeah
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:33.280]   I so for me, I mean it was kind of a no-brainer because it
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:36.080]   Only cost $49.99 at the time
[02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:38.800]   Yeah, I would absolutely do that
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:42.800]   And then the sense the app would do the monitoring and just let you know that there was an issue
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:45.200]   But now they want you to buy a year
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:51.760]   349 you get a year of ting monitoring the sensor service activation and a thousand dollar credit for hazard repair
[02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:56.720]   Sounds like they've mopped they've changed pivot. Yeah, they've changed their business model. Yeah
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:02.000]   Of course they did. Well, they launched this in 2018. So it's possible that
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:06.000]   I just came in at the tail end of that which lucky me but
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:09.440]   Bummer for y'all that changes things a little
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:16.480]   Because I've had this now for um almost a month and I'm really like I mean, I don't actually notice it
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:21.040]   Unless it's always about timing. This is a great idea
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:26.800]   So somehow it's monitoring the circuit and notices if there's a change in voltage or
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:31.440]   Yeah, it's it's changing voltage throughout your home. Right. Basically
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:33.680]   Yeah
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:35.680]   This is good
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:42.000]   So that is my thing and I'm sorry that my thing is ting not check it beforehand ting fire
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.120]   Dot com
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:52.080]   Ting catching apparently there is a coupon here safe 2021 safe - 2021
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:55.200]   What does that bring the price down to same?
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:57.680]   Okay
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:02.640]   I meant you just get priority customers. Yes, you know
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:06.800]   Let's see. Let's just see if I apply the coupon what am I gonna do?
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:10.160]   jalapeno
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:15.280]   And it cuts the price by 50 bucks. So there you go. 299. All right, that's good
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:19.280]   Jeff Jarvis. Do you have that was my number. Do you have a number?
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:23.120]   I do indeed. I do indeed. Well, and funny thing happened
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:25.680]   So I saw this story in the ft
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:30.400]   Couple days ago. I printed it out because I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get back to us as I was right with the ft
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:35.840]   And by by a guy named will page and then I saw as we were coming on the show today
[02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:39.600]   He tried to befriend me on linkedin and said I enjoyed what you said on
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:44.400]   The bbc about australia and all that so I friended it back because it's a great story
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:47.360]   He has a book coming out called Tarzan economics
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:50.800]   And he's the former spotify chief economist
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:55.680]   So in this is a treasure trove of amazing numbers about change. I'm going to go through it quickly
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:58.960]   in 84
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:02.160]   6000 music albums were released in the uk total
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:09.200]   Today streaming services make available a similar volume 55,000 new songs every day. Whoa
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:16.720]   Well, a lot of I lost 2009 the number of british songwriters has increased 115 to 140,000
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:21.200]   UK recording artists 145 percent to 115,000
[02:16:21.200 --> 02:16:30.560]   20 years ago there were five major UK labels and at most two dozen independent distributors today spotify host music from 751 suppliers
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:39.680]   There was there were a dozen and a half genres now spotify is every noise acoustic bass
[02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:45.920]   tracks 5,224 genres including coptic hymns russian romanticism
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:50.000]   And of course the new lockdown hint shanties
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.960]   Not all books books
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:17:01.440]   Um, oh, no, I'm sorry. So it's a lot of new books more than 3.5 million titles only a fifth of them were new
[02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:04.640]   But here's the one that's going to depress you my sir my friend my boss
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:07.200]   I'm looking at that paragraph right now
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:12.960]   885,000 new episodes of podcasts almost two podcasts every minute
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:20.400]   Whoa, the good news is yeah half of those don't make it past week one
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:24.800]   Sir, I'm serious
[02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:32.400]   There's significant pod fade in that in that number actually the number I was looking at
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:37.920]   There have been seven acquisitions of podcasting companies for more than a hundred million dollars each
[02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:44.560]   In the past two years, but that has not translated into new found wealth for many creators. Thank you very much
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:52.000]   After in streaming most artists receive 20 to 25 percent of royal team
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.720]   Because earnings go back first to pay in advance
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:18:01.600]   That means an artist receives an advance of a hundred thousand pounds must sell 500,000 pounds where the music before receiving any more cash
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:05.040]   Patreon
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:08.000]   So a lot of what it's saying is a lot of people can just go independent and say screw it
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:13.600]   Yeah, because you have to end up giving 75 percent of your royalties to the record company
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:14.800]   Yeah
[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:22.320]   So it was lockdown took hold major labels released 1.2 million songs in 2020 diy artists released a staggering
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:27.840]   9.5 million that's an eight to one ratio of artists doing it themselves to labels
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:30.480]   and finally patreon
[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:35.040]   Uh took seven years from inception to the distribution of two billion dollars to
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:40.400]   Creators the global music industry took 12 years to do the same for streaming revenue
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:47.440]   I thought was just this is a really good story. So so plug to will page author of the upcoming book
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:53.520]   Tarzan economics do out in April Kate principles for pivoting through disruption
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:59.040]   Is the point of that book? That's a great great bunch of numbers. Yeah
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:02.720]   mr
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:05.040]   Et put your pick of the week

[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:16.720]   The giz fizz from this weekend at about the 33 minute mark
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:22.400]   It was the funniest thing to watch the interaction between our very own jammer b
[02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:25.520]   and mr. Dick d'avartello because
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:28.240]   Okay, you said you had you haven't answered
[02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:31.360]   Because I didn't I didn't know this answer either
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:43.680]   Because you know jammer b is wearing a mask call 911. No, I'm dying. No, it's 33 minutes. I damn know right there
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:47.840]   Shoot
[02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:53.920]   He's wearing that newfangled mask
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:56.720]   That nobody and then what happened?
[02:19:56.720 --> 02:19:59.200]   Colonel Sanders
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:02.800]   And digby martello keeps going back to him like what did you say?
[02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:04.880]   Well
[02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:12.240]   Why am I seeing a kataki fried chicken ad on this that was part of the game? Oh, but it was so funny to listen to jammer b and
[02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:17.360]   D just trying to interact with one side deal with kfc now he's putting ads in the
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:21.200]   Oh, it was part of a game
[02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:23.200]   It was a mean game
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:35.360]   I watched that I watched that Saturday and I could not stop laughing. Oh, man
[02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:38.880]   But that was I thought that was I don't know what we're watching there
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:44.560]   I go home on Saturday afternoon. Thank god. I don't know what the hell's happening this right
[02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:49.360]   And my my other pick is another one that I wanted to mention
[02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:51.920]   Um, this one I wanted to mention last week and forgot
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:54.400]   But I want to give kudos to adobe
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:21:02.080]   They partnered up with tiara wack with the uh, promotuses w is for wack and what it is is um
[02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:04.800]   coloring for people because
[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:09.520]   I think right now people should just take the time to try to find
[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:15.920]   Whatever simple pleasure you can get your hands on and just just embrace it and enjoy it just to
[02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:23.280]   Take time to get away from the reality of all of this continued pandemic stuff and and covid and uh just
[02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:28.160]   Dive into it and one of the simplest things out there is just coloring books
[02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:30.800]   And yo me offers a bunch of color for free
[02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:33.360]   You can put as a p&e
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:36.080]   Photoshop you can put it in the illustrator or you can just
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:39.360]   Download them the old school way is as paper
[02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:46.240]   And print them out and just and to cheat you get it das it down in the kitchen table with your boys in color
[02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:52.640]   I don't do that, but queen pruit colors all the time. It's very soothing. I think yeah, yep
[02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:55.200]   All the time
[02:21:55.200 --> 02:22:00.240]   And when I saw it and I was like man good on you adobe. That's that's good stuff and it doesn't cost you anything
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:03.280]   This is pretty cute. Yeah, you want to have nightmares these images tonight?
[02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:11.440]   These are a little freaky. I'm not gonna lie. This is the letter w w is for wrestlers in a wheelbarrow
[02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:15.840]   W is like edgar gory kind of disturbing
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:19.040]   Worried walrus
[02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:21.440]   weird wasps
[02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:23.840]   Wilds of wonder
[02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:26.800]   Color some of the wickers style actually
[02:22:26.800 --> 02:22:28.880]   Tira
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:31.200]   Tira wack wack is that her name?
[02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:37.520]   Yeah, tira wack. That's great. I think she's featured at the top of that page. Yes. She is. Yeah. Yeah, there she is
[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:40.080]   W is for wack all right, so I
[02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:45.680]   I set up a thing in the security thing and I didn't know what I was doing. Uh-oh
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:51.440]   Are the police coming? It said a 738. We're still in the air. Yeah
[02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:53.520]   Um, I should be walking now

[02:22:57.200 --> 02:23:02.640]   I had to stop. No, don't call the 911. I'm just I'm just sitting here on a podcast. It's okay
[02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:06.560]   I'm all right. I got now. I gotta turn this off because like every night it's gonna say are you walking?
[02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:08.160]   It's gonna get a little
[02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:12.880]   I think that's a sign that says we need to end the show so jeff can go get his walk on
[02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:14.960]   Go walk
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:17.680]   With the police breakdown the door will be like oh
[02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:22.080]   I will leave you then with a short story. How about that?
[02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:26.960]   Uh, this is from a qntm.org
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:33.920]   uh, it is a fake entry in a wikipedia in the future
[02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:36.560]   about the first person
[02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:38.960]   Miguel Acevedo
[02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:43.200]   Whose brain was downloaded as an executable image
[02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:50.960]   He was a graduate student at the University of New Mexico. His brain was downloaded in 2031
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:53.840]   and um
[02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:58.000]   It's kind of like the hey the henry at a lack story, right?
[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:03.280]   What happened to his brain image? It became the most popular brain image
[02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:06.480]   in use because he was very jovial
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:14.240]   When activated it's actually really interesting highly recommended. It's uh
[02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:19.760]   It's called lina at things of interest qntm.org
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:27.280]   And uh, it's fiction. I read it at first. I was a little puzzled because I didn't know it's fiction
[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:31.760]   What did this happen? What happens? Be well written
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:34.880]   It's it's very believable
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:41.360]   And uh, it's uh, you know, they can't so they download his brain and they can execute it in a computer
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:44.080]   and he becomes an artificial intelligence
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:46.560]   and um
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:50.560]   They learned they couldn't tell him that the original owner of the brain was dead that was upset
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:55.440]   So they said he was retired quietly and he was doing kitchen work and
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:58.320]   Um
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:24:59.840]   It's fascinating
