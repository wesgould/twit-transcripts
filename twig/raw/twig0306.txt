[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.960]   Because you come here and you spend your day with us and we are so grateful. It's a pleasure. I do
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.120]   it for no money and no plugs, no nutting, just because of the pleasure of it and the fame and
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.880]   recognition in the world and the chance to be with our next guest. Oh, we love having Matt
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.800]   cuts here, don't we? Matt cuts is a Googler. One of the first he's at mat cuts dot com slash blog.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.680]   Hello, Matt. Good to see everybody. How are you? And we clarify before the show, but let me
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.680]   re-clareify you do. You are employed by Google. You speak for yourself, not for Google. Currently on
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:50.080]   leave, enjoying life. Apparently, somebody wrote an article, I guess it was on Bloomberg or somewhere,
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.880]   that this is not unusual, Google, that the really key employees after a certain period of time,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.480]   it's almost like an informal sabbatical. Well, and I don't know what sort of arrangements they
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.200]   have for the rest of the bench, but Google's been very kind about letting me take the time off and
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.440]   they're not paying me salary or anything like that. Oh, you're not getting paid.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.680]   For a little while I was, but at this point, I'm not. So I'm relatively cheap for them to keep
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.280]   around in the wings. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Gosh, you should really, they should really give you a
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.200]   little something, something to keep you in house. I need to, I need to kind of go for you to give
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.200]   you a pixel. Well, so they are paying my health insurance. So that's not, oh, hey, that's not
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.600]   insignificant. Yeah. But it still helps. But yeah, maybe I'll ask for one of the new pixels.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.080]   Yeah. Ask for a pixel for crying out loud. It's nice to see you Matt. What do you, what do you,
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.600]   are you doing a 30 day challenge every month? Matt likes to do a 30 day challenge.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.840]   I am a friend emailed me and he said, I'm doing a 30 day challenge where I take a cold shower
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.240]   every day. No, I said, that sounds like a great idea. Why don't I try that? And it was
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.480]   horrible idea. But you know, you take a cold shower and it's the worst thing that happens in
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.440]   the morning and now everything else through the rest of the day will be better.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.840]   And such a mesh. And such a good attitude. You know, you know what I think, Matt,
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.760]   you're not a human. You're a Disney character. If I get two pixelated,
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.560]   you'll know that I'm actually on the right side of life. You're amazing.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.120]   But so the cold, I'm on like day five and every day I sort of take a deep breath and I'm sort of
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.840]   cussing the shower out. What mean like ice cold? It's cold. You turn it as cold as you can.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.760]   It wakes you up. It's actually maybe good for metabolism and it's great for the philosophy of
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.400]   like, okay, I've done that. Now I can do something I need to make. What proof do you have this
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.120]   friend? Is it just tortly that he got you to do this 30 days straight? I could be getting
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:52.400]   trolled. It's entirely possible. Yeah, I bet. If I may, one of the very distinct memories I have
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.320]   from when I was in elementary school and they showed you those old films, you know, the film
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.240]   role or whatever in health, health part of fifth grade or something like that was a video about a
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.560]   guy who took cold showers every morning. And one of those mornings he gave himself a heart attack.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.720]   Just saying, be careful. All right. I distinctly remember this video and it's haunted me for my
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.000]   whole life. So I never take a cold shower because of it. Jason, I thought you were
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.240]   said you're in cold, the cold shower film was a great part of sex. No, thankfully.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.000]   And thankfully, no, no, get a little too excited. Take a cold shower.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.360]   Well, all right. So there is, there is, I remember reading that that's one way to lose weight. In
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.640]   fact, we met somebody who said that they that they lost weight that way. There's also this new
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:44.560]   trend of like super cold, like 200 below baths. Becky Worley did this for Good Morning America
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.880]   recently. She was telling me about it where you get it. I mean, it's really, really, really cold,
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.200]   like freezing cold. And Robin Quivers of the Howard Stern show just took some kind of cryotherapy.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.920]   It's cryotherapy. That's not, that seems like coffee enemas like
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:11.520]   if your friend says every day for the next month, I'm doing a coffee enema.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.920]   Can I just suggest you don't? Well, the whole idea is you're always trying experiments, you know,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.560]   and some of them are going to fail horribly. Like I don't plan to keep taking cold showers.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.800]   You don't. You can bail, right? I can, but you know, it's a cold shower. It's five minutes.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.280]   And then you're done. And so why not try something new? You know, maybe like pick up a new habit.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.920]   That's very scotch. Like Scottish, Scottish people would do this. I'm going to take a cold shower.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.320]   It'll be great. And they'll fail, manly. And whoever started one of these and some before 30
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:53.200]   days said, Oh, eff it. Yeah. Yeah. You have. Okay. Well, well, okay.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.680]   There's been somewhere I really suck. It turns out I can't meditate. Like my brilliant.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:05.520]   I try, I count leaves, you know, and it's just I want to do that. I want to, I want to, I want
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.040]   to start meditating. I asked Lisa, she said, you could do it when I'm sleeping.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   She wasn't not around. She said, I said, come on, we'll do it together. No.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:25.840]   I want to go watch TV. You go meditate. All right. So cold showers. Wow. I don't know. I don't
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:32.480]   want to do that. That sounds terrible. So did anybody listen to Mark Marin's podcast with the
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:38.080]   press? Oh, I want to. Yeah. I want to have you. Yeah. Not yet either. That's why it's only been
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:44.800]   downloaded a million times so far. Yeah. Millions a lot for a podcast. Sounds low for an interview
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.800]   with the president. What are you going to get the president on Twitter? Yeah, really, huh?
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.640]   I'm not sure what the deal was. Marin's people approached the president. Marin said, we didn't,
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.200]   you know, was just we thought what the heck. And then as it caught more and more real, he said,
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.720]   then I was wondering like, well, where do we do this? Do I go to Air Force one? Do I go to the
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.760]   Oval Office? It turns out the president came to him. His garage, little tiny garage studio.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.320]   It's hilarious talking about about the, you know, the all the secret security, a sniper on the
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.120]   neighbor's roof. Yeah. Tensell around. And then crowds came out because they knew they knew where
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.880]   he lives. So they wanted to come out and see the president. Wow. You couldn't because the president
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.080]   pulled up in his limo into a tent and then and then left the limo was completely out of sight
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:32.240]   as he entered the garage and left the garage. And of course, the media focused on the fact that
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.280]   the president in a completely appropriate context, I might add, used the N word. And that became the
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.240]   story, which is so, so typical. And then Don Lemon did his Don Lemonness about it.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.920]   Oh, you see that? No, what did Lemon say? Don Lemon Z? CNN?
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.680]   Yeah, CNN anchor. I'm glad I can finally say it out loud because I thought I might have the
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:58.400]   only person who thinks this guy is a buffoon. He held up a sign. He held up a sign that had the
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:05.200]   N word on it. Why would you do that? Yeah. Well, he's an African American. And he, by the way,
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:12.960]   got kicked off CNN tonight. And that before it, though, he held up a Confederate flag. So there's
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.400]   some sort of interesting, interesting thing going on there. This is what CNN calls intelligent.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.280]   Yeah. What do you think of this? What do you think of this?
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:30.560]   I was a great guy. I actually was I forgot about this. I was on I was briefly a regular on his
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:37.120]   air America show. I didn't know that. Yeah, long ago, not very briefly, you know, weeks, but I
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.920]   we met him at a Stitcher Award event, spent some time backstage with him. He's very funny.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.400]   He's actually a little neurotic, a little nervous, right? And I can only imagine how nervous he was
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.000]   about interviewing the president. Oh, geez. But go down him because what he did, it's funny,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.520]   the same day I was in LA at the same time to do the Nerdist podcast. And I had to apologize to
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.960]   Chris Hardwick. I said, I'm sorry, Mark, Maron got the president. You got me.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:10.320]   You kind of got the short end of the stick on this one, Chris. But Chris pointed out, he said,
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.200]   this was before we would heard what they talked about. He said, you know, he's going to make it
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.720]   personal and won't be about politics. It'll it'll be about, you know, Mark really likes to talk to
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:26.080]   people about themselves. And I think that that's it's kind of the president's senior senior year,
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.760]   isn't it? He's almost done. It's his, well, that's why the name of the podcast is so perfect,
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:38.560]   because this is his WTF year. Right. I wish he would, I wish he would do a WTF and like get rid
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:46.160]   of guns. I wouldn't be surprised if on the way out he does a few less than politics things. But
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.040]   remember, he's still the standard bearer for the party, which means he has to be careful because
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.840]   the six he doesn't, he doesn't want to screw it up for the Democrats. It's not so much the presidency,
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:04.560]   it's the house and Senate. Yeah. But how do we get into a political podcast? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah,
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.800]   that. So how is that? What is the status of your project fight in fight, by the way?
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:17.600]   So I look it up and it says, we're still deciding your status. What do we deciding?
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.200]   What is this like? We're working on your status. So I'm going to enter in. So here's what you do.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.320]   You go to, you, you, what's where, where's down to the bottom of that? There's a link that you can
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.360]   click through. I hate pages. Where they, okay, there we go. There's my invites. We're still
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.480]   determining your status. Yeah, that's what I got to. So it's not really a status. No, it isn't.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:44.880]   It's not very helpful. Oh, dear. But I will say at least they're, you know, it'll, I'm sure it will
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.840]   take a few days before they start to give info. But it's nice that they're at least letting you
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:56.640]   know how things stand now. Yeah, sort of, or will someday. Someday. At some point in the future,
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.920]   you will know how you, how you stand. Are you using Fi, Matt? Well, now that it's launched,
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.040]   I can tell you that I have been testing Fi and I really enjoy it. The, the Wi Fi calling
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.080]   is really good because the audio, you'll, you'll have the Nexus 6 on Wi Fi and you don't need to
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.760]   use your cell phone. And it's, that's been really, really nice. So I, I know a few of the people that
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:23.120]   work on it. And so I'm a little biased, but I've got pretty good expectations for it. I think it'll
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.760]   go well. I've been excited about this. Chris Michael in our chat room says he's actually watching
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:34.160]   right now on Fi. So it's Wi Fi calling its T mobile and sprint a weird kind of dual SIM.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:41.440]   It will choose the best of the three Wi Fi T mobile or sprint and use that for your data as
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:46.640]   well as your phone calls. It's not necessarily price competitive. In fact, it seems like it's
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.200]   pretty close to the same price as T mobile would be.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.880]   Well, and I think starting with Nexus 6, you know, it's pretty smart because they're like,
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.400]   okay, let's start with just known hardware. Right. You know, this gives them a chance to work all
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.880]   the kinks out, see all the corner cases, test out the billing and the statements. And then after
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.280]   that, you know, who knows which direction they'll go? Maybe they'll support more different hardware,
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:13.840]   maybe they'll, you know, be able to make deals with other carriers. But I like the fact that it's a
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:19.040]   per a flat amount per gigabyte. And, and then if you don't use it all the
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.200]   refund, you back what you don't use. That's kind of nice. That's better than anybody else does.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.960]   You know, you pay for just what you use no more. No less. That's kind of like ting did that.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.880]   One of our advertisers. Ting did that karma. I'm still waiting for my karma. Yeah,
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.720]   they're finally passing tests, but they're supposed to come soon. That's the wife,
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.160]   wife, my Fi device to get. Yeah. Yeah. So there's a lot of pressure to get away from this, this
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.600]   horrible rip you off for things you don't use. There was a rumor and I have yet to
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:49.040]   see it actually disproved that the people who got the early invites to Fi were all people who did not
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:56.880]   own Nexus sixes. Yeah, I don't, I don't know the truth that I can't confirm or deny that.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:05.120]   I think that's unlikely. But I do note that those of us like me and Jeff and I presume you two
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:11.280]   Jason Howell who are holders, owners, legitimate owners of Nexus sixes have not yet received
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.720]   or invite and the several people I've talked to who have been using Google Fi had to buy Nexus sixes.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:23.360]   Chris, did you have to buy a Nexus six to Chris Michael in the chatroom to use Fi?
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:32.560]   He said others round up to a gig fight as fractional data, which is nice. Yeah, Chris Michael had to
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:39.120]   buy it. I mean, totally unscientific in every regard. But I swear, everyone that I hear that
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:45.040]   has it did not have an Nexus six and bought one for five. Weird. So I'm just saying it seems that
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.360]   way. It's hard to prove it, but there you go. You know, I just want to say this and I'm not looking
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.600]   for special things. I'm looking for nothing free, but it is kind of, I was talking to a friend of
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.520]   my the other day and he said, what? You don't have a, you're on the show every week. No, you know,
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:03.760]   what one would think. But I've been told in no uncertain terms by numbers of people that
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:10.080]   we're not going to give it to you in early testing. You'll just pan it. You know, they're worried that
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.800]   those of us who have a bully pulpit, if we have a bad experience, we could really ruin it for them.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.080]   Yeah, but that's not very googly. I think I think Google actually does care about, you know,
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.600]   hearing what doesn't work and making it better. And I think they're believable in that.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:30.240]   Hmm. Because we don't, we're sophisticated enough to know that this is early. The reason they're
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.760]   doing it on one phone is, is you just said, Matt, to work the kinks out. There are, it's a company
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.360]   that I'd like to Troy or something like that. It's a company that acknowledges kinks. That's the
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.440]   whole point. Well, Matt, doesn't it? I don't know. Maybe you know, but doesn't it? It seems to me,
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.440]   if you're going to use two different carriers, that that is we're going to require something special
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:53.040]   on the phone or in the OS. That is not, that is not something most phones can take a single sim for
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:59.200]   two carriers for like guests. Right. Just to have the radio where you can have all of the bands that
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.800]   are necessary. I mean, that alone, you know, is a big restriction, I would think. So,
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.400]   yeah, it does make sense that they're, you know, over time, more phones will support more bands
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.960]   and we're getting closer to true world phones and all these sorts of things. But, you know, I think
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.360]   starting with a known set of hardware that they can sort of help on any part of the stack that
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.920]   goes wrong does make sense. But I'd love to see more people be able to get by quicker.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.720]   I suspect another reason might be that they want to make sure they, I think they want to have
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:33.120]   really good support. And so, if you roll it out too quickly, then you can't bring it up and ramp up
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.360]   and train all the support people to be the level of quality that you need quickly enough.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:44.560]   Exactly. Exactly. So, you can find out if, if you, what your status is, which is,
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:51.600]   I mean, actually, you already probably know. But if you want to get official confirmation at
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:59.840]   find.google.com/signup, I guess, question mark, U equals one, I bet you you don't need that.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:05.440]   Let's just take that off. And yeah, if you just go to f find.google.com/signup,
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.800]   it will let you know if you've already signed up. If you haven't, it'll give you a chance to sign
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.520]   up and then it'll say, we're still determining your status. Check back.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:19.760]   I was kind of hoping that before I left the States just to see how it would work.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:26.320]   So, I was so happy I got an email from Asus saying, would you like to test the Asus Flip,
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.120]   which I've been waiting for? Actually, once a week I searched and said, is it for sale yet?
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.240]   Then I saw the stuff saying it's for sale yet. Then they sent me an email and I was,
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.360]   we'll send it to you on loan, but wait, wait, can you even keep it?
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.840]   Sorry, I back and I say, well, no, I'm a journalist. I want to buy one, but I'm happy to buy one
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.440]   early. I really want to get my hands on this. This is great. And they come back and they say,
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.280]   well, can you guarantee you don't write about it? I said, no, I'm a journalist. I was, oh, you were
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.200]   on the wrong list. You were on the educational list, which I guess, education is none of
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.440]   them. We have a press list too. And yes, you could buy it. So I can't wait to get it, but yeah,
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.680]   I just want to try these things early. By the way, some of our chatroom, including Dr. Mom,
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.840]   go in there and they get, expect your invite in three to four weeks.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:12.560]   So some people, some people do have concrete days coming. And so I just sent an email to one
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.240]   of the people I know on PHY and said, is there any way to speed up the invites for Leo LaPorche
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:22.800]   of Jarvis or Jason Halle. We'll see whether you've lost your clout.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:28.400]   Exactly. My Google Mojo might be pretty much the dream.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.000]   Clout test. Clout test.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.400]   Clout test.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.400]   It might be on vacation. Who knows? But I at least ask to can't hurt to ask.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.400]   Thank you, Matt. You're really great.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.480]   Let's see what we talk about. Hey, by the way, thank you, Google. Thanks to you,
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:56.960]   the new Twitch website is secure. Google announced a little while ago that they would bump your
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.240]   ranking a little bit if you were an SSL secured website. And even though there's really not much
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.280]   reason that Twitch should be SSL, there's not a whole lot of reason not to be either. I mean,
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.360]   except for the cost of the search.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.040]   Which is the point, I think, just making the standard.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.600]   Yeah. And some people when I mentioned this said, you could make a case that somebody could do a
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:21.120]   man in the middle on Twitch. And then when they downloaded, let's say what they thought was a
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:27.680]   podcast that actually be downloading some malicious software. So I guess any site where you're actually
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.840]   going to use that site to download something probably should be secure.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.440]   Including the contents of the site, I guess.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.960]   But the other thing that was good, yes, show the page just because we spent so much money on it.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:50.240]   Okay. The other thing. Let's look at that site again one more time. Just, yeah, why that looks good,
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:58.320]   doesn't it? The other thing Google was doing was the mobile gettin thing. And there's some
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:07.840]   results in on the results of mobile gettin ad week has some numbers. The mobile gettin challenge
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:13.440]   was to get websites to upgrade to a mobile responsive format. Yes, we are responsive as well.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.680]   I don't think you really need Google's incentive to do that. I just looked at our stats and I saw
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.400]   that more a lot of slow bozos. I know. But if you look at your analytics, which we did,
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:29.120]   more than half of people coming to the site, what came in on a tablet or mobile mobile phone.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:35.920]   So if more than half your users are on small screens, you better well make your site responsive.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:41.840]   Regardless of what Google's index is going to do, but this certainly helps recent study of
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:50.160]   more than 1000 important e-commerce keywords by move web. The percentage of mobile friendly
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:56.800]   results in the top keyword position was 83%. When looking at the top 10 positions on page one is a
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:04.320]   whole 77% mobile friendly. So I don't know if that's an improvement.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:08.080]   It's the problem. Yeah, we don't know the delta.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:15.280]   But I would expect the world is moving to mobile friendly because the only way we did it was you'd
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.520]   have two sites. In fact, I still do this on Leoville.com. I blog because I'm lazy.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:26.080]   It's a WordPress blog. I have two templates. And if WordPress senses you coming in on a mobile,
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.840]   it'll give you the mobile version, which is kind of a dopey way to do it. But that's the old way of
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:38.480]   doing it. Remember WAP? Oh, man. Yeah. What did that stand for?
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:44.560]   Wireless access protocol. Yeah, no, but there's a WAP browser.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.400]   Oh, yeah, you're right. Wireless application protocol. You're right.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:57.760]   It was a standard for accessing information. No, but there was a WAP browser, a browser for
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:03.600]   mobile devices. And then you would make your website WAP compatible.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:12.160]   Oh, God, I remember that. Remember that? For years, Google's mobile stuff was entirely half
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.200]   time from one engineer. I remember talking to this engineer, and she was like, you know, there's
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:23.040]   just not a lot of mobile usage. So that's all the staffing we read. We need right now. So one half
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:29.200]   man here. I love the idea that she's sitting off like in an island on the Hebrides. And then
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:37.520]   the next day she's queen. Yeah. I am now in charge. One half woman year. Yeah. But it's kind of
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:42.800]   crazy. Like before I go on leave, we'd go and evaluate changes that we were going to make on
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:48.240]   Google site. And we had to make a conscious effort to say mobile first. And so, you know, the people
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.240]   in charge of the UI would say, don't show me what it looks like on a desktop first. Show me what
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.560]   it looks like on a phone or a tablet. And then later we'll look at what it looks like on a desktop.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.120]   Yes. You have to make that shift because there's so many people coming on mobile devices now.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.880]   I think our site actually looks better on mobile, to be honest with you.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:10.320]   Yeah. But the problem with the problem with talking about being mobile compatible is that it
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.800]   doesn't change enough. It still looks like it's a webpage, a portal thing, a content thing.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:20.080]   Right. And make it work small. As opposed to what I've argued is that what Google and Facebook
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:27.360]   understand is that mobile is a context generator, a signal generator for different use cases.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:33.040]   And so just taking the thing you already do and making it fit on a small screen misses the whole
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:38.960]   point of, no, I want to, I want to stream or I want to quick update or, or I got an hour to kill.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.040]   Let me, let me immerse in something. These are different use cases for content and we're not
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:49.440]   thinking that way at all in our business and media. By the way, Chris sent us a link to his
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:54.800]   Google Fine XS6 and I guess you get a free external battery when you sign up for fine.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.520]   So his Nexus 6 is connected to the batteries watching the show while he chats.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.480]   Humblebrag. Thank you, Chris. Chris. Chris.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:08.560]   I like it. Show off, Chris. I like it. By the way, this is, this is how nice it is with Google Photos.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.640]   You could just take a picture, get a link and send it to somebody and that's what he did.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.080]   Oh, so somebody Mark, uh,
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:23.760]   japagan just said that he had before and after nearly 50% of non-mobile from the URLs dropped in
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:28.960]   rank. I'll put this on there. Oh, they, oh, so they went down because they were not mobile.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.520]   Yeah. So I just put it in the chat and the, wow. Thank you, Mark.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:40.480]   Wow. So this mobile, mobile, mobile, getting actually happened. Sorry for mangling your name,
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:48.400]   that's good. Well, yeah. So mobile, that's Eric Inge. He's a pretty well-known guy in the
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:53.360]   SEO space. And as I understand, and I'm nicely unplugged from SEO these days,
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.560]   for mobile, get in, they had to bake stuff into the index. So a lot of the stuff, you know,
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:03.920]   you can just flip a switch and you can turn it on within hours. I might be mistaken, but I think
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.920]   for mobile, get in a man, that's a terrible name for the mobile ranking change, they had to sort of,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.120]   you know, make the determination, bake that into the index, and then at that point,
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:18.080]   they can start to do the ranking changes. So sometimes those can take, you know, 10 days to roll out
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:24.320]   if you're making new stuff into the index, for example. Yeah. This is a, this is a big deal.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:31.040]   And it shows you how much power Google can wield. I mean, we was part of the consideration of why
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.680]   we're doing HTTPS, part of the consideration of why we made it mobile friendly. I mean,
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:42.080]   it was in our best interest to do both anyway. But that's- We tried to support only stuff that
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:48.640]   would be a good idea anyway. But these sort of policy changes generate a lot of hot debate.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.760]   For example, the story just came out this week about revenge-born and how Google will take it
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.760]   out of the index. I don't know if you heard Twitter on Sunday, but we had a very good debate about
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.200]   that. Oh, okay. No, I haven't heard that one yet. I'll tell you my position.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:09.040]   And it's, you know, when you use revenge porn, it's like using child porn. It's, it's a non-controversial
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:16.240]   thing. Everybody thinks it's a bad idea. So I understand that nobody's going to say, oh, well,
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:22.960]   you know, we should promote revenge porn. That's not, but what I do, I am of the opinion that,
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.600]   and this is kind of a very purest point of view. And I'd love to hear what you think about it, man.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.800]   That if the goal of a search engine, which I think it should be, is to reflect the web as it is,
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:41.440]   then it should, it should do that purely algorithmically and without editorializing about some kinds of
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.080]   content. And if you don't like revenge porn, and no one's saying it's a good thing or child
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:52.160]   porn or anything else, you should go to the source of it and shut that down for Google to change the
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:58.240]   search results puts Google in a position as an arbiter of what's acceptable and not acceptable.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:03.440]   And I think that's a, that's a risky thing. Now, Ben Thompson, very smart guy from
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:07.840]   St.Tecory argued the opposite. And I thought it was a good discussion. But I'd love to hear
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:12.400]   what you think of it. Well, it's certainly true. There's that. And then there's the other aspect
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.560]   of it, which is the slippery slope, which is if you're willing to take action on revenge porn,
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.640]   then why don't you take action on this, you know, why do you show the Confederate flag?
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.120]   Right. I should not be able to search for the Confederate flag.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:29.600]   That way. And so. Right. Right. So, so I, you know, when I worked on safe search,
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.720]   we deliberately tried to make it only for pornographic content or non-family safe content.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.280]   And when someone wanted to add another category, I would kind of leave them down this garden path
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:43.440]   of like, well, what about bomb making? What about anarchy? What about pro-internexia? What about
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:48.480]   wiccans? What about whatever? You know, and it's interesting because after a few categories,
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.720]   people realize, oh, yeah, okay, now I can see the slippery slope in front of me.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:58.160]   Well, furthermore, safe search is a checkbox. So I can decide not to use it. And that I think
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:03.360]   you're putting that explicitly in the hands of the user is a great idea because the user can then
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:09.840]   opt in to see the whole web. Right. But it's, but doing it, as you say, editorializing by default,
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.400]   those are the sorts of policy decisions that are very hotly debated within the company and
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.400]   between the search group and the legal group and, you know, what are, what are the right
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:23.680]   presidents to set versus, of course, no one wants anyone to be subject to sort of objectionable
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.560]   content in this case. Right. So, so there was a lot of internal debate, but I'm going to use a good one.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.960]   Would you say it's fair? This is actually, we don't have to go back through that debate,
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:42.000]   but, but what is the goal of Google? I mean, the original goal was to organize all the world's
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.920]   information. Make it universally accessible and useful. I knew you couldn't leave that not finished.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:54.000]   Well, but that's, that is a lot of all that is a laudable goal. And I would, I would underscore
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.880]   all the world's information there. Well, and it's fun because we tend to be on the free speech
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.840]   absolute aside of things. I think Twitter has has carved out a niche niche, whatever you want
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.920]   to say, even a little more that they say we're the free speech wing of the free speech party or
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:14.720]   something like that. Right. And I think the internet lends itself to that compared to,
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:20.800]   you know, Western Union or telecom carriers or that sort of thing. But yeah, it's, it's also
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.880]   interesting to see the impact on people's lives. And how do you balance those two different things
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:30.080]   is, is not an easy decision to make. Well, very relevant to this discussion is David Drummond in
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:38.080]   Can just basically started war, Google war on ISIS and, and, and drew a line and said,
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.440]   No to that kind of extremist video.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.840]   That's another interesting use case.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.720]   - Well, and it leads to the right to be forgotten,
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.120]   frankly, doesn't it?
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.140]   - It does, and also, look at the other end of it,
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.120]   look at Facebook.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.460]   Facebook says no nude pictures period,
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.480]   we don't care if you're breastfeed,
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.540]   we don't care what it was, "Newsworthy, no nude",
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.400]   put it up in an instant article,
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.320]   Chris Cox said, "Can't we take it down?"
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.560]   No nudity, that's our rule.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.920]   That's what we do, no nudity.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.960]   No, I'm not wild about that,
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.320]   but at least it's a consistent rule,
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.720]   and I get it, and they're saying, "Here's our rule,
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.320]   and if you're a news organization,
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.480]   or if you're a club, or if you're a person,
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.040]   you have to accede to our rule."
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:17.880]   That's what it is.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:23.200]   - But there's also, Google is closer to library.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.640]   Facebook is more like a nightclub,
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.880]   where they try to make an environment
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.680]   that's conducive to what they want,
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.680]   and that's fine, right?
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.200]   Like people need a place to hang out
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.840]   and a place to talk about things,
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.840]   but at least at Google, we tend to want to be
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.760]   a reflection of the web as much as possible.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.560]   So yeah, these changes tend to be few and far between.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.920]   - You're right, Matt, but the issue now
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.960]   that's causing discussion is that with instant articles,
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.480]   with basically Facebook turning into a place
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.240]   where a publisher, frankly, could get rid of
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.880]   their back-end, their CMS, their technology department,
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.720]   and say, "You know what the heck?
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.360]   Let's just put everything on Facebook.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.800]   We'll get 100% of the revenue we sell,
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.120]   70% of what they sell.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.000]   There's audience there.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.160]   We don't have to be in the audience business.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.560]   Let's do it."
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.960]   Then the fear is, my friendly competitive colleague
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.680]   at Columbia, Emily Bell, says, "Whoa, then Facebook
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.320]   and Twitter become the press."
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.840]   And Facebook recognizes this is an issue,
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.960]   and it's not part of Facebook's mission right now
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:20.600]   to have an informed public, but Facebook could be very soon
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.120]   the most important distributor of news in the world.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.040]   What position does that put them in
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.560]   in terms of any obligation they then have?
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.120]   And I don't say that I have the answer
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.080]   or that they have the answer yet.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.480]   All I say about this is,
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.120]   this is a good and important discussion to have,
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.000]   because once these platforms become distributors,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.520]   do they take on, whether they choose to or not,
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.240]   some responsibility?
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.040]   What do you think?
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.640]   - Well, the notion that right to be forgotten,
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.280]   which in some sense is the terminal case
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.560]   in a lot of these sort of situations is really interesting
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.440]   because you see France and Canada sort of making the claim
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.040]   that you should do these sorts of removals worldwide.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.920]   And then what do you do when you get China, Russia,
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.880]   whatever kind of country is asking for some of the things?
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.880]   And you talked about this last week with Danny Sullivan,
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:15.880]   but it's weird because people think it's an attack
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.080]   against Google in some cases, but in many ways
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.200]   it's an attack against the internet to say,
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.040]   we wanna have a splinternet, we wanna have an internet
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.440]   divided by country.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.520]   And a lot of people I think identify more as citizens
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:31.120]   of the internet than that strongly with the pride
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.280]   of their particular country, which is a little interesting.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.560]   - We're gonna take a break when we come back.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.800]   Is Google listening to you?
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.760]   Apparently it is.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.600]   And some people aren't happy about that.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.440]   (laughs)
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.160]   This week in Google, Matt Cutz is here.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.680]   Great to have you, Matt, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.800]   and all of you in the chat room.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.000]   And by the way, I guess it was Mark Trafagan
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.560]   who did that study.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.840]   - Thank you for pronouncing that properly.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.680]   - Well, I don't know.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.360]   Mark can correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:01.040]   but they did that study of the mobile Geddon results.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.800]   And so we wanna give, it's nice of him to come into the chat room
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.600]   and give us that link.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:11.600]   And we wanna mention the website which is,
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.800]   now I've lost it.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.640]   - So is it still?
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.560]   - Stone Temple, I don't know.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.320]   - Stone Temple, I think, yeah.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.160]   - And Mark's pretty active on Google+ too.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.000]   - Or social, or social tons.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.120]   - Stone Temple Consulting Digital Marketing, excellent.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.000]   - Yes, okay.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.520]   - And I think one of those two guys is probably Mark.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.120]   - Not sure, but there you go.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.800]   We're gonna take a little break and talk about my mattress.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.320]   You got the video of me bouncing on my mattress?
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:42.280]   I love my mattress.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:46.520]   My Casper mattress, you would think it'd be crazy talk.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.920]   If somebody said, "Hey, we're gonna sell mattresses on the internet."
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.440]   For the first of all, how are you gonna ship them?
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.960]   Well, it turns out Casper's figure out a way
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.440]   to take that incredible American-made premium mattress
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.920]   with latex and memory foam,
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.640]   put it in a little box.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.680]   They give you, there's a Tyvex sleeve
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.040]   and they give you a little opener to open it up and boom.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.880]   The mattress, as you can see, it inflates.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.680]   And it's beautiful, it's great.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.520]   And by the way, you might say,
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.600]   oh, is it gonna smell like foam rubber or let?
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:20.360]   No, no, it's, I don't know what they do it, but it's incredible.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.360]   You get an amazing mattress.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.960]   So there's problem number one solved by technology.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:29.160]   Problem two is how do you know if a mattress is gonna suit you?
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:32.800]   I mean, you buy a mattress online, don't you have to try before you buy?
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.920]   Well, I think the folks at Casper would say,
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.000]   and I would agree that going to a mattress store
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.160]   and lying on a mattress in full daylight
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.280]   in front of a salesperson for five minutes
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.800]   is not really the way to find out
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.960]   whether a mattress is good or not.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.400]   In fact, I have bought more than a few mattresses I didn't like
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.480]   once I got them home.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.320]   You don't have to worry about that with Casper
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.360]   because you have 100 nights to try it
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.800]   and you will get free delivery and painless returns,
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.040]   absolutely free, no cost to you.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.080]   If at any time in that first 100 nights,
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.880]   you say, you know, it's not for me.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:07.120]   So there's literally no risk to you.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.520]   And it's so easy to buy and so affordable too.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.800]   These are premium mattresses that started $500 for a twin.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:17.240]   In fact, I'm gonna make it even better with a $50 discount
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:21.760]   when you go to Casper.com, C-A-S-P-E-R.com/twig
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.280]   and use our promo code twig,
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.080]   long lasting comfort and support.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.320]   I think they said guaranteed for 10 years, right?
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.560]   And man, is it comfortable.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.280]   We liked it so much, we got one for Henry.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.000]   And then Lisa's sister came and stole our mattress.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.880]   (laughing)
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.720]   Which is all right, I can't remember why,
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.560]   there was a good reason.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.040]   (laughing)
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.160]   So we're gonna get another, I love it.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:51.360]   You will too, Casper.com/twig, use the promo code twig
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.080]   for $50 off.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:56.000]   It's a bed that loves you back
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.880]   and your back will love.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:58.720]   Casper.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:04.000]   So, I don't know where to start on this one.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.360]   This comes from fullstack.info blog post.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:12.480]   Not okay, Google.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.480]   Not okay.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:18.000]   And actually Google responded to this earlier yesterday.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.080]   So here's the deal.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.200]   - Let's be clear, okay, go ahead.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.920]   - Well, you wanna tell-- - No, no, you don't.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.560]   So as you know, if you're using Chrome,
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:31.480]   and you go to the Google search page, let's do it,
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.160]   I can now talk to my browser.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.760]   I could say, okay, Google, and it's listening
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.200]   and we'll respond.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.880]   I said, I can say, I don't know, maybe it's not turned on.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.680]   And that's one thing, one point to make
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.640]   is that you do have to opt into that.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.680]   There's a checkbox to opt into that.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.120]   Well, it turns out, open source advocates noted
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.680]   that this hot wording component
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.360]   was actually being shipped with Chromium,
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.000]   the open source version of Chrome,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.640]   as a binary pre-packaged.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.080]   So you couldn't look at the code,
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.520]   you couldn't see what it was doing.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.240]   Google's response to that issue,
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.640]   when it was filed as a bug report is,
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.040]   yes, we download the hot word module on startup,
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.640]   but it's not activated unless you opt in.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.360]   - Google doesn't control Chromium, right?
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.360]   - Right, the code for activation
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.200]   is built into Chromium itself.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.640]   But it isn't really, it is kind of not done
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.960]   to put a binary blob, especially a binary blob
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.880]   that can listen to you into open source software.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:35.880]   So after a little bit of a furore, Google yesterday,
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.800]   you're laughing at the word furore, kerfuffle?
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.880]   - Kerfuffle.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.800]   - Google announced that that binary component
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.520]   is being removed from Chromium.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.240]   It's not open source, it doesn't belong
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.640]   in the open source browser.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.360]   So resolved.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:56.720]   - Yeah, and much, and much a do over, not much, I would argue.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.480]   - Oh my God, Google's listening to you,
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.600]   and you know you're gonna see this on stupid reports
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.720]   on the evening news, and it just doesn't help
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.560]   the techno-pantication.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.360]   - Or in privacy online news.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.200]   - Oh, God.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.360]   - Google Chrome listening into your room
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:14.800]   shows the importance of privacy defense in depth.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.920]   As you know, just wrap your computer in tin foil
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.960]   and everything will be okay.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.440]   As you know, in order to use this,
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:26.440]   Google has to send your sound back to the Google store
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.960]   to analyze it, they don't do it locally.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.360]   That's true of, as far as I know,
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:36.360]   almost every speech program, Siri does it.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:41.660]   Google now, Siri, Cortana.
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.640]   I mean, that's how they work,
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.480]   because nobody had, you know, Microsoft's connect,
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.480]   'cause well, actually, Connect has a few simple commands.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.080]   I think they don't get sent back.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.680]   I think Google does too, doesn't it?
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.160]   - Yeah, the voice recognition, if it's offline, does work.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.560]   It's just not as good as if it can send it to the cloud.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.840]   - Right, right.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.320]   - But I think it's a fair point.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.760]   Like if you're using Debian,
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.640]   you wanna be able to compile everything
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.280]   from this voice code to know you're clean,
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.800]   and you're gonna check the cryptographic signatures
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.920]   and everything, so, you know, fair point, good feedback.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.880]   I'm really glad that Google made the change,
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.560]   because, you know, if you're the kind of person
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.000]   who wants to use Chromium and an open source
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.360]   instead of Chrome, because, you know,
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.240]   you wanna compile it all, then yeah,
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.920]   you don't want a binary blob on your device.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:28.320]   So, it took Google a little while longer
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.320]   than I'd like to reach the right decision,
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.640]   but I'm really glad that within a relatively short
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.120]   period of time, they made that call.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:38.120]   - No, no, no, no, what if I'm using Debian and I want it?
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.560]   Can I download the blob?
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.680]   - I think so, I think you can, well, I'm not sure.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.000]   I don't know how it'll be after this change, but--
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   - You would hope so, I'm not sure, though.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.800]   - I don't have a note from your parents saying
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.640]   it's okay to use it.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:56.640]   - It would be ironic if I like okay Google, personally.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.000]   - Yeah, fair point about that,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.480]   but it's the kerfuffle around it,
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.320]   it's the conspiracy theories around it,
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.800]   I'm like, "God, Google's trying to listen to you."
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.280]   That's what, that's what just, well, yeah,
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.080]   and actually to Zellig, Ofer Zellig's credit,
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.480]   he, even though he does link to that privacy post,
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.560]   he doesn't actually go crazy about it, he says, you know--
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.040]   - Oh, Rick Falcon thing had dead a day.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.160]   - Yeah, Rick did, but this is appropriate to raise this issue.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.240]   - Oh, no, no problem, that.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.680]   - That means it should be open source, yeah.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.040]   And this is a unknown kind of blob
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.680]   that actually has the ability to listen in.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.000]   That shouldn't be part of the open source
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.280]   and Google did exactly the right thing
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.520]   after a few days of kerfuffle.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.080]   - Interesting thing is even after that mistake,
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.720]   like that will now be a bullet point
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.800]   that gets used against Google forever and ever.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.080]   And I think it's probably Jeff's point, and that's true.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.400]   I have a mental image of like,
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.160]   kerfuffle is down here,
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.640]   bruhaha is one notch up.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.480]   (laughing)
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:57.520]   You know, it was an iPhone announcement level,
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.960]   but bruhaha, I'd give it to you.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.680]   - Yeah, it's definitely not intended.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.520]   - It's literally alstra f, which is up here.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.760]   (laughing)
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.800]   We need a little thermometer or something,
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.920]   so we could see, we can gauge the amount of
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.960]   upset going on.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.800]   - Yeah, the thoroughness. - Yeah, the thoroughness.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.920]   The righteous indignation meter or rim.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.040]   - There ought to be something on,
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.520]   like you could just mine Twitter and figure out,
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:30.800]   people are 7.9 annoyed about this thing versus only 2.7
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.800]   annoyed about that thing.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.320]   - There's sentiment analysis.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.560]   - Yeah.
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.800]   - On the people are doing that.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.120]   That's kind of an interesting subject actually.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.200]   Figure out what people are talking about.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.760]   - I'm gonna, there's so many stories in here.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.000]   Jeff, do you have one that you wanna bring up on?
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.800]   - Oh, geez, there's just, there's just tons.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.600]   - I know, I know.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.280]   - We'll talk about open containers.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.120]   - Go ahead.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.640]   - We'll get to it, where was that in this?
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.680]   - How about the pictures?
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.800]   Do you wanna do the instructions?
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.880]   - I thought you might have put that in there.
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.480]   I really like this, it's really cool.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.720]   Thank you, Matt, for putting this in here.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.200]   This was from the Google, - I think of this.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.640]   - Google research, oh, Jason did this?
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.200]   All right, Google research blog.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.920]   It's, talking about neural networks.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.840]   Neural networks are a form of artificial intelligence,
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.640]   computer software that learns the way you teach it
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.360]   is just feed it stuff, feed it lots of stuff.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.680]   And in this case, these neural networks,
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.320]   which are attempting to simulate the human brain
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.360]   as being fed images.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:33.320]   And actually, this is quite a good conversation
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.000]   of how this works.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.560]   Image classification, speech recognition
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.440]   are two very big areas where neural networks
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.760]   are being used to try to get better at this.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.880]   And there's some really cool images in here of,
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.960]   I don't know, what are these, Matt,
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.320]   would you explain what I'm looking at?
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.520]   - Well, you basically try to train a neural network,
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.120]   a deep neural network to recognize specific things,
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:04.640]   whether it be ants or antelope or dumbbells.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.520]   And then you can turn it on its head
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:09.120]   and have the networks amplify things
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.720]   or given one image kind of take that
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.480]   and sort of build on it,
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.080]   and then it becomes self-reinforcing.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:17.920]   And so--
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:22.560]   - So you're looking for the platonic ideal of fork or ant.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:23.400]   - Yes.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.800]   - Or parachute or banana.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.680]   - And then you could feed it back into itself
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.320]   and then once it sees a little bit of a fork,
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.120]   it turns it into more of a fork.
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.400]   And so before you know it,
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.640]   you get this macro level structure,
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.920]   like a dog on one end and a fish on the other end.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.080]   It actually looks like an object,
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.040]   you know, because it could be plausible.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.400]   And it's funny because a lot of people on Google
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.240]   were reading the comments on Reddit
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.360]   and Reddit was sort of saying,
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.280]   this is exactly what acid looks like, man.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.080]   (laughing)
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.480]   - Well, there's something to be,
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.120]   there's not merely a stoner talk in there.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.640]   That's kind of what happens when your brain
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.520]   doesn't organize information very well because it's drugged.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.840]   Now that's what the neural network kind of is like.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:05.680]   - This is your Google.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.960]   This is your Google on drugs.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.480]   (laughing)
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.160]   - So there might be actually some learnings
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.840]   about how the visual cortex works.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.680]   - Yeah.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.280]   - How it processes stuff, you know,
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.240]   together with LSD or whatever, you know,
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.440]   - But notice by the way, these are images of dumbbells.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.540]   It seems like no dumbbell is complete
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.680]   if you look closely without a muscular arm.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.520]   - Yeah.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.920]   - So there's dumbbells, but there's also arms in here.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.040]   And when the computer sees those two linked,
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.240]   it says dumbbell.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:40.280]   Might be hard to see a dumbbell without an arm holding it though.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.120]   - Right.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.240]   And it only knows what it sees.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.760]   And so if it never sees a dumbbell without an arm,
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.640]   it's like, well, that's gotta be something else.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.600]   - They go together.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.400]   Wow, this is,
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.880]   this does look like you're on acid.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.680]   This is will to be sun acid, apparently.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.080]   Wow, that is quite gorgeous.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.440]   - The saurop paintings are pretty cool.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.360]   - Isn't that amazing?
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.440]   So, your saurop was a pointless--
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.080]   - It's like all about pixels.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:06.920]   - Yeah.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.400]   Wow, is that neat?
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.440]   I don't know if there's anything to be learned from that.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:13.560]   Here's the sky.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.680]   So these are the representations internally
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.680]   of the neural network.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:19.520]   Here's that--
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.360]   - That's pretty crazy.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:24.600]   - Dog snail loving you were talking about.
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.920]   - Wow.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:28.720]   - Oh man, who needs drugs, man?
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.280]   - Very, very vengo.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.800]   - Yeah, totally vengo.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.200]   - But there is, I think there is something to be said of,
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.160]   you know, if a brain is not doing a good job
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.800]   of organizing the information in the brain,
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.280]   it probably does look a lot like a neural network,
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.680]   a very naive understanding.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:47.280]   This is the admiral dog, the pig snail.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.720]   (laughing)
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.080]   The camel bird and the dog fish.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.480]   Wow.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.800]   - So I guess it also shows a little bit,
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.320]   you know, deep neural networks,
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.960]   they're gonna be popping up everywhere for,
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.160]   you know, I think maybe Facebook did something
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.240]   where you can give it a caption
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.120]   and it will generate an image to match that.
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.360]   So you know, there's,
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.280]   neural networks are gonna show up in all kinds of places,
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.720]   you know, in the next five years, not in the next 50 years.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.720]   - Is this what they're using for face recognition,
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:17.560]   for instance?
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:22.600]   - I mean, Google Brain and the deep neural network stuff
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.960]   is used, I believe, but this might be a sub part,
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.600]   a different, you know, branch of that.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.640]   - Right.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.520]   - That was really the lesson to me from my OMAT,
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:34.520]   is that, you know, Google Photos could only be done by Google
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.200]   because it has the kind of, and Facebook probably,
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.720]   but it has that kind of deep neural network computing
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.160]   power at scale.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.200]   - Well, in fact, Facebook's getting in a little bit
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.240]   of hot water because they've released a interesting
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.480]   new product, which I actually have a lot called Moments,
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.320]   which does face recognition on all the photos
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.280]   you've ever uploaded to Facebook,
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:58.880]   and then says, suggests maybe some people
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.840]   you'd like to share that with, which is pretty wild
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.280]   because it's recognizing, not only recognizing the face,
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.240]   but recognizing the connections inherent.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.080]   And yet it's incredibly useful.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.280]   These are pictures I took of a friend's niece,
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.280]   they all popped up together, 'cause of course,
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.840]   they're all related, and it said,
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.840]   who would you like to share this with?
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.120]   It didn't know that it was Johnny's niece,
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.160]   but of course it made it much easier for me to share those,
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.600]   than I did in fact share those.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.400]   But it did recognize, and this is what's wild,
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.720]   it recognized Lisa in these pictures,
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.960]   in which she's wearing a jeweler's loop,
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:37.240]   and she's wearing a helmet, and yet it knew each one of these,
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.320]   I mean, how did it know that was Lisa?
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:42.680]   - Apparently, Facebook says that they can recognize
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:46.520]   people with 83% accuracy, even if their face is obscured,
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.360]   or there's hair or--
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.600]   - I'll vouch for that.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:53.480]   It recognized, I guess, her arms, her hands, I don't know,
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.080]   it's amazing.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:55.920]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:00.440]   - So, and I think that this must be something that got,
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.320]   a problem that got solved in the last few years,
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.160]   and then that's why--
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:07.040]   - You know, there's so much more that could be done
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.040]   with facial recognition, both Google and Facebook
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.840]   are holding back. - Scared to death.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.080]   - Yeah, they're holding back.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.960]   - And I think that's a pity, because, again,
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.200]   examples I always use is what could we do publicly
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.400]   about missing children and Alzheimer's patients,
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.600]   not to mention terrorist and criminals,
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.960]   and connections with people and relatives
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:30.240]   and all kinds of neat things, but--
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.600]   - Oh, it's gonna freak people out, creepy line.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:33.440]   - Right.
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.920]   You know, I've just kind of,
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.200]   I've embraced Google at this point,
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.280]   I've given up fighting.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.760]   I love you, Google.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.560]   There really is something to be saying that, you know,
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.600]   that old joke, "I, for one, accept our new overlords."
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.360]   There is at some point where you go,
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:56.360]   "This is just so cool and so useful and so valuable
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.600]   that I'm not gonna worry about the privacy concern."
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:04.320]   There was a slash dot thread in like 2001,
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:07.280]   where we rolled out something,
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.720]   and the slash dot commenter was like,
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.480]   "Soon you'll take your Google to the Google
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.240]   "and your Google and then you'll Google on your Google
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.320]   "with Google with Google with Google."
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.480]   - In 2001, it was right.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.240]   - And your car will be a Google car, and it's not--
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.680]   - Yeah, see?
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.400]   - Not so, I don't mind.
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:28.160]   And the problem is, I guess you label this technopanic,
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.280]   Jeff, the problem is you can always come up
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.640]   with doomsday scenarios around anything.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.200]   So it's easy to say, "Oh, well, you know what's next,
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.560]   "is the police are gonna use,
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.800]   "they probably already are,
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:43.160]   "use this to recognize faces on the street and in crowds,
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.320]   "and they're gonna be able to criminalize activity
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.960]   "and say, we know you were in this crowd."
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.440]   - Yeah, you can always create these doomsday scenarios,
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.920]   but does that mean you shouldn't do this thing?
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:58.720]   - If we manage life to the worst thing that could happen,
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.120]   we'll live in caves.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.360]   - There you go, thank you.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.200]   That's exactly it. - It keeps up
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.480]   pretty dangerous to me, Jeff.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.960]   I think we are-- - Actually, yes.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.800]   Bears get in there.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.640]   - I don't wanna cave. - I don't wanna cave.
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:10.560]   They're no cave.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:14.600]   - I'm scared of caves. - We don't like caves.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:18.760]   - I thought the article about Google bringing fast Wi-Fi
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.760]   to cities is an interesting one,
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.440]   'cause it's kind of a similar thing.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.200]   Wi-Fi could be incredibly useful,
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.840]   but I can see where people who don't like
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.080]   or don't trust Google might be,
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.160]   "Ah, here's another brick in the wall."
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:30.640]   - You were great minds think alike,
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.680]   because exactly where I was going with this.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.160]   This is the Sidewalk's lab startup
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.560]   that Google was talking about,
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.480]   to make cities better.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:41.600]   - With their background.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   - And their first project is to bring free, fast Wi-Fi
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.600]   to cities around the world.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:50.440]   Now, what could be wrong with that?
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:53.280]   - Well, Leo, was it last week
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.640]   when you were talking about the announcement
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.920]   of Sidewalk Labs, and you were saying,
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.440]   "This is so generic, I could take, you know, Twit,
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:03.160]   and insert my name, and it would be the exact same announcement."
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.800]   So maybe-- - Now we know
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:05.760]   what they're up to. - It's so cool, cool, cool.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.960]   Yeah. - Yeah, they were listening
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.920]   and like, "Okay, we gotta announce more concrete stuff
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.880]   "so that they know what's happening."
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.120]   - Well, it was one of those do-good things where,
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.520]   "Ah, yeah, that's a great idea,
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:15.600]   but let's see what you plan.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.680]   What are you thinking of?"
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.280]   And this is a great one.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:21.600]   So they're planning, this is from Bloomberg Business Week,
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.640]   come September, tall, thin pillars
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.320]   with digital tablet interfaces and large ads,
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.600]   slapped on the side, will begin to replace New York City's
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:32.800]   derelict payphone booths.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.160]   - And boy, are they derelict.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.520]   - Yeah.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.760]   In addition to offering free wireless internet access
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.880]   to anyone within 150 feet,
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:42.600]   they'll also have plugs for free phone charging,
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.360]   phone calling, internet browsing,
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.080]   and access to local services and information.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:49.040]   And this is ad supported.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:52.600]   In fact, it could bring the city half a billion dollars
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:53.440]   in ad revenue.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.280]   - Yeah.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.120]   - The one thing I hope was,
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:59.880]   so we now have Wi-Fi in scattered subway stops.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:02.240]   So just today I was doing this.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:05.440]   I wanted to, in fact, today I was rushing to get here.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.800]   I got here a 10 minutes to spare.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.640]   - Thank you.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.600]   - So I downloaded the Twig rundown,
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.200]   wanted to download it onto my tablet.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.040]   - Right.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.040]   - But my tablet doesn't,
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.680]   so I had to use the Wi-Fi,
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.680]   but you have to do that stupid thing,
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.920]   like you have to sign on and say,
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.400]   no, I'm gonna put up dirty pictures.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.240]   And so it just takes,
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.080]   you're trying to catch us up way,
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.080]   you're on the other stage,
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.040]   no, no, they were the Wi-Fi.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:25.880]   - Oh, no.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.000]   - You know, and we've got to come up,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:28.840]   I've said this before,
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.520]   we've got to come with a universal way that I just say,
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:33.200]   okay, so as soon as I'm near that phone booth
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.360]   and I can go on the Wi-Fi, it just does it smoothly.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:39.560]   This whole sign on, McGilla, is a pain.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.040]   - They don't have to do that?
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.080]   I don't know.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:46.640]   - I think that would be a fantastic,
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.480]   great thing to offer,
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.640]   because how many times have you ever ever read
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:52.120]   with the hotel hotspot Wi-Fi says,
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:52.960]   before you click,
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:53.800]   - Oh, right.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.920]   - I agree to terms of service.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.880]   But I think 75% of people would be like,
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.560]   I agree not to do anything criminal,
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:01.520]   or maybe just universally agree
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.880]   to these 10 principles,
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.960]   you know, about to harass anybody.
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.560]   And then you can just get on the Wi-Fi
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.720]   without any trouble at all.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.800]   That would be wonderful.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.040]   - So here's what these look like.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:12.160]   This is from Fast Company,
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.360]   an Instagram shot of these new booths.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:19.520]   This is the link NYC Wi-Fi access point.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.400]   - I'm in New Yorker.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.600]   - Yeah, yeah, doesn't that look cool?
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.760]   Can you zoom in a little bit on that, Jason?
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:28.760]   - Cool.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:31.280]   - Yeah, so there's obviously some sort of interface
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:34.160]   in the front there, maps, that kind of thing.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.160]   - In some way, people are gonna be standing there
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.920]   for half an hour charging their phones.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:39.920]   (laughs)
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.400]   - Well, you know, if you need to make a call,
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.840]   just the fact that you could go somewhere
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:44.800]   and plug in the phone and make that call,
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.080]   you don't need to stay in there and charge it,
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.640]   but just be able to make that call as worth it.
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:48.640]   - Oh, I know I agree with that,
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:50.240]   especially with Google Fi.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.680]   It'll switch over to the Wi-Fi.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.840]   - Right.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:53.680]   So that's--
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.640]   - Well, and a lot of people, you know,
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.120]   might have trouble getting internet in their home.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.880]   And so if you have a low income person
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:01.240]   who would normally go to the library
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:03.360]   and you can just go down to the nearest lamppost
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:04.600]   or something, that would be wonderful.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.680]   - This is a really good.
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.880]   So you're saying, Jeff,
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.440]   that there's still a lot of old phone booths just--
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.640]   - They're not booth-boost,
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.040]   so they're the kind of, you know,
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:15.960]   the hoods, head to knees size, then, right.
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:19.520]   But there, you know, people have done bad things in them.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.360]   And most of them are,
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.000]   I mean, they're not run by the phone company anymore.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.320]   They're run by an independent company,
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:29.320]   but you know, is actually, I think, using wireless
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.520]   and just charging you,
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.760]   but it's rare you find a phone in them.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:34.000]   There are still kind of there.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.040]   - These are not unattractive too.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:36.880]   I mean, I--
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.200]   - No, that's the good thing as a little--
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:39.040]   - But you know what's gonna happen?
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:39.880]   - I'm gonna feed-- - I'm gonna say--
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.040]   - I'm gonna feed these not been applied yet.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.680]   A, we're gonna graffiti, B, within six months,
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.080]   we're gonna have stories about all of the bacteria
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:45.920]   all on the touchscreen.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.280]   (laughing)
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.360]   - Don't touch it.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.520]   Use a glove if you're gonna--
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.520]   - Then we're gonna have--
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.360]   (laughing)
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.200]   - You're gonna be able to walk by and say,
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.960]   okay, Google, and then Google's listening
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.480]   to all of New York.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.800]   - Yeah.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:57.640]   - Yeah, that's right. - That's right.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:58.640]   - You're really trying to listen to--
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.280]   - Okay, phone booth.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.120]   - Yeah.
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:02.360]   (laughing)
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.920]   - This is good looking though, I gotta say.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.960]   And they've even mounted a little light in the sidewalk
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:07.840]   to light it up.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.040]   That's pretty.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:13.120]   - The company is from Dan Dr. Rob, who was--
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.520]   - Former deputy mayor under--
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.840]   - Deputy mayor, head of Bloomberg,
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:19.040]   the business, very smart guy,
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:21.640]   really cares about cities, loves New York.
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:24.040]   And I think neat things will come out of us.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:25.440]   - Well, this is the kind of thing too,
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:29.200]   you benefit from an urban aggregation of people.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.040]   - Yes.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.240]   - You can do stuff like this, and as you heard,
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:36.120]   it could make half a billion dollars a year in ad revenue,
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.640]   just 'cause there's so many people in New York City.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.600]   - You're not gonna put that in Montana.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:43.840]   Wow, that's pretty neat.
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.320]   - You get balloons and you know, that's--
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.520]   - Yeah, there's other things for that, that's right.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.760]   That's right.
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:53.360]   Google has launched a news lab to help journalists.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.200]   I was wondering what you thought of this.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.040]   - I could tell you about that.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.840]   Well, in fact, I visited right after I was up
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:59.920]   the last time in Petaluma, I went down and visited
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:04.920]   the news lab team, Steve Grove, X YouTube and X Google+,
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:08.160]   a great team of some great people, Olivia Ma,
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.720]   there's Steve right there,
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:12.360]   Daniel Seaburg, Simon Rogers,
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.560]   they're all really great people.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:18.120]   Now, this is part of what I see is the leapfrogging
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.680]   of Google and Facebook trying to make nice with publishers
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:23.000]   'cause publishers can be mean to them in Europe.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.800]   Google started the Digital News Initiative
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.640]   with eight publishers.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.360]   There, I think, about to see Sundar
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.400]   and we'll see whether this moved to the product side.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.440]   Facebook did instant articles and what I just saw
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.200]   a story up since that's finally gonna take off
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.360]   beyond the test articles.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.520]   Then Google comes back with Digital News Lab.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.160]   This is not, you know, news lab may be a bit of misnomer.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.280]   It's, it develops some stuff,
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.560]   it did some new things on trending,
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.560]   it'll do things that are generally helpful.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.360]   The aim of this is not to reinvent news
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.440]   and fix the news industry,
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.920]   it's more to help the news industry.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.840]   - But imagine if you're not an official reporter
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.400]   working for a major metropolitan daily,
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:02.360]   but in fact, just somebody's interested in doing some digging.
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:03.760]   I mean, there's a lot of information.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.360]   - There's good stuff here, they've sparked people.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:10.960]   Simon Rogers was a, was a data vis guy at the Guardian
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.160]   who then went to Twitter and got the hell out
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:15.520]   and is now at Google and is doing neat things there
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.160]   and that's great.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:20.600]   But this is, this is, the one thing I wanna keep pushing
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:24.000]   Google on though, is that this, this is initiative of,
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.080]   you know, marketing and corporate relations
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.440]   with media companies, which is good.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.240]   I'm all for it, it's wonderful.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:34.000]   I still wanna push farther than say that Google needs
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.960]   to take news into its heart in its product side.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:40.360]   I'm sure Matt could confirm if it ain't product,
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.400]   it ain't not in Google.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.680]   And so that's what I wanna see next
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.560]   is how not that Google's doing nice things for the industry,
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:53.160]   which is wonderful, but how do we find true mutual interest?
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:54.640]   Google wants to organize the world's knowledge
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:58.080]   and make it universally accessible, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:02.120]   News and an informed society are part of that mission.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:05.160]   How does that become part of the heart of what Google does?
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:08.320]   So this is a good start, but I think there's a quantum leap
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.720]   that comes when it gets into the product side of Google.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.560]   - Yeah.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:16.120]   I mean, there's a lot of fun things you can do.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:18.160]   I love the Google Trends searches you can do.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:19.240]   - It's beautiful stuff.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:22.920]   - Yeah, people, you know, truth is anybody who's watching
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:27.280]   should just dig into this, g.co/newslab.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.280]   They also announced they're working with MatterBC,
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:34.280]   which is an incubator, accelerator for media startups.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:37.720]   What else are they doing?
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:39.480]   - They're doing training and other things.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:42.920]   They had a launch party in the great YouTube space
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:45.880]   in New York two nights ago.
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.280]   So I'm delighted this is here,
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:49.760]   but being greedy and desperate news people,
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.600]   I'll say, okay, what have you done for me lately?
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:52.960]   - Yeah.
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:54.200]   - Push for more. - Yeah.
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:59.240]   - Oh, let's-- - Well, you could ask for Google
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:02.120]   to fight on your behalf when the government comes knocking
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:04.080]   and wants to subpoena information.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.560]   - Boy, is that a great and amazing story,
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:08.120]   an awful story, but amazing story.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:08.960]   - Let's take a break.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.440]   We'll tell that story when we come back.
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.760]   Jeff Jarvis, Matt Cutts, Leo LaPorte,
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.120]   this week in Google is on the air.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:17.960]   Our show today brought to you by our great friends
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:18.840]   at Zip Recruiter.
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:21.000]   If you're the person at your business
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.320]   who's got to hire people,
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:26.520]   you need to know about Zip Recruiter for a couple of reasons.
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:29.400]   First of all, it's not immediately obvious
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:33.320]   what the best job site is.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.920]   There's many of them, more than 100,
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:38.560]   and each has its own kind of specialty.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:43.560]   Zip Recruiter lets you post to 100 plus job listing sites
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:47.040]   and lots of the social media sites too,
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.040]   like Twitter and Facebook and Google+,
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:52.760]   and I tell ya, it is amazing.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:57.080]   Post your listing, and then the candidates roll in.
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:58.680]   Actually, you'll start getting candidates
[00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:59.760]   within the first few seconds,
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.480]   because you're also being instantly matched
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.840]   to their database of over 4 million current resumes.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:10.440]   So you'll get instant matches, then more people.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.520]   The good news is they don't call on your business,
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.520]   they're not emailing you.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:18.040]   It all rolls into the Zip Recruiter interface,
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:21.880]   which makes it very easy to go through the candidates
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:25.720]   and to rank them to select the one that's just right for you.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.440]   400,000 businesses now have used it, including ours,
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:32.120]   and you can try it for free.
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.440]   There's nothing more important
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.800]   than getting the right person for your company,
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.800]   getting a good match, getting somebody who really fits,
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.160]   and the more choices you have,
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.800]   the more likely you're gonna find just that person.

[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:04.040]   We are talking Twig, we're talking Google,
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.320]   we're talking Facebook, we're talking big ideas,
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.160]   little ideas, all sorts of stuff.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.640]   What is the story you started,
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.200]   but I'm not sure where you're going with that one.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.200]   Jeff Jarvis explained.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.760]   Matt, you were gonna start with us.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.120]   Maybe Matt should explain.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:19.960]   I owe error.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:20.840]   I'm happy to start.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.280]   Yeah, and Jason, I just pasted another--
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.520]   Wait, Matt, you're sinking into your lower third, so can you--
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.240]   (laughing)
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.840]   He's melting.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:32.680]   He's melting.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:33.760]   He's melting.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.320]   (laughing)
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.560]   Apologies about that.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.200]   (laughing)
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.480]   Is your laptop in your lap, actually?
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:43.120]   Yeah, I'm sort of bracing it on my knee.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:43.960]   Oh, okay.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:44.800]   I'm sure it does a room.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.960]   Okay.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.640]   So there's an interesting story if I basically,
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.480]   I'll try to summarize and please no one sue me
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.520]   and no one at Google get angry if I do it wrong,
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.760]   but the US government came to Google and said,
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:02.440]   we would like data on Jacob Applebaum, IO errors,
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.440]   data, his Gmail and maybe other stuff,
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.880]   but the Gmail is the stuff that I read about,
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.560]   and Google tried to fight it.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.360]   And along the way, we also,
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.000]   Google got a gag order that said,
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.760]   we're not allowed to discuss it with anyone.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:17.080]   And so now, something like five years later,
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.720]   we're finally able to provide more information.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:24.720]   So, first look, published a 306 page legal document
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.400]   that's basically talking about all the steps
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.440]   that Google tried to take to protect Jacob's data.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.120]   And of course, Jacob wasn't able to be
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.960]   apprised of the progress of that
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.880]   and what worked and didn't work
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.800]   when we fought that case in court.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.600]   So the story find link was interesting
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.720]   because I think Jacob sort of sent,
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.920]   he was live tweeting it as he was reading this legal--
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.720]   - It's amazing, yeah.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.040]   - So there's one tweet where he's like,
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:53.840]   I just feel like I should send flowers to Google's legal team,
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.560]   they must have spent hundreds of thousand dollars
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.560]   on this case alone.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:57.400]   - I'm sure.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.600]   - I have to say using Gmail has been
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.880]   the best legal services investment I've ever made.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.440]   - That's amazing work.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:05.640]   - So Jacob is, this was over, I think over WikiLeaks,
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.320]   Jacob's done so many things.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.200]   He's a very well-known hacker and activist
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.240]   @IOError on Twitter.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:18.000]   And he was only apprised of this a few days ago.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.080]   But it's been going on since 2009.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.120]   - Yeah, which sort of to me violates
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.520]   all kinds of due process and the right to know
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:29.480]   and fight against stuff that's going on against you.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.920]   But it was funny because I tweeted this
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:32.080]   and at least two different people were like,
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:35.120]   okay, so the moral is never use Google for your email.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.560]   And I think, no, that's exactly the wrong answer.
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.480]   The answer is Google will fight very hard
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.320]   just like Twitter fought very hard
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.640]   to protect subscribers' privacy.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.560]   But what needs to happen is a new way of looking
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.440]   at some of these national security letters
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.960]   and these gag orders because no one's claiming
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.480]   that as far as I know that Jacob is trying
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.280]   to do terrorist type things, it's just he was sort of
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.800]   a player in this stuff going on with WikiLeaks.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.280]   And you can actually see the government say,
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:06.320]   when we let Twitter talk about their disclosure,
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.200]   it generated a lot of problems for us.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.320]   And so we don't want Google to be able to talk about it.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.480]   And that's incredibly frustrating.
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:15.720]   Google or anybody else ought to be able to fight this stuff
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.480]   and not be gagged for five years.
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:20.120]   That's just incredibly excessive and not called for.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:20.960]   In my opinion.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.920]   - So he also says, I don't think I'll ever be able
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.920]   to come back to the United States.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.000]   - Yeah.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.080]   - I did not feel safe.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.920]   - They are clearly after him.
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:31.760]   - Yeah.
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.960]   - In huge ways.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:36.400]   It's an absurd, it's a document that's very disturbing
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:37.320]   about democracy.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.280]   - He says he's being politically harassed.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:43.440]   And the government says that unsealing these orders
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.560]   has jeopardized their investigation.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:48.840]   And Jacob says, yeah, it's hard to politically harass me
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:49.920]   when it's public.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:54.160]   Just shameful, really shameful.
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.120]   So there you go.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:04.560]   - But we need to, there's these weird legal doctrines
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.800]   that date back to like ECPA, like to the 80s,
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:12.600]   that say, oh, if you have documents stored on a cloud server
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.960]   after 30 or 60 or 90 days, you know, clearly it wasn't private
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.880]   because in those days you would pull down your email
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.400]   and so if you left your email on the server,
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.320]   it must not have been private.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.440]   - Anything after 90 days is free to free game.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:27.240]   - So practically no one does it that way.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:31.560]   In a world in which people use Yahoo and Hotmail and Gmail.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:35.080]   Of course, you should have to get a full subpoena, you know,
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.680]   and all the legal protection just because it's sitting
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.720]   in the cloud or on Google servers doesn't mean
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.480]   you don't want it to be protected
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.080]   from government scrutiny.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.400]   - And as I'm fond of pointing out,
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:48.280]   this is the problem with writing laws to technologies.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.240]   That law was written to the technology.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:55.240]   Our constitutional right to privacy in our mail
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:58.040]   applies only to first class mails and packages
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.400]   through the USPS.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.680]   Whereas the law should be written to the principle
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.360]   that says the private communications are private unless
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:08.640]   and there's a condition there about warrants and due process.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.680]   But that's not the case and that's why every other kind
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:14.000]   of private communication isn't truly private from government.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.200]   And yes, I do care deeply about privacy,
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.480]   especially against government,
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:22.040]   the one entity institution that can use your own life
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.240]   against you.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:28.240]   - You gotta read this article and it's just kind of amazing.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:32.920]   And hats off to Google for a fighting so hard with no one knowing,
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.240]   they could have just let it go and say,
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.880]   okay, a subpoena, we, we, we, we are seen into it.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.800]   So it is in Google's interest not to have this be the precedent
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.680]   because Google, Google, one people would feel the review.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.520]   - But as far as Google knew,
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.320]   as far as Google knew, no one would ever know
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.720]   that they had done this and that's the other
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.240]   - Well, let's feel the Google so fought
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.080]   to make it public.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.400]   - Right, right.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.960]   Incredible, it's incredible.
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:55.040]   Anyway, so you're exactly spot on Jeff.
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.720]   These laws do matter and writing it so that it, you know,
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:00.080]   isn't obsolete by technology really matters.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:02.760]   So, and now that I've been a complete bummer,
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.440]   why don't we talk about free music supported by ads?
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.520]   (laughing)
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.360]   - Read the story.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:13.200]   It's, you know, it's so important and wow.
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.960]   That's the thing, when people talk about
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.800]   kind of imaginary or potential threats,
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.800]   that's one thing, but these things are right in our faces.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:23.280]   There's nothing to imagine about this.
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:27.040]   And, you know, maybe Google knows a lot about me,
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:31.400]   but the federal government has prison cells and guns.
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:34.400]   They have much more harm that they can do.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:38.880]   And this is just shocking and very saddening.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.920]   All right, free music.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.000]   Let's go to Google Music.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:41.840]   'Cause you know what?
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.840]   Google Music got better and better and they announced
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:47.640]   that they bought songs some time ago, which I really liked.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:51.120]   It was a free service that allowed you to listen to music
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:54.120]   like kind of a radio station based on your mood,
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:57.760]   the time of day, the concierge, and Google bought it.
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:01.680]   And they've now incorporated that into music,
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.520]   Google All Access Music.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:07.160]   If you got a free version with that ad supported,
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.360]   if you're not an all access subscriber,
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.280]   but as far as I'm concerned,
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.680]   there's just yet another reason to subscribe.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.040]   And you can see, it says,
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.720]   it's Wednesday afternoon, play mute.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.520]   By the way, Google fixed this
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.400]   because for the longest time,
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.120]   this was in the Eastern time zone.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.840]   So now it would say it's Wednesday evening.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.840]   But Google fixed it and they actually know where I am.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.480]   - Because that's the center of the universe.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.800]   - Yeah, right.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.080]   And the longest time, it's, you know,
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:33.400]   I'd be in the afternoon and say, it's Wednesday night.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:34.680]   You're going out.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.760]   So play music for getting out.
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.240]   What, which do you want, gentlemen?
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.920]   Getting outside, entering beast mode,
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.760]   boosting your energy, brand new music,
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:43.920]   or having fun at work.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.280]   And that's just the beginning, by the way.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.880]   There's a lot more focusing and no lyrics.
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:52.280]   There's also stations based on your songs,
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.800]   recent activity.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.720]   I've always liked, I'm feeling lucky radio,
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.440]   which takes the music that I've listened to
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.120]   and the music I own and makes a radio station for me.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.080]   But, well, you wanna enter beast mode?
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:03.920]   - Yeah.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:04.920]   - Let's get into beast mode.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.120]   Do you want gritty hardcore rap,
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.960]   brutal bass drops,
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.600]   turnt up anthems?
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.440]   Is that a word?
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.280]   Turnt?
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.440]   Turnt up anthems?
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.400]   Greatest aggro anthems,
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.360]   adrenaline boosting fight music,
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.960]   or I think aggro anthems.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.280]   Aggro anthems, and now we can go to,
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.000]   and by the way, you see how far down I've gone?
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:25.840]   There's so many stations.
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.120]   - There's aggro cultural anthems?
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.120]   - No, aggressive.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.640]   Aggro is aggressive.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.640]   See the beast?
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:32.560]   (grunting)
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.400]   Do you want 90s aggro anthems?
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.200]   Welcome to the jungle radio or aughts.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.520]   Let's listen to aughts aggro anthems.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.320]   Probably none of this is safe for work.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:46.400]   - Instead of punching a wall,
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.560]   unleash your inner beast with some angst
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.360]   written O.O. thrashers, hard rock, emo punk,
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.320]   and aggro rap hits,
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:59.120]   not for the faint of heart or the library.
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.600]   (laughing)
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.800]   - Lose yourself M&M.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:04.640]   There you go.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:10.200]   - That's not exactly, it's a good song.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.920]   - He does grow over time.
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.880]   - I'm gonna get pumped up.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:17.720]   - Yeah, get spaghetti on my shirt and all that.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.640]   - I'll sometimes listen to it to get new music to run to.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.800]   You know, 'cause I can't listen to Twig all the time.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.720]   You don't tweet from me to listen to Twig now.
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:30.760]   - Oh, actually yeah, I have a,
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:33.040]   there's a station I listen to that's some really good
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.040]   new music, there's a lot of stuff in here.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.640]   So this is songs,
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:39.480]   and this is free, they'll do ad support at all.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:41.320]   I haven't listened to it for the free version,
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.960]   'cause frankly I have, I paid for it,
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.320]   but Google music just gets better and better.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.440]   There are some negatives to Google music.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.360]   You can only play on a certain number of devices,
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.320]   and they don't let you deactivate devices
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:57.360]   as much as you'd want, I'm sure those are in.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.840]   The restrictions imposed by the music industry.
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.240]   - They need to fix that though.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.040]   Like Jason, I feel your pain,
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.720]   you can only deactivate for a year, for a different year.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:08.960]   - It's frustrating, yeah.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.600]   'Cause Jason and I, both,
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.600]   Jason's probably worse than me,
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.640]   but we activate how many devices a year, 20 or 30.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.640]   I mean, it's gotten to the point,
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.920]   I mean, before if I was reviewing a device,
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:21.200]   mind you, obviously an edge case, right?
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.600]   Like we're reviewing devices.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.840]   The majority of people are not doing that.
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.480]   But part of my way of reviewing devices
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.160]   is using a device as if it's my own,
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.360]   and I use play music all the time,
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.800]   but now that's not a part of my review process.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.280]   So it kind of changes things a little bit,
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:39.000]   'cause I can't afford to burn through
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.160]   those deauthorizations.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.680]   - And what play music really needs, in my opinion,
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:44.640]   is Family Plan.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.040]   And I think Apple did that right, right?
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.000]   With Apple Music, I think, what is it?
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.560]   $15 for a Family Plan?
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.920]   - Spotify, $50, and Spotify's gonna do that too.
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.920]   - That would help a lot. - Confidence, yeah.
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:56.040]   - Yeah.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.160]   - That's good feedback.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.320]   That's good feedback.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.640]   - Yeah, this is because it's tied to your account,
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:03.840]   there's no way to share it with your family in any way,
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.080]   because they would have that access
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.800]   to all your Gmail and everything else.
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.000]   But there's other restrictions.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.280]   You can only, the weird one,
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:13.760]   and again, I think there's music industry.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:17.440]   I love Google Music 'cause I can upload my music to it.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.440]   What is it, $50,000?
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.640]   So I wasn't limiting that. - Yeah, I think it's $50,000 now.
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:23.360]   - So which is insane.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.560]   - And the example I always give is
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.080]   that most of these services don't,
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.920]   the only place you can get the Beatles
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.480]   is from Apple's iTunes,
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.840]   because the Beatles never did digital deals
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:34.520]   and still don't want to,
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.560]   whoever owns the Beatles music today, I think it's Yoko.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:41.600]   But if I bought Beatles music,
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.880]   I can upload it to my Google Music account
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.520]   and now I can stream it.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.600]   And so that's great.
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.560]   That's now part of my radio station's
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.480]   high quality Google Music.
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.120]   So all of my songs are there,
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.920]   plus the 30 million other songs that they have access to.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.480]   It's a really great service.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.960]   But there's a weird restriction.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.000]   I can't remember what the details are.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   I can't download my own music from them.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.160]   I can do that, I think twice.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.440]   No, it's not a backup.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.760]   Don't think of it as a backup service.
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:11.840]   Three times?
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.240]   Okay, it's not a backup service.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:17.600]   'Cause it's not like you can always download your songs
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.080]   from it, which is weird,
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.080]   'cause those are songs I own.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:25.080]   But anyway, the intake is very much like Apple's
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.920]   new music system.
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:29.040]   You choose the genres you like.
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.240]   Classical, hip hop, rap, and jazz.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.760]   Who has the best curated collections?
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.480]   I mean, Spotify's I think are very good.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:38.280]   Spotify's are excellent.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.320]   I think Apple's gonna be good.
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.560]   But that's what Apple's focusing on, right?
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.240]   I don't know.
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.960]   I'm surprised that they don't have,
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.240]   I mean, Scroblar or Last FM,
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.880]   you ought to be able to subscribe to people or,
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.120]   rather than having some editorial person on staff
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.640]   in the cloud, I would happily follow people
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.440]   who are cooler than me or my friends
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.720]   and just let them curate good music.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.840]   Right, I like Sinatra and Jackson.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.840]   I like Johann Sebastian B.A.C.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.840]   as well as Pink Floyd.
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:13.720]   I like the Queen and the Rihanna, who is the Queen.
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:15.880]   The Stones and Bay.
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.920]   I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.440]   Lost my head there.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.800]   So, I have to go back and do this later.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.080]   That's gonna take forever to go through all of these artists.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.400]   But you could see, and then you,
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.760]   basically what I'm doing is I'm customizing this
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:32.120]   and then I'm gonna get some radio stations.
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:37.200]   The download thing that you were talking about, Leo,
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.680]   it's that you can download two times on the web.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:42.240]   But if you use, it says here,
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.560]   the limit does not apply when you use Google Play Music
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.960]   for Chrome to download.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:48.880]   So, I'm not sure what the difference is,
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.440]   but you can get unlimited access to it.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:54.000]   So, I can't just do it through the Chrome,
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.280]   if I have a subscription.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.680]   All right, that's good to know.
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:59.520]   They probably didn't want people sharing an account
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:00.560]   and an entire world.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.320]   Oh, that's what it is.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.160]   That's what it is.
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:04.480]   Take your entire library.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:05.320]   That's what it is.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.600]   Again, I don't think it's them.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.920]   I think it's the record industry with your,
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:15.920]   and the thing is that each system seems to have different rules.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.440]   So, I could deactivate, deauthorize stuff,
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.840]   unlimited on one system and only once on others,
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.320]   and it's just very strange.
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.520]   See, now I have Beatles radio
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:30.200]   because I actually have the beat, I own the Beatles.
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.800]   Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to get that right.
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.560]   And to their credit, they've got album art in there,
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:37.160]   and similar music and so forth.
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:41.560]   I don't think I want to hear the beat-alls, however.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.160]   (laughing)
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:45.080]   (laughing)
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.000]   That's what you hear on other services.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.880]   We now have the Beatles.
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.440]   Perhaps you'd like to listen to this karaoke version
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.520]   of "Hey Jude."
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.960]   Like the beat-alls.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:58.720]   (laughing)
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.920]   That's not good.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.200]   But look, I got the quarrymen.
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.840]   It's the original, yeah.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.080]   Oh, wow.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.920]   Yeah, that must be from a compilation
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:08.840]   that you imported or something.
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:12.600]   Yeah, that's some weird source of that.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.880]   I really, I like all access.
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.640]   I actually ended up getting Spotify too
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:18.120]   just 'cause they carry our podcasts
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.960]   and I wanted to support 'em,
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:21.560]   and I really like Spotify too.
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.200]   So, there's some good choices, which makes it very difficult,
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:29.440]   frankly, for Apple to enter this market.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:32.720]   (clearing throat)
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:33.920]   Did you all see the big news?
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.920]   Probably from Google, the health tracking wristband?
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.000]   No, yeah, okay, tell us about that.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.800]   Is that real?
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:41.960]   It is real.
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:46.960]   It's from either, yeah, it's from Google's X Life Sciences
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.000]   and it's not a consumer device,
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.960]   but there's a lot of people who run clinical trials.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.160]   And if you run the clinical trial,
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:57.000]   you want to know their heart rate or their temperature,
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.880]   maybe their pulse oxygen level.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.520]   And so, it kind of sounds like they developed this
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:03.520]   for internal use and now they're looking at
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:05.920]   whether they can make it available more widely.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.240]   They also do that.
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:09.040]   That's the same people who are doing the contact lens
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.520]   that can tell you what your blood sugar level is.
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.200]   That's right, yeah, so you're not gonna go by
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.720]   pick up one at Target or Walmart anytime soon,
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.200]   but to be able to run clinical trials
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.360]   and correlate this sort of data-like skin temperature
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.520]   with whatever medicine you're taking
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.160]   could be pretty useful.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.000]   Very useful.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.600]   Having had to go through having worn a halter monitor,
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.240]   this is an old man moment,
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.800]   when they want to check your heart over some period of time
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.760]   because I have atrial fibrillation.
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.040]   To be able to just do that
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.320]   and know that you could check anytime.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.760]   And some people are asymptomatic with that
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.840]   if the monitor could let you know this is going on
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.720]   when you don't know it.
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:51.120]   You know darn well that some of these things
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.880]   are gonna be indicators of worst things to come
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.400]   and you can get an alarm and alert.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.720]   This is gonna save people's lives.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.160]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.280]   But it's gonna violate your privacy at the same time.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.200]   Yeah, I don't care.
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.360]   You can share my fibrillation with the world.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.200]   I don't care.
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:07.320]   We know, you know, I was just reading an article
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.760]   in the Times a couple of days ago
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:11.200]   that we've really drastically improved
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:13.160]   heart attack survival rates.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:16.280]   Not by any specialized technology,
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.960]   but just by getting people to treatment faster.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:23.280]   You know, the heart has like 90 minutes to cover.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.400]   And if you get in before that,
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.360]   you can do it without damage.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.440]   I was amazed by that.
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:29.040]   Of course, living in New York area, it's scary
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.120]   'cause God knows all the bozos
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.720]   who don't get out of the way for the ambulance.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.120]   But that ties nicely in with these metric meters
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.600]   and so forth because the same thing with stroke.
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.200]   You're survival chances of the stroke are very, very good
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:46.360]   if you can get treated fast enough.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:49.040]   So, you know, having a little advanced knowledge
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.640]   of something bad about to happen
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.960]   can make a huge difference in survival rates.
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:54.960]   And quality life.
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.760]   You know, earlier today we talked about computers
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.560]   and neural nets making cool pictures
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:01.920]   or doing face recognition.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:04.880]   But if you've got sensors that are ambient noise
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.960]   and temperature and all this sort of stuff,
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:11.160]   and maybe it's possible to detect things like heart attacks.
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:12.600]   Now, because it's medical,
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.000]   maybe it would just show you an alert
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.240]   or a notification on your phone
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:16.400]   and then you'll have to decide
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.360]   whether you would follow the ambulance or something.
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.880]   But, you know, there's no reason you couldn't use that
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:25.880]   sort of, you know, intelligence or machine learning
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.880]   to maybe help save people's lives
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:30.000]   or get the medical attention much faster.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.440]   Oh, I love it.
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:37.440]   So, here's a story from the Verge about,
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.640]   now that we've done a happy news.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.480]   (laughing)
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:44.720]   Google Photos in the unguessable URL.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.360]   So, actually this is probably good news.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.440]   Yeah, it is.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.480]   The user on Reddit said,
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.680]   "I was browsing through my photos
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.440]   "and I wanted to see the full size of an image."
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:56.200]   So I right clicked it, which gave me a link.
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:20:00.520]   Even when I'm in incognito mode, that link is public.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.680]   I haven't shared it,
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:07.480]   but anybody who knew what the link was,
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:09.960]   could see it now, of course.
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.680]   This is a kind of security that is kind of frowned upon.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.120]   It's called security by obscurity
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:19.200]   because the URL is incredibly,
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.200]   it's 40 characters,
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:24.600]   it's 10 to the 70th combinations.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:28.160]   So it's highly unlikely that somebody could guess
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.840]   an individual URL.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:32.520]   On the other hand, I should point out
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:37.000]   that it wouldn't be hard to just start generating
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.640]   random links and seeing what you find.
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:41.800]   So be hard to find your picture,
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.600]   but a picture, not so hard.
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:47.040]   Web traffic is encrypted.
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.160]   So as you're looking at a photo,
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:52.640]   you have to worry about somebody in the coffee shop.
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:55.600]   But most importantly, the photo isn't at that URL
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.680]   until you specifically say,
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:00.240]   "Let's look at that photo."
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:04.800]   So I think it's probably okay.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:08.520]   - Well, and it also sounds like reading through the article,
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.000]   they don't put the photo at that URL
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.720]   until you do a right click on it.
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.080]   So the photo isn't accessible
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:16.240]   until you do a right click and ask for a URL.
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.080]   - Right.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:21.240]   - And then Google also keeps an eye on how many,
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:23.480]   they rate limits the request.
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:26.360]   So if suddenly some address is asking
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.480]   for a million different photo URLs,
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.680]   they're gonna block it.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:30.520]   - Let me understand that, Matt.
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.360]   So basically the URL doesn't exist
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:35.000]   until the user generates it by right clicking.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:35.840]   - Right.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:36.680]   - I believe that's right.
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.000]   I believe that's correct.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.360]   - And I've been annoyed the other direction
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.440]   where I wanted to share,
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.320]   I wanted Google to host my photo for me.
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:46.800]   And so I got a URL that was on Google Photos
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:50.560]   and or before Google Photos, it was just on Drive.
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.840]   And after fetching it five or six or 20 times
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.800]   to make sure that it would be safe,
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:56.120]   I think Google rate limited.
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.440]   And so I had to pull the image down and host it myself.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.680]   So I think they are putting some good protections in place.
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:03.800]   - How many people looked at that picture before it?
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:05.080]   - Well, I'm paranoid.
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:06.080]   So when I do a blog post,
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.440]   I was gonna host it on Drive and some reloaded.
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.280]   - Right, oh I see.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.400]   - My blog post, a bunch.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:12.640]   And then at some point it failed and it failed from then on.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:15.040]   And so just to be safe,
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.000]   it's multiple steps to pull it down
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.040]   so that it's hosted on your own.
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:18.920]   I wish you could say,
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:21.000]   well maybe now you can make this public
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:21.920]   and then anyone can see it.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:22.760]   - That would be nice.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.000]   Yeah, right now you have to download it
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.400]   to your computer then put it somewhere else.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.240]   - Yeah.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.360]   - That's not rate limited.
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:31.240]   Well if you-- - Well, and go ahead.
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:32.080]   - If you think about it,
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.800]   this feature of Google Photos,
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:36.920]   the fact that you can share a link
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:39.320]   with friends or family or-- - That's huge for me.
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.160]   - Or on Facebook is incredibly useful.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.760]   And the only way to do that is to make that URL
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:44.680]   available somewhere.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.880]   So they try to obfuscate it
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.040]   but it's sort of built in that you need that.
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.280]   - It's gotta be a public URL.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.280]   I like the idea that I can share collections.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:54.440]   I'm gonna use this as I travel.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:55.440]   I've been looking at so funny
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.640]   'cause I've been looking at all different ways
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.600]   to share pictures.
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.920]   And the easiest thing for me is just have photos
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:03.320]   automatically uploaded to Google Photos
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.560]   and then I can use the automatic collections
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:08.000]   or make new collections
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.600]   and share them on my blog or wherever else I want.
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:13.440]   That's kinda cool.
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.480]   So if you hit the share button,
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.280]   if you hit the share button,
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.360]   we've always had Google+,
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.880]   but now Facebook and Twitter are there
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.560]   but you can also just get this shareable link.
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:25.640]   And now this is generating that unusual link.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:26.480]   And this is a link. - Is there a link
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:28.520]   between a collection and a story?
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:29.720]   They were calling it stories.
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:31.240]   - I think it's the same thing now.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.800]   - Stories are not collection. - Yeah.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.200]   So if I do a new tab, let's do this and see.
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:37.880]   In fact, let me do a new incognito tab.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:39.480]   So it doesn't even know it's me.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:44.200]   - Jeff, I think a story might involve like,
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:47.040]   that animation of you're going from place to place.
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.240]   - No, I think this does that.
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.560]   That's these collections, do that.
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.680]   So this is what it calls a collection now.
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:54.080]   And it's just like stories, right?
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.240]   - Yeah, it's just like stories there.
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.680]   - Oh, gotcha.
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:57.520]   - So I love this.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:59.640]   But this, I just shared this with the incognito link.
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.400]   - Plus kudos. - Yeah.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:02.360]   So I mean, isn't that sweet?
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:04.080]   I mean, this is gonna be great.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.080]   I'm gonna, but you're saying,
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.280]   and that's something to keep in mind, Matt.
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.320]   If I put that link on my blog,
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:12.000]   it might get rate limited pretty quick.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.360]   - It could, yeah.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.080]   - But if you're just sharing with family, then--
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.400]   - Facebook would probably be okay.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:18.200]   - Yeah. - Right?
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:19.040]   Yeah.
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.040]   - I would think, yeah.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:21.880]   - That was pretty great.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:24.520]   My daughter's high school graduation did that automatically,
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.760]   and it was pretty wonderful.
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:28.360]   - I really love this capability,
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.600]   and this is an auto awesome.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:32.160]   That's, you know, I mean, it just,
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.360]   I mean, I didn't do anything.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.000]   And of course, now with the new photos,
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.760]   you can create your own stories and collections,
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.040]   whatever you wanna call 'em,
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:43.640]   and put music behind 'em and, you know, fancy 'em up.
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:44.880]   So I think this is great.
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.400]   I'm really happy about this.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:49.240]   - Would you get rate limited before,
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:52.600]   if you posted one of these stories to like Google+,
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.440]   I wouldn't think that you would.
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:55.720]   - No, I'd never had anybody say, oh, I can't see it.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:56.640]   - Right.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:57.480]   So I wonder what the difference is.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:58.560]   - I think probably when I was,
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.440]   I think I was getting rate limited when I post,
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:04.120]   when I was trying to load an image on Google Drive,
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:05.920]   so I'm probably completely different,
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:06.880]   and I'll bet Google's smart,
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:10.080]   and if you've got like 20 different IP addresses,
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:12.080]   then it's like, oh, real people are looking at it,
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.080]   whereas if it's like the same IP address 30 times in a row,
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.680]   then they're like, oh, this is some dumb bot.
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:17.520]   - Yeah.
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:18.360]   - Okay.
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.720]   - No, I was the dumb bot.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:21.680]   - You were the dumb bot.
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:23.000]   - Well, I'll try it.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.240]   I'll put all my, I'm gonna share my stuff up
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:27.680]   to leoville.net.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:31.280]   Google is, if you thought your pixel was expensive,
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:33.840]   now there's a $2,000 Chrome box, but--
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:34.680]   - Yeah.
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:36.520]   - That's a good reason for it.
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:39.560]   It's for meetings, and for people who spent
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:44.360]   upwards of $100,000 on special Cisco teleconference rooms,
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.840]   this seems like a pretty good darn deal.
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:51.840]   Lows groups of up to 20 people in the meeting rooms,
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:55.080]   but you do need this Chrome box,
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.800]   and it provides pan-tilt Zoom camera features,
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.160]   that's nice.
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.040]   Additional mics and speakers for the groups
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.440]   improve support for dual screen setups.
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.600]   This is for $2,000.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:07.520]   This is pretty sweet.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:09.600]   The PTZ camera means you can actually,
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:12.520]   I presume, aim the camera, right?
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.640]   At different people.
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:14.840]   That's really nice.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.640]   It makes the--
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.280]   - Oh, and I think, probably a lot of people
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.520]   are thinking about consumer grade webcams,
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.440]   and they're like, oh, I should pay $100,
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:25.000]   but for businesses who are used to
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.880]   Tandberg machines and stuff like that,
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:30.040]   this is really pretty cheap, or inexpensive
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.960]   for a product like that, so.
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:34.400]   - What a great use for a Chrome box.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:37.680]   You're using Hangouts right now, Matt, with this.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:40.840]   - Yeah, yeah, and Google does a lot of its video conferencing
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.280]   with a very similar product.
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.120]   - Oh, do they?
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.560]   - So yeah, yeah.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:47.280]   For a long time, we were like one of the top customers
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.880]   of a very expensive video conferencing system,
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.360]   and so I think it might have been partly
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.520]   trying to save money for ourselves that motivated,
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:56.080]   or was part of the motivation for this.
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.960]   - Pina in our chat room says,
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.000]   if you're worried about a link becoming compromised,
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.720]   you can also, talking backwards about
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.400]   the Google collections thing,
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.280]   you can delete that shared link, it no longer exists,
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.320]   so you really do have control over it.
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:12.280]   Look, there's some Type-C connectors, I love those.
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.120]   Give me more.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:13.960]   - Oh, I can't wait for more.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:14.800]   - Just can't wait for more.
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:15.640]   - Love 'em.
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.480]   - You know, I can't wait for the day
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:17.480]   when you go to a Google meeting,
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.320]   and the connector for everybody is a Type-C.
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:21.800]   - Oh, what a life that's gonna be.
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:22.640]   - Yeah.
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.720]   - Oh.
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:24.560]   - Shown the day.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.360]   - If only two have 'em, oh, I can't wait.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.200]   - Everything.
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.600]   Apparently there is one Android phone now,
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.520]   a European phone that has a Type-C connector.
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:32.360]   - Really?
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.200]   - Already.
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.360]   I think Google's basically said
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:35.400]   that's what's gonna happen, right?
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:36.800]   So, this--
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.600]   - Well, didn't the one plus two announced that they're--
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:40.600]   - Are they doing Type-C?
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:41.440]   - Yeah, that was their latest announcement.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.600]   - Yay.
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:46.680]   They were driven that one out, one feature at a time.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.000]   - I know it really annoys you, Leo,
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.480]   but I went to go check it out, and I was like,
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:51.240]   ooh, ooh, that is actually interesting.
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:52.240]   - That's a good fit, yeah.
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.800]   They got you, it's good marketing.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:57.720]   Good marketing can be, simultaneously annoying and effective.
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:58.560]   - Yes.
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.560]   - More par sausages, mom.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.920]   (laughing)
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.800]   - That's a good example, actually.
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:05.000]   - Well, it's not very informative, but--
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.920]   - We should buy this, so you can get a large room bundle
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:08.160]   or a small room bundle.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:11.040]   Update people for this.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.240]   We should get this for our,
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:15.320]   so that was the one we saw set up was a small room,
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.320]   but the large room has the PTZ.
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:18.760]   - Could you handle that as a,
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.480]   instead of using a PC, use that as a--
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.280]   - We currently in our conference room have set up
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.400]   a big screen connected to a PC,
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.400]   with a camera, and we would just use Skype,
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:32.400]   but we could use Hangouts too, I mean, it's basically this.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:33.560]   - Well, I'm also asking,
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:35.400]   through your Skype machine--
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:36.400]   - Oh, for the show.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.240]   - For the show.
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:38.080]   - For the show.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:38.920]   - No.
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:39.400]   - Yeah, that handle is bad right now for Hangouts.
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:40.960]   Could you use that instead?
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:41.800]   - Yeah.
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:42.800]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:43.800]   - What about it?
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:47.600]   - I mean, Leo is such a power user like--
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:48.440]   - Yeah, we're not.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:51.400]   - But for a regular business, I think we really do.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:52.240]   - Yeah.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.080]   - Yeah.
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.280]   - Wow, look, look who's on here, Mike Elgin.
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:57.920]   (laughs)
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:00.480]   Before you buy, what is that?
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.120]   Oh, that's, oh, I'm sorry, that's YouTube
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.520]   giving me more information.
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:05.320]   So I'm gonna paste the link that Chatham said,
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.320]   paste the link in here to your collection.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:08.840]   Let's see if it's rate limited.
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.440]   All right, Chatham, have at it.
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.840]   (laughs)
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.920]   We'll find out if that's rate limited.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.160]   (laughs)
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:16.880]   - If it can keep up with the Twit comments--
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:17.720]   - Yeah.
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:19.160]   - Then, yeah, it's not really limited.
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:20.960]   (clears throat)
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:23.800]   - This is sweet.
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:25.400]   All right, everybody, click that link.
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:27.080]   Look at my photo.
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:27.920]   Tell me--
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:30.120]   - I wanna know about the bear in that photo.
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.480]   - There's a bear?
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.720]   Oh, that's not a bear, that's Lucille.
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:36.320]   - Oh, okay.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:37.440]   - Wait a minute, let me,
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:39.280]   are you talking about Lucille the bear?
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.000]   This was the Giants game.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.440]   And we were at the ballpark, okay?
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:50.240]   And the Giants mascot who is Lucille,
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.840]   see she's got two rings.
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:56.840]   She came and snuck up on me while I was doing a selfie.
[01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:59.080]   It was like--
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:01.360]   - I feel the cold touch of a free hand.
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.200]   - And then she--
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:03.280]   - Oh, long, long, long bear.
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.200]   - And then she posed--
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:05.040]   - Full beard.
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:05.880]   - She posed for pictures.
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:09.160]   She's the Giants, that's the Giants, the stadium mascot.
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:10.000]   Lucille.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.440]   - This reveal I don't know about the sports ball.
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.440]   - You don't, apparently.
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.560]   You've never been to a Giants game?
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:15.480]   - Haven't, I should.
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:18.080]   - I think we could remedy that, Matt.
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:20.000]   I wanna take you to a ball game.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:20.840]   (laughs)
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.040]   - Have you ever had a hot dog, Matt?
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.120]   Have you ever had a hot dog
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:26.480]   that's been cooking since spring training, Matt?
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:28.120]   (laughs)
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:30.280]   - I'm missing out on these vital experiences.
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:32.640]   (laughs)
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.040]   - You saw yourself an American?
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:34.880]   Come on.
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:37.120]   - What is that bear in the picture he says?
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.200]   (laughs)
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.560]   - Oh, dear.
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:43.480]   - It's Luc, actually I call her her.
[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.680]   I think it's a he, Lucille.
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:46.760]   - Yeah.
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:49.880]   - I love how it handled the videos in this
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:52.400]   and how it handled some animated gifts
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.200]   and stuff that it made automatically.
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.560]   This is just really nicely done, I think.
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:58.040]   They're really, they really,
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:01.240]   I love story slash collections.
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:04.440]   - You know someone at Google right now is like,
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.960]   what is happening with this link?
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.160]   We're down there melting all the servers.
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:09.000]   What's happening?
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.800]   (drum roll)
[01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.800]   - I can't see how many Who Hate My Tuna is asking.
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:17.760]   How can I, why is there so many food handles in our chat room?
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:19.160]   Peanut and Who Hate My Tuna.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.960]   Creamy corn cob.
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.520]   Why did, I don't know how many people
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.680]   can look at my shared collection.
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:26.800]   I don't know any way to do that.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.080]   So everybody hit that sucker, hit that hard.
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:30.920]   - It'd be nice to be with you.
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:31.760]   - Oh yeah.
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.800]   - Yeah.
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:37.200]   Oh, Toad Sloth says he has a spinning circle.
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:40.440]   Maybe it's, maybe it's, maybe it's slowing down now.
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:41.680]   - We're doing it, we're doing it.
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:44.360]   - We're breaking it, let's break Google.
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:47.560]   Everybody, time in.
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:50.360]   Android Wear gets new watch faces from Hello Kitty.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:51.880]   Take that Apple Watch.
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:54.360]   Take that and Angry Bird.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.080]   Don't forget Angry Bird.
[01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:57.320]   - Are these official?
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:58.560]   - Yeah, these are official.
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:00.000]   - Wow.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.520]   What does that mean official?
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:03.600]   I mean, they're, you know, from the standard.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:04.720]   - Hello Kitty from San Diego.
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.400]   - Oh, it's in Rio approved.
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.160]   - Oh, wow.
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:10.840]   All the new faces go live in the Play Store.
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.000]   - Still no Mickey Mouse.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:12.840]   - Hello Kitty.
[01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:17.200]   Are they animated, like Mickey Tap is Toad.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:18.800]   That's the question.
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.600]   Can a Kitty Tap or toe?
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:21.440]   - That's a good question.
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.680]   - I want to lose see a watch.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:24.080]   - You didn't install Hello Kitty watch face.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:24.920]   - You didn't?
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:25.920]   - No, I was wrong with you.
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:28.880]   How about moods of Norway featuring a tractor?
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:31.640]   - There you go.
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:33.320]   Terminator Genesis.
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:36.000]   Yes, I'm, yeah, these are a Rovio's,
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.120]   these are all official, aren't they?
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:41.240]   'Cause that was one knock kind of on the original.
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:44.200]   Android Wear was that, you know, you can get a Rolex,
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.800]   but it's not from Rolex.
[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:48.560]   This is an official Rubik's Cube from Rubik.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:50.800]   - Two stars.
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.000]   - Wait a minute, you could actually solve it?
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.040]   - No, I mean, what the heck?
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:58.680]   That's crazy talk.
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:00.880]   This is exactly what Apple didn't want.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:07.160]   Oh well, I'm still loving Android Wear, I have to say.
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:08.000]   - M2.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.680]   - I am wearing an Apple watch.
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:13.760]   I probably wear the Apple watch to Europe.
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:14.600]   I don't know why.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:17.560]   (loud thumping)
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:19.360]   - Android got a little bit of trouble.
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.720]   You probably talked about this last night
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:21.560]   on all about Android.
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:22.920]   - No, he didn't actually.
[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:25.120]   I think I saw this morning.
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:27.920]   - So, Android, which I've used for, and we've recommended.
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:29.840]   I think it was even, probably a pick on the,
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:31.760]   a app arena, certainly a pick on the--
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:32.920]   - It's been on the show. - Twig.
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:36.680]   - Many times, is an app that lets you connect
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:39.760]   to your phone from your desktop and vice versa.
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:43.680]   It has been apparently removed from the Play Store,
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:46.680]   the Android, this is from a story in Android Police.
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:50.080]   The Android team said, "Well, I don't know what happened."
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:53.080]   Google had removed the listing after a mass complaint
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:54.800]   from Facebook.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:57.280]   The sweeping set of complaints picked up tons of apps
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:01.120]   with WhatsApp in their name, but also apps like Android
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:05.080]   that simply mentioned WhatsApp in the description.
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:08.320]   So Facebook was a certain trademark infringement.
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:12.920]   The reason given to Android was a legit trademark infringement.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:17.760]   And here's the reason for suspension.
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:24.240]   Does Android, it passes along notifications from WhatsApp.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.680]   It doesn't replace WhatsApp.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:29.960]   - This is a little tough though, because you don't want apps
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:33.720]   in the Play Store that say, bejeweled,
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:35.560]   and they're actually spammers or something like that.
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:36.400]   - It's a huge problem.
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:38.080]   In fact, that's one of the things Microsoft
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:40.600]   has not done well in the Windows phone store.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.960]   There's a lot of fake apps in there.
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:47.000]   And actually Google's done a good job in Android.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.120]   - It does say that after about 40 minutes,
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.680]   we'll re-instate it. - They re-instate it.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:51.680]   - We'll re- infatuate the situation.
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:55.840]   So that's better than not reinstating it.
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:57.320]   - Yeah, thanks. - It's still so optimal.
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:59.520]   - In fact, this is another one of them happy stories
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:00.640]   with a happy ending.
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:02.880]   - It's all happy stories.
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.040]   - It's a happy story today.
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.800]   Google did the right thing.
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:08.040]   People freaked, they shouldn't have,
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:09.800]   this is barely kerfuffle.
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:12.320]   - Where does it fall in the kerfuffle meter?
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.720]   - Hardly, hardly a bruja.
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.720]   Definitely not a frickha.
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:19.320]   - That's totally a kerfuffle.
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:22.080]   (laughing)
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:24.160]   - Well, how many words are there for kerfuffle?
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:25.720]   - There are quite a few.
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:26.720]   - Yeah.
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:29.720]   - Bruja, kerfuffle, frickha.
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:31.880]   - Ah, yes.
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.040]   - You get a little rakis.
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:34.360]   - Oh, I'm not quite.
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:37.600]   - Oh well.
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:39.400]   - No, we're getting there, we're getting there.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.640]   And so let's talk about OnePlus.
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:43.280]   So the OnePlus 2, the way they're doing this
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:46.600]   is they're leaking out one feature at a time.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.240]   OnePlus says, that's just good marketing.
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:50.720]   And I have to say it, I guess it is just good marketing
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:54.160]   and certainly getting a lot of attention.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:58.320]   They just wanna build community, they told mine at five Google.
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.680]   We're just trying to build community.
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:02.760]   So we know two things right now.
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:05.000]   It's gonna be a Qualcomm 810,
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.720]   which is the latest Snapdragon.
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:10.400]   It's actually one that was issued by Samsung for its Galaxy S6
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:13.000]   because it used so much power and was so hot.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.840]   HTC used it in the M19, or the M9,
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:21.860]   and but they down clocked it so it wouldn't burn up the phone.
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:26.920]   So the OnePlus 2 will have, let's see
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:30.040]   if they've added anything to this spec here.
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:32.200]   Let me see if I can, I can find it.
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:33.040]   Where is that on the--
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:34.320]   - Is that not gonna be,
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:38.840]   it's not gonna be the same as the Samsung 810.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:41.840]   - It's not gonna be the same as the Samsung 810.
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:44.840]   - It's not gonna be the same as the Samsung 810.
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:47.240]   - It's not gonna be the same as the Samsung 810.
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:50.480]   - It's not gonna be the same as the Samsung 810.
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:53.840]   - It's not gonna be the same as the Samsung 810.
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.680]   - It's gonna be the same as the Samsung 810.
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:59.480]   - It's gonna be the same as the Samsung 810.
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:02.120]   - It's gonna be the same as the Samsung 810.
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:04.520]   - It's gonna be the same as the Samsung 810.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.360]   Maybe that addresses the heat issues.
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:07.960]   - Maybe, N-Type C. - N-Type C.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:09.000]   - Which is huge. - Yeah.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.120]   - Very happy about that. - USB Type C.
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:14.280]   - I would buy a phone just 'cause it was Type C.
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:15.880]   - Yes. - Seriously.
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:18.040]   - That's awesome. - Yep.
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:20.240]   And it's a very nice lollipop.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:22.080]   Yeah, the oxygen is very nice.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:27.640]   Google told to expect large fines.
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:29.280]   - Oh, here we go, here we go.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:33.520]   I'll just be taking a drink while you all talk about this.
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:35.840]   - I have. - Whoa.
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:38.600]   - Expect large fines.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.880]   This is the European Union.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:42.920]   It, of course, is investigating Google
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:45.760]   for antitrust violations.
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:49.440]   And the commission has really reached the preliminary
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:52.080]   conclusion that Google's practice of positioning
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:56.000]   is playing more favorably in its general search result pages,
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.320]   its own comparison shopping service,
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:01.000]   which doesn't exist anymore,
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.840]   compared to competing comparison shopping services,
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.400]   constitutes an abuse by Google
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:07.760]   in the relevant markets for general search services.
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:10.680]   - And the total business of said
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:14.120]   comparison shopping services is probably in gross's
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:16.660]   a tenth of what they're thinking of, charge,
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:17.840]   it's ridiculous. - Yeah.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.120]   - It is a witch hunt.
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:22.520]   It is why people are not gonna invest in Europe.
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.640]   - Large fines. - It's gonna do
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:26.040]   far more damage. - Large fines.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:28.280]   - And as Danny Sullivan said on Search Engine,
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:31.760]   landed on this show, this is how Search Engine's work.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:33.840]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:35.720]   - You're gonna finance your-- - And by the way,
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:38.320]   let me say this to my friends and then the commies of Europe.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:40.480]   It's how capitalism works. - Yeah.
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.240]   - You promote your stuff, yes.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:45.280]   - And yeah. - Boy.
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:49.680]   - Talking about Europe, disliking the internet,
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:52.880]   the freedom of panorama, that was another interesting article
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:53.920]   that came out. - That's really
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:54.760]   the battle. - That's the battle.
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:55.600]   - What I added that to the rundown.
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.120]   - Oh, all right, let's go to that article
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:00.000]   from Medium. - Freedom, what is freedom
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.400]   of panorama? (laughs)
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.520]   - Well, yeah, basically you can take a picture.
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:05.360]   Go ahead, that.
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.960]   - Can you take a picture of artworks
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:09.240]   that are permanently installed outdoors?
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:12.520]   Like the whole idea that you can't use those pictures,
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:14.640]   which you took from a public place,
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:17.240]   you know, for commercial purposes or whatever.
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.640]   Like if you read through the Medium article that says
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:22.560]   that, you know, "Wiki Media" and "Wiki Commons"
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:25.360]   type stuff, they often don't have pictures
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:28.760]   of some of these buildings or artwork or whatever,
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:31.400]   because it's not clear that they have the right to use it.
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:34.600]   - So this color map of Europe shows
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:37.880]   how different countries handle this.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:41.800]   Countries that are yellow have freedom of panorama
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:43.880]   for non-commercial use only.
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:47.680]   Countries that are red have no mention of freedom
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:50.560]   of panorama, so in other words, presumably
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:54.840]   you could copyright, let's say, the leaning tower of Pisa
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:56.880]   and then what does that mean?
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:59.480]   No one could take a picture of it and put it anywhere?
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:02.920]   - Pretty much, you can't, yeah.
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:06.800]   - Yeah, what it does is it kills the definition of public.
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:07.640]   - Right.
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:09.520]   - This is what I wrote about in public parts,
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:12.080]   pardon me for the plug, but it matters greatly,
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:15.480]   is that what's public is owned by the public.
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:17.840]   And when you diminish that, you diminish the property
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:18.680]   of the public.
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:19.760]   So the idea that you can't,
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:22.000]   this is the problem with Google Street View.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.440]   The principle is that you can, from a public place,
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.800]   you take a picture of a public thing and to share that,
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:28.560]   is fine and now this limits it and says,
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:30.240]   no, no, no, you have to have the permission
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:34.240]   of that which you're picturing in the public.
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:35.360]   Thus, it's not public.
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:38.320]   - It looks like the places I'm going are all in green,
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:41.040]   which means I have freedom of panorama.
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:44.280]   So I'm gonna-
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.360]   - Jeff, I hope I'm not, sorry, go ahead.
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.040]   - No, you go ahead.
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:50.320]   - Oh, I just, Jeff, I hope I'm not stepping on your number,
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:53.680]   but it sounds like, "Weeky Media Commons has a category
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:56.960]   full of deletion requests related to freedom of panorama."
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:58.680]   There have been nearly a hundred images
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:00.680]   deleted of the Louvre pyramid alone.
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:02.680]   - I had no idea.
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:04.400]   I had no idea it was that bad.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:06.200]   - Who are these morons?
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:07.040]   - Oh, geez.
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:10.360]   - So the Eiffel Tower copyright,
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:13.960]   the good news is, this is, get this, it's this crazy.
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:17.880]   So the Eiffel Tower was built in 1909, so, or earlier,
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:19.720]   so its copyright has expired.
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:22.760]   However, the lighting displays
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:25.480]   are considered original visual creations.
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:28.680]   So you can take a picture of the Eiffel Tower,
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:31.440]   but not of the lighting display on the Eiffel Tower.
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:32.960]   - That's insane.
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:37.080]   - You can't do the pyramid entrance to the Louvre
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.680]   'cause that's copyrighted.
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:42.880]   These are all black, doubt copyrighted images.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:45.200]   - Matt's absolutely right, this is a matter of free speech.
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:48.920]   This means that you cannot picture the world.
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:53.160]   - Well, just can't we just do massive,
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:54.520]   decivil disobedience here?
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:56.920]   Let's just all take pictures of the Eiffel Tower light show
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:58.920]   and put it up on Google.
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:41:59.760]   Screw 'em.
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:02.120]   - Well, and I think it is for commercial use.
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:05.040]   So if you're a photographer, you can't put it on a poster.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:07.600]   But the fact where you can't have it in Wikipedia
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.760]   'cause the licensing isn't clear,
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:10.880]   that's pretty bad.
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:11.720]   - Yeah.
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:14.560]   - That's the real issues.
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:16.240]   That Wikipedia is very careful
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:18.880]   and doesn't wanna violate rights.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:20.600]   - And so-- - Because everybody,
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:22.680]   I know what I wanna use a photo that has rights.
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:25.360]   I know I can use it for the Wikipedia comments.
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:28.160]   - But if I show my pictures on Twitch,
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:30.080]   - That's commercial use.
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:31.600]   - That's commercial use.
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.920]   So when a college student for you, bud.
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:36.200]   - Civil disobedience.
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:37.880]   - Oh, no, no, no, no, slide show.
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:39.720]   - Damn it.
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:42.520]   - That is-- - That's a man, Leo.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:44.040]   - Fight the man.
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:45.400]   You know what's worst, Matt?
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.760]   - It's because now we know the Google photo
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:52.240]   can identify specific things like Eiffel Tower at night,
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:54.760]   watch, there will be-- - Yeah, that's what worries me.
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:58.680]   - It's way too, it to eliminate all images of black.
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:00.480]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:03.360]   - Oh.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:05.640]   - You're up.
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:07.720]   - All right, I am now going to commit an act
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:09.360]   of civil disobedience.
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:10.600]   Here's-- - (laughs)
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.320]   - That's the butt of the Eiffel Tower
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:15.000]   and I'm showing it on commercial television.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.080]   (laughs)
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:20.160]   - By the way, I found that with a Google Photos search.
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.760]   (laughs)
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:24.480]   I know I have other pictures of the Eiffel Tower.
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:27.960]   - There's another horrible, horrible, horrible decision.
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:29.600]   - Yeah. - Which is the human rights court
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:33.560]   now says that sites are liable for user comments.
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:37.560]   Now granted, Europe never had the section 250 that we have.
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:38.400]   And is 250?
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:39.640]   Now what's the number?
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:41.520]   - Doesn't matter. - 230D, I think.
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:44.000]   And yet-- - Oh, there's Big Ben.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.320]   Take that.
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:46.880]   Big Ben, baby.
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:51.040]   I'm sorry, the Elizabeth Tower containing the Big Ben Bell.
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:51.880]   Take that.
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:54.640]   - I don't know what that is.
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:57.000]   Let's see, copyright, water tower.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.200]   (laughs)
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.840]   I typed an Eiffel and I got this, I don't know.
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:03.560]   I'm sorry, continue on, I didn't mean to do that.
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:05.200]   - No, I was actually ripping you.
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:06.920]   (laughs)
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.200]   - That's two counts, Leo.
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:09.760]   Two counts. - Two counts.
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:11.920]   Civil disobedience.
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:14.080]   - You're not going to, you're gonna go,
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:15.520]   you're never coming back from Europe.
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:20.520]   - In Petaluma, we have a giant feed silo
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:24.120]   called the Eiffel Tower apparently, so there you go.
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:26.000]   - That'll low, that's coming down.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.480]   That's coming down. - That's coming down.
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:29.520]   Petaluma.
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:31.240]   - Now I wonder if,
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:34.920]   what's, what is, what, in the United States,
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:37.440]   can I take a picture of Mount Rushmore?
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:38.640]   - Yeah, 'cause what's public is public.
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:40.040]   - Public is public.
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:41.600]   - You could take pictures, I mean,
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.160]   that's also the principle that allows you
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:45.520]   to take pictures of police doing what they do in public.
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:47.000]   - Oh good luck trying that.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.760]   Well, you're, you have a legal right to do so.
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:51.960]   - I know I do, but go ahead and tell them.
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:55.560]   - But I've been to Petal Beach and they try to say
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:58.880]   that you can't take a picture of the one tree on Petal--
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:44:59.720]   - You're kidding.
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:01.040]   - And they're like, no, no, they're saying
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:02.560]   we control the rights to that tree.
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:03.960]   - It's kidding. - Something,
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:06.840]   I don't know what the legal status is, but--
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:10.240]   - This is the picture that got me banned from Egypt forever.
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:12.360]   (laughs)
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:14.520]   - That's it, you can't come back.
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:17.160]   Cannot come back.
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:19.640]   - I think he's telling that guy,
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:21.160]   go shoot that guy over there.
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:23.360]   I don't like him.
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:26.680]   All right, that is so weird.
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:28.800]   I've always thought that's a lot, but,
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:31.000]   so for non-commercial,
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.280]   if you just take a snapshot as a tourist, that's okay.
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:37.600]   - Well, but is pretty long Facebook commercial use?
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:38.440]   - Is it?
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:39.600]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.040]   - They're gonna make advertising money on it.
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:41.880]   Uh-oh.
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:44.400]   Facebook needs to block it then.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:50.160]   - Yeah, so I'm just looking at a Petal Beach
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:51.840]   on 17-mile drive.
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:54.040]   - That's the Lone Pine out there.
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:55.080]   - Yeah, the Lone Cypress.
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:56.600]   - Cypress is-- - A clean trade mark
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.600]   on the Cypress, yes.
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:45:59.880]   - Oh my God. - Which is,
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:01.800]   or yeah, I think it's now fallen down
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:03.400]   or bit blown over, but--
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:05.320]   - Serves him right. - Take that Cypress, yeah.
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:06.160]   - Serves him right.
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:08.280]   Well, let's see, let's go, yeah, see, they have a picture
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:10.320]   on Wikipedia of the Lone Cypress.
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:13.960]   So-- - Not for long.
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:17.280]   - Yeah, I'm sorry, I mean to get you busted Wikipedia, but.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:19.040]   (laughs)
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.200]   - But I'll paste a link into the chat about,
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:23.160]   there's a New York Times article about, you know,
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:25.680]   whether or not this tree can be protected--
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:28.200]   - Wow. - From denied permission
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:29.880]   to photograph the tree for his business,
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:31.720]   so commercial photographer was denied.
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:33.960]   - Well, I guess the argument in this case is,
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:36.840]   is the golf course a public place?
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:37.800]   - No, it's a private--
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:38.960]   - Well, entity.
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:40.720]   - It's private, but apparently they say,
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:42.360]   it's not the physical ownership of the tree,
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:45.680]   but the ownership of the intellectual concept of the tree.
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:46.520]   - Oh my.
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:48.600]   (laughs)
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:51.960]   - So maybe we shouldn't bash your up all the time,
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:53.840]   maybe some of this happens here.
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:55.640]   - Well, no, we go back, California.
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:57.400]   California is Europe late.
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:59.320]   What?
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:01.800]   - Oh, you New Yorkers.
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:03.080]   - I swear.
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:06.240]   Hey, so I wanna go back to you,
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:08.360]   because I think it's important, real quickly.
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:10.240]   The Human Rights Court says that sites
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:11.280]   are liable for user comments,
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:13.320]   but we have in the United States a section 230
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.160]   that says that there's a safe harbor
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:16.840]   that does not make you liable.
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:19.080]   - Now, also it's a huge decision.
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:21.320]   - We talked about this on,
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:24.720]   Mike Masnick did a great article on Tech Dirt about this,
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:27.360]   but we talked about it on,
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:28.920]   Twitter on Sunday,
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:32.400]   and Tom Merritt told me that one of his chat mods,
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:37.400]   T2T2, is from, where was it, Estonia?
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:44.560]   And said that that decision by the European court
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:47.080]   applied only to Estonian law.
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:51.320]   So it was not the blanket decision
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:53.080]   that we thought it might be.
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:55.920]   - Right, but it's a bad,
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:57.040]   it's a troubling decision,
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:00.840]   and it's a precedent at a larger level.
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:02.640]   That's what worries me.
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:03.680]   - Right.
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:04.600]   - Little, little, little.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:05.920]   - He was, and I don't know,
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:10.440]   but he was of the opinion that this isn't as broad
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:15.440]   or as concerning a decision for the European court
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:18.040]   of human rights because he applies specifically
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:19.440]   to Estonia.
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:22.600]   - And when you've got freedom of expression,
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:25.080]   and then you also have human rights aspect,
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:26.640]   and it sounds like most of this decision
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:28.120]   was on the human rights aspect,
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:29.400]   but I agree with Jeff,
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:31.160]   it's a really scary precedent
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:33.440]   and a very slippery slope to go down.
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:34.280]   So.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:35.120]   - So I didn't mean to interrupt
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:37.720]   your smooth segue into a commercial, but.
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:40.480]   (laughing)
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:43.520]   - Hey, do you wanna talk about Twitter at all?
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:46.680]   I wanna know, can you, can you explain, Lucy,
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:49.440]   can you explain it to me?
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.880]   Explain lightning.
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:51.800]   - Lightning. - Oh no.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.600]   - I can explain it.
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:56.080]   Actually, it's a smart thing.
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:57.880]   First of all, I think that,
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:48:59.040]   I don't know what happened to Puerl
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:00.320]   at the Castallo,
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:01.800]   but I feel like, you know, it's into,
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:03.560]   we had a, again, this was another good conversation
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:04.600]   on Sunday's Twit.
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:07.440]   Ben Thompson pointed out that it was Castallo
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:10.280]   who ousted the third party developers at Twitter.
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:13.120]   He's made a lot of boneheaded moves.
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:15.560]   Jack Dorsey's back and his beard are back,
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.640]   but only temporarily,
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:20.040]   Twitter says we need a full-time CEO,
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:21.680]   the board says more importantly.
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:23.600]   We don't, you know, and Jack says,
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:26.400]   I'm gonna put my time as he did before with Square
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.200]   and Twitter crossing the street.
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:30.480]   And, you know, on,
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:33.200]   op as odd days or whatever it is.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:35.120]   (laughs)
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:39.840]   But, so there's some debate over whether
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:42.560]   that Castallo was a sacrificial lamb
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:44.280]   to appease the market.
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:45.480]   If that was the case,
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:47.400]   they didn't really accomplish their goals
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:48.240]   'cause the market went up,
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.000]   they went right back down.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.400]   Or if he really was legitimately not running Twitter well,
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:56.200]   but one of the initiatives that he had spearheaded
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:58.160]   and was very apparently very excited about,
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:00.600]   even though he knew he was being ousted as CEO,
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:01.600]   is this lightning thing.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:04.280]   And if you, to me, I'll tell you what I think of it.
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:07.480]   If you think of what is the most useful,
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:09.760]   Twitter has lots of uses and really is kind of,
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:11.280]   and one of the problems with discussing Twitter
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:14.120]   is it really depends on each individual uses it
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:15.360]   in some different ways.
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:18.480]   So if Twitter is useful to you,
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:20.480]   because of the way you've crafted your followers
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:22.520]   or the way you, or the people you follow
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:24.080]   or whatever, that's great.
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:27.880]   But what Twitter mostly seems to be useful for is live events.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:29.640]   Where do we go when there's breaking news?
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:32.240]   Or Ferguson is erupting,
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:35.800]   or the Arab Spring is going on.
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:37.360]   Well, we go there to find the news.
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:38.960]   The problem is the news is intermixed,
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:40.800]   intermingled with people's lunches
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:44.240]   and weird diatribes against stuff nobody ever heard of.
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:45.440]   And it's all mushed up.
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:49.040]   So lightning is gonna be part of the Explore tab.
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:50.520]   And I haven't seen it yet,
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:53.360]   but my understanding is we'll be human curated,
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:56.680]   which I think is very interesting, live events.
[01:50:56.680 --> 01:50:57.840]   So during the Oscars,
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:00.920]   there'd be a lightning page that's human curated,
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:03.120]   pictures from the Oscars,
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:04.600]   tweets about the Oscars,
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:06.640]   tweets by people at the Oscars.
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:08.360]   Same thing if there's a big news event,
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:09.680]   World Cup, whatever.
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:14.040]   That seems to me to be Twitter trying to show people,
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.960]   this is what it's really good at.
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:17.720]   It seems to be that that, to me,
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:20.720]   that is one of the real great things Twitter does well.
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:22.720]   So that's my explanation of it.
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:23.840]   - Thank you.
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:24.680]   - Does that make sense?
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:26.720]   - And then Wired said Twitter is killing Twitter
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:28.000]   to save Twitter.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.400]   I don't think it's killing Twitter to do lightning.
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:34.120]   But--
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:36.720]   - Well, I took a bunch of German executives around
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:38.600]   if I told you to stop me a few weeks ago.
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:40.560]   And when I went to smart places like Vox and Quartz
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:42.240]   and places like that,
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:43.080]   as we entered the room,
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:44.520]   they would say to these publishers and editors,
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:46.000]   you know, you may all be on Twitter,
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.200]   but pointing out to the world, they're on Facebook.
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:49.040]   - They're not.
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:51.160]   - Twitter's only 17%, what is it, 17%,
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:52.240]   I can't remember what the number is,
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:53.400]   but it's very small.
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:54.880]   - I tend to think it's the center of the universe,
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:55.720]   but it's not.
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:58.640]   So I have an infestation of ants.
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:00.640]   That's why I've been going crazy for a ton of ants.
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:02.400]   - Are they itching you?
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:04.720]   So what makes sense to me about lightning is you don't,
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:06.680]   although, and this is one of the problems Ben Thompson
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:08.320]   pointed out, the Twitter.
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:12.160]   - Europe is sending ants to Jeff.
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:16.200]   - 27 with one blow, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:19.160]   He's the tailor of New Jersey.
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.600]   - That was nicely done, Jeff.
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:26.240]   - I'm waiting for the show to get off so I can get some spray.
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:29.480]   - 'Cause I'm getting up there just everywhere.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:32.000]   - The bay. - Saving their lives by talking.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.720]   - Yes, let's save some ant lives.
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:38.480]   It makes sense that Twitter would do this
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:40.520]   because you could go without even being signed into Twitter
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:41.720]   and see what's going on.
[01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:43.920]   It doesn't make sense because the value of Twitter
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:45.560]   comes from the signals they get,
[01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:48.080]   and this was, again, a great insight from Ben Thompson,
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:50.400]   the signals they get from signed on users, right?
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:52.480]   Same reason Google created Google+,
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:55.600]   the signal of attention is not useful
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:57.000]   unless you know who it is,
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.240]   and becomes more and more useful
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:00.360]   as you aggregate material around that.
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:04.520]   So this lightning might be a good idea,
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:06.560]   but if it means you don't have to log into Twitter
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:07.840]   to get value out of Twitter,
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:10.680]   it might not have the wrong effect.
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:12.400]   It remains to be seen how they implement it.
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:13.600]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:15.680]   It's something I would use.
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:17.760]   It's kind of like trends only better, right?
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:21.120]   It's live, it's streaming, it's human curated,
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:23.120]   which I think is very interesting.
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:24.640]   - But that's also a cost structure.
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:25.480]   - That's part of it.
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:26.480]   - Well, it's not only a cost structure,
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:28.240]   it's this whole thing we were talking about
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:29.280]   with editorializing.
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:31.680]   So what if it's during the Oscar ceremony,
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:33.520]   and ABC says to Twitter,
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:35.360]   "We would take it to very kindly
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:36.560]   if you had nobody in there
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:38.840]   who said anything bad about the Oscars."
[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:42.360]   In fact, Samsung here has given us some money,
[01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:45.160]   so if you could put more pictures of Samsung devices,
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:47.520]   I don't know why I do that with my nose
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:48.360]   when I talk about it.
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:49.200]   - It's a long term.
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:51.440]   - But it's supposed to go with a wise guy.
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:54.040]   We would take very kindly to the notion
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:59.160]   of you not in any way upsetting our apple cart.
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:02.080]   I haven't seen it yet, I don't know if anybody has.
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:03.080]   I don't know if it's out there.
[01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:06.840]   It's supposedly to be part of the explore tab.
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:08.720]   - There's all kinds of new stuff going on.
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:12.600]   You know, there's Instagram's new discovery thing.
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:13.440]   There's also the--
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:16.640]   - Discovery's a big deal if you're one of these social magazines.
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:19.440]   - Isn't that what Facebook's trying to do automatically
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:22.600]   with its algorithm is like surface of Facebook
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:24.360]   that you would enjoy?
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:25.760]   - Yes.
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:26.600]   - It's hard to do.
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:28.120]   - Rich and boring.
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:32.320]   - Storeful and YouTube doing a feed of news,
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:35.560]   a verified news videos, better beats TV.
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:38.600]   There's neat stuff happening.
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:39.440]   - Yeah.
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:42.120]   - In this area of curated,
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:44.520]   whether human or algorithmically curated content
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:46.600]   of what's going on now where it screams.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:47.440]   I couldn't be happier.
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:50.560]   I feel like I never have to contemplate my own death ever
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:53.240]   again because there's so much entertaining stuff
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:54.080]   on the internet.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:57.560]   I can be distracted forever now.
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:58.400]   - Oh, why?
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:02.040]   - Mac got it.
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:03.800]   - Yeah.
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:05.440]   - I'm distracted to death.
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:07.600]   - Neil Postman.
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:11.360]   - All right, let's, so anything you have to say about that,
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:13.400]   Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis?
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:14.600]   - About Twitter?
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:15.440]   - The Twitter?
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:17.800]   - No, you said what I wanted to hear.
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:21.520]   - Which is, the dick story is interesting.
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:22.800]   I mean, I've always liked dick.
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:24.360]   - I feel bad for him.
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:28.880]   - But it hasn't been a happy place work, I hear.
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:32.240]   And they have done some odd things over there.
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:33.800]   They've done some great things over the years.
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:35.560]   They've stood up for free speech.
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:37.520]   As you said earlier,
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:39.480]   or what I think Matt said is the free speech,
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:40.800]   wing of the free speech party.
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:41.920]   God bless them for that.
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:45.000]   But they also kind of threw developers into the bus.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:45.960]   They've done odd things.
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:47.040]   You don't know what to expect from them.
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:48.280]   You don't know what it is.
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:49.760]   Nonetheless, at the end of the day,
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:50.680]   give him credit.
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:53.080]   He took a company that was being laughed at
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:55.920]   because it had no business model whatsoever.
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:59.120]   And has serious revenue and serious value there.
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:01.840]   And so give dick credit for that.
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:05.080]   And now Twitter is probably gonna find some new path.
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:05.920]   And we'll see what that is.
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:06.760]   - Right.
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:09.080]   It's interesting though,
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:14.080]   everybody's going to some sort of curated feed,
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:16.440]   whether algorithmically or.
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:18.000]   - I think stream, I mean,
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.840]   here's my going too far statement.
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:24.520]   My tweet on this is we move from a page based web
[01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:25.600]   to a stream based web.
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:26.920]   - Right.
[01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:28.360]   - And that's not fully true.
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:29.720]   We'll always have pages.
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:30.800]   We'll have sites.
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:32.880]   But the idea of an attention stream,
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:33.720]   obviously, we're--
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:35.400]   - We're not even at that though, right?
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:38.840]   - And mobile has a lot to do with the adoption of that.
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:41.800]   - No, I feel like this is,
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:45.400]   if that was my main insight from Twitter
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:47.840]   and maybe eight years ago was,
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:49.840]   I even wrote a blog post 'cause I wanted to do something
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:50.920]   like it was that,
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:53.640]   initially at the Twitter,
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:56.720]   I felt like I had to read every post and go back in time.
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:56:57.560]   - Yes.
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:00.440]   - And then at some point I had the final realization,
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:02.240]   oh no, you just dip in and out,
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:03.400]   whatever's going on right now.
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:05.280]   - It's like a New Yorker cartoon.
[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:06.040]   - No, I can't come to bed.
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:07.280]   I haven't finished reading Twitter.
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:08.120]   - Right.
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:08.960]   (laughing)
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:10.040]   - Exactly.
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:13.080]   - I haven't got to the end of the internet yet.
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:14.960]   And now, and so you quickly realize
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:16.160]   the internet does this to you,
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:17.960]   that there's too much, so you just dip in
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:18.960]   and you enjoy what you read,
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:20.360]   but you don't feel like you're missed.
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:23.280]   There's no, you don't have to worry about what you missed.
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:26.320]   And that kind of content stream
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:28.800]   is a whole different way of thinking of stuff.
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:30.840]   Imagine if you only, like every time you got a book,
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:32.880]   you would just open it up, read a few pages and close it
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:35.000]   and never look at it again.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.960]   - Well then Amazon wouldn't pay you for anybody reading.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:40.920]   But that's kind of what we do with the internet.
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:43.840]   The internet is a book only half read.
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:46.560]   Maybe now it becomes a war for attention.
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:48.440]   And I'm not sure that's the end of the game.
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:51.360]   I think that people can game that
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.240]   and often efficiency matters.
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:54.800]   Google doesn't go so much for your attention,
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:56.400]   but for informing you and being useful
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:57.640]   and having you come back often.
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:57:59.720]   But right now, there's a lot of efforts
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:01.560]   to grab attention with streams.
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:02.400]   - Yeah.
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:04.080]   - You're giving a-- - Go ahead.
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:08.840]   - Oh, just a lot of sites are constructing reasons
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:10.800]   and ways for you to spend more time.
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:13.840]   I suspect Google, in my experience, at least the search team
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:16.040]   cares more about, okay, how do we win the trust
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:18.520]   and the reputation rather than win the attention?
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:20.360]   Because if you have the trust and the reputation,
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:22.360]   then people will still come to you when they need help
[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:24.080]   or need answers.
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:24.920]   - Yeah.
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:28.280]   - But absolutely, my wife will serve and then,
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:29.760]   well, okay, I'm done with the internet.
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:32.240]   I've spent all the time, I've read everything on Facebook.
[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:35.360]   So Facebook can invent new things to read, watch,
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:37.240]   or share, or the same with Twitter,
[01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:39.520]   then that benefits their bottom line, I'm sure.
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:47.640]   - I think we've covered the news in thorough detail,
[01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:48.640]   have we not?
[01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:50.400]   - Yeah, well, one more thing I'd like to mention.
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:52.680]   Your friend Bill Gross's printer.
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:55.160]   - Oh, yes, just got an award.
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:58.240]   - I saw you tweeted him 13 seconds ago.
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:01.720]   I'm thinking, wow, is this man a multitasker?
[01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:03.960]   - Of course, I'm reading attention to the show, yes.
[01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:07.880]   I couldn't really call you on it
[01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:11.640]   because I was reading Twitter at the time.
[01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:16.480]   It's the $399 3D printer from New Matter.
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:17.320]   - Neat.
[01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:19.040]   - And it's really neat, yeah.
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:20.720]   I can't wait to get mine.
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:22.400]   - $399.
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:23.560]   - Are you into that?
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:25.240]   No, wait a minute, did you get that pen
[01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:26.720]   that you would draw things in the air?
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:28.880]   - I did, I did, I didn't, it didn't.
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:31.280]   - Didn't, so now you want to do 3D.
[01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:32.120]   - I don't know what's gonna happen.
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:33.480]   My wife and my children are gonna look at me
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:34.520]   and say, what did you do now?
[01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:35.360]   What's wrong with me?
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:36.200]   Excuse me.
[01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:37.200]   - Ants, ants.
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:39.160]   - Ah, you could 3D print an ant killer.
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:43.720]   - It's Louise.
[01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:44.720]   - It's Louise.
[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:45.800]   - It just ants.
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:50.000]   - This is reminding me of...
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:51.880]   - Do you want ants?
[01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:52.880]   'Cause that's how you get ants.
[01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:54.720]   - Wasn't it...
[01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:55.880]   - That's archer.
[01:59:55.880 --> 01:59:58.640]   (laughing)
[01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:02.400]   - Anyway, here's a printer from newmatter.com.
[02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:05.520]   $399, it looks cool.
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:06.960]   - Yeah, it also is, sorry.
[02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:08.480]   It's constructed differently.
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:10.680]   So that the base moves.
[02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:11.520]   - Oh.
[02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:12.360]   - And the head stays.
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:13.200]   - The head stays and the base goes,
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:14.400]   "Oh, they really play it."
[02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:15.240]   - Yeah.
[02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:16.760]   - These things look very cool.
[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:18.200]   I just want to tell people,
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:21.720]   it's not as easy as it looks.
[02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:22.560]   - No.
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:23.400]   - No.
[02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:24.240]   - But it's also gonna be interesting
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:26.720]   is you're gonna have open source creation.
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:28.120]   It's hard for me to, I mean,
[02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:29.120]   my family will make fun of me,
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:30.720]   but it's basically gonna be nice to build gross
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:31.920]   and sign up early.
[02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:37.280]   But, and it's hard to imagine
[02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:38.520]   journalistic uses of this,
[02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:40.000]   but who knows?
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:43.000]   Recreate something.
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.000]   - Have you guys seen the 3D printer
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.440]   that was announced at TED, carbon 3D?
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:49.440]   - No, tell us about it.
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:50.280]   - There you go.
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:52.680]   - It's actually extremely cool.
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:57.320]   Basically, instead of laying things down very slowly,
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:00.640]   it uses a light above and it sort of,
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:01.440]   sorry, it uses a light blue.
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:02.960]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:05.800]   - And it can pull out of the liquid very quickly.
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:08.600]   So it's got the potential to be much, much faster.
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:11.040]   - But it's really great for the show.
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:11.880]   Sorry, Matt.
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:12.720]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:13.560]   No, no.
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:16.120]   And the guy who is one of the main principles
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:17.280]   went to UNC,
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:19.720]   or he's a chemistry professor at UNC Chapel Hill,
[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:20.680]   which is where I went to grad school,
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:21.640]   which is why I was interested.
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:23.280]   And so it actually looks like you can do
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:24.760]   all kinds of different materials
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:27.280]   and continuous and a lot of relationships.
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:29.520]   - Much faster scale, right?
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:31.160]   - Yes, yes, absolutely.
[02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:32.560]   So it's technically--
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:33.560]   - Leo's an oxygen--
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:34.400]   - There's an oxygen--
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:35.240]   - There's an oxygen-able layer.
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:36.280]   Anyway, sorry, go ahead, Jeff.
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:37.120]   - No, no, sorry.
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:37.960]   Sorry, you were saying the actual interest.
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:40.680]   I was just wondering if Leo finds the video,
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:43.480]   we can get a violation here because,
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:45.920]   I'm sorry, I see another rant.
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:48.960]   It's the Eiffel Tower.
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:49.800]   So, boom!
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:50.640]   - Yes.
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:51.640]   - Is this what you're talking about?
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:52.760]   This carbon 3D?
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:53.600]   - That's it.
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:54.440]   - That's it.
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.640]   - The interesting thing is that the light shines from below
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:01:58.960]   and there's an oxygen-permeable layer
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:02.400]   where basically instead of having to go down,
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:04.760]   print, go back up, and all this sort of stuff,
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:09.800]   it just kind of pulls all out in one continuous mechanism.
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:12.280]   And so I was in the audience and it was printing
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:13.120]   while he was talking,
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:16.440]   and a 3D printer I've never seen move that fast.
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:18.280]   And so it actually has a lot--
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:20.200]   It's not just like, you know, fluff.
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:22.040]   There's a lot of real world potential on this one.
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:23.280]   - And I hear after you, Matt.
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:24.640]   How does it do it again?
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:28.600]   - Okay, so there's an oxygen-permeable layer.
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:29.440]   - It's magic.
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:32.200]   - And basically it's ants.
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:33.920]   They get a ton of ants.
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:36.680]   They combine with the squirrels, they make it daffodine,
[02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:38.760]   and you can actually read on the website.
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:41.160]   It's carbon 3D, but I know a friend from Google
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:42.000]   who went to work there.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.600]   So it's, you know, at the point where they're able to
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:46.440]   poach some people from Google.
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:48.040]   - Wow, that's very cool.
[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:51.720]   - That is very cool, 'cause I tell you one of the big issues
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:54.800]   with printing, of course, is speed.
[02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:55.680]   - Oh, they're so slow.
[02:02:55.680 --> 02:02:57.000]   - Yeah, you don't really realize, I mean,
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.640]   this all looks great on the website,
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:01.400]   and then you get it, and it's like, yeah.
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:02.920]   - Overnight, yeah.
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:06.000]   - What do you end up with, you know, a chess piece, right?
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.440]   - Woo hoo hoo.
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:09.800]   - Well, I expect you to print a lot of interesting stuff,
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:11.160]   Jeff, will you?
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:12.920]   - I'm gonna try to take it to school
[02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:13.920]   and have people look at me and say,
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:15.320]   "Well, that's cool, what's that?"
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:17.280]   - We've had a few, and I always donate them to schools,
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:19.720]   'cause that's a great thing for kids too.
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:21.360]   Hey, from ScooterX in our chatroom,
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:24.200]   some very good news, the wireless power consortium,
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:27.680]   which runs the Qi power standard,
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:30.440]   has announced that Qi will soon have,
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:33.120]   basically the equivalent of Qualcomm's Quick Charge,
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:35.600]   which means wireless charging, which is speaking of slow,
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:39.120]   notoriously slow, will now be fast.
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:42.200]   Wireless charges will be able to deliver
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:45.800]   as much as 15 watts to phones.
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:47.120]   Yeah. - Nice.
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:49.080]   - So anybody who, I love wireless charging,
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:50.880]   that's to me, 'cause I have a little stand
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:53.680]   and I put the phone in the stand at night and it charges,
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:56.520]   and that'll be very nice, so just quick story.
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:57.600]   Let's take a break, come back.
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:03:58.600]   - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:03:59.680]   what's the quick story I wanna mention?
[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:00.520]   - It's what I mentioned.
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:01.360]   - Yes.
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:03.240]   - 'Cause I wanna, may it rest in peace,
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:07.240]   but circa is no way. - Oh, we forgot, yeah.
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:08.600]   - And I'm very sorry to see that.
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:09.960]   - I meant to ask you about that, right?
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:12.640]   - And circa, for those of you who don't know,
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:15.480]   is a site that cut news up into pieces
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:17.200]   and sort of allowed a couple of important things,
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:19.800]   one, it knew what you knew, so this is really important.
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:21.800]   It was the only news site that then told you
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:23.520]   what you didn't know,
[02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:24.560]   'cause it knew what you'd already read,
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:26.400]   and second, it allowed you to follow stories,
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:28.920]   which is a way to give permission to get alerts
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:31.400]   when something new happened in a story you cared about.
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:32.920]   Now, as a consumer proposition,
[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:35.280]   it would have required a lot more investment
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:36.720]   because they needed to have you,
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:38.400]   if you wanna follow all the stories you care about,
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:40.600]   they had to have enough people writing stories
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:42.920]   in this new way that didn't happen.
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:45.160]   Or it could have been a new CMS,
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:46.960]   content management system for the news business
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:49.680]   and rethink how we do things in an age of alerts
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:52.320]   and updates and stuff, but that would mean
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:53.640]   having to change the news industry,
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:54.640]   we know how hard that is.
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:57.000]   So it was really insightful and important,
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.520]   and in all full disclosure here is I introduced them
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:02.000]   to a lot of companies trying to help
[02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.560]   somebody would buy them,
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:07.560]   and nobody had the foresight to do so,
[02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:09.840]   'cause there were important insights and experience here
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:12.400]   that I guarantee you we will come back in a year or two
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:16.080]   and say, just like with Google Wave, we'll say,
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:18.160]   "Darn, you know, alerts are now using
[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:20.360]   a lot of things that Circuit used to do."
[02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:22.320]   And so salute to the team.
[02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:23.640]   Sorry this happened.
[02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:29.720]   It sucks, but know that what you thought about
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:33.440]   in the future of news will indeed be used in the future.
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:34.720]   So that's, I just wanted to get that in there
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:36.840]   just to pay tribute to them.
[02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:39.040]   That was a, yeah, it was an app on iOS and Android.
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:40.080]   They had a website,
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:42.600]   circa, was circanews.com.
[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:45.080]   I remember Ben Ha, who was one of the,
[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:47.280]   I think the funders and the founders.
[02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:50.760]   At a, I think it was a food camp,
[02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:52.240]   saying, "We wanna reinvent news,
[02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:54.000]   "and let's all get together and talk about
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.440]   "what should news be?"
[02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:56.760]   So I remember very, at the very beginning,
[02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:57.600]   it was right.
[02:05:57.600 --> 02:06:01.200]   It was also penance for what cheeseburger did.
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:02.280]   (laughing)
[02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:05.600]   Yeah, Ben, Ben, the creator of Iken has cheeseburger, yeah.
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:10.560]   Yeah, I love circa, and it is sad to see that,
[02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:11.380]   not make it.
[02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:13.840]   Thank you.
[02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:15.480]   Let's take a break.
[02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:17.760]   We're picks, final numbers, that kind of thing,
[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:19.760]   the back of the book, coming up.
[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:21.480]   But first a word from the best place
[02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:24.800]   to create your next beautiful website
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:27.680]   or online store, it's squarespace.com.
[02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:30.360]   Very proud to have been part of the success
[02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:31.200]   of Squarespace.
[02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:33.360]   Right from the very beginning,
[02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:35.640]   we were one of the first places they ever did ads,
[02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:37.520]   and we were so impressed.
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:38.960]   One of the things that we always used to do,
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:40.080]   and still do,
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:42.400]   is try to bring a Squarespace site to its knees.
[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:43.680]   And you just can't,
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:46.560]   'cause it's the best, most robust hosting there is.
[02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:48.880]   Even if every single person watching this show right now,
[02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:50.120]   went to a Squarespace site,
[02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:52.520]   you just, you couldn't bring it down.
[02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:55.280]   We love it, but on top of that,
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:57.400]   you also have this incredible software
[02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:59.400]   that lets you make a beautiful site
[02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:01.960]   with absolutely no technical background at all.
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:04.720]   I think that's a really valuable thing
[02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:06.000]   to bring to the world.
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.640]   All Squarespace sites are mobile responsive.
[02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:10.760]   Don't have to worry about mobile gettin'.
[02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:12.440]   They all have e-commerce built in,
[02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:15.000]   even the basic plan has e-commerce built in.
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.440]   Of course, their support is incredible.
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:20.600]   24/7, right from their offices in New York.
[02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:24.120]   So responsive design, beautiful sites,
[02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:26.880]   very reliable web hosting,
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:30.880]   and as little as $8 a month, that is incredible.

[02:08:02.120 --> 02:08:03.720]   and we're so glad to be part of their success.
[02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:05.320]   They've just knocked it out of the park.
[02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:08.760]   Squarespace.com, you all love 'em.
[02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:11.520]   You see offer code Twig for 10% off
[02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:14.360]   and don't forget that deal ends in just a week.
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:16.840]   If you start your trial before June 30th,
[02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:18.720]   free year of custom email and business tools
[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:20.880]   on a professional or business plan.
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:23.600]   Squarespace. Build it. Beautiful.
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:27.360]   I don't know, Matt, do you have anything
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:28.220]   you want to share with us?
[02:08:28.220 --> 02:08:30.440]   You always have something cool going on.
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:32.440]   - I do.
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:35.400]   So if you listened to Twig a week or so ago,
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:37.520]   somebody mentioned Google contributor.
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:38.360]   - Yes.
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:39.400]   - And the idea behind Google contributor
[02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:43.080]   is that you can give Google one, three, five,
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:46.200]   $10 a month and then instead of seeing ads,
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:48.040]   Google will bid on your behalf.
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:52.040]   And so if I, for example, have seen 4,000 less ads
[02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:53.160]   because I'm using Google contributor.
[02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:54.000]   - What?
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:57.120]   - And I think, at the time, Leo said,
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:01.000]   this is great but it only applies for nine or 10 sites.
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.720]   It started out with an initial number of partners
[02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:06.760]   but my understanding is that Google contributor now
[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:08.400]   works through the Google display network
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:12.440]   and so literally millions of sites can be supported by this.
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:14.320]   So for example, it's kind of neat.
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:16.240]   You can see the sites you've contributed to
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:19.120]   and Leo, you talked about distracting,
[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:20.280]   amusing ourselves to death.
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:23.040]   I've actually given over $6 to Imager
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:26.600]   'cause I enjoy browsing Imager when I'm posting it at night.
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:29.440]   But I've also given a quarter to the Washington Post,
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:32.680]   30 cents to Boston, 16 cents to mobile.
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:35.160]   - And so you won't see the ads on those sites
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:37.120]   because you donate?
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:37.960]   - That's right.
[02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:39.920]   And in fact, you can replace,
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:41.120]   this is the power user feature,
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:44.760]   you can replace the ads with any custom HTML
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:46.400]   like iframe that you want.
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:47.920]   So I have a little thing that shows a little
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:49.760]   Mondrian piece of artwork.
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:50.600]   - Oh, that's not so.
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:52.160]   - And every time I see it, it makes it happy
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:54.040]   because I'm like, oh, I'm supporting this
[02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:55.440]   but you could make it kittens,
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:57.320]   you could make it your to-do list,
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:00.840]   you can specify a URL and it will fold that in.
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:05.760]   And so right now I think there's an invite list
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:07.520]   but my hope is over time,
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:08.560]   they'll have that to the point
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:10.800]   where everybody can participate relatively quickly.
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:13.840]   So if you thought that it was only for nine or 10 sites,
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:16.120]   it's not anywhere that can basically display,
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:17.600]   I don't know if it's display adsense
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:19.640]   or use the Google content or display network
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:21.880]   but essentially there are tons of sites
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:25.160]   where you can give a buck to 10 bucks, whatever a month
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:27.640]   and it will take that and give that directly
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:28.680]   to the publishers.
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:30.600]   And so it's exactly the sort of thing you want
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:31.440]   to support.
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:35.200]   This is a great answer to people who complain about ads
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:36.600]   on the web, we've had lots of debates
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:38.600]   about ad blocker technology.
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:39.520]   And I've always said, you know,
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:41.160]   you gotta consider when you're blocking ads
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:44.240]   that you're kind of using the site's resources
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:46.200]   without paying them.
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:48.760]   So that's not acceptable.
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:51.120]   So this is a great alternative.
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:53.120]   If you don't wanna see, it's kind of like an ad blocker
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:54.120]   but if you don't wanna see ads,
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:55.720]   you can support the site instead.
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:59.400]   Do they set the amount of contribution ahead of time
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:01.360]   like each site or?
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:02.400]   I don't know whether it's,
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:05.200]   you look at the number of impressions per month
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:06.480]   and then you divvy up the pie,
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:08.840]   whether it's $5 you give a month or whatever
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:12.320]   or whether it only bids as little as it needs to
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:13.640]   so that you see, you know,
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:16.280]   your pretty picture or kittens rather than the ad.
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:17.800]   It might do that instead.
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:18.960]   I'm not 100% sure.
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:19.760]   And does this--
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:20.560]   It's over and over.
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:23.080]   And does this, how much does Google keep
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:25.200]   or how does it work?
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:26.760]   I don't know.
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:29.760]   You know, I would assume that it's a minority
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:31.280]   and the majority goes to--
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:34.040]   I'm wondering if it's the same ratio of the ads.
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:35.520]   I think that's the same.
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:38.080]   I suspect it's, you know, I have no idea
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:40.040]   but it's probably along the lines of AdSense
[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:41.360]   or something like that.
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:43.520]   But, you know, over and over again,
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:46.400]   you hear the phrase if you're not paying for it
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:47.680]   then you're the product.
[02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:50.280]   And on one hand I hate that because it's, you know,
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:52.120]   it's more like just a sound bite.
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:55.600]   But on the other hand, hey, now you have the ability to pay
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:57.200]   and have that money go straight to the publisher.
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:11:59.800]   And, you know, $6 for Imager is not nothing
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:02.120]   if you have millions of users who are all, you know,
[02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:03.800]   paying to not see the ad.
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:05.600]   So give it a check out.
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:06.720]   I think they're getting to the point
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:08.480]   where you can almost invite someone
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:10.600]   and they'll be able to join pretty quickly.
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:11.800]   So it's worth--
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:12.800]   And then I'd say--
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:14.000]   Do you mean as a reader or join as a site?
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.480]   You need an invitation to do it.
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:18.200]   Right now it's invite only.
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:18.680]   Yeah.
[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:20.680]   But, you know, I've got like five invites.
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:21.800]   I'm happy to invite people.
[02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:23.240]   But it's--
[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:24.200]   Hey, you're probably--
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:26.160]   I'd like to cover everybody who listens to this show.
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:27.000]   We're set.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:27.800]   Right.
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:28.320]   I'll take one.
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:30.360]   In an ideal world they'd be able to get rid of that invite
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:30.880]   system.
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:32.560]   I hope they're working on that.
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:34.320]   But it really is.
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:36.720]   It makes you feel good because you see this little piece of art
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:39.000]   or kitten and you know that you're helping a publisher.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:40.240]   This is really a great solution.
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:41.320]   I would like-- I would like to have one
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:43.000]   because I want to experiment with new business models.
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:43.200]   Yeah.
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:44.200]   I'll take one.
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:45.600]   This makes a lot of sense.
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:49.680]   Instead of running ad block and basically using content
[02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:52.440]   against the publisher's will for free,
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:54.920]   you can make a deal that everybody's happy.
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:56.120]   And you don't see that awful--
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:57.000]   Or instead of a pay wall.
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:58.400]   Or instead of a pay wall.
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:01.240]   Yeah.
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:03.640]   The Blendell model is OK, I'll pay 25 cents or whatever.
[02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:05.520]   Well, OK, maybe, but you're also probably going to lose
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:06.480]   to audience.
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:08.320]   I think I mentioned when we have this discussion two weeks
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:12.600]   ago that the Guardian has found that when they put their membership
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:14.600]   pitch to people who have used ad blockers,
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:17.520]   the guilt helps increase the yield on membership.
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:18.400]   Right.
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:20.040]   And I think it's not-- you know, in the long run,
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:21.320]   I'll be curious about the economics of this.
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:22.960]   Because what you care about in the end
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:28.480]   is what we call so sonarously, our poo--
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:29.000]   Not my--
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:29.840]   --a revenue per user.
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:31.000]   Oh, OK.
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.520]   And you want your-- you know, what's
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:36.800]   the relative our poo of showing somebody a whole bunch
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:41.880]   of junky five cent CPM ads versus getting $10 a month
[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:43.520]   from a loyal user.
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:47.160]   What's the relative loyalty that that causes?
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:48.160]   I don't know what the answer is.
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:51.720]   I suspect it's-- I suspect contributor this thing will be less,
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:53.240]   but maybe not.
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:56.040]   And if you're somebody that mowns the loss of circa,
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:59.440]   well, there's a reason why services like circa
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:00.240]   have to go away.
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:05.040]   They cannot do it in a financially viable manner.
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:07.640]   And the nice thing is when you have a publisher who
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:09.960]   would show an ad and they're-- you instead
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:12.280]   have a user who has Google contributor,
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:14.920]   you are guaranteed that the publisher will get, you know,
[02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:17.720]   like a penny more or, you know, a fraction of a cent more
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:21.040]   because you are by definition paying what it takes to outbid
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:23.640]   the people who would programmatically want to show you
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:24.640]   ads.
[02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:25.320]   Oh, I see.
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:28.120]   So your R poo is higher for that.
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:29.560]   Yeah, you'd buy this.
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:30.080]   Exactly.
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:32.960]   You take part in the auction, as I understand it,
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:36.280]   and you bid from this pool that you contribute a month
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:40.840]   in order to win and so that you will not see the ad.
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:41.320]   Oh.
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:42.560]   I like it.
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:43.120]   That's very--
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:43.640]   Yeah.
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:45.880]   And so I think a lot of people confuse the fact
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:47.640]   that it started out with a small set of sites
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:48.320]   as like--
[02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:48.840]   I did.
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:49.680]   --is a limited thing.
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:50.080]   I did.
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:50.560]   But--
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:51.080]   Yeah.
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:53.160]   But it was one of these like five where they want to start
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:55.000]   slowly and make sure that it makes sense
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.640]   and test out kick the tires before they roll it out more
[02:14:57.640 --> 02:14:58.440]   broadly.
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:01.760]   They need to do a better job of explaining which sites do
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:04.600]   this because they only show six on the left page.
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:05.600]   Totally.
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:08.920]   That's kind of unclear here of--
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:10.720]   you know, so I'd like to know this is good.
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:11.920]   So it's now millions.
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:13.600]   That's really great.
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:15.960]   Yeah, I'll sign up for that.
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:17.440]   People wonder-- people often say, well,
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:19.520]   Leah, why is it you show sites like The Verge
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:23.120]   and don't use an ad blocker?
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:25.280]   For the same reason, I would hope you wouldn't skip
[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:25.920]   through our ads.
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:29.160]   This is what pays for the content you're looking at.
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:31.360]   And when I show a site, I'm not going to block the ads,
[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:33.240]   even though I'm showing it on our stream.
[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:35.640]   Oh, by the way, that's my tip of the week.
[02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:38.120]   The premiere of Mr. Robot, which is--
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:40.040]   many of us have talked about it already
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:41.640]   because they put the--
[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:43.440]   first of all, they made a fabulous site.
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:47.720]   If you go to whoisMrRobot.com, it is-- oh, it's changed now.
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:48.440]   That's too bad.
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:52.160]   That's too bad.
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:55.920]   This was a really fun kind of-- yeah, here it is.
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:59.360]   Here's the boot screen that you get when you have to dig
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:01.600]   a little farther now that the show is launched.
[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:03.400]   But it's a hacker show.
[02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:06.120]   And the technology is pretty accurate.
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:10.440]   It's about a young hoodie wearing--
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:11.960]   it's pretty amazing.
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:16.960]   A hacker is a black hat and gets kind of involved
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:19.920]   with a hacker group that seems to be trying to change
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:21.040]   the world for the better.
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:22.280]   You liked it, Jeff?
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:22.880]   Yeah, I did.
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:24.440]   I watched the first episode.
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:25.000]   Well, the first--
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.720]   This is the great thing is I discover--
[02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:29.480]   I'm finding that Google Play is a discovery mechanism
[02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:30.080]   for new shows.
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:31.080]   Yeah.
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:34.680]   The other one that I just watched is Unreal.
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:35.400]   Have you watched that one?
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:36.360]   No.
[02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:41.240]   Oh, it's fictional, but behind the scenes
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:44.240]   that a reality TV bachelor-like show
[02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:46.240]   with really mean TV people.
[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:47.080]   Oh, it's about reality.
[02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:48.160]   It's a pretty television.
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:49.160]   I love it.
[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:51.960]   And the first four episodes are free on Google Play.
[02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:52.880]   Oh, we watched three.
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:53.960]   Really good.
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:58.040]   Yeah, this episode from Mr. Robot is also free last I knew.
[02:16:58.040 --> 02:16:59.040]   Yeah, it's on YouTube.
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:01.600]   It's all over the place for free.
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:03.440]   This is-- yeah, I'm going to be watching it.
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:06.120]   And I'll be taping it, I guess, whatever it is the kids do
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:08.360]   today, instead of taping.
[02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:11.880]   Have you seen "Sensate" on a new Netflix original?
[02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:12.280]   No.
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:14.200]   It's from the Wachowskis.
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:16.600]   And it's really interesting.
[02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:18.320]   But what's most interesting to me
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:21.880]   is the production values are feature film level.
[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:26.040]   Very-- and the locations are all over the world--
[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:29.680]   clearly, very expensive to make.
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:32.000]   And it just shows you Netflix is really coming of age
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000]   in terms of its production capabilities.
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:35.760]   I mean, first of all, you're hiring Wachowskis
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:39.000]   who created the Matrix and Cloud Atlas.
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:40.560]   It reminds me a little bit of Cloud Atlas.
[02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:42.360]   It's really beautiful.
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:44.240]   I'm not sure what the plot's going to be about.
[02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:49.840]   I think it seems to be about eight telepaths who somehow
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:51.760]   can sense each other.
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:53.320]   They don't know who-- suddenly they
[02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:55.560]   start sensing each other all around the world.
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:17:57.000]   And I think it's really well done.
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.200]   But what's, to me, interesting is the production value
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:17:59.640]   of it.
[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:00.720]   Incredible.
[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:02.360]   What do you got for us, Mr. J?
[02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:06.760]   Well, there's something related to Matt's, which is Pando.
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:13.080]   Pando Daily just started a $10 membership pitch, which--
[02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:15.400]   and you get the content early.
[02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:16.800]   You could also make things public.
[02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:19.560]   I don't fully understand it all.
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:22.160]   But she says--
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:26.920]   Sarah Kuda says that she's unlikely to get more VC money.
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:30.680]   So she-- this was very famously started with VC money.
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:31.200]   Yes.
[02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:32.200]   After the failure of--
[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:32.640]   OK, at least.
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:34.960]   --of Giga, all my think a number of people are wondering,
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:38.720]   is there a future to VC-backed journalistic enterprises?
[02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:39.480]   Maybe not.
[02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:42.120]   She's going to charge a membership fee, just like Jessica
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:43.360]   Lesson does at the information.
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:45.160]   But yeah, but as you get it early,
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:49.520]   she gave a good screed on Twitter.
[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:51.640]   Sarah did being against paywalls.
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:52.920]   And paywalls don't work for the journalists.
[02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:54.040]   Don't work for the public.
[02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:56.040]   So this is like--
[02:18:56.040 --> 02:18:56.640]   So she'll--
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:18:57.360]   It's premium.
[02:18:57.360 --> 02:18:59.280]   So she'll still offer a free version.
[02:18:59.280 --> 02:18:59.600]   Yeah.
[02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:00.120]   Oh, yeah.
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:02.640]   You can make things public and free and so on.
[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:05.080]   By the way, the number actually should be 27.
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:06.440]   What's that?
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:09.480]   The number of get ants around here.
[02:19:09.480 --> 02:19:10.080]   I'm telling you.
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:12.080]   I'm just watched with some glee.
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:13.280]   They're bad ants.
[02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:14.720]   They're ants with wings.
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:15.480]   I'm telling you.
[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:17.440]   He's the tailor of T-neck, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:18.720]   Jeff Jarvis.
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:21.160]   I just saw a spider came down and did it.
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:23.440]   And when they asked for me, thank you, Spider.
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:23.880]   Charlotte.
[02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:24.360]   Charlotte.
[02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:27.560]   We like Charlotte.
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:29.080]   Jeff's a professor.
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:30.320]   Yeah.
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:32.680]   Fressive journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:34.400]   Great guy, buzzmachine.com.
[02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:35.360]   Get his book.
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:37.160]   The latest is Geek Sparing Gifts.
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:40.360]   There's also Gutenberg the Geek, the Kindle Single,
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:42.360]   Public Parts.
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:45.480]   And soon, a book about ants.
[02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:47.800]   Dr. Mom says those could be termites, Jeff.
[02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:48.160]   Are they?
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:48.880]   No, they could be.
[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:49.640]   There could be something like that.
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:50.880]   That's what we're calling the experimenters.
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:52.400]   Get them out there.
[02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:54.120]   We can't do the show from inside a tent.
[02:19:54.120 --> 02:19:55.480]   I just want to say.
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:55.960]   Oh.
[02:19:55.960 --> 02:19:57.280]   No.
[02:19:57.280 --> 02:19:59.360]   Mr. Matt Cutts always a thrill to have you,
[02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:03.040]   matcuts.com/blog at matcuts on the Twitter.
[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:06.600]   He's on the beach and enjoying every moment of it.
[02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:07.600]   Thanks so much for having me.
[02:20:07.600 --> 02:20:08.520]   It was a ton of fun today.
[02:20:08.520 --> 02:20:09.600]   I had so much fun.
[02:20:09.600 --> 02:20:10.440]   Always fun, Matt.
[02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:12.040]   Always you're the greatest.
[02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:13.840]   You give this show some dignity.
[02:20:13.840 --> 02:20:15.640]   Actually, we want you to quit Google
[02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:16.400]   so you can be on this.
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:17.440]   We do.
[02:20:17.440 --> 02:20:18.600]   We do.
[02:20:18.600 --> 02:20:19.600]   We have a standing--
[02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:21.040]   Oh, no one can replace Gina.
[02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:22.120]   No one can replace Gina.
[02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:24.320]   I have a $100 bill.
[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:26.400]   It could be you.
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:27.680]   It could be yours.
[02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:28.320]   So what?
[02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:31.240]   I'll bet Leo would get you a pixel.
[02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:33.120]   I'll get you a pixel.
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:34.560]   I'll get you a-- you want a pixel?
[02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:36.520]   I got you a pixel.
[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:38.720]   Leo takes good care of people.
[02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:40.520]   It's great to see you, Matt.
[02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:41.760]   Thanks for joining us, everybody.
[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:44.920]   We do this week in Google Wednesday afternoons, 1pm
[02:20:44.920 --> 02:20:49.600]   Pacific, 4pm Eastern time, 2,000 UTC at twit.tv.
[02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:54.440]   You can also watch on demand twit.tv/twig.
[02:20:54.440 --> 02:20:56.040]   I hope you enjoy the new site.
[02:20:56.040 --> 02:20:57.040]   We're still working on it.
[02:20:57.040 --> 02:20:57.760]   Oh, this site's great.
[02:20:57.760 --> 02:20:58.280]   Sites great.
[02:20:58.280 --> 02:20:59.240]   I'm proud of it.
[02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:00.160]   I'm very proud of it.
[02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:00.960]   Yeah.
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:01.440]   It's gorgeous.
[02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:04.360]   It's every penny, eh?
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:06.120]   You're not seeing all the money on the screen,
[02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:07.600]   because a lot of the expense-- people say,
[02:21:07.600 --> 02:21:08.920]   why don't you use Squarespace?
[02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:11.200]   Because this site is actually--
[02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:16.760]   the site is the top layer of a huge API written in Drupal
[02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:17.880]   that is part of our workflow.
[02:21:17.880 --> 02:21:21.000]   The editors start when a show-- this show is done.
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.280]   The editor edits it and then goes into Drupal
[02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:25.720]   where the workflow goes and the Drupal handles
[02:21:25.720 --> 02:21:28.520]   where how things get encoded, where things go.
[02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:29.800]   It's all done automatically.
[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:31.200]   That was the expense.
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:32.480]   So you don't even really see it.
[02:21:32.480 --> 02:21:34.400]   And in fact, we've got a public API,
[02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:37.440]   and we're inviting anybody who wants to to create a new website
[02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:40.680]   or 100 websites, let out a million websites bloom,
[02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:42.480]   or little snippets, whatever you want to do.
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:44.920]   The API is very rich, very powerful.
[02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:45.840]   And you could find out more--
[02:21:45.840 --> 02:21:47.240]   It's a general control licenses to it, right?
[02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:49.960]   Well, no, what we'll do is you need, as you always do with an API,
[02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:53.440]   you'll need an API key, which we will freely give you.
[02:21:53.440 --> 02:21:54.800]   But it's somebody misbehaves.
[02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:56.480]   Yeah, so it goes through a--
[02:21:56.480 --> 02:21:57.560]   Yeah, it goes through a site called
[02:21:57.560 --> 02:21:59.160]   "3 Scale and Sure Matt Knows About It."
[02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:01.400]   And what "3 Scale" does is it gives us metrics
[02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:03.960]   on each developer's-- each key.
[02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:06.600]   And if somebody's-- it's an 8 million hits a day on the site,
[02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:08.280]   well, obviously, we're going to pull the plug on them
[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:09.840]   because we can't support it.
[02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:10.640]   But nobody would.
[02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:13.720]   I mean, the nice thing about this is we don't put out shows
[02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:15.000]   every minute.
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:16.640]   It's more like every five hours.
[02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:18.680]   So I don't anticipate a whole lot of traffic
[02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:21.000]   to do, like for instance, what the website does
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.400]   is not very burdensome.
[02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:24.120]   So I'm excited.
[02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:25.920]   I mean, I'm going to start writing--
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:27.320]   people have always asked us for years.
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:30.800]   I just want to download every single episode of a show.
[02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:31.800]   And we just don't do that.
[02:22:31.800 --> 02:22:35.720]   RSS feeds are not designed to have hundreds of shows in them.
[02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:38.320]   They would be massive.
[02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:40.000]   RSS feeds are really-- you're just
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:41.080]   to tell you, here's the new show.
[02:22:41.080 --> 02:22:41.640]   Here's the new show.
[02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:42.760]   Here's the new show.
[02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:46.120]   But we could easily do a one-liner in almost any web
[02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:49.120]   programming language to download every show, every episode
[02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:50.480]   of show.
[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:52.320]   There's all sorts of notify you when a new show's
[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:53.200]   available, things like that.
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:54.800]   All that's through the API.
[02:22:54.800 --> 02:22:56.480]   More information at twit.tv.
[02:22:56.480 --> 02:22:58.040]   If you click the button that says Learn More,
[02:22:58.040 --> 02:23:02.320]   we describe all of the behind-the-scenes machinations.
[02:23:02.320 --> 02:23:03.120]   And we have a link.
[02:23:03.120 --> 02:23:05.440]   You can also email API at twit.tv.
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:07.200]   And we'll get you hooked up.
[02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:09.200]   We're just about to do that.
[02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:11.000]   Just about to do that.
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:12.920]   We had a few last changes to the API,
[02:23:12.920 --> 02:23:14.360]   a few more things we wanted to put in.
[02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:17.800]   The documents are on apary.io.
[02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:19.520]   Just Google Twit and apary.
[02:23:19.520 --> 02:23:21.880]   You should be able to find those pretty quickly.
[02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:24.600]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:23:24.600 --> 02:23:26.800]   Very nice to see you all.
[02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:27.880]   And we'll see you next time.
[02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:28.960]   I won't be here, actually.
[02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:30.440]   I should explain.
[02:23:30.440 --> 02:23:32.240]   I'm going on vacation for three weeks.
[02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:34.360]   Who's hosting Twig?
[02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:35.600]   Mike Elgin next week.
[02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:37.880]   Elgin next week and the week after.
[02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:38.320]   And after that.
[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:40.120]   And the third week is moi.
[02:23:40.120 --> 02:23:41.440]   And Jason, how are pretty moi?
[02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:41.880]   Oh.
[02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:42.920]   Which is as it should be.
