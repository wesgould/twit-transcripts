[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.800]   Obsessive Twitter on all things journalism. Welcome to you Matthew Ingram. Thanks for having me. How you doing?
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.200]   What do you been up to these days? I'm good, you know, just hanging out
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.760]   To in some kayaking, you know waiting for winter to come. Yeah, awesome
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.160]   Yeah, and of course, it's it is where you are, right?
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.800]   It can be certainly last year. Yeah, we were snowed under for a good long time. So nothing
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.760]   I get to I get to San Francisco now and then so I get a break
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.040]   See in these parts San Francisco is the coldest spot in the area. So anyway come to Petaluma if you want to warm
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:45.000]   Warmth and sunshine. Well, let's jump. Let's jump into the news Google palace to pressure removes new snippets from German search results
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.340]   I betcha Jeff you have a few things to say about this basically what's happened is that people said hey
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.340]   We want to cut to the profits from
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.780]   That gravy train that Google's got going on where they you know
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.680]   basically put little snippets of news articles with the link and so Google said well, you know just in case we're just gonna
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.440]   Go ahead and remove some of that information and it's probably gonna affect them. So Jeff, what do you think?
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.320]   Be careful what you wish for my point exactly
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.200]   VG actual springer, which is the big
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.960]   conservative news Corp like German publisher, which has been waging war on Google and brought together other publishers to sue Google
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.240]   They got this law passed to talk about before we've done a reggae beat on the Leistung Schuttrecht
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.880]   and
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.600]   And it's an ancillary copyright law and then
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:43.080]   The law went through all kinds of changes and then and then snippets itself were not fair boatin, but then
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.640]   The publishers it's too complicated for for moral
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:56.680]   But the publishers then sued Google saying that they were Google was still stealing from them and one and I think 11% of Google's revenue or some such thing
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.480]   And so Google, you know does what of course Google needs to do they just said okay fine
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.720]   So we'll take on the snippets they will still put up headlines
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.960]   No snippets and no photos and I'll betcha anything the publishers will lose
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.120]   Traffic but of course the publishers are now going to turn around and and say I just tweeted this
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.480]   And there's already starting to say it. I predict that they wouldn't they already are saying well
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:24.880]   You're using your your your overdue info your oversized influence here to take down the content that we sued you to take that out
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.840]   It's a cluster F in Germany. I was in
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:37.120]   Mountain View brought out there paid only expenses nothing no no fees to speak to the
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.160]   Support engineers and sales engineers for well. They now call work
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.880]   a joke people under 50 won't get and
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.360]   So I did my spiel about Germany and they said afterwards I said well you wound the Germans up here
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:02.360]   But it's a huge huge issue while I was there also another story happened where a privacy commissioner in Hamburg has told Google that they may not
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:10.360]   Create any user profiles without explicit permission from every user which is absurd and ridiculous
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.080]   And of course every publisher has user profiles everybody has user profiles
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.800]   And indeed I argue that publishers do a better job of it
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.440]   But Germany's really become I spent the entire plane ride coming back from California just now
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.640]   Writing a piece about the German problem, but I want to play somewhere in the German press
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:34.240]   Now they would have a they would have a case I would think if a significant number of people used Google News or Google search
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.000]   as their newspaper just reading the the snippets in the summaries or whatever and never
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.480]   Clicking on the links. Do is this entering into the case at any point the degree to which?
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.480]   Google search is being used as an alternative to clicking on the links and looking at the actual sites
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.760]   You know that's that's part of the argument that's been made for some time
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.440]   I actually haven't heard it lately that the people just read the snippets and they don't need to read us then but of course
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.040]   We know that snippets cause
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.800]   Links to happen and and and there hasn't I've always wanted to do a study of cuny and I've never managed to get it going
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:14.280]   I need cooperation of publishers to do this to find out what what is the optimum size of a link if it's too short
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.440]   If it's just a headline, I will bet you it will not work if it's
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.680]   Too long. Yes, if it's the whole story one could argue it takes over the whole
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.880]   Experience however, I've seen with reposted us that five to seven percent still click through to the source to read more
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.200]   if it's a
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.840]   You know a description that that tempts you and wants you to go to the story
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.280]   Then I think that will probably increase click through
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.440]   And and so we don't know yet. What's what's optimal?
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.960]   You know for linkage, you know like the thing that I keep saying since this
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.840]   This argument about Google and Google News first came up which feels like 10 years ago
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:08:00.760]   Maybe it wasn't but it feels like that long and my point is if you're if a headline and two sentences from your story
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:07.440]   Is enough to give people the value they need from that story? You're you have a problem with your story
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.640]   It's not
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.320]   Google's problem that that two sentences or a snippet from your story is enough
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:18.960]   For and people don't want to click through or don't see the value of clicking through it's if you don't
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:25.160]   Make your content compelling enough so that that's enough then that's that's your problem
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:35.560]   But isn't the standard generic newspaper format to be reverse pyramid style where the first paragraph tells you the basic information the second paragraph tells you
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.800]   So it starts out very large and ends up getting more specific
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.160]   And so if that's actually the style the newspapers are using and in fact if Google is taking the top part of it
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.360]   Aren't they really giving you the main part of the story the nut of the story or whatever you want to call it?
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   I mean
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.920]   I think the proof is in the pudding if people are actually using as an alternative which I don't believe
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:01.440]   Then that's one thing but but you know a lot of times people skim people are skimmers now
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.440]   It's that's another problem
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.440]   That we have in our democracy now that people aren't really reading more deeply
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:15.880]   I'm gonna disagree a couple ways like I think first the fact that we skim we hit more stories and more facts and more things
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.680]   Than we knew talking about skimming if you got your news from 22 minutes in the evening news all you got was the skimmage
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.280]   Right, right and and and now you get more number one number two
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.760]   I wouldn't presume that people don't read in depth
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:32.680]   You know this is part of the logical fallacy of the of the links are theft argument as opposed to the links are gifts argument
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.600]   Well people just read the link and they didn't read our story. Well, who said they were ever gonna read your story anyway?
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.860]   Yeah, you're you're trying to prove a negative you're trying to say that they would have come to your story
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.860]   How they not read the link to your story?
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.960]   I don't quite work out either
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:52.360]   People used to walk by newsstands all the time and look at the headlines no one can plan about them stealing the news by reading it
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:59.000]   You know off the paper and and and now we see a movement a warning here in in seeing that
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.560]   Getting away from the mass media metrics of reach and frequency unique users and page views raw eyeballs
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.640]   Into higher value metrics of attention and so chart beat company in New York that does
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.520]   pixel by pixel activity on on on pages metrics for those
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:24.240]   Was certified as a Monday to be the first place to measure attention and so you have the financial times working with chart beat to sell
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.920]   10,000 attention minutes of
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.080]   You know CEOs in Europe you have a medium
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:36.600]   selling advertising by time rather than by eyeballs and attention and your impressions
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:42.000]   So you you have a movement now going to say that we're gonna sell attention
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.040]   Then that doesn't mean by the way that you have to spend two hours reading the story
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.800]   Tony Hale the CEO of chart beat argues that for
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.960]   Circuit for example
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:02.280]   Going back 20 times a day can be just as valuable spending 20 minutes there to the other measurement their measurement is over time to it's an aggregate
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.120]   It's not just you know exposure time to a specific story
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.760]   They look at exposure time over a month or whatever. So if you come back enough and read enough
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.160]   There's also a branding element here and also a
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.800]   Some assumptions that are being made and and you know I did my best to play devil's advocacy
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.920]   But in fact I'm completely on Google side and against the the German
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.680]   lawsuit and so on
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.280]   Because what I found as a blogger is that I often promote my own stories on
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.840]   Google+ and elsewhere and what I've found over the years is that if I give enough of the story
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:46.120]   Sometimes more than my my editors and and the publishing companies they work for are comfortable with then and and actually
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:51.440]   Promote the idea that people can get get all they want
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:12:00.920]   Dip into to it and really understand the story just from my little summary then the link the which is a promotion and add basically for the story itself
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.960]   Is more likely to go viral people will share it they'll comment on it more
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.520]   That plus one or if they understand the whole thing and there's got to be some kind of equivalent
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:16.320]   metric for search results because you know if you give a really good juicy summary that's enough to really get you know
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.920]   That's gonna spread like a story and then that's all promotion
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:24.080]   So personally I found that being super cryptic or just giving a little tiny bit and being stingy with
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:30.360]   Giving people a real sense of what the what's on the other side of the link works against you for promoting
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.580]   Traffic to to the sites itself. So I think they're making an assumption there that I think needs a little bit more examination
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:45.640]   You know, it's interesting to me is if this if Google is actually stealing eyeballs or whatever by having
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.720]   previews or snippets
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:54.160]   Twitter does a lot of that too their Twitter cards the expanded view of articles
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:00.400]   They've got effectively photo headline in some cases the first paragraph of article
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.520]   So I wonder why no one do you have any do you have any?
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:08.860]   Insight into how those work versus just a simple headline in terms of click-through and tweets
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:14.800]   Yeah, I mean I do I just set them up for for think up actually the publisher is actually setting those up
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.760]   So there's a few different styles Twitter cards. You can do the big image. You can do the small
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.500]   Icon you can do, you know, the summary and the headline
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.520]   There are some special Twitter cards like you can show photo galleries and that kind of thing
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:34.320]   So if you ever see a news article that has that Twitter card enabled like that publisher has has set that up and
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:40.000]   Enabled that and you have to get whitelisted and you have to have these you know particular tags and your and your markup and stuff
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.080]   So then that's a different thing than what Google does which is a Google figures it out and shows it kind of on their own with with Twitter
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.320]   You're actually
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:54.840]   Setting you do it right? I just think that lots of publishers seem to see the value in doing that to the point to the point where they actually
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:01.360]   Set it up themselves, but then you have other publishers who - obviously don't and in fact see that as a negative thing
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.240]   See, well, there's a little different because people are commenting so someone is saying something
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:13.400]   Through about about the article in their status update on Facebook or on you know in the tweet and then there's the attachment
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.940]   So it's so it's so cool. Yeah, there's this and of course those look those sites
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.560]   They send a lot of traffic right as does Google
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.440]   You know just to your earlier point about writing headlines and snippets and having something
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:31.520]   You know, there's something's wrong with you something is wrong with your story if the reader is satisfied by just previewing a snippet
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:37.480]   I I wonder though about how that has has created the sort of rise of the up worthy style
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:45.400]   Curiosity gap, you know, you won't believe what happens when this kitten jumps into a bucket of ice kind of style headlines that that we
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.460]   We've talked about here that get shared so much and go viral on Facebook. Sometimes people don't even read it
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.280]   Right, they're like that. Yeah, this is this is great. So I I wouldn't I wonder about that a little bit
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:01.920]   I don't know if these are necessarily bad, but the clickbait style. Yeah, no, I actually was thinking more in terms of
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.320]   It's similar. I guess to what Mike was saying
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.520]   I think you're if you if you have delivered value
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.240]   Two readers in the past
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:18.400]   That is you the individual you the writer or you the media outlet and if you've given them something
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.920]   Before that they feel was valuable then they're not going to just
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.560]   Do you see what I mean? They're not gonna yeah
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:31.400]   They're probably gonna click through because they expect that you will have things that are worth reading
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.000]   whereas if you if you do go for this sort of
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.840]   Clickbait stuff you actually wind up doing the opposite of what you think you're doing because then the reader does click through and doesn't have a good
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:46.240]   Experience or feels tricked or whatever and so then it actually you're further in the hole
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:53.200]   Then you would be if you hadn't done that but this this all goes to the to the outmoded mass media metrics that we operate under
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.200]   I and advertising
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:04.760]   The operator of just of impressions and volume rather than value if if if journalism is a service as I like to say these days
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.160]   Then the service is accomplished if you're informed and know what you need to know
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:14.680]   However, that happens we only have a model that says you have to come and read our whole story and spend time
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.480]   Looking at as many ads as we can plop in front of your eyeballs
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:22.800]   So we can rip off the advertisers charging them for these supposed impressions of you that model doesn't work on either
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   So it doesn't work for the consumer doesn't work for the advertiser
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.640]   Now Google came along and offered a better deal, which was performance and that was a step in the right direction
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:34.240]   the magazine publishers Association just for the first time this week started
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:44.480]   Revealing their audience across all platforms for 147 brands and 30 companies chart beat as I said earlier is now
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.240]   Gonna do with attention. I don't think either goes far enough
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.080]   I think we have to go to is that you have a valued relationship with a news provider and
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:59.040]   We find new ways because of that relationship because of the value we can bring you to give you something back in return and
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.640]   We haven't begun to do that
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:07.280]   Felix salmon wrote some about something what he called promiscuous media, which is media that
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:13.120]   Content effectively that lives wherever it needs to whether it's YouTube or medium or
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.200]   Twitter or Facebook content that's effectively
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:25.040]   Designed or intended to live there in that environment on that platform not to just be a call out to please click and go to our site
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:32.120]   But in order as you pointed out in order for that to be seen as valuable you have to you have to be monetizing your content in different ways
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:37.800]   Then just driving as many people as possible to your specific corner of the web
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:43.320]   Now part of this go ahead Jean. I'm sorry Mike. I was gonna I was gonna
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.040]   I was wondering what you guys thought of this was a few a few weeks ago
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.440]   Maybe a couple months ago, but the saved you a click controversy about the the Vox piece
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.880]   Headline was did Tony soprano die at the end of the sopranos, right?
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:00.600]   And they had the answer but it was six paragraphs into the piece and there's that Twitter handle saved you a click
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.120]   and which no spoilers put the answer and
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:09.560]   And then someone wrote I forget who it was maybe maybe it was a was a diverge writer another Vox writer
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:15.080]   But so one wrote this very angry, you know long piece explaining why this person had done
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:22.360]   Yes, stolen experience and this person had done all this work to write this amazing long story that like built you up to the big reveal
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.840]   And that's and that took it away
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:31.720]   And yet, you know as a very casual not even really big fan of the sopranos, but still sort of wondered I was like, oh great. Thanks
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:40.920]   I actually went and read it. I mean even though I got the answer what from saved you a click
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.120]   I still went and read it so I guess I don't know maybe I
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:49.160]   You cared you cared enough. Yeah, it interested me enough. I wanted to find out all the
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:55.960]   You know extraneous color and detail around how they found that out or what the explanation was or whatever
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:02.120]   So well the juicy didn't stop me from clicking. Yeah, the juicy nugget that they that was revealed was a good nugget
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:07.320]   It was something that that suggested that the story would be interesting to you half the time those kinds of headlines
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.720]   Say you're not gonna believe what ball but when you find out you're like, that's not even interesting
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:17.720]   Yeah, and so it can be a tease, but I I'd go to Jeff point Jeff's point on this as well
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:23.560]   Which is that you know without those sorts of twitter feeds you might not ever see that article anyway
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:29.640]   There's so many articles out there that you never get anywhere near them and somebody who's subscribing to those types of twitter feeds
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.680]   There are several of them out there and there I really like them
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:37.000]   Uh, you know, you you're you're not going to see those things anywhere else. They're you they're teasing stories
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   You're probably not going to see elsewhere. Uh, if they are specific to uh buzzfeed or whatever
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:50.520]   So, you know, and you know bringing it back to google news those publishers just like the ones in belgium where the same thing happened
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.480]   not only will they see traffic decline, but
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.280]   They're they're missing the the point if the point is to reach
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:04.120]   More people with your content and convince them that you're smart and you have things that are worth
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:10.440]   Reading then whether they read that specific article or not isn't really the point
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.520]   and so
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.520]   You know, their viewpoint is we
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:20.040]   It's our content. We should control it and they they feel like they already have all the audience they need
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.960]   So google's stealing it. You know, that's a completely different way of thinking about
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.080]   kind of what your job is as a newspaper
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:35.240]   Absolutely. Well, we're going to come back and hear about facebook's apology to quote affected drag queens unquote

[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:13.960]   Uh got a big victory today the uh, uh, facebook actually apologized to uh, member to uh, uh, uh,
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.520]   Uh, the effective community of drag queens. I'm gonna read the whole apology by facebook here
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:24.600]   Uh, the apology part of their message which is quote. I want to apologize to the affected community of drag queens drag kings
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:29.720]   transgender and extensive community of our friends neighbors and members of the lgbt community
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.440]   For the hardship that we've put you through and dealing with your facebook accounts over the past few weeks
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:39.160]   They said they were to revisit their real real names policy to uh, make it possible for
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.080]   Uh, drag queens who have stage names to use those stage names
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.320]   Uh, uh, as their name on facebook and
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:52.520]   This sounds to me. I don't know how you all feel about this, but this sounds to me like a complete
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:57.960]   um, phony baloney response to this because basically they're saying if you're a performer
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:03.480]   And you have a stage name and you use that stage name as your actual name in real life
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.800]   Generally speaking if you really go by little miss hot mess, uh hot mess
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.280]   That's really the name you go by in real life
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.840]   Then you can go ahead and use that on facebook and we're going to let you do that
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.320]   um, that doesn't sound like
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.720]   Uh, it's gonna. How many people are professional drag queens?
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.160]   I mean, you know, they haven't solved any problem here, but what do you guys think?
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.120]   Yeah, I have to agree
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.600]   Mike I I wrote about this when it first happened
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.760]   Uh, i've been a big
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:36.600]   Proponent of anonymity online for a long time even though I know lots of people blame it for all the worlds
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:42.840]   Problems, but I I I fundamentally believe that allowing people to comment and behave anonymously
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.920]   has value, um
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.080]   And so facebook has always been
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:52.200]   To some extent trying to suck and blow at the same time. They've been trying to say well
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:57.800]   You can use a quote unquote fake name, but only if that's what you go by in real life
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.200]   So as you pointed out if you're a drag performer and you can you can say well
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.600]   This is what people know me by if you're effectively a celebrity in some sense
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:11.000]   Then you can do that but regular people can't and so the the you know
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:17.480]   Although that community was what sparked this issue. That's not the sum total of the issue
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.560]   I mean for the problem. There are
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:25.800]   Lots and lots of users who are trans and gay and fall into all sorts of categories who cannot use
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:32.600]   The name that they want and what they get is facebook asking them for their birth certificate or their driver's license that
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.560]   From from what I could tell that is not going to change now
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.960]   There's a solution that seems kind of obvious to me and and jina maybe you can help me with this because
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.320]   I don't understand why all the social networks don't do this
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.400]   The solution to me seems to be that you if they want to demand real names of course
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.200]   Twitter and google plus don't
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.240]   Demand real names google plus doesn't anymore. They did for a long time
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.560]   But why don't they just
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:02.840]   Demand your real name to be privately given to the social network and then allow the public to see your pseudonym
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.400]   That way they get both
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:10.440]   The best of both worlds. They know who exactly who you are they can you can use your account
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.840]   Azure identity you can use it for buying things, you know, all that stuff
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.240]   But then you never have to reveal it to the public. What's wrong with that solution?
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:29.000]   I mean, I think for some communities particularly imagine, you know, a kindergarten teacher and a very conservative part of you know of the country who you know
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.600]   Is it is a drag queen performer at night who literally has you know living a double life and
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:40.360]   Doesn't necessarily want to out him or herself, you know, I mean, I mean there are situations
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.600]   My legal name by the way is Regina McTrapizzoid. I just go by Gina, Japan
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.960]   I guess it's a lot easier here
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.040]   I mean, this isn't just about drag queens
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:53.560]   Right at least about broadcasters and musicians and artists and book like people who write and use pen names like
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:58.040]   It's about people and you know, I mean that and the real name
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.560]   I don't even like when people say real name. It's legal name. It's your given name
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.360]   It's the name that your parents gave you and that's on, you know, a sheet of paper that says you were born, right?
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:11.640]   But that doesn't that isn't necessarily who you are and as far as I'm concerned like people should just be able to say
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:17.000]   This is how I want you to refer to me and period. That's real. That's real enough for me
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.920]   So I just I don't know this whole identification thing and your real legal name is this and what if I don't know
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.360]   I I don't like it, but there's no technical reason. There's no technical reason, right?
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.360]   I mean, there's a technical reason and in fact this came up during the google plus
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.160]   You know, Nemours or whatever you want to call them to
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.520]   Um, there is no technical reason why Facebook couldn't do that
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:43.480]   There's a reason why some users might not want to to present that name even privately to Facebook because they don't trust
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:50.520]   The company to keep that data separate and they don't trust, you know, they can't trust where that information is going to wind up
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:55.000]   But you know it to me it feels and I could be wrong
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.400]   But it feels to me like Facebook mainly wants you to use your quote-unquote real name or given name because that's what advertisers want
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:07.720]   Here's I don't think yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt you Matthew, but here's the thing that really bugs me is that certain types of names
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.680]   Uh can be used
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:16.120]   pseudonym and you know you I could go to Facebook right now and start a can an account I could make up a name and I have an account
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.400]   They never know
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.800]   Right, but if that name happens to be a little miss hot mess
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.680]   Hot mess they're gonna say well it doesn't sound right or if I have some other outrageous name
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:30.280]   So, you know the vast majority of fake names there are huge numbers of people on Facebook using fake names
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.800]   Without
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.880]   Consequence all right right when you've been reported or someone has marked you as abusive
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:40.040]   You know what's the first thing the police ask you when they pull you over show me your ID right like
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:46.360]   And but that's not way that authorities assert power and and uh, you know show me who you are show me your credentials
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:52.200]   My you know working at a college campus first thing you ask a student who's doing something wrong what you know show me your ID
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.560]   It is this it is a power move
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.840]   It is a kind of power relationship and I just don't like I
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:04.520]   I get the facebook has this problem where they need to make decisions about whether or not people are actually
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:11.320]   Behaving badly or abusing someone and and and getting their actual legal name is some indicator
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.440]   Whether or not this person is is for real. I don't know
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.240]   But I I feel like for the majority of facebook's users
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.720]   They should be known by how they want to be known
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:25.160]   And and that should that should be it and to be honest it feels to me like facebook
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:30.280]   You know apart from the advertising element or whether that's what advertisers want
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.360]   They you know reading chris cox's description of how it happened
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:39.640]   They all got lumped in with a bunch of these other reports and someone flagged their accounts
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.040]   maliciously or whatever and they didn't
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.880]   It feels to me and obviously they have a billion users so this stuff is not
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:52.920]   Simple, but they could do the things we're describing if they wanted to they could make it easier for people to use pseudonyms
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.960]   They could structure things so that you could do that and they could still achieve their objectives
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.440]   They just clearly don't want to or they don't want to devote the time and resources to making that happen
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.480]   So that says something about their priorities. I think
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:11.000]   Was there really a departure a mass departure to l.o. Or was that just a phony baloney?
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.600]   Trumped up this sort of rumor that people grabbed onto and reported his fact
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.160]   Well, I don't know about the same time using
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.480]   Oh, what now I can't remember the joke. What's the name of it? What was the name of the other face?
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.000]   App.net. Yeah, and what else and and and
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.400]   I'm on diaspora. I'm before that
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.960]   Yeah, yeah, I mean
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.680]   I had a reporter call me today about this and I said
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.840]   I'm I'm dubious of the killers
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.120]   If you think that you're making a killer that you're not being creative enough
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.400]   You're not really admitting something new in a value and you're not going to kill whatever you think you're killing
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.320]   It is true
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.760]   It is true that l.o
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.160]   Did seem to attract a whole lot of artistic
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:54.280]   Users, I think partly because it was designed and created by designers
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:30:01.640]   And so they reached out to friends in the creative community. I don't feel like there was a huge influx of people running away from facebook
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:06.280]   That's exactly right some people started l.o. accounts, but they didn't close their facebook account
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.640]   So what's the point? Right?
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:13.480]   Eventually they'll be annoyed by l.o. because it's pretty hard to use I think for the most part and they'll just gravitate back to where people are that
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.480]   They know and that's the thing that
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.760]   enables facebook to get away with all this kind of stuff which is that they have a monopoly on everybody
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:25.480]   Everybody's on facebook because everybody's on facebook and you have to be there if you want to interact with the people you know
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.080]   And that's the bottom line and they can they can harass you they can violate your privacy
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.600]   They can lie to you they can
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.240]   Sensor your newsfeed they can do anything they want and they'll be you know for the most part most people aren't going to leave
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.640]   There are reasons people leave sometimes they leave because they don't you're not sure about the privacy policies
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:44.680]   So they go to snapchat or whatever so they can have these conversations that are definitely private
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:49.960]   But people don't leave because of this kind of stuff well and you know what jina said
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:57.000]   I think brings up a good point and the sort of free speech implications of facebook and twitter and other platforms
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.920]   Are I find fascinating because effectively our sort of public square our digital public square
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.360]   Has been privatized and so we have a whole bunch of shopping malls
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.200]   Where you can go and wave signs around and say whatever you want and
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:16.280]   Behave the way you want until the mall cops come and say you have to get out of here because they own that building
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:20.200]   And so you know all of these decisions that places like facebook make
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.720]   as as sort of minor as they might seem
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.440]   are effectively
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:32.920]   Laws for this sort of social space that we as you pointed out pretty much have to belong to
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:39.720]   And so all those decisions have real world implications and social and political and sort of behavioral implications
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.880]   Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah with with l. Oh, I mean what was interesting to me about l. Oh is is just that
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.760]   The I think there was a huge spike in l. Oh
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.600]   registrations and hype and media and then it was getting getting talked up a lot
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.080]   I don't think people were leaving facebook, but l. Oh,
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.240]   Value proposition was we're not facebook. We're not going to sell you ads
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.880]   We're going to treat you like a human being and not a set of eyeballs
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.760]   Um, and so it was interesting to me that people responded to that
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:10.200]   But this has happened so many times people responded to that with diaspora and they raised a ton of what was back then on kickstart
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:15.880]   A ton of money people responded to this with app.net and paid a $50, you know, uh subscription fees
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:20.840]   Like this is a this is something that resonates with users particularly savvy users
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:27.560]   It means something. I think there's a whole group of you know, I think there's an ardent group of people hoping that one of these
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:33.880]   Um, either federated or anti facebook not facebook networks will actually prevail in the end
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:38.120]   I don't know if they they actually will but there's interest here so that interests me
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.680]   as a sort of actor
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.840]   there's a continual sort of
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:49.240]   Need or hunger desire for something else for something that sort of treats you like a human being and and it just keeps
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:53.160]   emerging from time to time under a different name the thing I noticed is
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:58.840]   Uh, certainly my daughters who are you know in their early 20s teens
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:04.280]   Um have no interest in facebook and never go there. So what they're using are completely
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:12.360]   Other networks, uh for other reasons in many cases because they offer different forms of privacy or anonymity
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.840]   Um, you know facebook is non-existent for them
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.320]   Well, it's just thing
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:23.480]   Well speaking of young people using social media google plus today and i'm google announced today that google plus now has a new
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:29.560]   Setting a new feature that enables you to designate your profile as for adults only you can
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:36.520]   Uh, basically it's an audience editing tool on google plus you let's you set filters based on age and location
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:41.320]   So you can actually zero in and and and say, you know, this is only for people in certain locations
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.600]   And this helps companies comply with local laws around the sort of thing
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:51.400]   But it seems to me that they're paving the way for enabling maybe a little bit more freedom about what sort of content you can put on google plus
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:58.520]   Uh, because if you can age restrict it then you go ahead and and have more uh, adult-like content that maybe in the future
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:04.600]   Less likely to be censored right now. There's you know any sort of, um, anything that's more than pg13. I think they pretty much
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:09.480]   Uh, not language based you can pretty much say anything but for pictures and that sort of thing
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:15.240]   Uh, anything above pg13 they they will block you or they'll you know take you out of the system or whatever
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.560]   Is this is this a good idea?
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:23.640]   I mean and and also one of the criticisms that's being leveled against this is that you can't designate individual posts
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:29.960]   as being either adult only or not you you can only say everything that I do is for adults only or
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.920]   Nothing I do is for adults only but what you guys think about this
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:40.440]   This is similar to it doesn't twitter have a setting where you can say mark my media as private or sensitive
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:46.680]   Uh, and and I think it applies to all all of your tweets. So then if you if you attach an image or whatever it's collapsed by default
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:52.680]   Um, this is interesting. I haven't I haven't seen this. So why so so okay age I get, uh, uh
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:59.160]   Why would you restrict your google plots posts to a particular geographic area?
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:03.080]   No idea. Um possibly I mean maybe if um
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:07.880]   You know if you have local laws that you're concerned with if you're in a certain community
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:13.080]   And you have a business in that community and there's a law for that area or that country or that county or whatever it is
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:17.640]   You can comply I guess and it doesn't apply outside. I'm not really sure I haven't played with these
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.600]   Let's say you're a German publisher for example. Yeah, for example. Yeah
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   Marijuana dispensary
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:29.640]   Okay, all right. All right. Okay. So to so to check this out. You go to your google plus profile settings
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:34.600]   I haven't done this myself, but this these are the instructions posted online and you select the audience tab again
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:40.360]   This is uh google plus profile settings audience tab and it'll open a variety preset and customizable post filters
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:46.440]   And you can choose uh these new filters that are in there now. So that's a kind of a an interesting new
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.680]   We're getting criticism for you know age inappropriate content showing up in people's streams or something
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.760]   I don't this doesn't feel like a feature like that lots of people would be crying out for
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:01.640]   Well, you know, they're they're they're algorithmic filtering is so horrible
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:06.520]   Uh if you go to your notifications, I mean my notifications is 50
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:11.720]   Fine and 50 percent. What are you giving me? Why are you giving me this?
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.360]   It's like somebody in some other country just saying hey
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:21.160]   And it's a picture of themselves like standing in a parking lot and I what there's you know out of all the users on google plus
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:24.600]   This is what you've determined your algorithms have determined that I really want it's crazy
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.280]   But sometimes you're going through that filter and i was like whoa all of a sudden
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.960]   uh, it's quite uh inappropriate and um
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.280]   So it's to make up for the fact that their filters can't do that already. I guess
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:41.560]   Right, right mike. Are you still uh is google plus still your sort of primary writing platform?
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.680]   I know that you've been really bullish and very active on google plus for a long time
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:48.520]   You have like two million for help followers or something here in two million circles or something
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:53.640]   I do I do it's still growing it still growing at about 2000 per day, which is pretty crazy
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.040]   Um, wow, it's it's very active
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:59.400]   I'm it's my primary for a long time it was my exclusive social network
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:04.840]   But since i've been at twit i am using twitter and some other things because that's i got to go where the whole audience is now
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:11.480]   Uh, did you actually write did you write full things on google plus was that a strategy that you used to
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.760]   in the beginning or
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:17.800]   I tested that I wrote a few columns. Um, what I did was I had some circles of
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:25.480]   editors and and other people who had volunteered and I basically did my drafts there and they you know, I had people commenting and stuff
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:29.800]   It was pretty cool. Um, but I I don't do that anymore for the most part
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.960]   I do use it for crowdsourcing I use it for all kinds of stuff and I do really like it a lot
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:40.520]   I just find the conversation so good there and I I have zero trolls zero. I mean, you know, uh,
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.800]   That's not exactly true
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:46.760]   I never encountered trolls more than once and when I encounter them I block them and I never hear from them again
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.280]   And it's just fantastic for that purpose and I love it for that purpose
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.080]   And I also like the fact that it's got a clean user interface
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.880]   I still like all that stuff and I like all the people there. I've actually made
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:02.120]   Real friends on google plus which is one of the rare things that you can do with the social network met them in person stuff
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:08.520]   I mean, I've had an account for a long time and I I post content there lots of not just my own posts
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.560]   But photos and whatnot. I have a lot. I mean lots of circles
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:15.480]   300,000 or something and I post things there and I get nothing
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.800]   I might get like one comment. Yeah, I get so I'm obviously doing something wrong
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:24.040]   It is my one. Yeah, you are. Go ahead. Yeah, you are
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.160]   I was off for a while. So sorry, uh, that's weird
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:33.480]   Because I I've actually been abusing google plus thing I haven't used as much as I should but I I tend to get comments
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.480]   I tend to get stuff
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.280]   The the the the
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:44.040]   Yeah, the horde on google plus is an odd creature they respond to certain things and don't respond to others
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:47.560]   And it's it's just amazing and one of the things they respond to is
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:52.760]   heavy use and primary use so if you were to use google plus as your primary
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:56.520]   Place where you're posting things all the stuff that you post on twitter
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.040]   Which is all great stuff if you were to do that every day after a few weeks
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:04.040]   They would start gathering and that you'd get this buildup of momentum
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.240]   I guess it's just not a repeat, you know, I do it from time to time
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.280]   But not it's not regular activity and you know what?
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:16.360]   I would probably do it more if google had an open api where I could use third party tools to post to it
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.200]   Yeah, and that's really the solution that I think most people don't
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:26.200]   I think we need a big movement of people calling for interoperability between the social networks because right now
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.600]   It's considered first of all socially
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:34.440]   Unacceptable to to sort of auto post using different areas to people hate cross posting
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:41.240]   For some reason I actually think it's a it's better than everybody living in their own little individual silos and also it's better than
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:48.280]   Than having to spend all your time chasing down conversations on all these multiple things it'd be great people see it as spam
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:54.200]   I guess yeah, no kevin marks yelled at me for cross posting once but it's actually a good solution if you do it right the way
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:40:00.040]   I do it as I use friends plus me and so on twitter it works great facebook doesn't work so great but on twitter is what
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.880]   It's called friends plus me plus sign and then me dot com
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:09.240]   And it's just a tool you just enacted and then everything you post on google plus goes to twitter with a link
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:13.560]   So essentially the first line of what you post which I tend to use is a headline
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.880]   It's a perfect tweet and it gives you a perfect link and that link goes back to google plus
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:23.000]   And so I actually am inviting twitter users to come to google plus and have a conversation with the google plus people
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.880]   It's one conversation. I have to manage one place
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:31.320]   And it's a it's a great solution and I think when people complain to me that i'm cross posting i'm it's like
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:35.480]   Why is that why is cross posting better than that's that's home delivery?
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.040]   Exactly
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.040]   Yeah, I
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.560]   When I was at uh, speaking to the to the work people
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.600]   I held up my chrome book and that alone got applause
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.440]   And I said, you know, I take I take about as much crap
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.800]   For this as I do for liking google plus and then also got a laugh
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:59.000]   That's a good one. All right
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   That must have done well in a room for google
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.840]   And by the way, by the way, there were 250 googlers in the room
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.560]   And so I was talking about it's about twig came up of course
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:13.080]   I said, I said how many people you have you watched twig and and a good i'd say third raised their hands and then I said
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.800]   Uh, oh, what if it's only googlers watching
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.800]   Right, how many employees did they have and how many is one third of those employees?
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.320]   Yeah
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.320]   Just as long as they're patronizing our sponsors
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:29.720]   That's fine. Yes, that's right get them get them open up the google plus api
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:36.760]   All right, so we we got another story coming out of europe and and jeff i'm going to defer to your pronunciation is it goontr
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.760]   Otinger
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.760]   How did i do?
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.240]   Yeah, so he's the
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.840]   Yeah, thank you
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.840]   He's the new commissioner
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:52.600]   Eu commissioner who admitted monday that he's the one who derailed the settling of an antitrust investigation against google
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.680]   Well, there's a lot of people trying to credit for that now
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.920]   Yeah, exactly
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.120]   Well, he is a politician and he said that if i hadn't been opposed to it
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.680]   The google case would have been settled back in march
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:07.560]   He's and then now they're saying that there's fresh evidence and solid arguments from 20 formal complaints
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.080]   Persuading them that google needs to present a better settlement officer
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:16.680]   This of course is around the whole issue of google providing information that competes against their competitors
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.680]   uh, and um
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:25.000]   I don't know and this is related of course to the focus on the user campaign and it's the same it's it's our user campaign at all
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.680]   It's it's it's it's the publishers. It's actual springer and company same exact people. They've they've run this
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:37.880]   Campaign they've run big ads and papers. They've brought in news corp, which you know, we talked about the rubber tom some letter two weeks ago
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.440]   uh, and
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:45.960]   They're they're running they're making google into the end of the big enemy and so they derailed they succeeded in derailing
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.440]   This room and i was probably about that as i watched
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:51.400]   on twitter, um
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:55.800]   And then translated as best i could tweets from the newspaper conference in germany
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:03.080]   Uh two days ago and you had angela maracle the chancellor going in pain homage and and and regretting how they've lost
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:08.600]   Uh, their newsrooms and what a shame this is you have the head of the spd the left
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:14.600]   Party and the bun doshdog coming forward and saying that we have to contain google's market power
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:19.880]   You have the justice minister of the country previously as we talked about in the show calling for google to be broken up
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:25.080]   Uh, and google's been frankly sitting there either being silent or
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.840]   According to a friend of mine a bit a bit rude and and haughty
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:34.600]   And they haven't found at all the right way to have this discussion and it's going to damage not just google our big fear
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.280]   Is it's going to damage the net?
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:42.360]   This is spreading from germany. We have the tax on links being proposed in spain. We have the right to be forgotten
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:47.160]   Uh techno europanic is spreading and it's going to have a huge impact on the net
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:54.760]   So now you have at the ec the person in charge of this replaces somebody who was actually pretty forward thinking in most ways nearly cruises
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:59.720]   Itinger is now the head and he's bragging about how he's all for the right to be forgotten
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:05.400]   He's bragging about how he sided with the publishers to uh kill the settlement that had already been made in the eu
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.800]   You have dern politicians
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.160]   Um and in the pocket of these media companies
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:17.720]   Uh the company the politicians they're supposed to be covering instead. They're running into these politicians to get help with their failed businesses
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:19.800]   It's a really
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.800]   Sucky situation there
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:27.320]   Yeah, it absolutely is and and um, you know sometimes I in my uh moments of darkness
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:34.200]   I wonder whether the europeans just want to shake down american tech companies for the money. I mean in this case there
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.820]   Mike of the publishers. I have heard them
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:40.200]   Shortal and giggle about this
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:45.880]   They're they're smart people. They know about it. They know that google is not going to pay them 11 percent of their of their revenue
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.960]   For linking to them. I mean, how stupid can you be? They're not that stupid
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.160]   Uh
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:55.800]   When when mattias do after the head of a springer argues that he's scared of google. I don't believe that for a second
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.920]   They're laughing thinking we got google over the barrel, but there's unintended consequences galore here
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:04.840]   And when I talked to epha in germany. I argued this is going to hurt germany badly
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.040]   Would you invest in germany right now? I sure as hell would not
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:14.280]   I would not if I were a tech company I get as far away from there as I possibly could and it's just at the time that the brillan
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.880]   Startup scene has taken off
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:23.160]   What I heard when I was in brillan is that you can only get angel money in germany because germany german's don't want to risk anything more of their capital for these startups
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:28.440]   So what happens is the vc's in america come after the good ones and they make him move to the us or they buy them
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:33.800]   And make them come to the us so so this atmosphere is going to cause a brain drain in germany
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   Just what it most needs the ability to grow its technology world now what google should do I think is actually counterintuitive here
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:45.560]   It should invest like crazy in german technology
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:52.600]   So it's not alone trying to argue against the luddites right now google's alone as the boogie man enemy against failing
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:56.600]   institutions that have not figured out how to adapt the new world and
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:03.060]   Government and publishers are in on a holy alliance together and it's ugly. Sorry for the rap
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:06.100]   Matthew engram. What do you think?
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:14.580]   Yeah, I couldn't agree more with jeff it feels to me like a just a plain old revenue grab and it feels a lot like
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:20.500]   Countries, I'm not as as informed about the sort of internal politics as jeff in germany
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:24.180]   But I do know that in lots of european countries they are
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:34.100]   Afraid because their economies are weak. They're they're they have no real startup sort of you know ecosystem going
[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:39.620]   They're and they're afraid to be to be honest of large american
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:46.660]   web companies like google and facebook and and so I think they see them as they see these types of laws as a way of
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:49.540]   Of asserting some control over them and potentially
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:52.100]   Generating some revenue. That's what it feels like to me
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:57.140]   Is this a german cultural thing? I mean it reminds me of the of the beer purity laws jeff where
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:03.780]   Basically they have these very stringent requirements for what can be put into beer and germany has fantastic beer
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:07.700]   But the variety that they have in germany is sort of the behind the times in terms of
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.740]   The crazy experimentation that's going on in the rest of the world
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:15.620]   Is this a german cultural thing? I mean they have a lot of public support for this these sort of sentiments
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:22.100]   Actually, they actually they don't they don't keep in mind. This is very important google has its second highest
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:24.660]   market share in germany as anywhere in the world
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:28.100]   and so
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.260]   It's 93 percent right
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:34.660]   Yeah, 63 percent in the u.s. So so a full you know
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:38.020]   Make it my math right here half higher than the u.s
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:42.260]   That's that's gigantic which is to say that the german user likes google and has no problem in uses them
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:48.020]   It's this campaign by publishers and government, but perception can become reality
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:52.740]   And and it's going to become reality if google doesn't figure out the right way to fight back yet
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:56.260]   And they haven't figured out they're either silent or hottie and that's not the right thing to do
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:00.900]   And to be honest, I think the the whole nsa thing heard a lot of
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:07.300]   Exactly american web companies they you i mean google said we have nothing to do with this and meanwhile
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:12.340]   There's all these reports about you know the fbi or whoever nsa tapping
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:19.620]   cables and putting boxes in their in their colos and and so everybody I think just got nervous about
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:24.180]   What was happening to their data when when they were using these companies?
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:30.820]   Yeah, and that reminds me of the uh, you mentioned the nsa there was a story that we don't have on the dock here this morning
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:35.380]   I'll just mention it briefly which is that eric holder who's the of course the attorney general of the united states
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.860]   Uh gave a speech yesterday
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:42.340]   Where he is was essentially throwing apple and google under the bus because of their strong
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:49.380]   Encryption and he was speaking in front of a group of people who were gathered together to protect children from
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:55.860]   Predators online predators sexual predators kidnappers and other threats that some children face
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:03.060]   And he was you know as a kind of a think of the children kind of a speech and these these dirty rotten silicon valley companies are
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:10.820]   Adding this encryption that prevents police and the fbi from successfully prosecuting criminals and predators
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:13.700]   And you know it really bugged me because
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:21.780]   Those that this new encryption movement is a reaction to the nsa and unconstitutional
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:29.780]   uh mass surveillance by that's fit that fits their argument though the whole argument is you need to let us spy on you at all times
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:34.260]   Because you or someone you know, maybe doing something bad and so
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:40.580]   We need to install cameras in your house and you know sucking all your data because you might be doing something bad
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:45.780]   You could be trading teleporn or you could be thinking about joining isets and so we need
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:48.420]   You could be but this this is the real right to be forgotten
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:56.260]   This is the right for you to to to crumple up your own piece of paper to to um, you know, erase your own file
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.180]   Uh
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:04.580]   That's that's still the right and that's still the essence of privacy is is what I control and when you lose control of the government
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:08.020]   No, I every time I go to europe. I apologize for being american with the nsa
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:12.980]   I it's it's it's abhorrent what the nsa has done and it needs control and I think that
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:14.180]   um
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:17.300]   uh encrypting everybody I when I was at google I I said
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:21.780]   Screw the government in this case who is who's your daddy here?
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:25.940]   It's your users and you got to enable encryption of everything or else people are going to trust you
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.100]   That was the most perfect segue
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:33.140]   Our next conversation, which is the focus on the user campaign if you haven't seen this
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:36.340]   It's an organization that's going after google. It's an organization
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:41.140]   uh, comprised of google's uh competitors Yelp trip advisor holiday check and others
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:46.580]   And uh, they they created this amazing video. It's it's actually a really great video. Let's go ahead and roll that
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:51.780]   When the internet was first getting off the ground its information was overwhelming
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:56.740]   No one no one knew how to access the data. So it wasn't very helpful
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:00.580]   Then google came along organizing the world's information
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:04.740]   They made it universally accessible and useful through an algorithm
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:10.660]   This formula looked through all the information and helped sorted out and presented to users in the way
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.980]   We've all come to appreciate
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:18.740]   This changed everything how we did business and relationships how we accessed information
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.220]   Even how information was provided
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:25.540]   And once the most relevant sources were being rewarded and delivered to the user
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:32.660]   People came to depend on these results and lean upon google's stated goal of focusing on users
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:40.740]   Which led to one of the biggest evolutions of google search when google started to deliver more specific results in the form of answers
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:46.660]   Instead of just links to sites google started looking at other types of information knowledge based
[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.340]   algorithms
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:53.540]   It sorted through the information of the wall to try and deliver the actual answer you are looking for
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:52:00.340]   Sometimes how came in the form of a location on a map a weather forecast or even the answer to a math question
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:07.700]   And because google was consistently delivering information that was most make a compelling argument in a in a couple of minute or so
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:10.340]   There have been some concerns
[00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:13.620]   Google has started to further change the way it's displaying search
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:16.580]   And people are starting to take note
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:20.020]   Instead of running info through their standard organic search algorithm
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:25.860]   Google has started giving preferential treatment to some of its own content to boost its popularity
[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:30.420]   Now when users see results some of them are still what's most helpful
[00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:33.220]   But some are just what google wants you to see
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:35.460]   And here's the thing
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.220]   They look the same
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:42.340]   Even though the results that come through the back door have not had to go through the trusted algorithm
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:48.020]   These selective and biased results omit some of the best information that is available on the web
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:55.940]   Making it more difficult for users to find what they are looking for and discouraging the innovation of those providing good information
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:04.420]   So what was once a trusted platform to find relevant answers is now being questioned because if it's not being done in the best interest of the user
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:07.060]   Who is it valuable for?
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:15.620]   Right now google is being investigated because the interests of users institutions and businesses that have come to depend on google are being threatened
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:17.700]   The solution
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:22.500]   For regulators google innovators and most importantly users
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:26.580]   Is for google to start acting more like google
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.300]   That's what it means to focus on the user
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:36.100]   Allow the best unbiased results on the first page without giving preference to google plus or anyone else
[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:40.820]   The trust of users the health and innovation of business ecosystems
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:45.060]   And the rights of everyone to have access to information depend on it
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.540]   You can protect the integrity of search
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:53.300]   Download focus on the user local to see examples of the unbiased results that are possible
[00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:57.460]   Share this message and contact members of the european commission
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:03.460]   We can keep the internet honest by helping google continue to focus on the user
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:06.740]   That's what do you think jeff that sounds reasonable?
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:11.140]   Keep the internet honest really for a couple reasons
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:13.140]   One back to the trusted algorithm
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:15.860]   Who says
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:21.140]   Does it okay fine if we're gonna fair is fair then if google has to is required link to yelp in some formula
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.460]   Then does yelp require to link to google?
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:26.180]   I have the same problem with the German publishers
[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:32.580]   Uh, they read a video very similar kind of all this is cute. We're gonna make it all seem seem so cute make you understand you idiots video
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:37.220]   In which they said go go search for shoes on google and my god
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:38.580]   They show you their advertisers
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:44.180]   Well now go to built the largest publication in europe owned by actual spinner see that there's a little link on top for shua
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:48.420]   In shoes, what do you see there? You see built advertisers and nothing else?
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:53.380]   What do you see on google? You see their advertisers? Of course you see the rest of everything in composite one about shoes
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:56.340]   I just searched on hotels in midritt
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:55:04.420]   Because i'm going there soon on google at the top. I see their ads. I see ads and sponsored things. It's clearly labeled
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:08.180]   Uh, lot of ads google sell a lot of ads because a lot of demand for it
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:09.220]   That's true
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:13.700]   But I don't see that there's what what they were accused of doing in the video was presenting
[00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:15.220]   um
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:19.860]   Uh algorithm michlustines and paid listings and looking exactly the same show me show me how
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:24.580]   That says ad that says ad that says sponsored on the right. It says ads
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:28.500]   So show me how that's true and then maybe you convinced me, but I don't see it
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:33.140]   Right below there's trip advisor first first listing trip advisor
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:42.420]   There's a and is it does it also disable their point to a certain extent invalidate their point to a certain extent that these are just competitors who are trying to compete
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:48.580]   Uh by essentially changing public opinion, which is I guess the definition of propaganda. No, they're not trying to change public opinion
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:51.540]   They're trying to change policy opinion. They're trying to hide behind government
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:57.380]   This is the great irony of news corp and actual springer of fighting this because they are both conservative bastions of conservative thinking
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:01.940]   Don't like big government have been often critical of the EU when they can't make their business work
[00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:05.780]   One of the do they run behind the skirt of the EU government
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:09.940]   Juni you were you were trying to say something a minute ago. I interrupted. This is my bad habit
[00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:11.700]   No, no, that's that's okay
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:18.100]   No, I was it was just interesting to me that the the the video had this concept of like there was a trusted google
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:23.540]   Now there's not a trusted google and can we just get back to the the trusted algorithm?
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:26.820]   Before they had whoever
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.580]   This is the algorithm
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:37.380]   And also weird the google plus I never see google plus results and searchers
[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:39.540]   I very rarely do I see google
[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:44.660]   I found that interesting that google plus was the thing that got plugged into the machine and was just stuffing results
[00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:49.300]   I mean, I gotta tell you I just ran this search for hotels in Madrid. This is on my 15 inch
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:51.140]   Mac book
[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:58.180]   And partially because this big image bar across the top like the actual results that aren't ads are below the fold
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:01.540]   Like I actually do have to scroll in order to get to that first
[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:03.380]   Images take up a lot
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:08.180]   The images do take up a lot and those are not sponsored as far as I can tell those those that's just
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:11.540]   They're commerce links aren't they the images
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:15.300]   Are they or not? Uh, it's just encrypted at google.com
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:20.500]   Who's rating? I wonder oh, that's a good question. That could be google plus that could be google local
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:26.500]   Which is you know, remember that as a zagat guys. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I mean, okay
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:31.060]   And then it's also on maps. So it's the same database, right? And maps is
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:34.660]   And maps is taking up a chunk on the on the right there
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:39.220]   Which is just a useful search result most of my searches don't look anything like this
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:41.220]   This happens to be a very highly sold
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:46.900]   Uh, um search results, but anyway, yeah, no that the the video is just interesting
[00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:47.780]   I mean
[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:52.340]   Are our users complaining? It sounds like the publishers are the ones who are complaining
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:57.380]   You know like this this idea that this is about the users, right like I don't I don't know
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:00.100]   Well
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:07.860]   Those other tech companies be careful because they're gonna come after you next yeah, um your your american tech companies and and and
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:13.780]   You're being demonized and so you play in with with their hand and they're gonna and they're gonna turn right back around and say
[00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:18.260]   Oh, you have to link to our stuff. We're gonna come after you and ask you for money for links. Watch out. Yeah
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:28.020]   Well, the only the only possible solution is that google is somehow regulated and forced to rank links in a specific way
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:33.380]   That is the only other option to allow in google to do whatever its algorithm or
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:36.900]   You know, it's it's desire to place ads. Yep
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:39.860]   Unless you accept their argument
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:45.700]   Unless you accept their argument that there's you can't there's no visual difference between and i'm not sure that's exactly true
[00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:50.180]   But if there in fact is no visual difference between their, you know, ins you know
[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:56.420]   Google plus result and the what would be the natural result then that's one option, but I agree with you
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:58.340]   That's not what they want. That's not what they want. They want they want
[00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:04.180]   They want to be a flag but then they said some good results are not being included and then you see the result drop out of the list
[00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:08.740]   So then so then google would have to be required to have a certain number of
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:13.540]   You links to a certain number of external sites within a certain, you know
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:18.980]   And then you've got a google regulator and that's and that implies that there's a tiny number of
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:26.260]   Of other companies that are going to be privileged. They can't add results from every single company that provides hotel information. So you're a super disaster
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:28.420]   Right, exactly. Oh, absolutely
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:34.740]   By the way, the best source of of recommendations is uh person to person. So jeff i'm going to give you a recommendation
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:38.260]   The very best pizza place in the world is in Madrid
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:43.700]   You got to go to this place the guy's Italian, and he's a recent immigrant to to Spain
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:46.100]   But it's called pizza taka
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:49.700]   And uh, it's a perfect name for you to like yeah, exactly
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:54.100]   But taka spelled t-e-c-a and and the the url is law pizza taka
[00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:58.500]   And it's just the most fantastic pizza. I have ever tasted in my life
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.660]   Who was this? No man with another in your backyard
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:05.780]   Exactly right the guy ferments his dough for three days and then he adds yeast at the end
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:10.260]   He told me something he learned from his uh his grandmother. Anyway, it's a it's a great restaurant
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.900]   Uh, but back to the tech news and just sec we're going to come back
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:16.660]   We can take a break and and and then we're going to come back and talk about I don't know
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:23.060]   Maybe julie and the sarge a sange and some of his comments about google and eric schmitz
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:29.220]   Response and so on but first I want to tell you about personal capital personal capital is a good service
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:32.020]   It's one of our sponsors today and it's good because money is good
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:35.380]   And it's good for you to hang on to the money that you've earned and they help you do that
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.220]   One of the ways they help you do that is right now
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:43.940]   We've all got our financial stuff scattered all over the world in different on different sites in different financial companies
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:49.940]   Uh in banks for own case all over the place and personal capital is really cool because it brings together all that data into
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.980]   Sing it puts it together. So it shows your money
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:59.380]   What's coming in what's going out and it lumps it together in a way that's very intuitive and easy to understand and I really appreciate that
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.060]   I also like the fact
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.060]   That they have an android wear
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:07.620]   Application or an android application that supports android where I guess is more accurate
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:12.180]   They were one of the first companies to support android wear and um, I had been using this app
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.820]   I don't know for about three hours
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:18.980]   and I got a message saying that you know, I had some kind of uh
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:21.060]   Uh
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:25.220]   Feed that was going to be charged against my bank account if I didn't take action. I took action
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:30.420]   I avoided a 35 dollar fee within the first few hours and that's essentially what this free app does
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:35.060]   It saves you money and it shows you your money so you can make better investment decisions
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:39.700]   So it's it's really a great thing. There's no reason not to use personal capital set up your free account
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:45.460]   Go to personal capital dot com slash twig and personal capital is free and it's a smart way to grow your money
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:51.140]   And we thank personal capital for their support of this week in google
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:56.980]   Well vanity fair has a big article about a basic on a uh, I don't know if you guys saw this but it was a
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.340]   um julian assange did a kind of uh
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:01.940]   uh
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.940]   Obi-Wan Kenobi type of hologram
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:11.140]   interview where he was uh basically going after google and saying that google was uh the nsa or working with the nsa
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:12.740]   and um
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:16.260]   Quite an interesting thing. Um, I don't know we didn't queue up a video of that chat
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:20.740]   But if you can if you can find that it's it's uh, it's in actually in one of the story links there
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:23.140]   Uh, very bizarre. Let's take a look at this
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:28.180]   So it has presented over last 10 years of being some fluffy uh graduate student
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:29.700]   um
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.700]   colorful like its logo
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.700]   uh, playroom of ideas
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:38.660]   uh, and a different sort of company not even a company at all come it's something that gives free services
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:42.980]   It's not that it's a normal company
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:45.860]   Just like other normal companies in the u.s. That are very big
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:48.740]   And it should be seen as a normal company
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:55.380]   Unlike other companies however is engaged in a very ambitious project that is not normal
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:58.660]   in terms of its business and that is to
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:03.860]   collect as much information about the world as is possible store it indexer
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:07.460]   make predictive models about people's interests
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:10.500]   And use that to sell advertising
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.140]   Uh, and of course the national security agency comes along
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:21.220]   Given that google is doing basically what the national security agency is doing in terms of collecting information storing it indexing it
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:23.060]   uh, and
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:28.740]   attaching it to people and sticks its fangs in and sucks the information that google sucks and that's
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:32.340]   Going to be the case or no no matter what google does
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:36.340]   Unless it leaves the US jurisdiction
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:40.180]   Now i'm probably in the minority, but I actually love advertising
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:45.300]   I think it's the most moral form of monetization for most online services and i'll tell you why because
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:54.580]   basically those people who use the advertisements and buy the products and services advertise subsidize the services for everybody including people who can't afford it
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:59.460]   This is especially true with social networks and so on and that's why I don't like
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.100]   Any sort of social network that charges admission
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:10.340]   Like app.net. I was I was kind of against that service and of course contextual advertising in principle is a great thing because who wants?
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:15.300]   I don't want to see uh ads for wrinkle cream and maybe I need it, but I don't want to see those ads
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:22.020]   I don't want to see irrelevant advertisement. I want to see relevant advertisement. I want it to be so relevant that it feels like
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:26.900]   I'm getting search results for things I would have searched for if I had a thought of it
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:33.700]   And of course that's to me. That's the big problem with google and facebook and everybody else who claims to harvest our personal data
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:39.860]   For the sake of serving up uh contextual advertising in that they they don't know how to do it well in my experience
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.380]   I think they're terrible at it. I don't really understand why but anyway. What do we think of uh,
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.220]   Julian
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:49.620]   Cory he's in the uh equidorian embassy in london still and that's why he had to be beamed in
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:54.740]   Uh, what do you think of comments? I can't stop focusing on that. I'm just thinking that I'm going to cancel all my early airplane
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:57.860]   I'm hollering in an airplane. I'm gonna admit that is awesome
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:01.540]   That looks amazing. I would do that
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:05.860]   Do you see an untruddled?
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:11.540]   Sit in your loving room and get beamed in my hologram. It's fantastic. It's a high res 3d version of what we're doing here
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.500]   Basically, amazing. Uh, yeah, that that is fantastic
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:18.020]   But he he's been trading barbs with eric schmitt because they both have books
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:24.340]   essentially and uh, I don't know I haven't read did you read the the vignette that he
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:29.220]   mentions that julian Assange mentions in his book about eric schmitt eric schmitt's girlfriend
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:32.100]   uh came to see him
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:33.140]   and
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:40.020]   Was effectively his allegations as I recall them are that he was talking with someone about
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.700]   um
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:45.780]   The government about the nsa that type of stuff about wicki leaks
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:52.100]   And he got a visit from eric schmitt's girlfriend and someone from the state department or I think it was
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:59.140]   Might have been jared koan. Anyway, someone who was either associated with or had been associated with the state department
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:06.020]   So his his allegation is that effectively eric schmitt is a couple of steps away from being a government operative
[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:10.980]   um, which you know is the type of thing that julian Assange likes to say
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:13.460]   um, I don't know if I
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:17.060]   Believe that but certainly his claims in the video that google is a business
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:24.100]   Clearly it is a business. Clearly it is trying to to gain as much information about its users as possible. That seems pretty
[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:26.020]   Uh, you know, I have no problem agreeing with that
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:33.700]   Yeah, it's it's all very weird and and and that vignette I hadn't I had not heard that but that is very strange
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:38.340]   And it's quite a leap. I mean some people you know, some people have worked for the state department
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:43.220]   Uh, you know, I think that necessarily means that eric schmitt is and besides why we'd work for the government
[01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:45.380]   He's got a much better job than anybody in the government
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:51.540]   Including the president if you ask me, um, so yeah, kind of kind of a weird type of deal
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:57.540]   Well, um, google is getting into the streaming music service business. They've up there
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:02.740]   They've up the ante on their on their music business. Uh, this these are based on essentially rumors
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:08.260]   Uh that google is going to be unveiling a search another streaming service and they're going to
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:16.900]   And we had a conversation on this on on tech news today and the big question was why do they why does google torture itself and torture us with all
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:21.620]   These different sources of music they got youtube they've got they've got uh, google play music
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:26.500]   They've got all these different things. Why don't they just have one kind of iTunes thing or one
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:31.220]   Spotify oriented service and just let everybody buy into that
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:37.700]   I don't think they actually know what people want right. I don't think they actually know what people want
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:42.420]   Yeah, so they're trying a bunch of different things those projects probably don't even talk to each other
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:48.900]   Yeah, what people want is spotify essentially uh spotify has I think 20 times
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:54.820]   Uh, the audience that uh google's music service does I happen to think that the the secret is in youtube somehow
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:08:00.900]   They need to turn youtube and they're not just a place where people have videos and people use it for the music heavily
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:02.500]   But they don't have a good
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:06.100]   They don't have a way to to use the music on youtube legally
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:13.220]   Uh for as a music service that just downloads as an audio only file that streams and has thumbs up and all that kind of stuff
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:18.020]   Uh like uh panda or something like that, but I think they could do that they should do that
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.980]   I think they're just lost in the woods. They've got so much complexity
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:27.060]   I don't think I think we went out on the street and asked people about google's various music offerings people would just be super confused about it
[01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:33.860]   You know, I will say um since I live in canaka stand and we get things uh three or four years later
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:39.300]   We we just got google play music relatively recently and so I I
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:44.740]   Signed up and I I uploaded everything I have basically to google's cloud
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:50.020]   And then i've been using it on various devices and I have to say I really like it
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:53.540]   It's I haven't obviously I don't have access to a bunch of things
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:59.140]   That other people do like panda or for example, but I think it is actually pretty good and they're in particular
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:04.020]   They're music recommendations since we were just talking about their ability to recommend things
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:11.140]   Actually, think they're pretty good. They they've clearly gone through my stuff and and they suggest things that are more off
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:13.780]   And then not pretty good to listen to so I don't know
[01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:17.860]   It's a great service. It really is and the quality of the audio seems really good to me
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:20.020]   I could be my mat my imagination
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:23.780]   Um, maybe it's just because I like the price and that makes it sound better
[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:27.060]   Uh, but uh, but I think the audio quality sounds really good
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:29.860]   Well, uh, we got one we've got a story here for for jeff
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:34.660]   Uh, basically what people have been saying about the chrome book and slamming it is I you can't do real work on it
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:36.820]   Well now photoshop is coming to the chrome
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:41.220]   Yeah, so now if you can do photoshop on the chrome book what can't you do?
[01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:45.140]   Anything
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:49.940]   Video editing but but we talked about that before there are services where you can do video youtube cloud
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:51.780]   YouTube
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:53.780]   Yeah, that's true. That's true
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.100]   So it's like I don't know
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.020]   Yeah, I mean it is
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:03.220]   This is more of a symbolic victory. I think for chrome book fans than anything else because of course, you know, you can do
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:10.820]   You can do 100% of what the majority of people do with a laptop on a chrome book jeff you and I know that
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:16.980]   Uh, and but people will say things like I can't can't do real work like photoshop and now photoshop is coming to the chrome
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:21.540]   Coffee out here. I think it goes just to those who have a subscription to adobe's
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:24.100]   Sweet. Oh, it's still
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:29.780]   Hidiously overpriced. I mean we're talking about photoshop, but that's part of the photoshop experience is they're gonna empty your wallet
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:39.140]   I did say when I was with the with the work group
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:42.420]   that
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:44.980]   You know I helped my chrome book and I said that
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:49.860]   You've got to find that you still got to find the middle and and I think robust hardware matters
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:57.060]   That if people really get involved with chrome books and really start to live on the cloud and your friends and neighbors are doing and can do it
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:02.100]   That's going to drive more people to your services and so the the hardware strategy is odd as it seemed
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:06.420]   I think it's actually very important. Yeah, I think they need a little bit of sexy too
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:12.420]   I don't know if you agree, but if there was a sort of macbook air looking device and it was a chrome book
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:15.780]   I would be on that like a fact get on an m&m
[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:19.300]   like it would be because the I love the
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:25.140]   The chrome book cloud I everything I use is in the cloud if I'm not connected to the internet
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:28.820]   I'm basically not really doing anything except playing solitaire
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:32.340]   So but if the design was a little bit better, you know just a little bit
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:35.220]   Then I think that would make a big difference for a lot of people
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:40.260]   You are so right in fact I ended up I was on the fence after testing
[01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:46.820]   uh chrome book pixel for a while I was on the fence between a macbook pro with retina and a chrome book pixel as my sole
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:51.940]   laptop and that's exactly what brought me over to the macbook pro with the retina
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:55.940]   It's just the design is better. It's just so good. Yeah, it's so good
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:58.260]   and if this thing and I
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.060]   Decided that I was going to use it like a chrome book
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:04.180]   I was going to try to be as cloudy as possible with the macbook pro
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:09.620]   But I ended up getting sucked into all these other things simply because it's there and it's kind of how you do it
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:10.900]   But yeah, man
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:12.180]   Give me a give me a chrome book
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:13.940]   That's like like a macbook
[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:17.540]   Even in the ballpark of being having the elegance and the lightness and usability
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:21.140]   And i'm there although admittedly the the chrome book pixel is
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:27.700]   It's close. It's so close. It's a high quality device. The screen is beautiful. Yeah, the pixel is is a nice machine
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:35.620]   I'm just too married to my realize that i'm just really married to my like routines and the ways that I do things and i've invested some time and money
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:41.540]   Into software particular bits of software that i'm certain shortcuts and and like so i have two things about the chrome book
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:49.380]   I probably could get it all set up so I could do my development and push to get and run my tests and and do all the things i normally do during the day while i'm coding
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:54.100]   I probably could i just the thought of letting go of like my favorite tech senator
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:57.700]   And like the commands that i use and like how to learn a whole nother thing
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:02.500]   You know just just i i'm like, oh, so you know so much time it would take so much time
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:06.420]   In addition the other point which i brought up in the past in our discussion of the chrome book is like
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:13.460]   You know if someone hacks my my google account or if my google account gets shut down for whatever reason and i can't get in touch with anybody at google
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:18.180]   And then like i can't use my computer. That's just not not acceptable. You know
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:24.180]   Um, I mean i already it's like, well, you know if they shut down my google account, I couldn't use my android phone, right?
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:27.540]   Like you can't use your android phone basically unless you're you're logged in
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:30.980]   Um, I changed my or I was setting up two factor offs
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:34.580]   I turned it off and turned it back on and like my phone was just like boop boop boop
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:39.380]   I got all these notifications that I got logged out of play services and you know the whole thing was just sort of rendered
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:43.700]   I was like, oh, this is actually everything's connected to my google account, which is a a free account
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:49.460]   Uh on google, you know a company that we know it's not like you can call up and be like, hi, can you unlock me?
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:51.860]   You know
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.860]   You could do that
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:14:00.020]   I could because I have this amazing platform, but I would do it would be a twit special me sort of begging
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:08.260]   But it is funny how I like your first your first comment about how you get so used to your workflow or your even if it's
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:13.860]   Not in your case, but probably in mind if it's screwed up in some way or you've kind of hacked together some
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:17.380]   Clergy kind of way of doing things. You're just so used to it
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:22.740]   It's like and so moving to something new even if it's arguably more efficient or better
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:26.020]   It's it's like moving houses or something or being
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:29.380]   You know, uprooted and having to move to a different city
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:32.180]   You don't know where the coffee shop is and you don't know how to use the buzzer
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:35.700]   And it may actually turn out to be better, but getting used to it is hard
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:40.020]   Although it has to be said and then and I think jeff also you can you can verify this
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:45.460]   There's a psychology that is causing resistance to living in the cloud with the chrome book
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:51.380]   And uh and that psychology is something along the lines of I know where it is. It's right here. It's right
[01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:53.220]   Exactly
[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:57.140]   At this meeting that I said it's in my hands. They sound stupid to you guys
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:01.380]   But you've got to provide backup. And I said we discussed this for like an hour
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:04.020]   On on twig and
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:05.860]   It goes away
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:11.780]   But you need to do it now you need to provide an api to backup on other virtual services and onto hard drives and such
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:16.180]   Absolutely, it's it's exactly the kind of thing that google is in a position to provide very easily
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:18.500]   They just offered unlimited
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:22.500]   Cloud storage with individual file sizes of no bigger than five terabytes
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:28.660]   For the education users they got all the storage in the world and they should absolutely just throw the switch and make that happen
[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:33.300]   But the point I was going to make was that when you actually use a a chrome book
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:36.500]   Uh significantly the psychology reverses
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:42.500]   And you and when you go back to a regular laptop you're like this feels really flimsy to have it right here in my possession
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:46.500]   I gotta I don't know exactly what's happening on the on the chrome book
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:50.660]   You always have this sort of peace of mind. I'm not going to get I'm not going to get a virus
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:53.300]   I know exactly where my stuff is no matter what device I
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:56.100]   Excess my stuff is I know i'm going to get the current version
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:16:01.700]   It the peace of mind is actually on the in favor of of chrome of the chrome book when you start using one
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:04.500]   I actually felt that way even though I don't use a chrome book
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:09.300]   I mean, I'm so connected everything I do is on the web when even when i'm writing its word press
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:14.020]   Um, you know my own server version, but it's it's not on the device
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:18.420]   And I thought I had lost my laptop. I left it somewhere
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:24.100]   I thought it's gone someone's gonna have taken it and you know what I didn't even care because there's nothing on there
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.700]   And there's certainly nothing on there that isn't backed up somewhere
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:32.260]   So, you know, we're at worst someone sees a few of my photos. I don't even care
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:37.380]   It's I could have literally bought a new laptop and instantly had all the same stuff I had before
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:39.060]   What about your naked selfies?
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:42.180]   Not consuming that stuff that stuff I have encrypted. Okay
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:47.300]   The thing that bothers me and maybe this this bothers me because I know a little too much about how this all works
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:50.260]   It's this idea that there's this like single point of failure
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:54.500]   This idea of like, you know, like back in college there was a mainframe and there are all these dumb terminals, right?
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.980]   And like the dumb terminals could come and come and go get connected
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:17:00.340]   But if something was wrong with the mainframe you couldn't get to it and that's kind of what google is
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:04.340]   Whereas, you know, i'm a coder so I work with git which is a distributed version control system
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:06.580]   That means that on every single
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:12.180]   Uh machine or device where you're interacting with their repository. There is a full synchronized copy
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:15.540]   It's distributed and it's federated and I can push to this server
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:18.020]   I can push to that computer. I can push to that server
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:24.740]   So there's there's no the one single point of failure that that someone other than me is controlling that I'm dependent upon
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:29.940]   Um, and so that distributed federated, you know completely synchronized peer-to-peer model
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:34.820]   Like just doesn't exist with commercial web apps because you're just not financially incentivized to do that
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:36.900]   There's there's literally no
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:42.180]   Reason for companies to do this and this is the conversation we've had about diaspora and twitter and interactivity
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:47.940]   Between the social networks it actually slows down innovation and and means, you know, lots of arguments about standards
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:49.140]   And it's all really hard
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:53.220]   But like developers who I think in a lot of ways are kind of the canary and the coal mine
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:58.500]   Figured out that version control systems that involve this see this singular canonical copy
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:04.020]   Where developers check out and then push back into it and there are all these conflicts and if the server goes down you're all at a
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:08.500]   Lot of risky that doesn't work. It's incredibly risky, right? That doesn't work and that's why sort of you know
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:11.380]   in modern, you know software development used distributed
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:18.100]   uh, um, version control systems in which there's a full copy on every machine where the person is working and so
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:23.220]   That's what that single point of failure, you know, the the one the one entity controlled
[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:28.820]   uh, uh, you know sort of central place where it should be that makes me uncomfortable
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:35.780]   You're actually it's interesting. Sorry. We're seeing we're seeing I think that's that sort of I think of that as the bit torrent model the peer-to-peer
[01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:41.460]   model we're seeing that sort of bleed into other areas too even even media, you know lots of
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:47.060]   Streaming I think popcorn time or whatever it is, you know a lot of that media is effectively peer-to-peer
[01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:53.380]   Distributed there is no it doesn't exist in a specific place. It's being constantly streamed from multiple users
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:56.820]   Right exactly. Yeah, I want to see more of that
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:06.020]   And I want to see that backup feature. I absolutely that's a the perfect idea for the chromebook. Anyway, uh, sundar pichai if you're watching and I know you are sundar
[01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:09.620]   I know you're watching every minute of the show. Give us the backup. We need it
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:15.140]   Uh, well in just sec we're going to come back and do the google change log but first I want to tell you about our third sponsor today
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:16.500]   Which is prosper?
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:17.380]   Prosper
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:21.540]   Uh is a peer-to-peer lending we talk about the bit torrent model for for content
[01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:27.300]   We could uh, we also have a bit torrent model not really uh for money in 72 hours you could have
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:32.100]   $35,000 to cover your needs. What would you use it? What would you do with that money?
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.980]   Would you pay off your uh credit cards your high rate credit cards?
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:38.980]   Would you start a business do home improvement projects, uh, you know rebuild your kitchen
[01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:45.860]   Find out how easy online application is for prosper and provide a few details and see a rate online almost instantly
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:47.780]   You can go there immediately and check it out
[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:53.540]   Personally, I see this as an alternative to crowdfunding for some people of course crowdfunding sites is a fun
[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:56.740]   A fantastic trend but it's not for everybody
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:20:03.540]   And the reason is that kickstarter projects and others are a huge amount of work before during and especially after you reach your kickstarter goals
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:08.260]   And so if you just want to start a business and don't want to fritter away all your time with the fundraising
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:13.140]   Prosper is the way to do it without deferding your time and energy on the fundraising itself
[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:17.860]   Prosper is silicon valley's answer to personal loans and with prospers innovative peer-to-peer lending process
[01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:23.140]   There are no outrageous fees no raising interest rates and you'll never set foot in a bank
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:30.020]   Remember the bank those those guys that created the financial meltdown prosper has more than two million members and over a billion dollars in funded loans
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:35.140]   For limited time prospers offering twit fans a 50 dollar visa prepaid card when you get a loan
[01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:40.260]   So go to prospered.com/twit and that's a special rate just for our audience up to 35
[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:46.900]   Thousand dollars in just three days and a 50 dollar visa prepaid card go to prospered.com/twit
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:54.020]   Well, jina, are you ready to do the google change log? I'm always ready. Let's do it. Here the trumpets
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:08.740]   Right on right on we have some really cool new features coming down the pipe in chrome
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:12.100]   We know because the earliest version of chrome canary
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:16.740]   Which is of course the most unstable sort of developer version of chrome often previews these features
[01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:21.700]   And there are two two new ones that i'm kind of excited about it. What one is kind of goofy one's really useful
[01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:26.660]   Um, you've already seen in chrome that if you've opened up a tab and it's playing audio
[01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:30.100]   You'll see a little icon on the tab letting you know that the audio is playing
[01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:35.540]   That alone is useful, but in canary they've introduced a feature that lets you pause
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:39.460]   That sound by just clicking on the icon on the tab
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:45.860]   So really nice smart stuff there if you've got say a you know an ad or something or some sort of music playing in the background
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:48.020]   You just click on the tab and you can pause it like again again
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:52.980]   That's in the canary version of chrome, but we'll see that that that most likely will come down to the stable version in the next
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:57.060]   Video or audio or are you just muting it for a while?
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:02.100]   I believe it's muting so I don't believe it's pausing. I believe it's muting. So it's like shut up
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:09.140]   No one to hear you right now. Yes, because it because that that that icon shows up even if it's a video or a flash
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:17.380]   A element that's playing audio. So it's muting the other thing we're singing canary. There's a hidden endless runner game
[01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:23.780]   So you see in chrome when you're offline. It's got that sort of like that eight bit dinosaur
[01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:30.020]   Which I which I love well in the canary build the little little dinosaur still shows up can't connect to the internet when you're offline
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:32.420]   But if you I think it's you tap the space bar
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:38.580]   You can start running that dinosaur through the desert jumping over cactus and you know it gives you all something to do
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.580]   Why you can't get on the internet
[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:44.580]   I love this kind of thing. It's like, you know, this this kind of thing is like a classic easter egg
[01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:51.140]   Uh, you know there's excel had one of these games where you sort of fly around and and there's there was a tetris game
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:56.740]   And anyway, so that this is this is kind of fun. We have something to do with the dinosaur when you when you can't get online and a new version of chrome
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:58.900]   That's in canary right now
[01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:01.700]   Now we already talked about photoshop on your chrome book
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:08.100]   Um, that is pretty cool. You know just just just to just to clarify. I was like, how is photoshop running on your chrome book?
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:11.460]   It's actually like it's streaming photoshop
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:15.220]   So adobe is gonna be running photoshop on a server somewhere in the cloud
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:23.060]   You install this app for your chrome book which like which which gives you like tunnels you into the remote server and connects to your google drive
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:28.260]   Um, so you're streaming photoshop over the web versus running a local photoshop app
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:35.700]   So people are by testing this now not clear how fast it is particularly with giant images. I would love to try this out
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:43.300]   Uh, but they're they're testing it now and uh, I assume that people who have you know, pay and have emptied their wallet will we'll we'll get this eventually
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.700]   Imagine if that works what else we could do that with?
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:50.980]   Yeah, it's a cool model. Yeah, it is it is you gotta mean a big big big fat pipe
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:56.260]   But sure, I mean, I I guess if the if communication between adobe servers and google servers, although
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:04.660]   Is fast enough then the saves to google drive will should work right? I mean if you're you're basically just tunneling it's like remote control. I got computer
[01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:08.340]   The original optical material to the cloud is the cost
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:11.540]   Once it's there you're working on faster processors
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:17.060]   Mm-hmm. Yeah, it has to save to the NSA server first, but that shouldn't
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:22.660]   Very fast servers. Yeah, they got they got a shortcut straight to the NSA servers as well
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:28.980]   New in uh in gmail you can now view images within your message full screen
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:32.340]   So this is similar to how attachment with regular on non image attachments work now
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:35.860]   It's works with images you can click on large large images within a message
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:38.260]   You see them full screen in gmail on the web
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:43.220]   You can click on the google drive button to save the image directly to drive or the arrow button to download them
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:49.300]   To your to your computer so subtle but nice change for those of us who email images around
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:53.780]   And finally, uh, thank you for this. I I'm I believe this was jeff
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:57.620]   Google's beefing up their mobile ad offerings
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:04.180]   So google's introducing new mobile display formats and tools that were that will roll out over the coming months
[01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:08.180]   Um, so advertisers had this these new sort of mobile lightbox
[01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:13.620]   Ads engagement ads how many how many more buzzwords can I say they dynamically
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:19.300]   Resize to fit any size across devices. This is part of google's sort of multi
[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:23.700]   screen size multi device world that we we heard a lot about at google io
[01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:30.020]   Um, so you have existing ads that kind of fold and unfold and collapse and expand depending on the device you're looking at
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:35.780]   Um in the in these new formats, uh, so their google is trying on their best to crack the mobile advertising nut
[01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:41.940]   And i'm sure they'll do they'll do pretty well. So advertisers will pay when users engage with the ads to expand them
[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:48.420]   Um, the ad type will be available soon in the adwords ad gallery for, uh, google display network campaigns
[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:51.540]   That's all i got fantastic
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:55.220]   engine
[01:25:55.220 --> 01:26:03.140]   And we have our tool tip and number of the week why don't we start with you jeena since you're in the mode of talking right now
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:06.020]   What do you got in terms of our tip of the week?
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:11.940]   a little a little something from from reddit and and chad this actually might have been from you, uh, I
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:14.340]   Did not know this but
[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:16.340]   Google drive has got this really neat thing
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:19.460]   So if you need to insert a special character in google drive
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:24.580]   So like if say you're in a google doc and you go from to to the insert menu special characters
[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:29.860]   You can actually draw the character that you're looking for. I never remember the names these characters
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:35.700]   Uh, yeah, you can draw it and it will search for the character that looks like what you just drew
[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:38.500]   Yeah
[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:42.580]   It's pretty this is pretty crazy and you know, I tried a couple of things and it was some you know
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:46.820]   Sometimes it was more accurate than others, but really neat if you're like, yeah
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:49.700]   Looking for the little the with the doofy doo you guys
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:53.140]   The necklace the prince used to wear what I want to use that
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:56.100]   Euro sign and the pound sign
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:58.740]   Shruggi all the time
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:00.740]   Shruggi
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.740]   You should add those
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:05.780]   All right, jeff your number of the week
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:07.220]   Uh
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:15.940]   All right, so speaking of sundar he says that drive now has 240 million active users up from 190 million since june
[01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:18.500]   This is the this is the one that really interested me
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:19.220]   Um
[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:24.500]   crowbooks speaking of crowbooks are approaching 50 share of the edu market up from
[01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:31.860]   100% only 18 months ago. I'm so happy to hear that it's such a perfect education device. That is fantastic news
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:36.660]   My son by the way is uh, he's uh, he works for a company called tinker
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:41.460]   And uh, they do education. They teach children how to do software programming
[01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:44.740]   Using a drag and drop. It's like legos for software
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:49.460]   And uh, and he said that you know, they just take to the chrome book is a perfect solution
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:54.100]   He goes and he does actual training with kids and it's perfect because they can just log in
[01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:59.380]   They can do their projects and and they love it and it just works fantastic. So that's great to hear
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:02.500]   Uh, any other numbers jeff?
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:07.620]   No, I have one quick question for jeena. Yeah, do you believe the reports about the uh, chamu, uh, nexus?
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:10.340]   six moto
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:12.420]   xyz the moto nex
[01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:18.980]   This zit i do i think that it makes sense that they're gonna come out with a new device when they release l
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:21.620]   Uh, it sounds like it's gonna be big
[01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:25.620]   5.9 5.9 inches, which is
[01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:29.780]   Bigger than than the one plus one which is which is pretty big as again with
[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:32.500]   This is five five
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:40.180]   Oh, this is five five. Yeah, so it's gonna be a big phone according to rumors. Uh, but yeah, it's basically gonna be what they're saying rumors are saying
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:41.860]   Uh
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:48.180]   a moto x like device motor roll is gonna go going to manufacture it from facing speakers pretty excited about that coming, you know
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:52.100]   Obviously with l uh, yeah, I I think that uh, I think that
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:54.100]   It sounds it sounds credible to me
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:56.420]   timing
[01:28:56.420 --> 01:29:00.660]   I mean, uh, yeah, I you know I forget now what the rumors were about timing
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:06.260]   But I imagine it's got to happen before the before the holiday season, right? I mean that that makes sense. It's got to be imminent
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:11.380]   Yeah, that'd be imminent. Yeah, and there's a picture circulating now that uh, look pretty credible
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:16.500]   We had a big discussion of it today after tech news today and it looks it looks pretty real
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:21.220]   Now, uh, Matthew do you have anything you want to throw into to this a tool tip number or anything like that?
[01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:24.180]   Does it have to be google related? No
[01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:29.220]   Okay, so this is something interesting. I literally just came across
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:33.940]   before the show clayshirky who some of you may have heard of
[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:36.740]   media guru
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:41.940]   Happened to be in hong kong and wrote something about the occupy hong kong protests
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:45.940]   Um, which is fascinating and I definitely think you should read it
[01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:52.100]   Just a sort of, you know one man wandering around taking photos and but he published it on github
[01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:55.300]   Which sounds interesting. Yeah, he um
[01:29:55.300 --> 01:30:01.300]   Uh his blog if you've ever been there looks exactly the same as when wordpress first launched
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:08.180]   You know 45 years ago and so maybe he's given up and gone to github, but I I find it interesting because um
[01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:10.820]   You know, he's clearly
[01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:15.940]   Is github not blocked in china and maybe wordpress is that I don't know. That's a good question
[01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:22.180]   I was speculating but I just find the the github model for text for for sort of writing
[01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:26.180]   A fascinating idea and so i'm interested to see him experimenting. I went to look
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:28.820]   At his article and it
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:32.580]   I think it had only been up for an hour. There were already three pull requests
[01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:38.100]   And they were effectively typos that someone had noticed and uh and suggested a correction
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:41.300]   Um, I think that's it's a fascinating sort of
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:45.220]   exercise and distributed writing sort of peer to peer
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:52.340]   I've asked for how github could be used rautologically and and and I'd love to see this be a really interesting experiment in that
[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:56.260]   Well, and I and i'd like to see as it as it goes on, you know
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:59.460]   It's about a controversial topic. There's got to be lots of people interested
[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:02.020]   if if it could become a kind of
[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:04.820]   You know if people get add to it and and effectively
[01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:11.540]   Take it and change it and and and stretch it or or add new things to it the way you do when when it's software
[01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:13.620]   I just find it fascinating so
[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:17.700]   Hmm that is fascinating. Oh, I need and by the way, tommy flowers in the chat room
[01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:22.100]   Corrected me and said that the plural of lego is not legos
[01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:27.860]   It's lego and so uh, your facebook can apologize to the drag queens. I can apologize
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:30.260]   So the plastic yellow people and i'm very sorry about that
[01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:35.060]   It's like moose. It's it's singular and plural. I never heard that before
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:39.220]   Yeah, apparently it's true. I guess it has to be true. It's in the chat room
[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:46.980]   Uh, okay. So my my toy of the week is path talk now path talk is a messaging app that nobody uses
[01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:50.180]   And it's a pretty ordinary messaging app
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:53.700]   And there's no reason to use it except for the reason that they gave us this week
[01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:57.620]   And that reason is that they now have a new tab called places
[01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:02.340]   You go to the places tab and you select a business of any kind
[01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:07.620]   And then you ask them any question or ask for to make a reservation or something like that
[01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:12.340]   They say we'll get back to you in a few minutes and then they come back with an answer or whatever it is
[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:15.560]   And the way this works is this is a human powered
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.700]   concierge service
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:19.700]   They call the business
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:23.540]   They get the answer and then they chat you back as if they're the business. So here's an example
[01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:29.140]   I sent a uh text on this to the north coast brewing company tap uh their tap room
[01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:32.660]   I said, do you have l- do you have laginatus maximus on tap?
[01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:38.340]   A couple minutes later. I they got back to me and said hello. Sorry. We do not have a laginatus maximus
[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:42.660]   In case you'd like to try out our drinks. We're gonna be open till 9 p.m. Today. Have a great day
[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:48.980]   Uh, they so that's a human being that is a human being and so this this is especially great
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:53.700]   If if a business is going to have a long whole time or they're gonna give you the run around
[01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:56.260]   Sometimes you're gonna call a big department store and you have something in stock
[01:32:56.260 --> 01:33:00.980]   They have to go check and all that kind of they do all that stuff and then they come back to you with the answer
[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:03.940]   I don't you know, obviously this is a money losing proposition for path
[01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:05.460]   but
[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:09.140]   For those of us who want who want don't want to waste time. It's really fantastic
[01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:14.820]   So it's just called path talk. It's a human powered concierge service
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:17.940]   They also actually use a little bit of intelligence for example
[01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:23.460]   If you call to make a reservation and you say, you know, uh, can you make a reservation at so-and-so restaurant at seven o'clock
[01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:29.460]   And there's no availability they'll make the reservation for seven thirty and get back to you and say how about seven thirty?
[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:34.420]   I've made the reservation for seven thirty if you want it and if you say no, I don't want that then they'll go and cancel it or whatever
[01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:38.020]   But they actually have you know the real people who are making real decisions and
[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:45.380]   To it are those human beings that path employees so they are path employees who call the restaurant they
[01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:48.740]   My guess is that this is offshored and outsourced
[01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:52.580]   That just my guess because otherwise they'd be nuts to just have people, you know
[01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:58.500]   Uh sitting in New York City paying New York City rent and paying New York City, uh, whatever they effectively pay them to do this
[01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:03.140]   I believe so this is an acquisition act you acquisition by path
[01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:07.860]   I don't recall the name of the company offhand, but they acquired a company that did this and
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:12.340]   Apparently they're using it as a reason for you to go use their messaging service
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:18.340]   I don't know how long it'll last they also have in addition to using what is actually the four square database of of companies
[01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:22.260]   They're also augmenting it with their own and an interesting
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:26.100]   Experiment that I had was I asked for the the business hours
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:33.380]   And instantly I got back the posted business hours for that business and said oh they're posted hours or xyz
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:40.580]   They still contacted them to to verify that today's closing time was xyz and they got back to me with that information as well
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:47.540]   So they they have some out of automation. They have a database that's four squares and they also have their own database of information
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:50.100]   Really fantastic so far in my experimentation
[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:55.940]   It's been kind of thrilling to use because usually information like this is cumbersome to get
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:35:00.500]   And they they do it all so it's just a great it's a great thing and it's free
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:03.060]   But we know that humans don't scale
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:05.460]   That's right. They don't but that's my
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:09.700]   That's not my problem. Yeah, you're still around kids. Yeah, you're still around. Exactly. That's exactly right
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:13.780]   Well, you guys want to talk about anything else or should we close up the show? What do you think?
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:19.380]   Any other topics? This is a great show. Oh my god. Oh, show. I love the show
