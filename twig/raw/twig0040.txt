[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.440]   In which we cover all the ladies from Google and the cloud,
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.040]   joining us, I didn't expect it, but it's so exciting.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.000]   He's here.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.760]   He made it from the airport.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.200]   Are you JFK, LaGuardia?
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.240]   Where are you?
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.560]   I'm at Miami Airport.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.000]   Miami Airport, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.360]   And where are you flying, Jeff?
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.320]   Back home to Newark, as you can hear from a--
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.520]   Bob, I'll put it on mute now.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.920]   You're telling me what the time is.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.760]   So useful.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.560]   Oh, it's 3 o'clock.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.840]   You know where your flight is.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.040]   It's not late, it's late, it is.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.400]   So I thought you were on Howard Stern this morning.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.120]   That was on Monday.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.840]   I was about here to speak to Gucci.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.680]   To Gucci, the handbag manufacturer?
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.400]   I was hoping to leave some nice loafers, but didn't you?
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.000]   All right.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.160]   That's good to know.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.200]   I was on Stern on Monday.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.560]   We could talk about that in a few minutes.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.920]   I would love to.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.760]   And I also that spent a few hours with IBM about Lotus Notes.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.800]   Oh, cool.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.360]   That was your punishment, huh?
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.440]   Yes.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.720]   The price I paid.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.000]   The price he paid.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.720]   Also with us always glad to have Regina Tripani from Buzz--
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.240]   I'm sorry, smarterware.org.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.720]   And--
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.200]   Howdy.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.880]   Howdy.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.360]   And you're now working--
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.360]   was it--
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.840]   and Neil Dash's Enterprise.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.760]   Expert Labs, is that it?
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.720]   Expert Labs, yeah.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.960]   I'm working at Expert Labs, and I'm
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.600]   writing for a fast company.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.560]   Congratulations, by the way.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.080]   Oh, thank you.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.760]   One of the most influential women in tech.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.960]   She's in the Evangelists column.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.920]   Well, yeah.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.280]   I have.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.640]   I mean, I don't know if I'd put you in the Evangelist column,
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.840]   to be honest.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.880]   I was surprised by that, too.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.520]   But I'll take it.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.360]   Hey, it's a great list of some smart ladies.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.240]   I'm very honored to be on it.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.800]   But I guess I think that this counts as my evangelizing.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   Twig does.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.080]   Because you're really a developer.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.240]   I don't know if there was a developer category.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.920]   I don't see you as an evangelist for anything in particular.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.560]   I don't know.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.760]   A lot of people told me they bought an Nexus 1 because of me.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.320]   Oh, maybe you are.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.360]   I've joined Gina's religion.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.200]   Just by any Jeff, you were already there.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.920]   St. Gina.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.920]   St. Gina.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.200]   St. Gina of the Holy Android.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.240]   I think you're right.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.760]   Come to--
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.760]   Oh, God.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.240]   I'm recovering Catholic, please.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.960]   Our lady of open source.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.200]   Also here, also here.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.160]   We're really glad to have him.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.400]   He's the host of our Windows Weekly program,
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.440]   the editor in chief of the Super site for Windows,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.280]   WinSuperSight.com and news editor for Windows IT Pro,
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.800]   the author of Windows 7 Secrets.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.160]   Mr. Paul Therat.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.600]   Hey, Paul.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.200]   Hello.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.720]   How are you doing?
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.400]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.280]   We weren't sure if we were going to get Jeff in Miami.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.440]   So we brought Paul in to back us up.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.240]   I'm just going to play video games since Lee and me.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.760]   No, no, we need you.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.120]   You know why what prompted me is I got an email from somebody
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.640]   saying, well, I guess this week in Google isn't really
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.280]   a cloud computing show because you don't ever
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.080]   cover Microsoft's cloud initiatives.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.040]   It is this week in Google.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.480]   Well, we almost call it this week in cloud computing,
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.640]   or this week in the cloud.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.240]   But we thought--
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.800]   Twig doesn't sound as good as Twig, so--
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   Yeah, Twig.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.360]   They agree.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.800]   So--
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.520]   Can I derail this for one second?
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.960]   Would you please?
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.000]   There's a big palm announcement coming up at 5 o'clock.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Must be a sale, right?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.960]   No, I didn't hear that.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.120]   Is this-- I'm not sure if this is public yet.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.840]   Tell us.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.520]   Scoop it.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.760]   I'm not sure if I can.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.120]   How do you know about it?
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.480]   I got an email about it from the company that
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.680]   is announcing it.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.840]   That's not Paul?
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.320]   I didn't say that.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.320]   How many syllable--
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.160]   I'm not sure.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.280]   There's no accompanying--
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.200]   it doesn't say, hey, you can't talk about this.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.640]   But I'm not sure if I should--
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.640]   Shooray.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.140]   It's not--
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.120]   It doesn't say embargo.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.800]   You can say it.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.280]   Let me just--
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.120]   let me look.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.120]   Let me think.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.640]   It's OK.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.120]   So this is going to be an announcement.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.280]   You're buying a stolen phone from them?
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.760]   Really?
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.360]   No, I did not.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.200]   What is your guess?
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.440]   I don't want to pull a gawk or meteor.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.120]   No, no.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.640]   So when you see gawk or meteor's lawyers line,
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.280]   is it they didn't buy a phone?
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.920]   They bought the story.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.800]   They bought the story.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.920]   The phone just came with it.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.360]   We were just--
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.520]   in fact, they said these something even worse.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.120]   We took the phone so we could return it to Apple.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.080]   We bought the story.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.360]   That's so nicked that.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.160]   That's parsing it.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.600]   So do you think-- OK, so obviously somebody bought Palm.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.920]   I'm thinking HP.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.440]   That's a good guess.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.840]   Let's leave it at that.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.240]   OK, so he doesn't know if he can say it.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.760]   But that's really interesting.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.800]   What would HP want?
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.480]   It must be the patents.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.480]   It must HP is going to get in the phone business.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.160]   Does HP do the--
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.240]   HP already makes phones.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.200]   Yeah, they make Microsoft phones.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.080]   They do.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.040]   Yep.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.040]   Along with Dell now.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.400]   Or at least they used to.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.880]   They used to.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.400]   Yeah, it has been a while.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.840]   No, they do.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.440]   They still do.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.320]   They do.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.440]   Yeah, in fact, they still use that IPAC brand.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.040]   They still make IP-- oh, that's the old compact.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.840]   Yeah, they still use the brand.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.160]   Interesting.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.520]   So it must be a pure business phone.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.600]   Yes?
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   I don't know.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.560]   I don't know.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.560]   Here it is.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.560]   It is searching--
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.080]   Oh, you mean the existing phone?
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.600]   Yes.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.240]   Yes, Leo.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.880]   That phone is a pure business.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.800]   And it's running Windows Mobile 6.5?
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.640]   I bet it is not.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.600]   It's pretty old.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.080]   6.5, yeah.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.480]   The glisten.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.840]   HP glisten.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.680]   Sure.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.560]   That is just a terrible name.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.040]   But it looks like a BlackBerry phone, I have to say.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.840]   The glisten.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.480]   That could be a Palm phone.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.720]   I could see them putting WebOS on there.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.200]   Could this be the kind of--
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.200]   No, no.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.000]   I'm sure they're going to go with the existing devices
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.560]   and so forth.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.000]   Anyway, sorry about that.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.960]   I got a little spazz attack there.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.760]   You can say it now.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.880]   Engadget has published the story HP buys Palm.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.920]   They don't believe in Embargoes.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.280]   There you go.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.800]   Well, HP doesn't say anything about Embargo.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.240]   Holy-- holy-- holy moly.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.040]   HP is announced as acquiring Palm, too.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.640]   You want to guess the number, Jeff Jarvis?
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.320]   You're the number guy.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.320]   $1.2 billion.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.840]   No idea.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.560]   Absolutely no idea.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.600]   $5.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.720]   $1.2 billion, which works out to $5.70 a share.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.840]   The deal closes July 31, which marks
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.920]   the end of HP's third fiscal quarter.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.960]   Current Palm CEO John Rubenstein is expected to remain
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.360]   with the company.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.160]   Press release just came out.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:16.640]   It did.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.160]   More details at 5 PM and Paul, you scooped it.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.440]   That's great.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.880]   We practically beat Engadget.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.480]   I love this.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.960]   I love this Wednesday schedule.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.520]   It's great.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.280]   We actually have news.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.560]   That's happening as we talk.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.760]   It's real time.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.040]   The chat room says-- we told you about this 20 minutes ago.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.240]   Losers.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.760]   If you would just read the chat room, Leo,
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.120]   you would know everything.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.840]   All right, all right, all right, all right.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.200]   I'm trying to do a show here.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.640]   Do you mind?
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.600]   I do look at the chat room.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.440]   So by the way, this is not the only acquisition
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.160]   that broke today.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.520]   Apple has announced that it's buying Siri, which
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.280]   is an Apple iPhone app.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.840]   It's quite impressive.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.640]   It's a voice app, voice-enabled app.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.120]   But you could do things like make me a dinner date
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.480]   or get me tickets to the show.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.320]   It understands.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.120]   It does a search.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.920]   Siri apparently has an API that some sites work with.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.200]   And if it works with those sites,
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.000]   then Siri will act as almost a personal assistant.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.240]   It's a very interesting acquisition for Apple.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.440]   So this was the day to spend money.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.960]   Did Google buy anything today?
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.400]   I don't think so.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.120]   Not that I know of.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.200]   Shocking.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.320]   So Siri is an iPhone app.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.200]   And they bought it?
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.480]   They bought it.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.080]   What's the kind of-- what's the state of voice input
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.280]   on the iPhone right now?
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.840]   It's not as far along as Android.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.000]   There isn't a microphone on every--
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.400]   You don't get the transcription.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.320]   They have-- there is a Dragon dictate on the iPhone.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.600]   If you don't get the same thing you get with Android 2,
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.360]   one where you have every time you see a keyboard,
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.080]   you could dictate.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.880]   No.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.040]   But Google, of course, has its app on the iPhone.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.640]   And so all the Google app--
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.640]   that Google search stuff is all there.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.200]   Voice search stuff.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:58.560]   OK.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.440]   Siri is only 3GS, right?
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.280]   And I've--
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:01.800]   I've talked--
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.160]   I'm probably this the case.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:04.960]   Let me look here.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.440]   It says, remember, Siri's confirmed an interview with PC
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.400]   magazine?
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.120]   They filed with the FTC for an early termination request.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.080]   That is, I guess, to fast track regulatory approval.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.680]   Siri launched in February.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.320]   I mean, it's a pretty new product.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.720]   It's a natural language iPhone app.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.120]   You type or speak into the phone with a natural language
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.520]   request, such as book me a table at 730 tonight for 2.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.880]   But you'll fernio.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.760]   Or find out where Avatar is playing in 3D in my office.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.120]   If I had an iPhone here, which I do not, I would show you.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.640]   It's actually really impressive.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.760]   Is this the first app, like iPhone app,
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.840]   that Apple has purchased from a third party that we know of?
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.340]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.080]   Well, this is like a Twitter moment, isn't it?
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.680]   It is kind of like a Twitter moment.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.040]   According to altimeters Michael Gartenberg, an analyst,
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.400]   he says he believes Apple will tightly integrate Siri
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.280]   and that the deal erased the advantage Google's Android
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.560]   offers with its tightly coupled search.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.080]   Be interested.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.520]   That makes sense.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.080]   If you put it everywhere in iPhone 4,
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.640]   then you absolutely have parity.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.560]   Yeah, because that is one of the things, right?
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.640]   That Android offers just voice to text everywhere.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.200]   So it makes sense.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:21.760]   It's one of the things.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.360]   So people ask me, why do you use an XS1?
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.520]   It's the most the first thing I say.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.760]   It's because I can dictate SMS.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.160]   I can dictate anywhere.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:28.760]   Yep.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.760]   Or is this more against local and 4 square and all that?
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.560]   It has that application as well.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.720]   I mean, it's natural language.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.920]   It's location based.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.080]   It's very smart.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.280]   Siri is quite impressive.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.000]   People like Robert Skow will have said many times,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.960]   this is a game changer, Siri.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.640]   Interesting acquisition.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.840]   And the local stuff, is it using APIs?
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.240]   Or is it doing all the local stuff itself?
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.000]   It's my understanding that it's not doing scraping.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.480]   I might be doing some scraping, but that in most cases,
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.400]   it works best if it's talking to a site like 777 film
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.240]   or whatever, that understands a Siri request
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.560]   and will hand it back the right information.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.080]   I see.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.840]   So for instance, OpenTable works very well with--
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.640]   so if you do dinner reservation,
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.160]   OpenTable and Siri have a language
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.440]   that they can talk back and forth on.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:23.960]   I love it.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.200]   It works really well.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   And it's also a beautiful UI.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.320]   It's a very intriguing UI that takes something
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.680]   that's pretty difficult to understand and use
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.560]   and makes it fairly simple by giving you
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.360]   a lot of examples and so forth.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.680]   It's on the iPad too, Leo.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.920]   Oh, yeah, I should probably--
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.680]   Kevin, I'm playing on it.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.360]   --I could show it on the iPad, of course.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.920]   I hate to remind you of your toy.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.880]   I have this.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.360]   I have this.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:46.800]   Who is my point?
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.400]   You forget, you even have it.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.920]   It just integrated into my life.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.440]   Oh, Paul's going to hate me in a minute.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.080]   Paul's-- no, I'm sorry.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.120]   He's playing modern warfare too.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.080]   We're safe.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.280]   Paul, are you there?
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.880]   Sorry, I was running up a little blog post about this HP thing.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.560]   OK, go ahead.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.280]   Please do that.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.080]   It's a big story.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.560]   It's breaking.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.360]   You're still making cat sounds in your iPad.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.000]   Did I miss--
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.120]   You missed nothing.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.360]   You know, this is a good question.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.440]   Do I have Siri on here?
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:13.760]   I don't.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.600]   I think I took it off, so I will install it right now.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.560]   I took off a lot of non-native iPad apps,
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.480]   because I just don't like that little interface.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.440]   But I'll put Siri on here.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.560]   We can play with it.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.720]   Meanwhile, other stories in the Googleverse--
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.600]   you said there are a lot of small stories.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.040]   There are a couple of small stories.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.200]   They launched Google Earth integration with Google Maps
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.480]   this week.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.440]   So there's a browser plugin that you install at Mac or Windows.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.880]   And you get Google Earth views in Google Maps.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.480]   It's pretty neat.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.560]   That's cool.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.800]   Yeah, it is pretty neat.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:54.440]   So how is that different from the satellite view?
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.600]   It's got that Google Earth feeling to it.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.000]   Actually, that's a really good question.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.760]   It's similar to the satellite view.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.680]   Does it support KML?
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.520]   That also is a good question.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.440]   So you go to earth@google.com/plugin.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.520]   You can install the plugin.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.920]   And let's see.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.120]   Oh, they've got a couple of cool little demos here.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.880]   Well, let's take a look.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.960]   It's a web browser plugin that lets you navigate and explore--
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.480]   oh, I see.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.720]   Yeah, there is a big difference there,
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.440]   because you have that 3D--
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.960]   Yeah, the 3D building experience.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.720]   That's very cool.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.120]   A lot of people have used Google Sketchup to design--
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.680]   you go to New York City now.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.480]   Almost all the buildings are 3D.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.080]   Yep.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.040]   And so when you have the plugin installed,
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.200]   you get a little button on the upper right-hand side.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.320]   There's like map satellite.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.440]   And then there's an Earth option, which is pretty neat.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.640]   And it's just kind of like the Google Earth experience
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.520]   in maps with that 3D.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.280]   Works on Chrome, IE7, Firefox, and Flock on Windows.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.000]   Does not work in Chrome on OS X, just Safari and Firefox
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.200]   on OS X.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:03.920]   And you can do that thing.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.120]   You can pan kind of--
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.880]   if you hold down the shift key and click and drag,
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.720]   you can pan kind of like horizontally.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.320]   So I'm not describing that one.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:16.840]   Yes.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.360]   I'm in the hat right now.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.840]   You could change the angle.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.000]   Yeah, you could change the angle.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.400]   You could do that with Street View, though, too, can't you now?
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.160]   I can't remember.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.880]   It's all merging together into one big thing.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.480]   It is.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.600]   It is.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.640]   Let me show you real quickly.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:38.320]   I can show you Siri because I've installed it now on the iPad.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.120]   So there it is.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.200]   And unfortunately, you can see this
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.760]   is why I took it off in the first place.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:50.280]   It does ask immediately if it can use your location data.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.120]   I think I'll have to log into my Siri account.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.120]   So I'll show you some more of that in a second.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.120]   Let's see.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.320]   Hi, I'm Siri, your new personal assistant.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.480]   Please tap to get started, just a sec.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.320]   So you do have an online account.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:11.320]   Or they verify-- I guess they verify your--
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.640]   I remember this took a little while before.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.720]   Maybe they save your information in the cloud.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.560]   So funny typing on this giant keyboard, this giant iPhone
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.560]   keyboard on an iPad.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.320]   It's just-- you feel like you're in Toy Town.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.080]   Oh, it's already registered.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.720]   Yes, this is my address.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.120]   OK, let's see.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.200]   First we're going to talk about why you uninstalled me.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.840]   Yeah, right.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.840]   One of the attributes of natural language
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.600]   is I have a feelings.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.960]   And you hurt my feelings badly when you took me off your iPhone.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:58.120]   All right, I guess I have to do this whole thing
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.320]   to reset my password.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.080]   Well, we'll worry about this later.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.720]   But it's a really cool app.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.760]   And you can see that it's doing some really interesting UI
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.920]   stuff that is not typically Apple kind of a UI stuff.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.760]   Let's see.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.440]   I think you raised an important point.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.160]   Is Apple now going to start buying apps?
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.560]   Apple time is--
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.680]   I don't know what time it is.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.280]   I just want to know that local time is 430.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.320]   Why do they do that?
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.400]   Why do they do that?
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.880]   People wear watches.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.200]   I don't understand.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.640]   Yeah, I mean, it's just interesting to me
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.520]   that they bought an iPhone app.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.600]   They're very interesting.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.000]   I mean, it kind of gives a goal.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.520]   iPhone app developers can have a new goal.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.360]   Apple acquire.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.160]   Right, let's get bought out by Apple.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:40.960]   Exactly.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.920]   I'm playing around with this Google Earth and Maps.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.600]   And it's really cool.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.680]   It does that thing where Earth zoos out.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.600]   You see the whole planet.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.280]   And then it kind of rotates around the place you want to go.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.920]   I went from Brooklyn to San Francisco.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.160]   And you have the kind of a full rich Earth experience
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.360]   right in Maps.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.800]   And it's in the browser.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.120]   And it's in the browser.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.880]   But you do need the extra plug-in, which is just
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.040]   this extra step, installation step.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.440]   The other neat geo thing that came out
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.840]   is the Android Sky Map, which is an Android app that you kind of--
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.640]   and I think there's something like this available
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.320]   for the iPhone as well.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.360]   You launch the app and you kind of point it up to the sky.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.520]   And it shows you the constellations
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.560]   as you move like these in your location.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.960]   Which is pretty neat.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:26.280]   And mobile Firefox, Fennec, is available pre-alpha for Android
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.200]   right now.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.600]   Is that going to be better than the built-in?
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.560]   Right now, it is definitely not.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.680]   It's a huge download.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.320]   And it crashes on my Nexus One.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.680]   It's very, very pre-alpha.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.480]   It's like pre-nightly built even.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.840]   But it's kind of neat to see.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.840]   I have some nostalgic feelings about Firefox.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.360]   I love Firefox, even though Chrome is getting
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.240]   to be increasingly the more attractive choice,
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.040]   because it's just so fast.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.880]   I love Chrome.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.200]   Chrome is getting better.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.200]   But of course, we don't have all the plug-ins.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.880]   One reason Chrome is better.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.680]   Right.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.160]   I mean, which browser do you guys use full time right now?
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.000]   Chrome or Firefox?
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.480]   Chrome here.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.080]   Paul, are you a Chrome guy?
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.920]   Yeah, I am a Chrome guy.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.440]   It's just so fast.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.040]   It's so speedy.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.960]   And Firefox is just--
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.840]   I use Firefox for years.
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.040]   But this is no comparison.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.040]   It's just gotten--
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.040]   It's turned into a gig.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:16.560]   A little bloaty.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.880]   A little bloaty.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.720]   And partly, I think that's kind of doing it a little bit
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:25.880]   of a disservice, because it's all the plug-ins that we use
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.600]   that make it bloaty.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.560]   OK, so here we go.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.760]   So now this is Google Maps in the browser
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.360]   with the plug-in installed.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.360]   And so what's going to happen here is what I--
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.840]   OK.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.520]   It's definitely--
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.760]   Oh, it's definitely more Google Earth-y, isn't it?
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.440]   Yes.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.160]   It's super 3D.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.560]   Was it even very well with Street View?
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.200]   Boy, I don't know.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:52.720]   Let me see.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.800]   It doesn't look like the Street View peg man.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.480]   Usually you see the yellow peg man.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.040]   He doesn't seem to even be an option.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.400]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.280]   So you have-- it just adds a tab.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.440]   So you've got map.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.320]   You've got satellite.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.120]   And now I have an Earth tab.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.680]   And it did kind of look the same.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.600]   But notice it did a little angling thing.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.080]   Ooh.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.080]   Yeah, hold down the shift key and click and drag.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.080]   And you can change your angle.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.920]   Ooh.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.520]   There we go.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.520]   That's like the Earth.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.120]   Now, if I were actually somewhere where people had mapped
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.120]   buildings--
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.800]   There's a lot going off.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.840]   The Titanic is listed as a location on the left side.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.720]   Is it?
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.560]   Yeah, click on it.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.040]   Let's go to the Titanic.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.000]   I didn't even know.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.440]   Oh, this is the underwater stuff.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.400]   So funny.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:36.900]   Yeah.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.800]   Does it be on the water stuff?
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.040]   Titanic ditch, Colorado, is that it?
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.840]   Titanic.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.600]   Oh, dear.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.240]   I mean, you're getting the Titanic on your left side?
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.160]   Yeah, let's go.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.000]   I've got the Matterhorn.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.200]   Oh, it's random, I see.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.200]   It's random, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.280]   Gateway Arch Hoover Dam, CN Tower, Niagara Falls, Colosseum,
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.200]   Titanic, Atlantic Ocean.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:56.680]   Let's go.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.320]   We're going to go visit the Titanic, kids.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.000]   Yeah, so it does that zoom out and then zooms you in.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.080]   [ZOOMING]
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.280]   Oh, boy.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.200]   Oh, oh.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.040]   Going underwater.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.000]   I hope you got your aqua lung on.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.240]   Oh, look.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.640]   Wow, there's two halves.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.880]   That is amazing.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.380]   OK.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:13.880]   It's pretty neat.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.440]   That is freaking cool.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.520]   It's really neat.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.200]   Can I zoom in on it?
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.200]   I guess I can.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.560]   Oh, man.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.200]   Can I go in the windows?
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.200]   Wow.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.000]   That's kind of eerie.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.080]   Yeah, it is.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:30.480]   It is.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.600]   And it's kind of brown and split in half.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   But it's neat to just click on a place and zoom out
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.800]   and fly over to it.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.680]   Yeah, wouldn't that be a great way,
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.680]   Jeff, instead of sitting in the Miami airport,
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.000]   just click and go.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.480]   Just tell me about me.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.360]   Imagine I'm home.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.440]   Just go.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.320]   Click and go.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.400]   Here's the Tower Bridge in London.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.480]   Yeah, I think this is a nice addition.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.200]   And here's a 3D.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.720]   Somebody's done a sketch up 3D of the Tower Bridge.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.680]   So it's like a pop-up.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.320]   It's very slick.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.000]   It's fun.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.240]   All the time that I've wasted in Google Earth,
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.160]   I could avoid it because I had to launch a whole nother
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:07.660]   program.
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.960]   But now I can just waste time flying around the globe.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.960]   Right in my browser.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.560]   Great.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.640]   Another way to kill time.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.840]   Thank you, Google.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.960]   What would we ever have done without the Google?
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.360]   So while we're on maps, they've gone nutty in Germany
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.760]   again on Street View.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.680]   One city in Germany is not only are they
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.640]   requiring that they hash out faces and license plates
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.480]   on public streets, but also they want to put up public notices
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.920]   before they get there.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.640]   So we're coming to your town.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.960]   We're going to take pictures.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.920]   Just beware if you want to stay out of it.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.400]   Hi, Jose.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.640]   Just a grandma inside.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.440]   Yeah, she said, not to be seen.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.680]   Well, talking about privacy, Gina,
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.800]   you wrote an excellent article.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.200]   In fact, an article I've been sending to people,
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.760]   time to audit your Facebook privacy settings.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.400]   Here's how this is a fast company article by Gina Trapani.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.880]   Was it difficult for you to figure out what to set
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.640]   and what not to set?
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.920]   I mean, the big issue is-- and you point this out--
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.280]   when you go to Yelp or Pandora or docs.com,
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.320]   you get this bar at the top that says, hey, Gina,
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:13.480]   Yelp is using Facebook to personalize your experience.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.640]   And you have to click no thanks to opt out.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.200]   It's opt out.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.120]   It's opt out versus opt in.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.240]   But worse than that, because your friends can still
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.840]   reveal information about you.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.640]   Yes.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.880]   I had this interesting experience this week.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.880]   Some friends on Facebook friends with my nephew, who's 14 or so.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.560]   And he liked a friend of his status updates,
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.360]   a friend who I don't have access to.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.280]   But because my nephew liked it, I could see that status update.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.920]   And this whole conversation between all these 13
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.720]   to 15-year-old boys and girls, which I was certainly not
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.480]   meant to see.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.400]   And clearly, this was not meant for an adult to see.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.840]   And it was because his friend had never
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.640]   changed the default setting, which is that my friends,
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.880]   even if my profile, parts of my profile,
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.200]   are set to friends only access, my friends
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.840]   can share certain things, like photos, like status updates.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.320]   And that's the default.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.800]   Even if you set your profile to private,
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.360]   there's still this other privacy settings panel
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.760]   that you have to go in and say, my friends can't share
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.800]   information about me either.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:23.080]   And then it says, are you sure allowing instant personalization
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.800]   will give you a richer experience as you browse the web?
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.840]   If you opt out, you will have to manually activate
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.400]   these experiences.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.000]   Please keep in mind, if you opt out,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.560]   your friends may still share public Facebook information
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.960]   about you, at least they tell you this.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.480]   And then--
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.520]   At least they tell you.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.480]   And then you have to go and check it again and say, block it.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.000]   Yes.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.960]   And that's easy now because there's only three of them.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.440]   Right.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.880]   But what if there's 1,000 of them?
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.640]   This is the thing.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.120]   As Facebook adds more partners, you either have to opt out.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.280]   Each one individually?
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.280]   Or is there a global opt out?
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.640]   There isn't a global opt out.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.080]   Each one individually.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.560]   You know, I used your global--
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.080]   you did recommend a global opt out solution.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.640]   And I did it.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.240]   Did you really--
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.200]   I have deactivated my Facebook account.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.600]   And what I did on-- now, by the way, deactivating is kind of--
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.240]   it's not very committed because all you have to do
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.640]   is log back in with your password.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.880]   And it suddenly comes alive again.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.240]   Yes.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.840]   Well, that's what's so interesting, right?
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.600]   They make it difficult for you to just close your account.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.440]   It's not just closing your account and everything's gone.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.440]   There's deactivating it where they'll just hold on to all your data
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.040]   for you just in case you can just fine.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:33.600]   You might change your--
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.320]   And then there's full on the lead.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.800]   And there are two different places to do those things.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.680]   So I feel like Facebook goes out of its way
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.920]   to make things confusing and hard to find
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.400]   so that it forces the defaults on you.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.280]   Well, and the guilt trip they lay on you when you deactivate--
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.920]   have you deactivated?
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.360]   Yes.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.000]   So right.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.320]   When you hit deactivate, it shows you pictures
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.760]   of all your friends' faces saying, like, Leo's
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.600]   going to miss you.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.800]   He's going to miss you.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.480]   Adam's going to miss you.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.800]   I was appalled.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.000]   It was amazing.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.360]   You don't want to quit.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.640]   It made me want to quit more.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.360]   I'm trying to leave AOL in the day.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:12.880]   Right.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.880]   Seriously.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.000]   I mean, and I have to say, this is not an easy decision.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.280]   And one of the reasons I didn't delete, but I deactivated.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.560]   And I said, my last status update on both my private and personal--
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.800]   my private and public Facebook account was,
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.600]   I am deactivating my account pending until I understand
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.360]   what the privacy implications of all this
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.080]   are I'm deactivating my account.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.200]   But-- and so it's kind of nice that I don't have to delete
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.800]   everything.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:39.680]   But I don't know.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.880]   I'm really thinking--
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.200]   You know, after our last show, Leo,
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.840]   I blogged that if you can't figure this out, you know.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.400]   How can anybody figure it out?
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.480]   It's really complex.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.440]   And it struck me that one--
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.680]   I remember the old Seinfeld Bizarro episode.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.200]   What I want is a Bizarro version of this where I hold identity
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.880]   stuff, I publish it, and I give permission to Facebook to use it.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.360]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.600]   It's called Opt-In.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.120]   Right.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:05.640]   It's called Opt-In.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.440]   This was the reverse.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.880]   It's the-- I'm the host of my identity.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.920]   Right.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:09.720]   Yes, that's right.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.240]   I store it, and I give you permission, Facebook.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.080]   But Facebook is saying, yeah, that's exactly what we're doing.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.360]   You store it with us.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.560]   Of course, we have access to it.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.840]   And then you give other sites permission to access
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.160]   what we know about you.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.760]   That's what's going on with Pandora with Yelp.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.960]   It's so complex.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.560]   There's a site I can't find right now that I got.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.480]   There was a Twitter like, Timmy, you know where Facebook is touching you.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.360]   And it was just a little thing that would show you what Facebook shows
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:36.880]   the world.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.440]   It's awkward because you have to click on every single possible file and link.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.920]   And I'll try to find it on the front feed later.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.320]   But it's interesting.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.280]   We need that.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:46.960]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.840]   It's zesty.ca/facebook.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.600]   The Amazing St. Gina.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.440]   That's a great site.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.440]   No, I love that.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:53.960]   You shall find.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.560]   So here it is.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.600]   Are you sure you wanted to activate your account?
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.360]   Justine will miss you.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.080]   Rodrigo will miss you.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.360]   Nick will miss you.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.440]   Gary will miss you.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.280]   Tony will miss you.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.200]   They'll no longer be able to keep in touch with you.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.840]   It's as if if you leave Facebook, you don't exist.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.160]   Keep this account or will kill this dog.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.120]   And then after you say I have a privacy concern, it says, please remember,
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.360]   you can always control the information you share and you can see it.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.840]   Before you deactivate, please take a moment
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.440]   to learn more about how privacy works on Facebook.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.240]   You can smart me.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.560]   And then this is the other thing.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:33.160]   Even after you deactivate, your friends can still invite you to events, tag you in photos
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.640]   or ask you to join groups.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.720]   If you opt out, you will not receive.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.760]   So in other words, I've deactivated, but still I live on on Facebook.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.840]   I still have an account in effect until I delete that account.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.320]   Well, I don't want to get emails.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.160]   I don't want to know what they're doing with my image and so forth.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.280]   And then you have to confirm your password.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.600]   The best thing to do at this point would be to change it to something I don't know.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.240]   Then you have to do this.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.520]   Like we don't want a robot to deactivate you.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:08.960]   So you have to do a capture.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.720]   What the hell word is that?
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.720]   Uranium.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.720]   Uranium.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.720]   Really?
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.720]   You are a and you and Uranium.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.720]   Yes, it is.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.720]   Uranium.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   She's thank you.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.720]   I needed some help.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.720]   Crowds sorts.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.920]   Crowds sorts the capture.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:25.800]   And now, by the way, it's going to think for a really long time because I have 5,000 friends
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.280]   and it actually took like an hour.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.800]   It's ridiculous.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:36.400]   So zesty.ca/facebook.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.920]   And there's also a great new post on LifeHacker as long as we're talking about this.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.880]   But what Facebook publicly publishes about you?
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.440]   Yeah, that's the site.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.720]   That goes to this site.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.200]   So okay, so the LifeHacker site is going to this site.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.840]   So any information you see below is visible.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.200]   If you put in you, it probably won't work because you're now a lot visible, right?
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.200]   Oh, I hope so.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.360]   Well, let's find out.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.960]   So where do I enter it here?
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.960]   Yep.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.960]   Okay.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   Yep.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.960]   That's the...
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.120]   Now as a public person, oh good, data empty.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.440]   I love that.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.440]   That's good news.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.160]   I'm putting my name in there, Steve.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.160]   Are you still acting?
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.160]   You can immediately.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.360]   And is it with a space?
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.040]   Gina Tupani or is it awesome?
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.960]   No, just one word.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.040]   Okay, name.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.080]   So what do I click one of these?
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.480]   Oh yeah, look at all this stuff.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.040]   Yeah, so one of these can show.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.040]   Oh, baby.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.720]   Look at that.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.720]   So I don't know what to do.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.320]   Now this is a connection.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.480]   So these are some activities.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.920]   So this just goes, this is using the API to get this data.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.920]   Right, right, exactly.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.640]   Oh, calls to stream exceeded the rate of 100 calls.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.640]   She's doing that right now.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.640]   Everyone's doing it right now, yeah.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.360]   Let's also get your Gina.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.960]   We still have the API.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.960]   We broke it.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.920]   We broke it.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.400]   So that's copying the E.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.400]   But I mean, that's...
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.160]   Shouldn't Facebook provide just that?
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.640]   Facebook should say, should be...
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.880]   If Facebook wants to be the guardian of our identity, then they should be the guardian
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.360]   of our identity and act that way not as the sleazy...
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.600]   I don't know, sleazy's a little strong.
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.600]   Smarmy.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.920]   You know, like auto salesmen.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.960]   We're actually like now.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:25.440]   They do have that like view your profile as this person would see it button at some point
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.840]   in the profile editing process.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.680]   So I give them that so you can see what other people would see.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.160]   But the thing is, is that I was talking to a friend of mine about this, is like all
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.000]   of us geeks who are concerned about privacy and know what the implications are.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.800]   Like we're going to go through all those privacy panel settings and check up our...
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.800]   But you know, 15 or...
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:47.320]   The young kids aren't going to stick with the defaults and just keep chatting with their
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.320]   friends, defaults matter.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.320]   Yeah, they're just too responsible.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.640]   Is there one is the default and understanding that.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:57.760]   And the second is, I think that there's an opportunity for Facebook to say, we're going
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.280]   to help you with your identity throughout the web.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.280]   But now I don't trust them to do that.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.280]   Right.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.280]   Exactly.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.920]   Paul, what do you think about all this?
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:12.720]   This is a tough one for me because I use Facebook, my family's on Facebook.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.960]   I feel like you guys, I feel like they're not doing enough.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.440]   In fact, I think they are actively working to make it hard to configure things like privacy.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.280]   I cannot believe the controls that are in there.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.560]   And even I have struggled with them.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.880]   And as you guys were going through the site, I was using the same thing looking at mine.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:31.040]   And you know, I'm pretty transparent about myself, but you know, my wife's on there,
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.200]   my kids on there.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:38.280]   I just forwarded that link to my wife to say, let's make sure everyone's on the right page
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.280]   here.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.280]   But do you think you'll be a backlash?
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.440]   Yeah, I hope so.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.080]   I mean, you know, because increasingly this is the way that people get in touch with other
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.080]   people.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.240]   I mean, I had dinner with college friends of mine.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.520]   I haven't seen it over 20 years because of Facebook.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:58.480]   So I recognize the value, but yeah, I mean, it's scary and it's confusing.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.600]   I mean, to me, it's confusing.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.880]   I went in, I was just looking at my Facebook settings once again, and I find myself instantly
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.640]   bewildered to the point where I don't even want to look at it.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.640]   It's so confusing.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.920]   You know, interesting.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.320]   They do a bad job.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.680]   Here's a cynical question.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:22.400]   Do you think that that's intentional or do you think that the push to give so much control
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.440]   led them down there?
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.480]   I think it's a maturity.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:31.560]   You know, I think it's just an immature service from young guys that don't have a lot of industry
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.560]   background.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.560]   I'm more cynical.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.480]   I think they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.040]   I like in this to Apple.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:42.240]   Apple does what it does and can have very much the same.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.160]   And they have two justifications.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.400]   If you know, we're doing this to make it convenient for you.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.720]   Really makes the web more friendly place.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.000]   All these connections are valuable.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.680]   And that is true.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.560]   But it also has this huge benefit to us.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.920]   And I think Apple's done a very good job of saying, "We're going to do what's good for
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.520]   us, but here's why it's good for you too."
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.520]   And...
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:11.360]   Elio, when I went to spend time with these guys from IBM and Lotus, which is as I said,
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.600]   it was my price for getting on the Howard Stern Show.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:20.040]   What struck me was that they did all the integration with all these internet things
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.040]   that we want.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:27.200]   To do that, they had to basically recreate the internet at all its applications.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.200]   But what impressed me, you really do get over your identity, who sees it in what way, and
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.200]   so on.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.960]   And it made me wishful for how that should work on the internet.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:45.280]   And it doesn't now because we have these folks who are trying to scam us, I think.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.800]   How was that, by the way, doing Howard Stern?
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   Was that fun?
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.800]   You'd never been in the studio.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.880]   Many, many, many times.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.880]   I've been on the phone a lot.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.080]   I've never been in the studio, and I was in the studio, and he asked me what I was up
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.880]   to next, and I said a book about privacy, I hope.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.680]   And then we got into it, and suddenly next...
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.000]   I knew I was still on the story of prostate cancer.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   So...
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   You're telling about...
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   You're revealing too much.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.600]   But you know, I think it's really good.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:17.200]   See, here's an opportunity, Jeff, because if somebody like Howard Stern starts saying,
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:23.480]   "Facebook's gone too far, that carries so much more weight than if we say it."
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.480]   People listen to him.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.480]   Teenage.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.480]   Listen to him.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.080]   There's a weird thing in the text industry too about sour grapes.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.000]   I mean, I'm a Microsoft guy, Gene, is a Google person.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.200]   I mean, so we're complaining about Facebook.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.200]   You're an Apple guy.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.200]   Right.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.840]   I mean, unfortunately, people tend to see us in the scope of that.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:45.920]   So obviously, of course, we hate Facebook because we want this other thing to win, you
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.920]   know, whatever that would be.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.480]   And that's not the case at all.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.480]   No, no, no, no.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.480]   I use Facebook.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.560]   And like I said, I recognize the value, but I am a little freaked by it.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.120]   You know, I think part of the issue with Facebook too is that it started out as a service that
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.840]   was by default, everything was private, right?
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.440]   You had to have a college, you know, a .edu email address.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.320]   You had to sign in to see anything.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.080]   I mean, it was mostly...
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.080]   Mostly everything was private.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.280]   And then it became...
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.320]   Then more information became public.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.320]   And that's wrong.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.160]   I mean, so nothing's wrong.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.000]   It's just that's the way that you freak out users.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.520]   You can't start with things being private and then make them public unless they change
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.520]   settings.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.320]   If you offer a service from which everything is public and then you can often make that
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.000]   stuff private, it's a different story.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.200]   It's kind of like how you can lower prices and not upset people, but you can't raise
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.200]   them, you know?
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.200]   Right.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.640]   Well, Facebook's got a difficult challenge.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.040]   This is the narrative as I see it.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:44.120]   So you know, this young guy, Mark Zuckerberg, basically wants to get late.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.720]   So he's in college.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.200]   He's a college sophomore.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.600]   And he can't meet girls because he's a nerd.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:58.000]   So he creates the Facebook, which is essentially a site where he hopes he can get Harvard girls
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.920]   to enter information on so he can Mac on them.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.440]   And you know what?
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.440]   It's viral.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.440]   It goes viral.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.440]   Why does it go viral?
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.520]   Because everybody wants to put their information on there so they can Mac on each other.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.400]   They're college kids.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.000]   So he suddenly gets this notion.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.600]   He suddenly realizes, wait a minute, this is hugely valuable.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.640]   By the way, I didn't get it until I really kind of thought about it.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:28.840]   He's created a platform where I am incentive to give them all, you know, just to bear all.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.840]   And I get a payout.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.440]   If you're a college kid, I get a payout.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.680]   Now even we as adults, we've found there's a payout because we meet old friends.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.800]   We couldn't connect with them.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.680]   There's these huge payouts.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.760]   So there's an exchange going on.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.040]   I give them all my information.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.120]   Facebook says, now we'll only reveal it to those people.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.800]   You say you want it revealed to.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.360]   Okay, I feel comfortable then.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.880]   It's not super private, but at least, you know, I have some control over it.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.800]   And I get this great payout.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.880]   But now Facebook says, oh, wow, look at this.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.240]   We got all this great information.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.400]   This is this is a gold mine if we could just give this to advertisers.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.320]   So they kind of give it to advertisers.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.200]   See, you know, we'll give it to third party marketers.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.200]   We'll protect it.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.760]   Oh, because there's, because there's gold at the end of that rainbow.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:20.560]   And now all of a sudden Facebook saying, holy cow, we have a bigger goal.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.560]   This is a huge goal.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.560]   Mine.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.560]   The more that we can get, the more we can sell.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.840]   That's where they come up with beacon.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.920]   They get shut down a little bit.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:28.920]   Okay.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:29.920]   Okay.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.920]   We'll back off.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.360]   Now they say, well, what about open graph?
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.560]   Now we get everybody, not even, you know, now we got everybody on Facebook.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:39.000]   We, how do we get them to give us more information about where they go, what they like, what
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.240]   they search for?
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.120]   Look at Google, they're getting all this great search information.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.960]   How can we get that stuff?
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:48.000]   And they come up with open graph, which is just another way to pipe your information
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.520]   into Facebook so they can give it to marketers.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.920]   I think it all makes perfect sense.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:57.200]   Is that narrative seem, seem like even more than that Leo, I think it's right.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:02.240]   And I also think that we see, you know, Google causes four billion clicks a month to publishers,
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:07.880]   bitly two billion Facebook God knows how many I think we see that the human link becomes
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.280]   more powerful soon than search.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.640]   It really is a win against Google.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:18.920]   Is Google somehow better than Facebook in this regard?
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.520]   I don't know why I trust Google more.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:26.160]   I mean, but it doesn't seem like, well, what about Google buzz?
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.320]   You know, well, buzz made a screw up.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.760]   Yeah, buzz made a screw up.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.160]   It wasn't of the same nature.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.800]   It wasn't to me, everything Facebook does is a cynical attempt to get more of my information
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.240]   so they can sell it.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.280]   And buzz, you know, went head over heels to try to fix it in the weekend, realizing,
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.120]   oops, we mix the public and private.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.120]   That was a mistake.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.120]   Right.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:53.760]   Is Google's business model somehow inherently more less intrusive though?
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.360]   I mean, they're not, I don't give them information willingly.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.880]   I mean, they kind of follow me around by my searches.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.840]   In all this discussion, I was tweeting about it and blogging about it after our last talk
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:09.000]   and Rick Clow, who's a very good guy at Google, is now in charge of Google profiles.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.920]   And he's been talking a little bit about, he's trying to get his head around it, but
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.720]   I think more about being what we wanted to be, which is an open thing where we can publish
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.120]   it anywhere.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:23.560]   I think that Google's mission is to organize the world's information.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.640]   Facebook should have been to help us organize ourselves.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.960]   It's trying to organize us.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.640]   I think the difference is information versus lives.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.240]   Facebook is in our lives.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:35.040]   Yeah, and Google's was dealing primarily with public information.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.560]   When you put up a public web page, you wanted to thank Google when they index it and send
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.920]   people your way by putting it in their search results.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.920]   I'm like, hey, thanks.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.440]   That helps me and also makes me money.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:51.520]   With Facebook, when Facebook makes my information public in way, backdoor ways that I wasn't
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:55.480]   aware of because the defaults changed, I feel really violated.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.400]   It's a completely different thing.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.280]   But Google started out dealing with the public web.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:07.120]   And they mostly do deal with the public web, except for Gmail and your contacts and your
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.360]   reader and docs.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:13.480]   And so far, except with the notable exception of Buzz, they haven't screwed that up yet.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.480]   It's really great.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.480]   We're going to take a break.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.080]   It's a really interesting story.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.320]   Paul Therad is here from Windows Weekly Podcast.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.720]   He's also the guy behind the super site for WindowsWindSuperSight.com, the author of Windows
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.040]   Seven Secrets and an Expert.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.960]   We haven't really talked much about Microsoft's cloud initiatives.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.640]   I'd love to do that with you, Paul.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   In just a little bit, Jeff Jarvis is at the airport, Miami Airport.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.680]   I'm so glad we were able to get him on from the airport.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:43.160]   Are people giving you strange looks?
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.400]   He's frozen in time.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.400]   He's frozen.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.960]   Now we're giving him strange looks.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.000]   Unless that's the universal signal for.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Hi.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.080]   There he goes.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.840]   Jeff Jarvis is a Buzz Machine.com.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.760]   This is blog, Gina Trapani, smarterware.org.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.960]   Founder of Life Hacker, always great to have all three of you on board.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.360]   Briefly, let me talk a little bit about go to training, and then we'll get back to our
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.560]   conversation about Google and the cloud.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.560]   Go to training.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.240]   It's the latest product from Citrix.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.680]   They are so fantastic.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.920]   They've got, of course, go to meeting.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.120]   Go to my PC, great remote access products.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.200]   Now they want to take on training and make training better.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.480]   If you've just done corporate training of any kind online, you probably know how bad
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.400]   the status is, how bad the state of the art is.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.280]   This is all changing now with go to training just launched from Citrix.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.280]   Go to training.com.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.000]   You can try it free for 30 days.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.480]   Of course, you get all the great benefits of Citrix's base platform screen sharing.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:41.200]   You presenters can be in different locales anywhere in the world.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.600]   Great voice over IP.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.440]   Chat.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.520]   But there's some additional features that are just for training.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.400]   For instance, you create a content library associated with your training.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:54.920]   Upload any document type or link to any website.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.360]   That library can be used before, during, and after your training sessions.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:03.640]   You can create and customize training tests to give attendees before, during, or after
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.440]   each training session.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.640]   You can send out email invites to the session using the integrated email system.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.640]   Where are you?
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.640]   We're starting.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.640]   Integrated chat.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.640]   Polling features.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.640]   Feedback.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.280]   Testing.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.760]   Complete testing for the training.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.760]   Here's the best part now.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.400]   You can have up to 200 people at your event, at your live session.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.520]   That's nice because you get some nice interactivity going and so forth.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.800]   Then, record it as it's going and anybody can take that training anytime.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:35.840]   I have to take this training for the radio show on how not to swear on it on the air.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.320]   By the way, thank you Howard Stern because I wouldn't have to take this if it weren't
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:42.640]   for that massive FCC fine of Howard Stern.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.680]   It's impossible.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:50.080]   It's designed for people in the building and I'm not in the building and I've been talking
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.080]   to the ITP.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.320]   Just use GoToTraining.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.320]   I wish I could get the...
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:57.360]   If you've had a bad training experience, if you're a trainer, if you're an IT professional,
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.240]   try it or get your training folks to try it.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.360]   Go to training.com.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.800]   30 days free.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.800]   It's all yours.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.800]   GoToTraining.com.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.720]   We're so glad to have them on this week in Google.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.400]   Thank you Citrix for your support.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.680]   That's talk about cloud.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.440]   Now, I think Jeff, I don't know if he's gone off to take his plane in the cloud.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.440]   Oh, there he is.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:19.440]   He came back.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.120]   There's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.080]   Are you there, Jeff?
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.040]   Oh, you're muted.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.400]   My sprint died, so I switched to Wi-Fi.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.680]   If I get to be too unbearable in this way as well as others, just cut me off.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.680]   You're always...
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.680]   Always bearable.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.680]   The always bearable...
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.560]   Nice to think anybody's ever said about that.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.440]   Always bearable Jeff Jarvis.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.640]   I don't know how valuable these stats are, and you're very good, Paul Thorett at debunking
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   stats like this.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.720]   I'll throw them out there.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.960]   I don't know if this is your number, Jeff.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:52.960]   The Android Passes.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.960]   I don't have none.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:54.960]   So do it.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.960]   Okay, good.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:58.720]   Android Passes the iPhone for web traffic in the US.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.560]   Now, this is based on AdMob, which publishes...
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.560]   Web ads.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.800]   Web ads in both Android and iPhone apps.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.880]   Now, there are a lot more Web ads from AdMob, I think, in...
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.160]   Well, I don't know.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.160]   I don't know.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:16.400]   I'm normalizing this for the number of applications and so forth.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:24.000]   Android traffic in the US has increased to 46% of OS share compared to 39% for iPhone.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.400]   Worldwide iPhone is still number one with 46%, and Android only is 24%.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.640]   Let's see a stalled base of each.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.000]   Do we have numbers?
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.520]   You know, Google doesn't reveal that.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:39.080]   That Andy Rubin interview with the Times, I think he said that Android's 9% of smartphones
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.080]   are interesting.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.080]   In the US?
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.920]   That was a very forthcoming interview.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.120]   It was a very forthcoming interview.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.200]   Yeah, I'm just double checking.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.200]   Pretty sure it was 9%.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:53.240]   AdMob, by the way, even though Google bought it, is not yet part of Google.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.520]   They don't have regulatory approval.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.520]   So...
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:02.280]   And of course, we know that the installed base of iPhones is...
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:07.720]   Because Apple's just said it, and I think it was at 75 million.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.840]   Anyway, it's an interesting stat.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.240]   I think nobody would doubt that Android is coming on strong.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.760]   Verizon announced this week that they are not going to carry the Nexus One phone, even
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.840]   though this has been on Google's, you know, priceless.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.680]   Coming in the spring, they said, "Now, you know what?
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.560]   We're going to stick with our droid line, and in particular the HTC Incredible," which
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.560]   is incredible.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.560]   Indeed.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.560]   Incredible.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:31.560]   Don't you want it?
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:36.840]   The New York Times says Android currently runs on 9% of smartphones in the United States
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.840]   according to ComScore.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.840]   That's about it.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:39.840]   That's not right.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.800]   That AdMob number, I was confused about it.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:46.720]   At first, I looked at it and said, "This seems strange at 9% smartphone usage, but it's
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:52.360]   add impressions in relation to the entire market share of the operating system.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.240]   Is that correct?"
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.240]   I think so.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.040]   According to the brands...
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:02.360]   That just means that more Android users see ads than iPhone users.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.360]   You're right.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.360]   It's add impressions.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.960]   They're all the impressions within the current market share.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:13.040]   So that's interesting in that it may make Android an attractive platform for advertisers
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:18.400]   to work on, but we still have to remember that we're talking about 9% of the market
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.400]   in the United States.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.880]   So that's a much smaller market than the iPhone.
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.600]   Because I looked at the number and said, "I don't understand."
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.200]   Are all these Android users tethering?
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.200]   I don't...
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.200]   What do they do?
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.200]   Web traffic?
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.120]   Are we using the web more because on Apple, you're always on apps?
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:34.320]   Or maybe more Android apps use AdMob because there are far more free apps on Android.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.040]   Yeah, that's possible.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:38.960]   38,000 apps now in the app store as of a few weeks ago.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.920]   That was your number, I think, last week.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:41.920]   38,000.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:42.920]   That's pretty compelling.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.000]   I mean, that's a big...
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   That's huge growth.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.960]   8,000 in a month.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.720]   Yeah, that is a big growth.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.840]   I got my Google I/O droid.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:53.840]   You did.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.840]   Yes, I did.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.840]   How do you like it?
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:56.840]   I like it.
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:57.840]   It's okay.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:58.840]   I like the Nexus One better.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:46:59.840]   Me too.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.840]   I think I'm actually going to try developing something for Android.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.640]   I'm going to try and put together a little app.
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.840]   Using the droid, so I'm excited about that.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:06.840]   So no 2, 2.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.160]   But maybe when Google I/O happens, I'm supposed to bring the phone to I/O.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.560]   Maybe they'll offer an update to the two to the two.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.440]   Yeah, we were speculating on that, that maybe that's when they would do that.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.680]   I am actually now it's 50,000 apps.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.920]   Somebody just said, "Because that right?
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.400]   Could that possibly be?"
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.400]   Wow.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.640]   The latest, I guess that's what Andy Rubin said.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.760]   Oh yeah, in that article, he did say 50K.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:33.320]   50,000 apps.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:37.280]   It's huge growth.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.360]   So you don't want it incredible.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.360]   I want it incredible.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.680]   I'm very tempted to throw this Nexus One.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.680]   Oh, yes, no, I do.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:44.680]   Eight megapixels.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:45.680]   We don't want to think about it.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.520]   It's a place to subtract all with optical.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.520]   It is incredible.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.520]   Yeah, it is incredible.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.120]   It's well named, although I don't know.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.960]   The name is like, "Come on."
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.880]   Yes, adjective.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.800]   Once you've gone to incredible, what is in it?
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.800]   Yeah, well, right.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.200]   When there's nothing else to look forward to.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.200]   You hit the end of this superlative line.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.200]   It's true.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.640]   The next word up is a curse.
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.640]   Fucking unbelievable.
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:10.640]   It's that.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.440]   Leo, you got a little New York coming out.
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.440]   Yeah, this phone.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.440]   That's what I'm believing.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.000]   It's like the standardized clay over there.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.240]   I don't know if you can get dice man to do the yes.
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:24.240]   Wouldn't that be?
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.440]   I'd like to say the greatest brand ever.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.440]   It's unbelievable.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:31.720]   It's not that unbelievable, it's a phone.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:32.720]   You just want it.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.760]   You know, I decided that if you all were going to ask me about the gizmodo thing that
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.720]   I was going to take out my Brooklyn accent.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.720]   All right, so congratulations.
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.120]   You got a problem with that?
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:48.400]   You just stole an iPhone and being investigated by the Santa Clara React team.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.440]   What are you going to do next?
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.440]   What?
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:52.440]   What?
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.440]   What do you want?
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:49:00.240]   You know, I don't know if Jason's Chen says that, but he should.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.240]   He should.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.240]   He should.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.480]   Do we have an opinion on that?
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:11.320]   I mean, we've talked incessantly about it since a tweet on Sunday and then a Mac break
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.640]   weekly we had Denise Howley, attorney come on.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:20.520]   You guys, you're Jeff, maybe, you know, as a representative of the Inksdane Wretch class.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.520]   Are these shield laws in New York state?
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:25.920]   Not a whole I think New York state does, no federal, of course.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:29.600]   And, you know, there was an Atlantic blog argument that this ruins journalism because
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.600]   it opens up the shield.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.600]   But hello, journalism is welcome to everybody.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.960]   You have to deal with this.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:38.560]   If, I mean, basically what would happen in an open world is the Tony Soprano would start
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.760]   a blog and say, Hey, I'm a journalist.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:46.960]   Oh, so it's the HTC bada Bing.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:52.040]   What is this podcast about again?
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.040]   I don't know.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.040]   I don't know.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.640]   We're all up in the cloud.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.640]   We're in the clouds.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.720]   Our heads are in the clouds.
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.600]   What is Microsoft up to in the cloud?
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.120]   I mean, look, they got the cloud guy.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.520]   You're talking about Lotus earlier, Jeff.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:10.640]   I mean, Ray Aussie who created Lotus Notes has been working at Microsoft now for how many
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.360]   years, three or four years?
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.360]   Yep.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.960]   And everybody thought, well, as soon as Ray Aussie arrives, Microsoft's going cloud.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:17.960]   Did it?
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.800]   Actually, it did.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:23.000]   But of course, because it's Microsoft, it's happened in such a stealth fashion.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.720]   It's like no one noticed, you know.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:31.120]   To this day, Microsoft's biggest cloud services, such as they are, are the cloud services it's
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.280]   had for a long time.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:36.400]   You know, the Windows Live stuff that used to be MSN, the Hotmail stuff, you know, I
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:40.840]   mean, that's still very popular and well, I'm sure continue to be popular.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:44.960]   But obviously they're trying to move their server products to the cloud through Windows
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.040]   Azure and the other Azure services.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:52.080]   They have hosted versions of Exchange and communication server and SharePoint and so forth
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.320]   that they're selling to businesses.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.600]   But you know, it's a tough transition.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:01.960]   Microsoft obviously has made billions and billions on very traditional software and the world
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:02.960]   is changing.
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:07.120]   So, you know, they're kind of scurrying to catch up in many ways.
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:12.760]   I was talking about live typing in Google Docs and in Wave with a Microsoft guy this
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.240]   week and he said, oh, well, you know, Microsoft has that.
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.480]   We've done that for years.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.280]   And I said, yeah, there's a lot with that.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:22.440]   And he said, yeah, in the rich client, which I assume that he was talking about Microsoft
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:26.640]   Word being the rich client or on live, if you're in the rich client, if you hooked up over
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:32.640]   SharePoint correctly or on live, you can kind of watch people update a document at the same
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.640]   time.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:34.640]   I had no idea.
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.560]   I mean, I feel like part of the issue with Microsoft's cloud stuff is like I whenever
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:41.160]   a cloud announcement happens, I'm always, I'm always just like, what does this mean?
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.760]   Like, I'm not, I'm not really sure.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:46.080]   I can't, I can't parse it like for an individual user and I feel like maybe it's because their
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:50.520]   launches are primarily for enterprise, but I'm never, I rarely get excited about it.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:54.240]   And I'm always like, oh, but I have to have an exchange server with SharePoint.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.960]   And, you know, I just don't want to do it.
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.960]   It doesn't get excited about exchange.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:51:59.960]   Everybody.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:00.960]   Don't worry about that.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:07.320]   I, I, I, rhetorically, I, one time, and I've asked this other times, publicly, but I've
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:11.760]   asked Microsoft, you know, if exchange service so great, why doesn't Hotmail run on it?
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.760]   You know, and, you know, there's a good point.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:18.360]   A lot of stuff going on there, but, you know, it's been long enough.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:23.000]   I mean, they bought a Hotmail back in what 1994, something like that.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.720]   If they were going to move it to exchange, they would have done it a long time ago.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.240]   So clearly that's not happening.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.240]   It was on Linux.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:29.240]   They moved enough Linux.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.240]   All right.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:36.640]   Or, I think you're right that, that to me, what's it, not to go back to this lotus thing,
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.000]   but it's similar.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.760]   I ignore the enterprise world because I live out here in the, you know, onesies and two
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.760]   sees world of ours.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.120]   And there actually is stuff going on in the enterprise world, which I've always made
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:52.040]   fun of, but they do have the opportunity to integrate in ways that we don't have because
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:57.280]   people are trying to grab on the standards like Facebook and Twitter and not in the standards.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:00.200]   So security controls, you know, right.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:04.200]   So it almost seems that my eyes were open to this extent that there is potentially some
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:09.520]   development that can happen in the enterprise world that can get them past the web.
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.520]   Sure.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:15.240]   I think one of the criticisms of Ray Aussie is that when he arrived at Microsoft, you
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:19.720]   know, he talked about stuff like live mesh or the, the group products that moved into
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.720]   office.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:25.760]   And in many ways, it seems like he's been re-implementing the same kind of software
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:29.800]   solution, you know, over time at different places.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:34.240]   And of course, a lot of the Microsoft stuff has sat still for a few years now.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.800]   So there's some confusion going on there.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:40.000]   But I think this year is going to be a big one for the Windows Live stuff.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.200]   And it's worth noting too that, you know, Microsoft's consumer online services are
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:47.880]   actually used by several hundred million people.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:53.400]   And they are in fact more popular than the equivalent Google services or the Yahoo
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.160]   services or whatever in most cases.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:59.360]   So we talk about docs all the time, but docs is a fraction.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:00.760]   Gmail is a fraction of Hotmail.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:01.760]   It is.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:04.960]   And actually I developed some numbers there and these are from Microsoft.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:09.200]   So I also take this with their grain of salt, if you will, but according to Microsoft,
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:14.160]   and this is less than 30 days old, they're about 400 million people.
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:18.520]   They use Hotmail every day, 175 million for Gmail and 200 million for Yahoo.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:21.800]   And we make this big deal about 400 million Facebook users.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.800]   There's that's a month.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.040]   There's 400 million Hotmail users a day.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:29.840]   And Microsoft says that there are actually over 500 million active users of all of their
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.280]   Windows Live services every month.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:35.040]   And those are people that use email instant messaging, the social networking stuff and
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:38.040]   the portals about half a billion.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.040]   Who are these people?
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:42.040]   Are they primarily US?
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:45.360]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:51.640]   So actually it's I don't actually have that data in front of me, but that's obviously
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:52.640]   worldwide.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:55.800]   But the Windows Live stuff tends to be very popular in the United States.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:00.400]   Curiously, there are countries in Europe where it's incredibly popular and then a couple
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.400]   of countries in Asia.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.440]   And I don't know those off the top of my head, but I want to say it's something like France
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:09.760]   and Germany, countries like that where the percentages are actually higher.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:10.760]   Really?
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.440]   Whatever countries for whatever reasons.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:17.000]   But yeah, I mean, you were going to correct me and I want to correct myself.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.440]   It's free BSD, not Linux, that Hotmail was originally.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.480]   Yeah, yeah, I think so.
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:25.800]   You know, it's interesting the way you said that like, who are these people?
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:31.720]   Because it is no, but that's actually really interesting because nobody knows who these
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:32.720]   people are.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:36.080]   I mean, they're quite well because they're not advocates for the technology.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.080]   It's not us.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.080]   That's right.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:41.960]   I could remind her that like I'm sealed in my nerd bubble.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:42.960]   Right.
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:48.800]   I see more people in young male than I ever see on Hotmail or on Microsoft service.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:50.800]   Right.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.600]   I mean, I, whatever it's worth.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.880]   I mean, as is my stuff.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.880]   Is it all spam accounts?
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:59.560]   Well, 400 million spam accounts.
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:04.320]   I happen to use Gmail and Google Calendar and all that stuff myself right now.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:08.440]   I anticipate that changing over time, but you know, part of the reason is that Microsoft
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.560]   hasn't gotten the integration pieces in that they need.
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:15.240]   You know, they have tremendous desktop software and server software and all that kind of stuff.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:20.320]   And they have actually very decent online services as well, but they're a weird missing
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.320]   chunks of integration that are very important.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.960]   So for example, their online calendar service doesn't integrate with any mobile phone right
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:27.960]   now.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.280]   It's not even their own.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.280]   Wow.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:31.280]   And not even their own.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.280]   And that's right.
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:33.280]   Wow.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:37.480]   And it's worse than it sounds because this dates back a year now.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:41.560]   So we're waiting for this new generation of Windows live services to hit when this will
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:42.560]   all be rectified.
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.020]   And that's fantastic.
[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:48.800]   But why wasn't this one thing, you know, fixed over the past year?
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:49.800]   I have no idea.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:53.280]   Well, it signals a lack of commitment a little bit to me.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:56.760]   I'm like, well, they've got this whole business where they sell software that comes in boxes
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.000]   on shelves at Staples.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.440]   Like they're not going to worry about getting their calendar, you know, their live calendar
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.440]   down.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:04.440]   How much longer they're going to be able to do that?
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.960]   Is that the wrong way to look at a poll?
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:10.200]   I mean, it concerns me like, oh, you know, this is Google's business, their whole business.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:14.360]   So I know that they're totally, you know, committed to their only platform.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.360]   Right.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:20.200]   So Google as a relatively young company, came of age on the internet, all of their services
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:21.840]   essentially in an internet base.
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:26.200]   They do have some, you know, traditional software products like Chrome and so forth.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:32.120]   But you know, mostly they perceive the world from the internet, you know, that's a huge
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.920]   advantage when you're talking about online services.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:38.760]   Microsoft sees the world from, you know, a traditional software sense.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.800]   Like you said, literally floppy disks and boxes.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:45.720]   Making that transition is hard because they made so much money doing it the old way.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:48.600]   There are still people that company I'm sure who are thinking, what are we doing?
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.600]   What are we doing?
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:54.920]   And you can look at things like Microsoft Office where they move so slowly to the web,
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:58.280]   you know, away from this old business model, you know, office is still a very traditional
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.280]   software product.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:02.720]   And on the other hand, you know, with this version, you can do things like buy, you can buy office
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:07.280]   online literally digitally, install it, stream it down to your computer.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:11.840]   It's still, you know, that traditional software, but they're getting there, you know, but it's
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:12.840]   really interesting.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:17.000]   Who here uses office on letter off versus Google Docs?
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.960]   I use office.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:24.560]   I mean, I literally, I just had to send a fax today for, for reasons I don't even want
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.560]   to get into.
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.520]   But I wound up using Word and I was like, Oh, I need a fax template.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:31.840]   And I actually within Word, you're able to choose a template and auto downloads it.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.920]   So you're browsing the online gallery and then I chose a template that I wanted an auto
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:36.480]   download and I was super impressed.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.160]   I was like, Oh, this is a really nice integration.
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.680]   I had a nice fax template and used it.
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:41.800]   I generally I use it.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:45.360]   I use a text editor or docs, but, but you know, there's some editors who want to use
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:46.360]   Word.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:48.960]   If I want something to look really nice and format it well, I use Word.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.480]   It's the only time I've used Word.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.680]   Yeah, for books, publishers want Word.
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:57.400]   I'm not concerned so much with formatting as I am with the functionality around spell
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:00.080]   and grammar checking and all that stuff.
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:03.440]   But you know, you raised another interesting point there because Word is a traditional
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.440]   software product.
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:08.040]   One's been around for a long, long time has picked up these kind of online capabilities
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:11.920]   over time, whereas a product like Google Docs is going to come at it from the internet
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:18.080]   point of view and it will pick up more traditional, you know, software type design features over
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:19.240]   time as well.
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.160]   So they're kind of, they're going to meet in the middle at some point, right?
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.800]   But right now they just approach the same thing from completely different points of
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:26.800]   view.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:33.480]   We've talked on Windows Weekly, Paul, about how Google Docs is very feature-like compared
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:35.200]   to something like Microsoft Word.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:40.440]   But for some people, people like Gina, who maybe Jeff and me as well, that's a feature.
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:41.560]   Now, that's a benefit.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:43.720]   We don't want all those features.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:44.720]   Yep.
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:45.720]   Yep.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:52.200]   Well, you know, Microsoft has now and it's just starting to roll out their office web applications,
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.200]   right?
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.920]   Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.
[00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:00.240]   They're their cloud-based versions of those Microsoft Office applications.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:06.280]   So I'm actually, I just started using the Word web app as my word processor for my daily
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:10.800]   work because this is stuff that ends up on the web anyway and it turns out moving something
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:14.200]   that you're typing in a web browser to something, you know, to some other form in a web browser
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.760]   is actually very natural and it works very well.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:23.080]   This thing is dramatically more full-featured than Google Docs from an editing perspective,
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.080]   I would say not from any--
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.560]   That's part of the problem, though, isn't it?
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:29.920]   Going through Microsoft features to find something is like going through Facebook's privacy to
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920]   fix it.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:35.480]   Well, that would be true, I think, of the Word application, but actually the web app version
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:41.920]   is-- sits, I would say, somewhere halfway between Google Docs and its traditional Word
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.920]   from a functionality standpoint.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:49.920]   So, I mean, just looking at, for example, Word 2010, the desktop app has like six, seven
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.160]   tabs of toolbars and so forth, whereas the web version is three.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:59.240]   And it's not just three tabs worth of toolbars, it's three really dramatically scaled down
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.320]   sets of functions.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.320]   It's all the basic stuff.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:05.240]   You know, in fact, I haven't done this yet and maybe I should, but if I were to compare
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:10.480]   this to Google Docs, I bet they're actually-- they were pretty close, you know.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.720]   Does it require Silverlight?
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:18.600]   No, but if you have Silverlight, it's actually a better performing version, I guess, if you
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.920]   have Silverlight in the browser.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.760]   And so is it JavaScript?
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.640]   I don't know how they implemented, I'm not sure.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.800]   But it works across Chrome, Firefox, IE.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.800]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.800]   Oh, yeah, JavaScript.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.800]   That's interesting.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.560]   And it's a way for a Mac user or a Linux user to have what has traditionally been a Windows
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:43.080]   only experience because this thing works a lot like Office 2010 on Windows.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.080]   Right.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:49.440]   Oregon has just announced it's going to bring Google Apps to all of its classrooms statewide.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:54.640]   You keep-- you do keep seeing wins for Google Docs over Microsoft.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.640]   Well, right.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.760]   So I mean, I would say with some exceptions, for example, Office Web Apps is free, so that's
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.920]   free for anybody.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:09.800]   But when you look at Microsoft's enterprise cloud services like business, they have awful
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:15.440]   names, but essentially hosted exchange, hosted SharePoint and so forth, you know, there is
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.680]   no free version like there is on Google.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.880]   So schools like the free stuff.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:20.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.760]   And this is tough because-- well, schools actually do get Microsoft stuff for free, although they
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.840]   don't get the exchange stuff.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.040]   They get the, you know, the Hotmail Windows Live stuff.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:34.960]   So there are colleges all over the United States that can use Google or Windows Live
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.280]   as the back end, right?
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.800]   And it has your EDU address or whatever.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.360]   So those two companies both do the same thing there.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:44.640]   But Google does offer Google Apps for free.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.320]   There's a free version of it.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:50.400]   And that's actually a huge deal because I think, you know, small businesses, businesses of any
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.880]   kind actually, you know, they're always constrained from a financial standpoint.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:58.200]   And I think a lot of them can get away with using the free version.
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.320]   And Microsoft just doesn't have that.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:05.360]   And that's something I've been writing them on because, you know, the base price for, you
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.920]   know, hosted exchange is basically $5 per month per employee, but you have to have at
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.920]   least five people doing it.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.760]   And it gets kind of expensive over time.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:24.760]   Are you like, is the Facebook, is docs.com the same as the office, general office web
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   docs?
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:30.200]   So actually docs.com is office web applications.
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.160]   It's the same exact platform.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.280]   The only difference is that for collaboration purposes or for sharing purposes, you're going
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.280]   through your Facebook contacts list instead of your Windows Live.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:40.840]   That's going to help us a lot.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.080]   That's going to introduce a lot of people.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.880]   I bet you a lot of people didn't even know that you could use office online.
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:47.000]   Well, I think that was the, I didn't know this.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.720]   I mean, the day they announced this, you suddenly have this like off and you realize,
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:56.480]   this is a platform that Microsoft is going to be basically handing out to people and they'll
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.360]   be able to customize it in their own ways.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.600]   Now there are a lot of Facebook's in the world, but, you know, companies like Facebook's
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.880]   that have lots of, you know, people using that service will be able to use their own
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.880]   branded versions of office web applications.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.080]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:19.360]   Let's see, before we get to our tip and tool and number, none of which we have, is there
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:24.360]   any other subjects or stories you fellows would like to talk about?
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:30.320]   No, just let me just briefly, I wanted this to talk about that HTC thing.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:35.840]   The deal there actually is that Microsoft is going after the same intellectual property
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.560]   and patent licensing concerns that it has with Linux.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.920]   You know, Android is based on Linux.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:47.160]   So Microsoft has actually contacted a bunch of Android handset makers to talk to them about
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.600]   cross licensing of patents.
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:53.240]   Now HTC doesn't have their own mobile patents like a Motorola would or one of the bigger
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:55.080]   companies that's been around for a while.
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.240]   So they can't do a cross licensing agreement.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:02.280]   So the HTC agreement, HTC is actually going to pay Microsoft to identify itself against
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:09.400]   any patent claims, but I think you're going to see more agreements like that in the future,
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:13.480]   just as we did with Linux companies between Linux and Microsoft.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.160]   So I think this is just an extension of that.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:20.080]   So they had no choice because they didn't have any patents HTC had to settle with Microsoft.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.880]   Well, these companies will all reach, there was no settlement.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:23.880]   No one sued anyone.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.880]   I mean, they just-
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:25.880]   There's a licensing agreement I should say.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.920]   They contacted, yeah, they reached an agreement.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:32.920]   So the agreement was that Microsoft would not pour salt on them and destroy them forever.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:37.960]   Does that help them in the Apple lawsuit?
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.960]   Well, I think HTC I mean.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.320]   As Apple's suing them, of course.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.320]   No, not at all.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.760]   And in fact, I've seen some speculation around that.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:47.760]   I don't see how it could.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:51.440]   I mean, well, actually that's not necessarily true.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.440]   Depends if these are competing patents.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.440]   Yeah, depends on what the-
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.840]   So if Microsoft has patents around multi-todge sure, things like that actually, yes, I suppose.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:03.560]   See, I didn't realize, normally in a patent lawsuit situation, it's kind of mutually assured
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:04.560]   destruction.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.560]   You've got patents.
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:06.560]   We've got patents.
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:07.960]   You, us, will sue you back.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.400]   I didn't realize HTC had no patents.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.920]   So HTC is kind of a small company.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:13.920]   They're very vulnerable.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.080]   They're completely vulnerable.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:20.200]   And that explains now why Apple did not go after Google.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.600]   It went after HTC because HTC has no patents.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.600]   Apple has an endless supply of cash.
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.320]   They could fight this forever and probably has a lot of patents.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.720]   And they could counter sue as well.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.320]   So go after HTC.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.200]   Maybe they'll make a deal with Apple.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.760]   It's nibbling around Google.
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.920]   And I guess Microsoft's nibbling around Google too because Microsoft's not suing Google,
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.920]   they're going after the handset manufacturers.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:42.920]   Right.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.800]   So anybody else who uses Android are they in the same position that the HTC is in now?
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:46.800]   Yes.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.640]   And in fact, that's one of the things in the press release.
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:53.480]   They don't name names, but they say you're in contact with a bunch of other Android.
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.960]   If you're making an Android phone, there'll be a knock at your door.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:00.480]   Is it accepted that Microsoft legitimately has these?
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:05.120]   I mean, in other words, is Linux, if I do a Linux Distro, do I license the stuff from
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.120]   Microsoft?
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.120]   Is that generally accepted?
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.120]   Hundreds.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.120]   Hundreds of companies have already done this.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.120]   Interesting.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.200]   This has been one of those many quite Microsoft things.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.120]   You know, they've gone to the big companies.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.720]   They've gone to the small companies.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:22.440]   And the basic deal is, you know, you're indemnifying not just the company itself that is creating
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:25.800]   some Linux-based solution, but also their customers.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:30.920]   You know, so it's a presumably someone has actually looked and said, "Oh, yes, you do
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.400]   have a valid patent for whatever."
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.240]   But I mean, obviously as a part of these agreements, none of those companies are talking
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.600]   about anything like that.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.400]   So that's just speculation, I guess.
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.840]   That's really interesting.
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:48.080]   And do you know what areas the patents are in?
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.680]   The Linux patents are Microsoft patents, I guess.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.240]   No, I mean, right.
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:57.720]   No, no, I don't.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.240]   And Google is a very open company.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:05.040]   And this was something that Andy Rubin discussed in the New York Times interview.
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.480]   There are actually benefits to that, but there are also downsides to it.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.040]   You know, they release the source code for all the stuff that they're doing.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:15.040]   Microsoft can look at it and say, "Here, here, here."
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.960]   You know, and then they have their basis for going after those companies.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:23.840]   I'm afraid writing at CNET says, "It's not clear to what degree, if any, the Microsoft
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.800]   agreement will help HTC and its battle against Apple."
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:33.520]   However, she quotes a Gartner analyst, Ken Dulaney, he says, "That's the key battle
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.520]   for HTC."
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:39.960]   He says, "If this doesn't help in some way in HTC against Apple, I don't think HTC
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:40.960]   gains much."
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.280]   Well, Microsoft wasn't there to help HTC.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.800]   Microsoft was there to get its license fees, obviously.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:46.800]   Hey Leo.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:47.800]   Yes, sir.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:48.800]   I think I'm taking off.
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:49.800]   All right.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.760]   Jeff Jarvis, he is the blogger at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:55.960]   Thank you for making all that Yomen-like effort to get with us.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.280]   We'll see you back in New York.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.280]   Bye-bye.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:59.280]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.280]   Safe life, Jeff.
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:01.280]   Oh, and there he goes.
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.280]   He's clicked.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.280]   He's gone.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:06.320]   Yeah, fascinating story.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:09.560]   And of course, the big story, once again, to recap and Paul broke it on the show right
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:20.920]   at the beginning, HP is buying Palm for $1.2 billion making the folks at Elevation Partners
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.320]   breathe a huge sigh of relief because they were into Palm for several hundred million
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:25.320]   dollars.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:31.360]   That's Bono's venture firm and run by Roger Macdamy.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:36.440]   They put a pretty big investment in Palm late in the game, hoping that WebOS would
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:38.480]   take off.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.640]   Palm's stock price got more and more depressed now.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:44.960]   The HP deal is, I think, valuing it at $5.70, which is, I think, a pretty hefty premium
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.120]   over its last price.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.680]   $1.2 billion for Palm.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.920]   Jeff's number of the week.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.640]   Yeah, let's make that the number of the week.
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.280]   How about, do you have a tip that you'd like to pass along?
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.960]   You kind of did one.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:58.960]   I do.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.520]   Well, I did a couple, but I do have one that we actually didn't cover.
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:10.000]   You can rent movies, 48-hour rental, 99 cents to $3.99.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.640]   You pay with Google Checkout.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.920]   I think a Read/Write web wrote about this.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.040]   It wasn't really a big launch.
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.640]   The selection of movies, it seems to be sort of indie films and documentaries, but there's
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.640]   some good stuff here.
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:24.640]   The September issue, actually, which Leah and I have to chat about.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.640]   That's a great movie.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:26.640]   I love it.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.640]   I watched it because of you.
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.640]   Yeah, that's $3.99.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.720]   Precious, which is a fantastic movie.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:31.720]   Brothers.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.720]   That wasn't so good.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:36.040]   But there are some really good movies here.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:41.240]   Like I said, I haven't tried this, but if you click on one of the movies, $3.99, you
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:44.200]   pay with, so it's rent for 24 hours.
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:45.200]   It's stream, right?
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.200]   It's stream.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.560]   Yeah, you complete the payment.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.200]   It's a Google Checkout payment.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.360]   This is kind of interesting.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:55.040]   Another way to, I guess we don't need another way to rent movies, but kind of interesting
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.040]   that YouTube is doing this.
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.840]   It'll be interesting to see where this goes.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.320]   I wonder why they're doing this.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.840]   Ah, kind of just getting the game, I guess, right?
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:04.840]   You know, it's interesting.
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:09.240]   When you do rent that movie, then on the right, you get a bunch as you do on anywhere on YouTube,
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.360]   a bunch of other videos.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.360]   Some of them...
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:13.360]   Who made it to?
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:16.600]   Yeah, some of the movies, but some of them just YouTube videos, including it looks like
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.040]   some pirate versions of the movie.
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:23.600]   Here's Girl with a Pearl Earring, part five through nine.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.520]   Interesting, interesting.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.520]   Hmm.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:26.520]   Hmm.
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:31.040]   So you could rent it, or you could watch the fake version on YouTube.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:36.840]   And another kind of really minor video-related thing now is that you can narrow your search
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.200]   results for TV shows by season.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.200]   I saw that.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.560]   That was going to be one of the tools I talked about.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:43.560]   I love that.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.680]   Yeah, you kind of drilled down on the sidebar there, but yeah, kind of interesting.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:49.840]   Because I do that all the time.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:52.240]   Is that in the show options?
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.880]   Colin, I got to keep that thing open.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.240]   Yeah, hit Show Options.
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:58.960]   And then click on Videos, Under All Results.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:01.320]   And then under All Videos, you can see Episodes.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.000]   Yeah, I mean, you really have to drill down to see this.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   And then you can filter...
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   There's the episode guide.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.680]   Yeah, so I just searched for the wire.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.320]   So I have season one through season five.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.320]   That's Nate.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.600]   Oh, and then there's a dropdown of like, you have to choose which episode.
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:17.600]   Wow.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:22.040]   So, you know, when you're trying to find that episode of the Office that you missed, you
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.800]   can literally drill down by the number, the season and the number.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.000]   And some of these are YouTube links.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   I see an Amazon link.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   Huh.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   Huh.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   Great.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.280]   This will help me pirate television.
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.280]   That's fantastic.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.280]   Exactly.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.280]   There you go.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.280]   Look at that.
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.280]   That's great.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.280]   Everywhere you can find it.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.280]   Well, thank you.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:42.760]   That is a great tip.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:46.800]   We already had a number and my tool was actually going to be Google Earth in the browser.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.800]   We showed that earlier.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:48.800]   No, it's fine.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:49.800]   I don't mind.
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:50.800]   That's a great tool and we got a nice tour of it.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.800]   So there you go.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.160]   Sorry about that.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:57.440]   I want to thank you so much, Paul, throughout for joining us, giving us the Microsoft perspective
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.480]   and the scoop on HP.
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:03.320]   Paul Thorett is the host of Windows Weekly, one of our great podcasts, a really great
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:04.320]   podcast.
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.880]   I highly recommend it if you haven't heard it at twit.tv/www.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:12.440]   He's also the man in charge of the SuperSight for Windows, win supersight.com.
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:17.480]   It's a good place to go if you want to know what's up with the latest Windows.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.240]   There's Paul with his mug.
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.480]   Paul's mug with a mug.
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.040]   SuperSight for Windows, win supersight.com.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.560]   And of course, his book is Windows 7 Secrets and the new one coming out, Windows Phone
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.600]   Secrets.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:29.600]   He's writing it right now.
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:30.600]   Look at that.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.200]   You really did get that blog post up.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.200]   HP acquires, Paul.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.200]   Look at that.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.920]   That's what I talk about productivity.
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:37.920]   Multitasking.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.560]   Serious multitasking going on there.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.560]   Multitasking.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.560]   That's fantastic.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:45.640]   Gina Trapani, is it smarthereware.org and the author of the complete guide to Google
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.680]   wave, completewaveguide.com?
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.680]   There was some wave news, I forgot.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:51.680]   Oh, yes.
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.880]   You can remove people from a wave.
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.880]   Yes.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.880]   It's kind of embarrassing.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.880]   Finally, just a small feature, but much needed.
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.880]   The feature, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:03.680]   But one of those features that was just like so conspicuously missing.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.680]   Yeah.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:05.680]   So you can remove.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:06.680]   You can remove somebody.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:10.400]   Good, because there's a lot of people in waves I want to remove right now.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.400]   Yes.
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.400]   Yes.

[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.400]   Well worth getting.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.400]   Yep.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.400]   Thank you, Gina.
