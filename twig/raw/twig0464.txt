[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.720]   It's time for this week in Google to show where you can ever the latest news from, well,
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.780]   I just Google, but anything going on in the Google verse. Because we've got the verse
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.440]   and this and the song and Stacey Higg and Buffum is the song from Stacey and IOT.com.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:08.160]   Hello Stacey. Hello y'all. Happy 4th of July. We didn't have a show last week. I celebrated
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.400]   accordingly. Good. You set off bombs. You know, we didn't. It was pouring rain. Oh,
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.720]   bummer. But we did have tacos. K so and a big party. That seems like a good idea. That
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.880]   sounds like fun. Did you invite Kevin over? You know, I didn't Kevin knows he has an open
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.840]   invitation to my house anytime. He and his entire family. More than I could say. Kevin
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.280]   Tofel is also here's about Chromebooks.com and Stacey's co-host on the IOT show. Good to
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.040]   have you. Kevin. Good to be here. I have all the codes to Stacey's house on my phone.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.240]   So I can get in. You can probably control her house from where you are. Those blinds
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.800]   that keep going up and down. I know. I'm not going to be very careful never to do Kevin
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.000]   wrong. So we could begin the show now because Kevin and I have stopped watching football.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.800]   Kevin's wearing an appropriate jersey though, I note. He's a Liverpool fan. Liverpool football
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.560]   ball. Wait, someone mark this day. Whoa. You have a tattoo. I do. Is that a real tattoo
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.840]   or just a temporary? Yes. It's a real tattoo. Oh my God. Oh, he's more serious about this
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.920]   than I thought. Yes. So I have a Beatles tattoo on the back too. Is that why you're a Liverpool
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.120]   fan? I you know what? I had to pick a team and it just made sense. I'm like, okay, well,
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.360]   I love the Beatles. So I have to go with Liverpool or Everton because they're both in the same
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.320]   area. And I just chose Liverpool and that was it. Holy cow. Yeah. Fan for life. It's the
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:47.000]   only time I've seen Kevin not in a Beatles shirt. Yeah. Kevin and I actually are brothers
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.160]   from another mother because I'm also a massive Beatles fan and I have a tattoo of a beetle
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.640]   on my bottom. Unfortunately, mine's an actual bug. No, I don't. I don't have either. I
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.200]   do have a Twitter bug, but that was for charity and there's it's a long. So I'm watching the
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.920]   game, which is now ended. I'm watching it at work like a lot of people probably are
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:19.680]   do illicitly streaming it on YouTube TV when at the half suddenly you could show my screen
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:29.680]   Carsten. Whoops. Currently, there's no content available for this page. Refresh page to try,
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.520]   which means I kept refreshing it and it was like what it was about an hour before it came
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:43.160]   back. YouTube TV went down in the middle of the World Cup semi finals. This is not good.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.400]   Arguably more people watching it than during the NFL's Super Bowl. Probably didn't this
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.320]   happen to Comcast or someone during the Olympics. Their streams also went down the differences.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:00.680]   Nobody cared about it during the Olympics. I care about the Olympics. The winner Olympics.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:09.200]   Come on. Really? Summer maybe not. We are awesome. Summer. What's in summer? Try this.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.800]   You know, Stacey, that just like a regular game by the Liverpool Football Club is watched
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.000]   by more people than watch the Super Bowl every year. You know that, right? Yes. Yes. I'm
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.040]   aware of the fanatic soccer slash football fans. I'm just saying that like streaming platforms
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.160]   go down and it just seems like they're the worst time. Well, YouTube. I mean, Google,
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.080]   come on. They know how to deliver video. This is what's going on there. Kind of surprising,
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.400]   really. Yeah. I was going to switch to YouTube, but I'm sticking with PlayStation view because
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.440]   it was rock solid. Yeah. So that's how you were watching it. Yes. Yeah. And I think that
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.960]   that's one of the things we're in a battle now between sling TV, PlayStation view, YouTube
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.520]   TV. There's some new ones. There's what new one called Fylo that doesn't have locals.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.360]   And this is a real battle for over the top court cutters. And when you go down during
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:13.760]   a major event like this, that's got to hurt. YouTube TV tweeted. And they said, Hey, everyone,
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.120]   sincere apologies for hold on the tweet will come up in a second. I don't know why Twitter
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.600]   really confuses Chrome. Twitter's down. Twitter's not down. Hey, every, you know, it's funny.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.240]   They used to be down all the time, right? Twitter. We haven't seen a fail well in years. Hey,
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.080]   everyone says, see your apologies for streaming issues with YouTube TV. The timing is horrible,
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.320]   but we're working to be up and running again ASAP. It was about an hour, about one full
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:50.080]   hour. And critical scoreings was lost. They came back just at the end of the game. So
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.160]   people were able, I was able to watch the end. We're so sorry about the service interruption.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.840]   We understand your frustration. Yeah. And I wonder how many people PlayStation
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.280]   View is going to win from this. They're all the same price. What do you play for your
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:10.000]   pay for your PlayStation View, Kevin? It's 40, 40 a month, but they just up to five bucks.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.960]   Actually, like three different competitors just went up five bucks a month. So it's pretty
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.160]   much the same. Yeah. Yeah. YouTube TV was 40. At least I got it for 35 during the trial.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.520]   And I'm still grandfathered in before. But you also, YouTube TV doesn't have tiers. They
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.280]   have just the one offering, which includes locals, PlayStation View, they have some
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:34.920]   tiers. You can start it. There's started 40, then 45, 55 and 75, kind of more like cable.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:40.760]   Yeah, we just we just do the core. I mean, I just need my sports and other stuff. And
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.800]   sometimes they even supplement it with Fubo TV because they've got Pac 12 network, which
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.600]   I like to watch. And you know, so sometimes I'm paying for two of these services. But
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:54.400]   the nice thing is you watch it for a season of sports and then you cancel it. That's it.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:01.880]   File which is the new Kitten town. Try.filo.com is cheap. It's $16. But they don't have
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.800]   any sports. And so this is really, they say, I think they're aiming at millennials who
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:12.360]   don't apparently don't care as much about sports. So they have MTV and Comedy Central.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:18.000]   They have the Food Network. They have AMC and A&E stuff. They I think that they're aiming
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.080]   at the Vice Land. They're aiming at the kids at the millennials who don't have as much
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.440]   money. They actually started, I think, as a college station college wired colleges.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.720]   And now they're just now available for everybody at 16 bucks.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.080]   I think this is funny. This is funny. Bring them up. I just signed up for them just last
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.840]   night for a trial because we were thinking, as I said, going to YouTube TV before today's
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:48.680]   debacle. And my wife wants Food Network and I want HGTV. Don't judge me. And neither
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:54.040]   of those are on YouTube TV. So I figure, oh, for 16 extra bucks a month, we can get those
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.840]   in a few other channels with Fileau. So I just signed up yesterday.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.840]   Interesting.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:04.000]   So how much are you paying in total now for television services? More than cable. No,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.200]   no. It's a good question. Do you consider Internet as part of that? Because it has to
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.200]   be, right?
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.280]   Well, it does. It's not like your base broadband. No. Because you'd have that anyway.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.760]   Right. I'm just talking about like over the top services.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.880]   So it's 40 for PlayStation View. I added Fileau yesterday. That'll be 16 a month if we stick
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:29.880]   with it. Of course, we have Netflix, but T-Mobile pays that for me, except for $3 a month because
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:36.440]   that's their deal. They give you free Netflix if you're a subscriber. Amazon Prime we have
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.200]   as well. So it doesn't add up to be that much.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:46.080]   So that's 60 and then cost a Prime, which is 120. So what is that a month? 10, 70 bucks
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.080]   a month.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.500]   That's about what you'd pay for a cable.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.160]   People still like it. 99.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.640]   Is it that expensive? Wow.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.440]   Yeah, I'd probably still have Prime anyway. And I'd probably still have Netflix anyway,
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.440]   even if I had cable.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.440]   Yeah, good point.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.440]   Sure.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.000]   It is interesting to watch this happen. Of course, it's one of the reasons AT&T bought
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.440]   Time Warner because one of the reasons Comcast has bought NBC Universal, the pipes need to
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.160]   – we've talked about this a lot in the past – want to own the content because it's
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.280]   not enough just to be a pipe anymore. You don't have a lock-in like you used to.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.840]   You know what we're not paying just to close that loop on price because a lot of people
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.760]   don't think about this. We were paying $12 for each cable box. We were paying an extra
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:39.120]   fee for DVR service. I mean, my fee is just for the rentals and DVR was like $40 to $50
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.680]   a month alone.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.960]   I have to say now having – I did try – because they all have one week trials. So I tried
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:50.160]   them all just kind of as a review purposes. This was about a year ago when AT&T's direct
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.200]   TV now just came out. It was not working very well with Time because they didn't, I guess,
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.800]   they weren't prepared for the traffic. But I stick with YouTube TV because it's – to
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.680]   me, that's the nicest interface of the bunch. I really like the interface of YouTube TV.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.400]   I wish that would come on the Roku or has that changed because the last time I checked,
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.240]   I couldn't – it drives me nuts. It's on Apple TV now, which is good.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:19.200]   Yeah, but I'm not an Apple person. I don't like simplicity.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.400]   I do think there is – this is the other problem, right? Is there's this natural animosity
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:30.920]   between these – all these groups? And Roku doesn't like YouTube for some reason. I don't
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:37.880]   know why. Comcast didn't like Roku for a long time. You couldn't activate HBO Go
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:44.160]   on Roku using your Comcast subscription. They finally hammered that out a few months ago.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.520]   So it's – and this is the problem for normal people. It's quite a mess. It's hard to – I
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.880]   think this is the intention. I think the cable companies are really trying – they're
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.040]   kind of like Russia at this point. They just want to sow confusion because then people
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.360]   will just go, "Oh, screw it. I'm just going to keep my cable."
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:06.440]   I think there's a lot to all the drama happening between the big players and the dislike.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:12.680]   And yeah, this is where, again, standards and whatnot come out, open internet, where's
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.680]   Kevin Marks? He would be sharing – he would be sharing this with us.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.680]   Yes.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.680]   So – well –
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.080]   I don't know. I don't have any of these services.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.080]   Let's skip.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.080]   Very few.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.320]   You don't have cable, even.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:28.280]   I don't have cable. Oh, no. We got rid of cable, like, gosh, in 2008.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.200]   So does your daughter feel like a second-class citizen when she goes to school and everybody's
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.200]   talking about –
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.360]   Nobody in her class watches TV?
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.960]   Oh, she goes to that fancy bilingual school.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.520]   That fancy – no, but she – they all watch YouTube. I mean, they don't even –
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.000]   That's really true. That's all you need.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.960]   That's why I think YouTube TV has kind of an inside track with the – with the youngens.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.400]   I don't even know what they'll want to. Like, my daughter is like – I feel sorry
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.560]   for people to watch TV shows when they're on.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.760]   That's crazy. I had to explain to her – she has a friend who's out of town right now.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.560]   And I had to explain to her that she could call her friend on the phone and talk to her
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:10.360]   because her friend doesn't currently have access to Google Hangouts or a phone to text
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.120]   her. And she's like – I was like, you could probably call in like her dad or someone
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.600]   might have a phone and she could talk to you on the phone. She's like, "Why would we
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.600]   talk on the phone?"
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.600]   Yeah. It's a different world.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.520]   It's a different world.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.520]   It's a different world.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.040]   Interesting to watch. Now, remember, AT&T acquired Time Warner, again, Pipes acquiring
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:33.600]   content. And one of the things they got was HBO. Remember that right now Netflix seems
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.120]   to be the dominant player in all of this over the top stuff. In fact, they've announced
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:44.680]   they're going to spend not $8 billion, but $11 billion over the – over the year to
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:52.840]   both create and acquire new content. Kind of amazing. And it works for them. They get
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.600]   subscribers based on the originals, right?
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.880]   Yeah. People talk about them. You go into the office, although Stacy and I don't go
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.520]   to an office, but if we did, what would everybody be talking about? Whatever show was on Netflix
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.080]   last night and you feel left out. You don't want to feel left out. And you get sucked
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:17.120]   in and then you binge. They get a lot of subscribers with original content because it's good
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.120]   content.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.840]   Yeah. It is. Oh, and I should correct this because apparently the last time I checked,
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.080]   I could not get YouTube TV on Roku.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.080]   But you can.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.960]   But two people are now saying that, "Yes, you can now." So I should revisit that. So
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.480]   when my dad comes up, he's got a YouTube television subscription. He wants to watch golf and he
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.280]   can. So now I can tell him that he can.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:41.360]   That's one of the reasons YouTube TV is pretty awesome. Yeah, it is now – as of February,
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.640]   it's available on Roku. So that's a big deal.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.640]   How many people actually watch TV on a TV these days? Because I don't.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:54.480]   I do. We actually prefer – we'll even Chromecast YouTube.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.560]   Yeah. I don't like the little screen. I want to see it on a big screen.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.960]   See, we all want to watch different things. So it's like, I'll just grab my tablet and
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.960]   sit in my recliner and I'm good.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.160]   And if you think about it, if you've got good headphones or, you know, and your tablet
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.800]   is close enough, it's really exactly the same as if you were watching a TV 8-feet, a larger
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.880]   TV 8-feet away.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.200]   Oh, well, we force ourselves to like go and watch things. And here's the big ethical
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:27.280]   debate in our house. No one can start a show without conferring with the other members
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.160]   of the family. So – You mean start a binge.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.100]   We start a binge. So this is my husband right now. We're all supposed to be watching
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.060]   the LumiSnikit together, but we kind of – Anna went and watched him without us. But – Yeah.
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.420]   It's hard for adults to watch that actually after a while.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:47.420]   Oh, we handled it. And my daughter and I are watching Sabrina Teenage Witch, which is
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.260]   nice. Oh, God. Oh, Lord.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:54.460]   Hey, you got to find something. Why don't you make her watch the Handmaid's Tale and
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:59.260]   learn something about life? Dear Lord, she wanted to watch – she saw children of men
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:05.980]   or something. Oh. It's just like what's that about? And I was like, "Oh, no, no,
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.580]   Patty." Oh, no. Sabrina Teenage Witch, good choice, good choice.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:16.100]   Good choice. So the new owners of HBO – so HBO is kind of – it's interesting. They
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:22.780]   have internally thought of themselves as bespoke content that they hand make great television
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:28.780]   like the Sopranos or Game of Thrones or Westworld. It's an event. It's Sunday night. It's
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:34.300]   worked for them. According to New York Times, they spent over the last – what was it?
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.500]   Three years they spent – let me get the numbers right because it's actually – it
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:45.340]   sounds like a good number. They spent $2 billion a year to make $6 billion in profit.
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:57.580]   Does it sound bad, right? Netflix, $11 billion in one year, all of a sudden AT&T, the new guy
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:04.900]   in charge. He's in charge of all of Warner Media, John Stanky, longtime AT&T executive
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:12.300]   with a very unfortunate name, comes in, sits the folks down at HBO and says, "There's
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:20.900]   a new sheriff in town." And what you're doing is not enough. We need hours a day, not hours
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:27.540]   a week, not hours a month. We need hours of viewing a day. You are competing with devices
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.620]   that sit in people's hands, capture their attention every 15 minutes. This is a quote
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:37.220]   because the recording of his town hall leaked. I want more hours – and this is from the
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.300]   New York Times – I want more hours of engagement. Why are more hours of engagement important
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:46.260]   because you get more data and information about a customer that then allows you to do
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:50.940]   things like monetize through alternate models of advertising as well as subscriptions, which
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.700]   I think is very important to play in tomorrow's world. Now, I know he didn't want this to
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:18:02.100]   get out, but the reason it got out, I would imagine, is because some HBO staff jaws dropped.
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:07.460]   This is such a shift for HBO. They wanted – I can shorthand it for you to be more like
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.260]   Netflix and less bespoke.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:19.860]   I'm not terribly surprised at what he said. There's also recode published the full text
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:26.340]   from the memo. I would encourage you to go look at both of those things because it looks
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:35.340]   like the New York Times cherry picked some of the stuff. They talked about actually bringing
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:44.220]   HBO is to be the front end of a bigger subscription business, which could include different programming.
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.980]   There's that in there. Apparently, he also never mentioned Netflix, but he did focus
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:55.980]   on Facebook and Amazon, which is worth thinking about too.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:04.420]   Yes, everyone's like, "Ah, the media business." He called himself a bellhead. These old
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:10.900]   telco guys, I totally see how the media business would be very snobby and not wanting part
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:19.820]   of this. John Stanky, he's a smart man. This is not an idiot. I have met John Stanky
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:26.700]   on several occasions. He is technically astute. He can get down and understand a business,
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:31.140]   whether it's deep intricacies of fiber or spectrum policy. I have no doubt he can figure
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:38.580]   out the media business. He's not going to set HBO on fire just to make it turn out crap,
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.940]   I promise. That's just me.
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:48.740]   Peter Kafka's recode article tries to dampen out the concerns of people who love HBO the
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:57.540]   way it is, the Game of Thrones, Soprano's Westworld fans. We already have a Netflix thank you.
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:04.020]   His premise is that AT&T said, "We're going to let all the time Warner properties run
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.980]   themselves with autonomy." I have to point out, Peter, you know better than that. That's
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:14.220]   exactly what every single company that acquires a new company says until they don't.
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:20.020]   And almost always in the long run, they don't. Frankly, the reason the Times article resonated
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:24.060]   is it makes perfect sense. That is, if you were going to just walk into a business and
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:30.100]   not be concerned with its reputation or its current fans and what they might want, but
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:34.220]   really how do we make this business compete in the modern world? You'd say exactly what
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:39.220]   Stanky said. So I'm not saying Stanky's dumb. I'm saying he's saying exactly probably
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:44.420]   the right from a business perspective, exactly the right thing. But I don't know if it's what
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:50.860]   we want HBO to be. Anyway, it's just something to pay attention to. There's no way AT&T lets
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.500]   HBO continue as it is. It's just not profitable enough.
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:02.580]   It is incredibly profitable. That is incredibly profitable, especially, well, even compared
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.500]   to a wireless phone business. I'm like, they're doing real well.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:17.300]   I don't know. AT&T spent $84 billion for Time Warner. They've got to justify a very expensive
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:24.380]   acquisition. They're already boosting their fees. Yeah. Well, they said, wait a minute.
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:29.020]   No, no, they're not. They said they would never do that. Did you not see the stories?
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.980]   No, I know. I'm kidding. That's maybe a bit. They said they would never, ever do that.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:40.780]   But immediately they did. Yeah. And this is a CC FTC. Oh, yeah. They said they'd lower
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:48.220]   prices. The the Warner the Time Warner merger is a synergy. See, this is how can you how
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:53.020]   can you be really naive about this? Every time a company wants to get regulatory approval,
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.900]   they said, no, the synergy is going to be good for consumers. It's going to lower profits.
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.020]   They tell the new company they're acquiring. Don't worry. We're not going to touch you.
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:07.500]   You've got a great business. We were. I remember this at tech TV. Comcast said worse. We think
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:12.540]   tech TV is doing a great job. We bought you because we love you before they disassembled
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:18.340]   it. I can't remember a single acquisition like that, a big acquisition where they promised
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.740]   the world and actually fulfilled that promise. No, they never do these things are, I mean,
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:29.220]   not notoriously bad. If you put conditions on it, then maybe, but otherwise no, like merger
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:35.860]   conditions. Anyway, I'm not I'm not to Peter Kafka's point on recode. I'm not all upset.
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:41.620]   I kind of expected it. And you know, we live in a golden age. If if you're a content creator,
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:48.100]   all you have to have is a good idea and a phone phone to call somebody, you're going to sell it.
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:53.780]   There's a lot of money at play. Apple's put a down more than a billion dollars. Amazon,
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.260]   I don't know how much they put into it. They spent almost a billion dollars for the rights
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:03.780]   alone to the Lord of the Rings. There's a lot of money out there. Don't get me started on that.
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:10.500]   I can't imagine that coming out in a positive way. I mean, what all they can do is go down or
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:15.060]   backwards with that, in my opinion. Oh, one word, one word, Kevin prequels.
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:21.940]   No, nobody wants to see a sequel. I'm sorry, a series on the sim, really, and then take the
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:28.740]   lost tail. Where was Gandalf all that time? You know, hanging out with Tom Bombadil.
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:36.260]   Yeah, I mean, Lord of the Rings soap opera. I don't think now. It's my furry toes curl.
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:44.980]   Let's take a little break when we come back talking about the battle of the dinosaurs,
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:51.700]   the giants, Firefox, and it's four year battle to get Google to treat it like any other browser.
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:58.740]   But first a word from WordPress. If you are a business, if you're a person, if you,
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:04.740]   everybody in the world owes it to themselves to have their own website. I'm not talking about
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:09.220]   a Facebook page. Mark Zuckerberg owns that. That's his website. I'm not talking about a
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:15.460]   Twitter page. That's Jack Dorsey's website. Talk about your own website. Maybe you say,
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.780]   well, I don't need that because I have Facebook or Twitter. You got to have a place. The people,
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.860]   when they search for your business name or they search for your personal name, that's the first
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:28.980]   thing that comes up. It's the place they go where you show your best stuff. You get new customers,
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:34.020]   you position yourself. And what better way to do it than a WordPress.com? I've been a WordPress
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:40.180]   user for years. I moved to WordPress.com from self-hosted WordPress because I didn't want to be doing
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:44.100]   all the updates and configuring and all that stuff. I found I spent more time tweaking my site than
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:49.860]   actually posting content. WordPress.com does all the coding, all the design, all the tools. They've
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:54.820]   got great support 24 hours a day, five days a week, Monday through Friday. They're there on
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:59.780]   weekends too. So you never have to worry about a technical problem. They take care of that for you.
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:06.500]   And it's less to have a site on WordPress.com than it is to host your own site. It's $4 a month.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:11.220]   I actually spent a little more because I want the business account. So I get the built-in SEO,
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:16.900]   the social sharing. So my fans and friends and customers can go out and share my stuff on their
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:22.020]   Facebook and Twitter. There's hundreds of great plugins. You can even with the business plan,
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.940]   bring your own themes and plugins. You don't need to though. They've got them all. I'm now using
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:31.540]   the Google ad plugin, which means my page at leoloport.com loads fast, much faster on mobile.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:38.820]   There is a reason why 31% of all websites run on WordPress. Can you believe that number?
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:46.020]   Almost a third of all the websites in the world. 31% run on WordPress. WordPress is amazing.
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:51.620]   It's awesome. And you've got to try it. Go to WordPress.com/twig. Get your website started.

[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:07.860]   Try it. You're going to see. I have to pitch my kids. My daughter said I need to have a website
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:13.940]   because I want to put my poetry up there in my drawings. I said, "Okay." I got her set up,
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:20.580]   WordPress.com. My son said he likes to take pictures. My pictures get squeezed and destroyed on Facebook
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:27.940]   because it's Henry. When you were born, I registered your name and I've been waiting for this day.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:37.140]   I'm going to hand it over. We set them up. WordPress.com/twig. 15% off right now.
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:43.940]   It's good enough for my kids. It's good enough for you. Kevin, your kids are grown.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:50.980]   Mostly. My son will be 21. That's grown two months. Two months. God bad news for you. That's grown.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:56.660]   I'm going to give him a WordPress site. Did you have the sense 21 years ago to register his domain name?
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:02.980]   No. I got him a Social Security number and I started a college fund for him.
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:10.180]   I did the first. I didn't do the last. I looked into how much I would have to save.
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.700]   I said, "There's no way I'm saving that much. You're going to college on your own time, kid."
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.460]   Stacey, did you have a domain name for your daughter?
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:21.220]   Of course we do. My husband is a domain name expert.
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:26.340]   Of course. Nowadays, you shouldn't name a kid unless you can find that domain name.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:34.660]   I think he registered all of, no, he's missing one of his nephews, but our nieces and nephews,
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.500]   many of them, he registered their names too.
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:41.540]   Yeah. I feel like you almost have to do that Google search before you name your kid these days.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:46.900]   It's tough, man. Hey, pro tip, when you're naming the kids,
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.180]   if you can't find the right domain name, just look for the country codes that have a different
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.260]   one. Yeah. Put a dot IO.
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:58.420]   That's the idea. I feel like, will I? Will I owe? I owe IO off to work. I go.
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:03.300]   Dot IO. Dot IO. What's dot IO is the Indian Ocean?
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.700]   Is it? Yeah. Okay.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.580]   Libya is dot OY. Bitly.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.380]   Yeah. There's some fun ones.
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:18.820]   Dot TV is Tuvalu. FMA.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:22.980]   I can't remember. Tuvalu. The island is sinking, but makes a lot of money.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.740]   I was just saying they're losing TV.
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:31.540]   I have dot AM, which is Armenia. I have Leo dot AM. That's actually,
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.700]   that's a pretty good domain. I don't want to lose that one.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.940]   One of my favorites is Peter Rojas. What's his?
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:42.740]   I have to look it up because I can't remember exactly what it is, but it's,
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.060]   I believe it's R O J dot A S.
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.980]   Oh, it's a great domain. R O J dot A S. It is.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.740]   Right. Nice.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.500]   Which is for what, what country is.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.300]   Austria.
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.700]   A S.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.780]   I do not know.
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.100]   It's easy enough.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.300]   Where's Andrew? Andrew would know.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.260]   A S Nick is American Samoa.
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.540]   There you go.
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:07.860]   That's a good one.
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:12.260]   Is there a dot TE? I could be a la poor dot.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:17.460]   Is there an EO? I could be L dot EO.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.220]   Oh, you can't have a single, single letter.
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:24.180]   And I was chagrinned because Leo.com
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:29.060]   was taken by the Royal Bank of Canada for their mascot, Leo.
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:34.420]   And then they let it, I gave up. I thought, oh, well, they'll never give that up.
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.060]   They gave it up. And some squatter got it.
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.620]   Oh, if I had just been watching.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.340]   Never, ever, ever give up.
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.380]   Never give up.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.020]   Firefox.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.740]   I'm watching the one in India, K-E-V dot I-N.
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.700]   Oh, wouldn't that be good?
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.940]   Oh, someone has it. I'm watching it.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.220]   Oh, you're watching it.
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.580]   I have for about 10 years now.
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.140]   Yeah, Kev.
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:56.980]   It's like watching paint dry.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.580]   That's the problem.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.100]   FM is the federated states of Micronesia.
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.780]   So I have Leo dot FM as well.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.380]   Oh,
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:13.060]   Firefox and the four year battle to get Google to treat it like a first class citizen.
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:16.420]   Firefox has gotten better and better, by the way.
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.980]   It's gone through that bad time when it was really a pig.
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.100]   And it's really fast.
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.780]   And I've actually started using it a lot.
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:30.820]   It turns out that Firefox doesn't work as well on Google pages.
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:34.820]   The Google flagship search page, Firefox doesn't even have the toolbar.
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.420]   You know, you can narrow searches by date.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:42.180]   Google flights occasionally will block Firefox.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.940]   Sometimes it'll just give you a degraded version.
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.300]   Google's explanation for this.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:53.780]   We're focused on providing a great experience for search across browsers
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.740]   and continue to work to improve this for all users.
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.740]   Firefox uses the Gecko engine.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.340]   Everybody else uses WebKit now, right?
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.420]   Firefox uses the Gecko engine,
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:06.500]   which requires us to do extensive testing on all of our features to insert compatibility.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.500]   Because it's different from WebKit,
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.900]   which is used by Chrome and Safari and UC and Opera.
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.300]   We've done this for Firefox desktop,
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.540]   but not have done the same level of testing for mobile.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:16.580]   Come on, Google.
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.220]   That's a really mealy mouth response.
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.100]   How hard can it be?
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.580]   I agree with you.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:25.460]   How hard can it be?
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.460]   I don't know.
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:31.620]   I'm looking at the two comparison images right now, and I get it.
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.980]   I mean, if you're on a phone and you're using whatever browser
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.740]   and you go to Google and you don't get the results,
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.140]   or you can't manipulate them the way you want or move around the page,
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.660]   you're not going to blame the browser.
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.980]   You're going to blame the company providing the information.
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.940]   That's a good point.
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:46.500]   Probably unfairly.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.380]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:51.780]   So on the left is a Chrome version of the Google Search for World Cup.
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.420]   On the right is the Firefox mobile version.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.740]   Funny thing is, the Firefox mobile on iOS uses WebKit.
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.180]   I think it does on Android as well.
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.420]   So it's not even Gecko.
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.460]   Do you think it's anti-competitive?
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.180]   Or do you think it's--
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.860]   I mean, I think it's anti-competitive.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:08.820]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:09.540]   That's probably--
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.540]   Yeah, it's probably on their nose.
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:13.060]   I mean, because also look at how--
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.940]   Well, airman.
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.300]   Every time I use Firefox on Windows,
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:23.460]   Chrome bitches at me when I go to Google page,
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:26.180]   Microsoft bitches at me when I go to Microsoft.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.060]   You should be using Edge.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:27.940]   You should be using Chrome.
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.380]   You should be using Edge.
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:29.940]   Why?
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.540]   Please stop the bickering.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.060]   Just--
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:38.100]   You know, part of it though is if you look at the Google Search results in Chrome,
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.580]   you've got these Google cards, right?
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.300]   Is that really the use of a web standard?
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.100]   No, it's the way Google wants them to be shown.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.580]   So now they can say, well, look, that doesn't look as good,
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:52.420]   because we have these nice flashy cards that just get you right to the information.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.620]   So I'm not too keen on this whole thing personally,
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.140]   with Google's doing.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.700]   It does not--
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.980]   And Mozilla keeps yelling at Google about everything.
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.060]   Mozilla's yelling at everybody about everything.
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:03.220]   So--
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.100]   That's a good point.
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.100]   This is kind of Mozilla's thing too.
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.420]   Yeah, the folks behind Firefox, yeah.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:14.580]   According to the Washington Post, Google may have some big issues coming up in Europe,
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.580]   not over this, although that could also be a cause for further action.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:25.540]   But Google may be getting fined billions this month from European regulators
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:30.260]   for forts, saying it's search and web browsing tools on the makers of Android smartphone.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:35.220]   So Google's already got a big fine over the shopping thing,
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:40.500]   over favoring according to the EU, Google Sites over competitor's sites.
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.300]   What was that fine?
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.980]   It was a lot of money.
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:51.860]   And now they're facing maybe even a larger fine over what the EU sees as anti-competitive
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:58.900]   measures against people who are trying to make use Android without using Google.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.100]   I was--
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:07.140]   This reminded me of the Microsoft EU fine, or like I was not ever covering that directly.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:07.380]   So--
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:12.340]   But it seemed related, the same arguments being made, that you can't download one app without
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:13.780]   downloading the whole thing.
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.940]   So I didn't know if that was a better parallel.
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:22.900]   It's similar, but it's different in that this is not the user's downloading something.
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:29.700]   This is the handset makers signing a contract with Google for what they call GMS, Google Mobile
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:34.100]   Services. And they have to have all of the Google apps in order to do that.
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.300]   There's no picking and choosing.
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.260]   That's the contract.
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:41.620]   So it's similar, but it's different because it's not consumers who are making the choice here.
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.180]   Now it's the handset makers that force the choice on the consumers.
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:49.860]   The EU says device makers like HTC and Samsung face an anti-competitive choice,
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:54.580]   set Google search as the default search service, offer Google's Chrome browser,
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.820]   or lose access to Android's app store.
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.220]   That's part of the Google services.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.820]   Without the app store, you got to make your own.
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:08.580]   And you may well not have the millions of apps that Google offers.
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.900]   So really, there is a pretty big stick.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:16.100]   And it's really terrible for end consumers because the Google App Store does things to
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:19.460]   enforce some security that generic app stores may not.
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.980]   That's a big risk for users.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:30.500]   So potentially a fairly large find to add to that $2.7 billion find they got last year.
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.700]   They're appealing that find.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.060]   And I imagine they'd appeal this one.
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:41.780]   See if Jeff were here, I'm sure he'd have something to say in this.
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.020]   He's not.
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:44.580]   So there.
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:49.700]   I wish I could argue here, but I've got really no great argument.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.900]   You know, it's hard for Google.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:58.660]   I'll try to play somewhere in between Jeff and you guys.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:03.300]   It's hard for Google because, see, Apple doesn't have, isn't faced with the same issue
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.300]   because nobody else makes iOS phones.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:11.060]   So there's no necessity to strongarm anybody.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.900]   Google did the right thing.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.420]   They made Android open source.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:19.940]   So it means any manufacturer, including by the way, Amazon can take the Android code,
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:24.820]   make their own version of Android, which Amazon has done with fire and distribute it.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:32.420]   Google has one little thing that they do, which is, well, okay, but if you want the App Store,
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:39.700]   you got to take Gmail, you got to take Chrome, you got to make the default search engine be Google.
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.220]   And that doesn't seem unfair.
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.740]   That seems like a reasonable thing.
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.460]   It's all bundled together.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:51.380]   But if you don't care about the App Store, look, we've made Android available free for you to use.
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:51.860]   It's free.
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:56.980]   And it's why so many things run Android because it's free.
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:02.420]   And you can install or sideload the Android apps.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.620]   Get them from Google Play, of course.
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.740]   You get them from somewhere else.
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:08.980]   And there's security risks, as they said mentioned, that a safest place would be through the place
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.820]   door. But if you don't have access to it, you can still get those Android apps.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.580]   You used to be able to start when I would install a ROM on my Android device,
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:21.860]   you would the ROMs would not come with Google services, but you would download G apps or something
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:22.820]   as separate file.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.700]   Is that illegal or is that legal? Is that okay?
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:30.020]   You would think Google would say fine because you're going to be using our services now.
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:30.740]   You would think so.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.740]   I almost don't want to answer because that's exactly what I did to the Amazon Fire HD 10
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.540]   tablet that I have.
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:36.020]   Right.
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:39.660]   Sorry. So any
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.940]   It's going to end the show, go back and find it white.
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:50.500]   So it's funny because Apple didn't face this just by being a closed source and saying,
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.540]   no, it's a very.
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:58.020]   So this is part of an argument about, yeah, the nature of anti-competitiveness in kind of
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:02.100]   a software driven world, like how far can you go when
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:08.340]   in these in you could make the point where, I mean, the point that antitrust people are looking at
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.220]   is well, you buy an Apple phone or a Google phone, fine.
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.180]   You know, you can get those are apples to apples, no pun intended.
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:20.180]   On the software side, there's a bunch of people clamoring for Android because the other so
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.980]   closed off. So where do we draw the line?
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:26.340]   And I think it's going to be a harder and harder decision to make,
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:30.820]   especially when we start thinking about how data, the ability to collect data is going to
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:35.620]   influence the services you're able to offer. So looking at something like, is it going to
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:42.020]   be anti-competitive in a few years or like Google photos to be so good because they have access to
[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:50.900]   all of this data? I don't know. I don't. I'm not a lawyer. I'm looking on Quora and somebody
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:56.660]   else who says I'm not a lawyer says it's almost certainly legal to do what Kevin did. You just
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:01.060]   change a switch in the settings on your on your fire tablet and you click a link and you download
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:07.140]   Google Play services in the Play Store. And frankly, why would Google try to stop that?
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:10.660]   Because you're saying I want to use your services. Exactly.
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:19.780]   Exactly. That if you're Samsung and you want to pre-install the Google Store, you have to sign
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:23.780]   the agreement with Google that you're going to do all those things. And that's what the EU is upset
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:28.900]   about. I don't know. I feel like Google should be allowed to do this because they did the right
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:35.540]   thing, which is they allowed Android to be given away for free. So that's not exactly as strongly
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:40.900]   worded as Jeff Jarvis might have had it. But I think I've somewhat represented the Jarvis position.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:50.020]   Let's take a little break and have more. What is for dinner tonight, Stacey? We're going to have
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:56.020]   something delicious. Oh, no, we're eating out tonight. Sorry. That's delicious. That's
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:02.260]   delicious. Oh, that's true. You live in Austin, Texas. There. Yes. There will be tacos. There will
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:08.260]   be tacos. There will be. Kevin, remind me, where do you where do you hang your hat?
[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:13.540]   In between Philadelphia and Quaker Town in Pennsylvania. So you can go out and get a nice
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:18.180]   hot soft pretzel dip and butter. I don't need the butter, but yes.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:25.460]   You need. I'm looking at you. You need the butter, dude. You need to fatten up a little bit.
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:29.780]   No, no. I don't need a flavorable football club tattoo. Give it some
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:35.060]   swell it out there a little bit. The problem is for my pretzels, it's just a 10 minute walk down
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:38.740]   the street. I don't get enough exercise to get the pretzel from. Well, I won't say from where
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:45.460]   because last time that was a whole debacle. Why? What happened? Did you? Do you remember
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:52.260]   Wawa store? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no, that we were going on and on about Wawa. I felt so bad.
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:57.060]   What was what's bad about Wawa? Oh, nothing. I must have been. I think it's awesome. No,
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.940]   you were there. You were there. Jeff was saying how wonderful it is. And then we
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:04.740]   started looking up where how many stores they had in the East Coast. And we got we got sucked
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:10.580]   into the Wawa discussion. We went down the Wawa rabbit hole. Oh, man, Kevin, we go down.
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:15.380]   That's all we do. That's all we do. Is your show that you guys do is a little bit more
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:20.100]   structured and directed? We yes, we we try to focus only on IOT.
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:26.420]   There's some singing. Kevin, Kevin does. Not by me. Not by Kevin. Never by Kevin.
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:34.340]   So Stacey sings? Oh, yeah. She doesn't realize that I've been recording the all her singing,
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.260]   you know, for three years now, unbeknownst to her. And we're going to have a greatest hits
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:43.060]   podcast one time. You'll hear Stacey. Can we have ringtones of Stacey singing?
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:51.700]   No problem. Best thing I've ever had in my life, I think. One of the best things I was in a
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:58.820]   farmer's market in Philly. And there was a Pennsylvania Dutch booth, young lady with a little lace cap,
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:09.620]   fresh, hot, big pretzel with salt. And she dipped it in melted butter. And I took one bite and I
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:15.220]   said, I'm moving to Philadelphia. In fact, I'm moving in with you, young lady. It was the best
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:20.100]   thing I ever had in my life. Oh, my God, was that good? You might have to give up electricity to do
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:29.460]   that. I hear the Amish these days are very technology focused. I don't know. It's a good I
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:33.700]   they could well be. I mean, I still see the the carts and the horses every once in a while. And
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:39.380]   we just moved my step daughter out to Kutztown University, which is about. Yeah, 45
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:45.060]   minutes northwest of us. And we look like the Amish World Series, a bunch of guys playing baseball.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:51.060]   I mean, I was, you know, they're all over. I don't know how technically savvy they are.
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:56.580]   Well, let me just refer you to this NPR story from a few years back. Amish community, not anti
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:01.220]   technology, just more thoughtful. Here's one of their three horse buggies. They all have electric
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:07.060]   lights powered by rechargeable batteries. One even has windshield electric windshield wipers.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:12.820]   One Amish man in Lancaster County, P H X his voicemail about four times a day is shop is
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:17.540]   equipped with a propane powered forklift hydraulic powered saws cordless drills in a refrigerated
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:24.100]   tank where milk from the dairy cows is stored. So they are they don't consider themselves
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:32.740]   anti technology. Just careful. Good. We could probably do that. Yeah. Maybe that's the new Amish
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:38.820]   mode on Android P. There we go. You can only check your voicemail four times a week.
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:44.100]   Oh, I never checked my voicemail. That'd be fine. Who checks their voicemail ever?
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:51.140]   You know, the notification stays at the top of your thing and it drives me nuts. So I every like
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:55.460]   twice a week or not twice a month, I'll check my voicemail. That's your by the way, that's your
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:44:01.860]   carrier. I know. It's very annoying. You have 18 T I bet. I have Verizon Verizon even more. Same
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:08.580]   difference. Yeah. Very and their voicemail like their voicemail is so archaic. It drives me
[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:12.820]   absolutely bonkers. I'm like, come on, you guys. Do you really want to charge me? I think it's like
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:17.140]   three bucks a month for a visual voicemail. Yeah, two more tickets. Same thing. It's crazy. Come
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:26.020]   on, people crazy. I refuse. Whatever kind of go ahead Google five. Oh, yeah. Well, I have a Google
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:32.180]   voice number, but yeah, I asked people in my message not to leave a voicemail. Yeah, but doctors do,
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:37.620]   you know, all those people. Yeah. I do. She never gets back to me.
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:44.900]   I could make this my pick of the week, actually. It might be something you'd like.
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:52.660]   So I was a big Jabber fan way back in the way back. Oh, yeah, me too. Yeah. Everybody was till
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:57.300]   Google said, Oh, we did a deprecated blah, blah, blah, but it was a really, I thought a great
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:03.300]   chat protocol that could be much more than chat. It supported XML and it was very extensible.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:10.740]   Well, I I found this interesting service jump.chat JMP.chat.
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:16.340]   And it so it gives you a real phone number. You can choose your area code.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:23.700]   You can use it as a Jabber phone number. So you can send texts. People can call it,
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:29.860]   but they can't talk to you. They can only leave a message, which then appears in your inbox
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:41.700]   as a playable wave file and text. And so I created a phone number. It's a it's a it's a bit of a
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:47.940]   process. You can try it free for 30 days. And then it's 35 bucks a year or $3 a month.
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:54.740]   So what you do is you create a Jabber ID on this site in Germany called dismail.de.
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:46:00.100]   And that can be anything. You're not really going to use that publicly. There are Jabber clients
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:04.820]   for all the mobile platforms when you've been using conversations on Google Play.
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:10.260]   Then I imagine they're using Twilio or something like it, but you can get a number
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:14.020]   for jump.chat. And when you give out that number,
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:19.700]   you put it on your business cards, but this way people call, you can't talk to them.
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:26.260]   They don't leave one of those unusable, call this number, press seven to delete,
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:32.660]   eight to listen or save. They leave a text message in this Jabber client. So you can have like a
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:38.260]   separate messaging client that's just for text phone messages to this special number.
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:44.260]   So I immediately did this. And I've served for 35 bucks a year. I have a four way.
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:49.940]   It's not quite Google voice. It's an interesting, it's kind of an alternative thing. I thought
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:56.980]   this was really, really great. I set this up yesterday. Jump. The JMP.chat. It's a Java messaging
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:02.580]   for phones, I guess is what JMP stands for. We could stay safe. We could use that for
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:07.140]   CES planning and just give everybody all that phone number. We never have to talk to anybody.
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:12.820]   Yeah. So I plan to use this when I make appointments, when I put it on your business card.
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:17.540]   For your show, you could create a special number that people could leave messages that you'd have
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:23.220]   the audio, you could play back. You can read the text. I mean, it seems to be exactly the same
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:32.820]   capability of transcription as Google's fire voice. I should maybe we should do that, Kevin,
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:37.540]   for the Kevin's in the midst of a technical challenge.
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:44.740]   Are you trying to write this in Python, dude? I already did. Not this. Not this. No, Twilio.
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:48.740]   Twilio will give you the back end for all that stuff. Exactly. That's what I did. I took Twilio
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:53.860]   and Python. I made our IoT voicemail hotline. Right. How long did that take you?
[00:47:53.860 --> 00:48:00.020]   Day or two. I'll say, I don't know. It was a year ago. So it was a while ago.
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:04.980]   It works. Can you own it? Yeah. But I run it on a Raspberry Pi.
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:11.060]   Which is fine. When the dog decides when Norm says, I'm going to go to an RZ.
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:15.620]   Yeah. Exactly. Or the Internet's out. So I just moved it over to Google Cloud.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:20.100]   And what I thought was going to be free isn't free. So now I'm going to go to AWS.
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:25.860]   Well, here's the other thing. You can send unlimited text messages from that number.
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:32.340]   So what you could do is have an IoT number that you say, leave us a message or whatever.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:38.420]   And if you want to be on our mailing list, send us a message. And then you can add that to a
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:44.580]   contact list and send out messages to everybody. Should I give out that number and my number and
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:52.260]   see what happens? What could possibly go wrong? What could possibly go wrong?
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:58.980]   So yeah, I'll give out my here. Let me see. I have to, I can't remember it now.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:04.180]   It's a 415 number, which I don't see. I don't have a 415 number. And I thought I should have a 415
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:12.100]   number. Makes you look legit. Makes you look too legit to quit. Let me open the conversations
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:17.780]   because that's where that's my jabber client. Oh, I never set it up on here. I got it on this
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:25.300]   phone, too many phones on IO. I'm just thinking how I can't find my phone. So the opposite
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:30.180]   opposite problem. Clearly not Amish. The phone number.
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:39.220]   Let's let the telephone begin. Yeah. Well, this is this is actually a good test, isn't it?
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:46.580]   This is I don't hear those phones ringing. 415-604. I kind of give out the right number,
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.020]   though. If I give out the wrong number, I'm going to.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:58.740]   Hey, not going to be happy at all. 415-604. 1630, I'm pretty sure.
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:05.380]   Let me verify. Let me verify that.
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:15.700]   Crap. I can't. Yeah. 1360. Oops. 415-604-1360. 415. Everybody call that number right now.
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:23.540]   405-604-1360. Leave a message, send it. You could text it. You could MMS it. It's using jabber,
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:29.460]   but you don't have to use a jabber client. You can use any SMS client. You can call that number.
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:32.900]   Now, you don't get a voicemail message. When you call the number, you get a beep.
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:39.780]   Because, but I think most people are conditioned if they hear, "boop," to start talking.
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:46.580]   It would be nice if you could say, "Hi, this is Kevin Tofel, and this is Stacey Ikenbotham.
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.460]   I want to sing a song, but instead, why don't you leave us a message?"
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:52.420]   Which is very close to the one we have.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:57.140]   We recorded an MP3, and we just host that off Twilio.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:01.540]   We could change it whenever we want. We could make it seasonally specific.
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:07.300]   Chatham wants to know 415-604-1360. We'll see. The lines are open.
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:10.660]   The lines are open. I've done this many, many times, because, you know,
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:16.820]   all of this stuff is cheap and easy now. Thanks to Twilio, probably, is the back end for most
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:20.260]   of this stuff. It's really kind of neat. How much is a Twilio account for a phone number?
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:24.340]   It's very expensive.
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:28.500]   I figured it's less than 35 bucks a year, because that's what I'm paying.
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:35.220]   If we pay like three tenths of a penny for every incoming call or something,
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:35.780]   that's ridiculous.
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:39.700]   See, at this point, I think it's free. God, I hope so.
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:43.940]   Hey, everybody call me and leave long lines.
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:49.380]   So we're going to talk Chromebooks in a second, of course, because Kevin is the Chromebook wizard
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:58.740]   and crostini. I'm loving it, but first, a word from last pass. Last pass works great in your
[00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:03.700]   Chromebook. Works great in your Android phone, your iOS, your Windows, your Mac, your Linux.
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:06.740]   That's one of the reasons I use LastPass everywhere.
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:11.620]   Every one of my passwords is in LastPass. I only have to remember the last pass password.
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:18.820]   It unlocks and auto fills everywhere I am. It generates long, strong passwords.
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:23.540]   It helps me do a security checkup so that I don't have the same password again and again on site
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:32.260]   after site. Look, this is clearly the answer to the password conundrum, and everybody has it,
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:36.580]   especially if you're in business. If you think of it, if you think of the problem that a business
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:41.380]   faces, because, well, we've had that problem. We had an engineer put all of the passwords on a
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:47.620]   website that he could easily get to, but also, could everybody else. That's when we set up LastPass
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:52.100]   Enterprise. LastPass Enterprise means that everybody in the enterprise can have access to the
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:58.180]   passwords they need. You can actually share passwords without them even seeing it, so you can
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:04.100]   change it. It's automatically changed for them. You can assign roles, so only certain people have
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:09.780]   access to certain things. Your employees don't have to write passwords down. Remember them?
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:16.580]   They, it just works. Over 81% of all the breaches we hear about every day are caused by weak or
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:24.100]   reused passwords. That's why 13 million people trust LastPass. 33,000 businesses use LastPass.
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:27.700]   We've been using LastPass for a couple of years, and one of the things, I believe in it so much
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:31.220]   that we do for all our employees is we give them a LastPass personal account as well,
[00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:37.300]   so that they are protected in their regular life too. That's how important it is.
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:42.180]   When you use LastPass Enterprise, you can control your password policies. For instance,
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:47.940]   we require two-factor. You don't have to use two-factor to use LastPass, but we require it
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:53.140]   of our employees. We can have automatic, and this is, for our employees, we do this, I think every
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:54:00.420]   six months, all the passwords reset. That way, if an employee leaves and we forget to change
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:05.140]   or whatever, it's nice to you. All the password password requirements are up to you too. We make
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:10.740]   sure that they use LongMaster passwords. You can restrict access to specific devices and locations.
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:15.540]   So for instance, when I was in Japan, I couldn't at first log in, because it said,
[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:21.220]   "Your LastPass is set to be used in Petaloma. What are you doing in Japan?" So I had to jump
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:24.980]   through some extra hoops, which is, "I was glad." I said, "Okay, in this case, for the next three
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:31.220]   weeks, Japan's okay." That's the kind of thing you want. You can figure over 100 policies,
[00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:38.500]   access security reports, create shared folders, organize database logins, SSH keys, software licenses.
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:44.740]   It's not just passwords. I use LastPass notes to keep all of the documents,
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:52.500]   our EIN numbers, Social Security numbers, payroll information. It's all secure. Its data is encrypted
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:58.180]   and decrypted at the device level. Data stored in the vault is always secret, even from LastPass,
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:05.940]   even from LastPass. So this is the right way to go. You and your employees could take the
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:10.500]   LastPass security challenge. So it tells you where there's weaknesses. So you can fix them.
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:15.700]   It's the first thing we did in the business. We made sure all the passwords were strong and long
[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:21.540]   and compliant. So there's LastPass for all sorts of users. LastPass premium for personal use,
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:26.340]   LastPass families for the family, LastPass teams for teams of 50 or fewer,
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:31.620]   LastPass enterprise for the business as that's what we use. At work and at home, fix your
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:36.820]   password woes with LastPass. It's the number one most preferred password manager.
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:43.940]   And it's really a big part of our business. It has been for years. And I've used LastPass forever
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:49.300]   practically since they started. Steve Gibson interviewed Joe Seagrist. Joe was very kind.
[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:52.820]   Let him look at all the code Steve gave it. His seal of approval started using LastPass.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:58.580]   That was some years ago. We love it. LastPass.com/twip, find out more,
[00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:02.660]   get signed up and get your business signed up. Because if you think about it,
[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:07.300]   if your bookkeeper has access to your QuickBooks and has the password,
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:15.380]   if he or she leaves, they still have the password. LastPass.com/twit, you better protect that stuff.
[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:23.380]   LastPass.com/twit. We're very grateful to LastPass for keeping all our stuff safe and secure.
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:29.620]   So Kevin is the Chromebook guy. I'm really pleased that you started this website, Kevin.
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:34.980]   That's fantastic. It was a good time actually. I mean, I've been working with Chromebooks since
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:40.500]   day one when they first started. And I got away from them and had some free time. And just one
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:45.460]   weekend in March said, "Let me start up a blog on Chromebooks." And it was perfect timing. There's
[00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:51.140]   so much innovation coming right now between hardware, software. It's perfect.
[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:58.500]   Aboutcrumbooks.com. Nice and simple. And you were the one who told me about Christina. You could see
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:02.740]   you've got a most recent article is, "What are the good Linux apps to install?"
[00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:07.700]   Yeah, that's a question I get from a lot of people who are not using Christianity.
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:12.740]   And for those who don't know, Christianity is a Google project to bring full Linux apps to
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:19.300]   Chromebooks, even Chrome boxes, any Chrome OS device actually. And the question I get is,
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:22.820]   "Well, when I get, when I can do the Christianity stuff on the stable channel,
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:27.460]   because it's in dev now, the dev channel, what do I install?" And I'm like, "You know what? That's
[00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:32.100]   a great question." So everybody's different. I mean, I put some IDEs for coding on mine. I put
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:37.140]   Skype on mine. It's not working yet because there's no audio support. But people maybe don't want
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:44.580]   those, but maybe you want, I don't know. I either finding a wiki, a finding Windows or Linux
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:47.700]   equivalents of Windows apps. I think maybe that'll help people.
[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:54.980]   This is so much better than what Microsoft has done with their Linux subsystem, because it's
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:58:01.460]   real Linux, just Debian on here. And so I'm a little concerned, but I'll talk about it a little bit,
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:07.140]   but I install immediately Git and Keybase and all the stuff, all the command line only,
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:11.140]   all command line stuff. And as you can see, Emacs, and I installed SpaceMax,
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:17.700]   the Haskell compiler, the Python interpreter, all the stuff that I use day in day out.
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:27.220]   And what it does is kind of interesting. A Chromebook as configured is really kind of a safe, secure
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:34.820]   device for limited use, for people who don't need Photoshop or 3D design tools, stuff like that.
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:40.820]   Although I have to say with Adobe Fuse, which is a video editor that's coming soon to Chrome OS,
[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:49.140]   this might be changing. But what's interesting is, I don't, the middle stuff is not what I'm
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:54.900]   worried about. The fact that I can use Linux and the command line is huge for me. This makes this
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:59:01.220]   like my go to computer now. And if you have a fairly fast computer, how does the
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:03.380]   crostini work on the slower machines?
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:10.020]   It depends. I would say not as good. If you're going to do this, if you're going to do this,
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:16.340]   you probably want at least a core i3 processor. Even 4Gram is pushing it, I believe.
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:24.900]   That's what this HP Chromebook X2 is that I have. And it's working. But it's a good step behind
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:29.460]   the Pixelbook. And then once you start into the 2 and 300-eloch Chromebooks, I don't know.
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:32.420]   I mean, we're asking an awful lot of that hardware at that point.
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:39.300]   I just as a kind of a give-you-an-idea, e-max, I run on every box, all the max box, all the
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:44.660]   next boxes. And normally, e-max, I run it as a demon, which you can do, which is interesting on
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:49.700]   crostini. So it could stay in the background and load pretty fast. Because that initial load is
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:54.180]   slow. I've never really found it that slow on most machines on this. It's eight seconds,
[00:59:54.180 --> 01:00:00.820]   because I have Space Max and 160 packages. There's a lot to load. And that eight seconds feels long.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:06.100]   So it is one of those things where it's not going to be as snappy as a dedicated Linux
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.980]   box or even Mac OS running a command line.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:14.900]   Now, the funny thing is you mentioned, it's all command line to install your packages and
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:22.420]   hitting the repository to install apps. There's code changes that Google is working on actual
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:28.740]   installing of Debian packages. Oh, nice. Well, I use App. You can use, you know,
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:34.100]   you can app to get install anything in the Debian repository. Which version of it is this stretch?
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:38.660]   What's on here? This is stretch stretch. Okay. Yeah. I think because that's the long-term
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:44.180]   support. It's stable. It's the stable branch. Yeah. And that's what you want. Because you don't.
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:49.220]   But it keeps you good up to date it. I mean, every time I launch it, and I put the terminal in my
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:54.900]   menu bar. So it's very easy. Just click the terminal. It's launched. I'm running bash right now. I'll
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:01:01.140]   probably switch that over to fish, my preferred command line tool. You know, pseudo apt update,
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:05.860]   pseudo apt upgrade, and all your apps are updated. Just as you would expect on any Linux box.
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:12.820]   I like it. I like it a lot. It really makes a Chromebook a lot more useful for something like
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:17.460]   you. You want to use Python. You don't have to log into a Raspberry Pi with SSH anymore. You
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:22.340]   could just do it on your Chrome. Exactly. And the thing is you had noted how secure that the
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:28.980]   Chromebooks are because everything is from top to bottom handled by Google. It's got the TPM chip
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:34.340]   in the devices. The way they've done this, I don't think, I don't feel they've compromised
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:39.780]   security at all because it's all a sandbox container. And your secure boot still turned on.
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:43.780]   You don't disable that. You don't have to run in developer mode.
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:50.340]   But that raises the one concern. I don't want to spend too much. That's one of the reasons I'm
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:54.580]   using space max. Usually I use a custom Emacs configuration that's very complicated.
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:02:00.660]   I don't want to invest a lot of time in setting this up because I'm worried that it's, you know,
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:04.020]   at some point I'm a powerwash it and I have to do the whole thing over again.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:10.820]   That's a valid concern. But I don't have the information handy right now, but I will look it up
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:14.500]   and maybe you can edit it to the show notes. You can take snapshots of the containers.
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:20.580]   And then basically image them and then restore them so that's exactly what I want.
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:26.340]   Yeah, because this is for people who are interested in the nitty gritty. If you take a look,
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:34.900]   it's LXC and LXC is one of the components here. And it's been in Linux forever.
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:38.900]   And there's a lot of tools and ways to use it. And that's what Google is using to create the
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:45.380]   container. So is it a true root like like crouton was or I don't believe so.
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:48.740]   Okay, I don't believe so. LXC is a container technology like Docker.
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:55.140]   So that's nice. So it's running in a container which I could then snapshot
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:59.620]   and restore. So I would snapshot it and save it somewhere. You want to save it securely because
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:05.140]   you've got like I have all my GPG keys in here and all that. I save my dot files. I have a
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:10.260]   get repost secure get repository with my dot files. I guess I could just do that. But it would be
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:14.340]   nice, much nicer if I don't have to reinstall it if I just had a container and I could,
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:18.980]   that would be really nice. Yeah, there's so much going on with this. This is always changing.
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:23.940]   Every week I find five new things that are happening are coming and it's really exciting
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:28.340]   right now. When will it be as hard to keep up with? When will it be in the regular channel in the
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:36.580]   standard stable? So it was going to be in stable 68, but then they pushed it back to 69. So that's
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:44.260]   soon. It is soon. But again, it's also only on certain devices. Because of the Linux
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:49.060]   kernel that they use and so on and so forth. So Stacy, if you get a Chromebook, get one with
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:54.020]   Linux kernel four dot four. That's all I can tell you. Okay. Well, I'm not going to ask you until
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:04:00.580]   like six months from now. Does your daughter use Chromebooks in school? No, they use MacBooks.
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:05.060]   MacBooks. Wow. That's nice actually. But expensive for the parents.
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:12.100]   Well, she has my old computer. And then I bought a new computer. She might get this one,
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:15.780]   or I might just get her a Chromebook. She doesn't get to keep her school computer.
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:19.700]   Everything's on Google. So you just log in and you've got everything.
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:27.620]   This pixel book is awfully nice, but it's expensive as that. I got the base model, which is a thousand
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:33.300]   bucks. It's pretty. I'm watching you fling that thing around. It's so light. It's nice.
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:37.540]   You don't mind carrying around. It comes with a pencil. So I don't do any illustration. But if
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:43.220]   a kid wanted to, this is a really well. I buy my child a thousand dollar computer.
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:47.540]   I don't blame you. Look what it does though. I was watching the World Cup on it and the fact
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:54.340]   that I can, you know, tent it like that makes it really great for watching TV. No, I really like
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:05:00.420]   this. I think I think Best Buy still has them. I think Best Buy still has them for about seven,
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:05.860]   twenty to seven fifty right now. That's attractive. Yeah. That's very attractive. Considering that
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:12.260]   Chromebook X2 was $600. So what is Google's? It's kind of futile to ask this. It's like asking,
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:17.220]   what is Google's messaging strategy? What is Google's Chrome OS strategy? Because it's a little
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:22.260]   confusing. You had Chrome OS, then you added Android store to it. Now you've got Linux on it.
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:26.260]   It's all over the place. What is it? One OS to rule them all.
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:31.780]   I don't know until they figure out what they're doing with Fuchsia. And I don't know really much
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:37.300]   about Fuchsia, so I won't go there. This is their way to say, look, we used to be the platform that
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:41.300]   was saved, secure, and you're limited to web apps. We thought that was good, but maybe some people
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:47.540]   didn't. Guess what? Now we have probably the most apps available on our computers because we have
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:55.940]   Linux. We have Android and we have a web. Fuchsia, which is yet another operating system from Google,
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:59.300]   but it takes a while to develop an operating system from scratch.
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:06.980]   The last one took me two weeks. It's hard. It's a lot of time. That kernel gets every time.
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:12.180]   So Linux was the kernel for both the Android and for Chrome OS. They didn't really have to
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:18.180]   develop from scratch. Fuchsia, they're doing from scratch. And they've been working on it for at
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:24.180]   least five years. I think it's going to be a year or two more, I would guess. But maybe not.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:30.980]   Did you ever install Fuchsia? Because you can install it. You can. I didn't. I saw Ron and
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:34.740]   Matio do it. And when I saw how little you could do with it, I'm like, I think Ron.
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:41.140]   Exactly. Thanks, Ron. You saved me some time. And I could be wrong. Stacey, have we ever heard
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:46.660]   about Fuchsia being part of some embedded platforms? Or am I confusing with something else?
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:48.900]   I think you're confusing it with them. Oh, God.
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:57.540]   Brillo, and we, maybe? I think it's Zircon. No, I don't think. Andromeda?
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:02.180]   We have not talked about Fuchsia being part of embedded stuff. Maybe I'm confusing with the
[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:08.180]   Android things or something right now. So which was Brillo? According to a tech radar, Google Fuchsia
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:14.100]   is a hybrid OS comprised of two distinct but connected user interfaces, a phone centric
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:22.500]   one code named Armadillo. And a traditional desktop UINAM copy bar. This is actually from a 9 to 5 Google.
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:27.380]   That makes sense because if you're going to, if you're Google and you're going to develop from
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:30.660]   scratch, you want one that's going to work on Android devices and you want one that's going to
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:36.580]   work on. I lied to you, Kevin. They did say that it could work on embedded devices that it was
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:42.340]   going to work on everything. Every. So yes. Wow. God, that was all the way back in like 2016.
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:48.900]   No wonder I don't remember. Yeah. You're right, Kevin. Microkernel. I can't
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:51.620]   seem to remember microkernel for Fuchsia that they were going to use for that.
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:58.420]   They have been gradually transferring people over. Earlier this year, the former head of
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:04.740]   Android platform security, Nick Kralovich went to define security, the Fuchsia's department. That
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:09.620]   means, well, of course, if you're building a OS today from the ground up, you've got to do
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:14.820]   security from the ground up, but it might be a little bit farther along than just a laboratory
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:20.500]   project. But knowing how long it takes to develop an operating system for scratch, knowing
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:27.940]   what state it was in when we're on a Mario installed it just earlier this year, I think it's a ways off.
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:33.940]   And so until then, you have this beast with three backs. That's the Chrome OS.
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:40.500]   Yeah, but you know what? A lot of people are complaining about Chromebooks are getting too
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:45.780]   complex now because of all these additions and Chrome's. Yeah. Well, it can be. It can be.
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:49.540]   You don't need to enable Linux apps right off the bat. That's a setting. You don't turn on.
[01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:53.700]   Or you don't need to enable exactly Google Play Store. Turn it off. And you still have the same
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:58.020]   Chromebook that you've always had. I don't know. I don't think people realize that.
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:02.340]   Yeah, you get the choice. And I think it was not forcing this just like putting Linux on Windows.
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:08.260]   Google's doing trying to do the same thing Microsoft did, which is to appeal to a certain group of
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:13.060]   people, Sysubins and others who really wouldn't consider Chrome OS. But now you can have a good
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:17.940]   terminal. You can have all the pen testing tools, command line stuff. You could put,
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:26.180]   you know, wire shark or anything you want to put on there will work. I presume, I don't know,
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:30.980]   but I presume you have access to the networking stack and all of that stuff. Is it how isolated
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:36.020]   is it from the hardware? I think it's still pretty isolated. In fact, I mean,
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:39.860]   because they're still working on a lot of the hardware components, there's no graphic GPU
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:45.300]   acceleration, for example, audio. I wouldn't want to put any X window stuff on it at all.
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:51.060]   It's not powerful enough or fast enough for graphical interfaces. Yeah, especially if you're
[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:54.740]   going to have this run across a range of Chromebooks that some might be. I mean,
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:10:01.220]   there are some of the ARM based ones actually supported already. Yeah. So I'm curious what you
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:06.740]   guys think of this story. I just was reading about it on Reddit. Marcus Brownlee did a review of the
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:16.420]   OnePlus 6. And by the way, the red OnePlus 6 is coming out. And then tweeted that he was a little
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:24.420]   perturbed at OnePlus because they took his video review on YouTube and are running it as an
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:35.700]   ad. Oh, no, no, no, no. So he has no control over it. Hell, then. So there's a whole thread back
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:41.220]   and forth. And at some point, the folks from YouTube said, no, no one can do that without your
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:47.940]   permission. We should talk. Now, at this point, that sounds like if Marcus wanted it to be pulled
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:58.180]   down, he could. He does point out it's his most viewed video ever. So he says basically he was
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:04.980]   without his permission. Google says, well, you can't turn an ad video on an ad without the creator's
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:13.780]   consent. So now is it a setting that maybe he had that he didn't I can totally, I think you have
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:19.780]   to explicitly ask permission. Certainly in the real world, if somebody was going to take my review
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:27.860]   from here and put it on their website, they would be required to ask. Well, you know, sometimes people
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:32.340]   pull review content from like, I know that when I was writing it, fortune, people would sometimes
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:37.780]   pull our review content for their advertising. But it's fair use. So you could pull like a
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:42.180]   statement from my review. Yeah. And I don't even like that when people do that occasionally they do
[01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:46.500]   that and I will complain and make them take it down. But yeah, you see that movie reviews all the time,
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:51.220]   you know, sis, cool and eber to thumbs up. That's not you don't have to ask permission to do that.
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:59.060]   Where's the advertising revenue going? Which account? I mean, if it's going to Mark has is no,
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:03.540]   then we would know it's not it sounds like it's not going to one. It's just it's no there's no
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:09.620]   revenue. It is an ad. One plus put his video in this using that to run an advertisement.
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:14.980]   Right. Right. Right. But if I'm Mark, as I'm upset, in fact, I would say if I were Mark, as if
[01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:20.100]   that had happened to me, I would have it would have be gone because that's an implicit endorsement.
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:26.980]   And of course, a complete conflict of interest because he now I go even the extra step. We don't
[01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:31.700]   generate review stuff unless we buy it. So like I bought this pixel book, I bought this iPhone,
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:36.100]   I bought this pixel to because I don't want to even have a review unit, but he but most people
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:40.260]   and that's completely normal process have review units as long as you send them back.
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:46.660]   You know, there's not a problem with that. Although the other day, Mark has showed his drawer of
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:54.020]   phones. Apparently he does not send them back because he has a drawer with at least 500 phones in it.
[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:59.540]   So that's a little weird too. Mark is you should send those back. That would be the right thing to
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:05.060]   do on those. I don't know. I'm curious. I don't know who to blame on this one. If it's if the ad
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:10.820]   still up, then at this point, I think you have to say, Mark has probably is like in the traffic.
[01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:18.900]   He's not making any money on it. That's yeah, that's I mean, but we're all old. So yeah,
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:25.220]   YouTube standards are very different, aren't they? I don't even know anymore. And I don't even
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:31.860]   know what's allowed. I mean, we send our stuff back with the except another couple of exceptions.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:36.820]   There are things that we I think we've purchased most of it, but there are a few things that I
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:45.700]   have that I keep because they continually update. Right. So ongoing reviews long term.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:53.620]   I think one of I think maybe my either my wink or my smart things hub is an ongoing review unit.
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:58.420]   However, the others are all one of the hubs is, but I don't remember which one. And by the way,
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:04.500]   I shouldn't say that Marcus. I was I thought Marcus was getting these sent to him to review,
[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:09.060]   but maybe he's buying him. Maybe that's why his phone drawer is so it's so full.
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:14.820]   Maybe you sell them, but I mean, you use them sell them and you know,
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:19.460]   we'll see if you buy them, you should sell them. If you don't if you're giving them as a review
[01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:24.260]   unit, even if and sometimes companies do this, but we don't when somebody offers me us a review
[01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:31.460]   unit, our standard policy is to say fine, but you must send a return label and we will return it
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:36.340]   within two weeks of the of the finite finality of the review. And we insist on that and you have
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:40.500]   to pay for return shipping. And then in that case, we'll review it because I don't want first of all,
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:46.900]   anybody who does this is the problem. This is just this is a minor. I remember John
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:48.820]   Z into four. I told this story before.
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:55.700]   Who was at the time, writing a column a day was in 30 different magazines. And basically,
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:15:00.260]   he was so powerful in the industry. This is in the 90s. Everybody sent him everything.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:06.980]   I remember going to his house once he had a laptop on every step of his stair going up his
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:12.900]   stair. He had in his living room, he'd been going through stuff, a pile of boxes of software that
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:17.380]   they were going to sell or throw away or dispose of. And then I said, you know, John, I need to
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:23.060]   modem. He said, Oh, come with me. And he was running a space above a gas station that was like
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:27.380]   fibber Mickey's closet. You opened the door and you had you had a good and he said,
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:33.460]   there are a bunch of modems in here. Let's see. What do you want? So he was he couldn't be bothered
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:37.300]   to send him back. And you know, if you don't have a staff, I understand that. But oh, yeah,
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:42.900]   that's that's it's I mean, we're a small operation. And that's that's why it's done a mailing label,
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:47.700]   because then I just keep the box, grab the label back on it. And UPS comes and gets it.
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:53.460]   That is that is how we roll. I would like I would like to let me just say this.
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:59.140]   Mark has and everybody who does reviews the Linus Tech tips, all these people
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:05.460]   publish us an ethics statement. Put it on a website. Everybody should do that.
[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:09.460]   I have a disclosure online. Yeah, explains all that. Yeah.
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:15.700]   You know, Cara Swisher is the role model in this because she was for a while married to a woman
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:22.900]   who worked was executive at Google. So she has a very extensive, you know, statement. And I think
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:29.860]   that that would be a good thing for us all to do. And we don't have one because, you know,
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:34.180]   the last one I had was Jim Latterback, we're one for everybody. We all had to sign it.
[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:39.300]   You know, I'll write one. I think it's a good thing. I haven't done it either. Well,
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.980]   right one. Just so people know where you stand.
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:48.980]   Okay. What are we going to talk about next? You ready for prime day?
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:56.820]   I am. Do you buy on prime day? Not really. If there's something exciting to buy,
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:00.500]   I've never been excited about prime day. There's never like anything that I'm like,
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:04.740]   holy mackerel, I need that. It's now Amazon prime 36 hours.
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:13.860]   So big one day, couldn't hold it all. I actually wait for it like when I lost my
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:19.780]   Kindle earlier this year, one of my mini Kindle losses of this year, I was like, oh, wait till
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:23.060]   prime day because they know the Kindle will be on sale. But then they put it on sale for like
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:28.980]   national book month or something. So I got it then. So they, that's the best thing to buy on prime
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:35.380]   day for sure is echoes, kindles, that kind of thing. It's coming, by the way, a second half of
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:39.060]   Monday and all of Tuesday of next week, July 16th and 17th.
[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:44.420]   I kind of feel like it's like a flea market of all the stuff they can't get rid of in the
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:50.580]   warehouse. What do you mean? You think they can't get rid of the TRT travel, the turtle travel pillow?
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:54.660]   You don't think they can, you don't think they're 12 pack of pumpkin.
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:18:01.220]   Pumpkin? I was like, hand pumpkin for like an absurd deal. And I was like, what is 12 pack?
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:07.940]   You're in a party and coming out your butt. Oh, wait a minute. That's a lot of pumpkin.
[01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:17.060]   I know. Up to the, oh, look, your chance to win a $50,000 Lexa CS with Alexa built in.
[01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:25.700]   Now how much would you pay? Popular movies, $1.99, 30% off selected Amazon devices.
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:31.060]   Now, I always go to the wire cutter because they do a good thing. They must hate prime day.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:39.060]   Mm hmm. It's all hands on deck. It just must just because they're there and they're just comparing
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:43.380]   the deals on prime with real with other places and telling you what's a good deal because not
[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:49.140]   all of them are good deals. A lot of Martin and what is isn't what is and thrifter,
[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:54.740]   which is Renee Richie's company Mobile Nations also will be doing the same thing. So probably
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:59.540]   before you buy on prime day, it'd be a good idea to check out the wire cutter.
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:05.380]   They need to automate that thing. Yeah. Well, that price checking and then
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:09.780]   if something gets so great Amazon for that sort of thing, I feel like there was a lawsuit.
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:15.300]   I bet if you, somebody had a Raspberry Pi, a little bit of Python code, there's nothing they
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:25.300]   couldn't do. Mm hmm. Just saying. I'll be running off my Amazon Fire 10 with the Google Play Store.
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:31.060]   Oh, nice. Mm hmm. Now Kevin found some good deals on Google stuff,
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:36.500]   coincidentally tied to Pi Day or prime day. What? Not Pi Day. Well, it would make sense.
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:42.180]   Google would want to offer some deals on it. They teamed up with Amazon's arch nemesis too.
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:46.900]   I just realizing this, Kevin. We talked about this six hours ago. How could you?
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:51.700]   Was it? Was it Walmart that they're doing? It was.
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:58.020]   What? Yeah, interesting. Yeah, funny how it's the same day, the 17th, and you can get all the
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:05.220]   Google stuff with rebates. So you get the Google store sale price plus rebates. It's like a home
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:12.260]   menu with $19 net. You can get two Google home maxes, the big speakers for $498. Where is this?
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:19.940]   Where is this? I think. I've never shown a store. No, no, no, no. This is just on Walmart.com.
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:24.500]   I remember I read it. Mashable had it. That's where I found it.
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:29.380]   I like, you know, if you were thinking about getting an Apple HomePod,
[01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:37.140]   seriously can stop, first of all, seriously consider the Google home max, which sounds,
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:41.620]   in my opinion, everybody is good. It's more expensive, but with that deal, it's less.
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:45.940]   And you have Google Assistant instead of a dumb little Siri in there.
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:52.660]   I'm really a, oh, yes. See, say, no, it is on this Google store. Makeways, keep the
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:57.860]   keep the beat, save $150 on two Google home max speakers. Just add them both to your carton.
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:01.060]   It's right now. So is that the deal? That's the deal you're talking about, right?
[01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:03.460]   That matches the deal that I was talking about for sure.
[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:07.620]   Yeah. So there are $399s. It's $800. So it's $650 for two.
[01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:12.260]   That makes it less than the home pod, but you have to buy two.
[01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:17.860]   Oh, students can save 10% using student beans.
[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:27.780]   Nest doorbell and a Google mini are on sale somewhere for $169, which actually is a pretty
[01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:32.180]   sweet deal. Where did I find that? We should do a podcast.
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:42.660]   Deals. The deals of the day. Oh, CNET showed it. So it's the, that's a really good deal because
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:51.620]   the doorbell, the Nest Hello doorbell is, it's like $239. So they're saying you can buy the Nest
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:57.860]   Hello doorbell with the Google home mini for $200 and then you get a coupon code that brings it to
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:04.260]   $170, basically. That is a good deal. And that is a great doorbell. Yes, sales.
[01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:09.460]   I highly recommend that doorbell. I want a team with the wire cutter,
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:15.940]   a thrifter and have cameras in there. They must have a bullpen, a war room, right? With 20 guys
[01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:22.580]   typing fast as they can and have like a microphone there and have just run up and say,
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:27.780]   I found a great deal. And then sit down and just stream it live all prime day. Why don't we do that?
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:38.260]   Wire cutter thrifter. Call me. You know my number. It's 415-604-1360. I wonder if I got any,
[01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:42.260]   don't expect me to answer. I think you've got voicemails. Do I?
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:48.500]   People did say that they left messages. I don't see any. That's what you should use as your ringtone.
[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:55.700]   Everybody around you'll just start saying, yeah, hi Leo, it's me.
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:23:07.460]   Peep. On iOS, you have to use a weird, it's sad what happened to Jabber. You have to use a messenger
[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:16.660]   called Tagazi messenger. It's not the best name. Oh my God, I did. Oh my God. Oh my God, I got a
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:22.100]   bunch of them. Thank you. Yeah. How's the format? Can you show us format? Are they? Well,
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:27.220]   in places to gotten appropriate because it's Tagazi messenger. It has a little tiger next to it.
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:34.020]   Here's what I was interested is how good are the transcripts? That's what I'm interested in.
[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:39.940]   Here's the audio. That's a wave link. voicemail transcription. Hey Leo, I hear Texas. They have
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:47.860]   done to the birds. What that? Okay. That's pretty accurate. Here's another one.
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:52.180]   It's like an experience involving that. Hey Leo, I know when Jay and the Chaplain.
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:24:00.420]   All right, just text me. All righty. Bye. Here's another one. Leo, I think she really need to
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:05.540]   let you buy a shotgun, but first home defense need really need a pest.
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:11.780]   This is like Google voice back in like 2000. Yeah, it's not very high quality. This is like drunk
[01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:18.660]   Google voice. There's just a text. Hi Leo. Here's another one. Joe. Hey, I am calling you. Thanks
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:30.340]   for the trip. This is Leo. How are you doing, baby? Hmm. Anyway, thank you all for the call.
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:34.180]   Hello Leo. Somebody, somebody send me who this?
[01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:41.700]   So I didn't get a whole lot, but I got a few and yeah, the transcription is a little bit
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:48.340]   disappointed. I'll have to listen to the waves and see if they are that incomprehensible actually or
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:57.940]   anyway, there's plenty more space where that came from. If you want to call me the wire cutter,
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:03.220]   we'll figure it out. Amazon devices are already on sale ahead of prime day, by the way.
[01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:10.980]   Oh, this must be 35 bucks for an Amazon Echo. I think 35 pounds. That's why are you in the UK?
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:16.020]   I don't know. I'm in Mashable UK. Oh, what?
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:22.340]   I got three barks. I forget what that means.
[01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:29.300]   It means my oh, my nest. My nest is probably going haywire, but my phone is not near me. So I
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:36.260]   can't look at it. That's her ringtone, actually. Yeah. Wait, is it? Oh, it's not September yet.
[01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:41.620]   I'm still waiting for my Google display unit thing. So.
[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:49.940]   That's not a September. Did you pre-order September? I don't remember. I don't. Could we
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:54.100]   pre-order it? I don't believe we could. I may have pre-ordered it. If you could have pre-ordered it,
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:26:01.060]   I think we did, but I don't know if I did or not. Well, I'm going to go check the Lenovo Smart
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:09.060]   Display with Google Assistant. Yes. It's a notify me. Yeah. So I signed up for notifications.
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:13.540]   Yeah, I probably did too. Limit five for customer. Just get ready.
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:21.140]   You can't. Don't worry. Limit five per customer. And did you get pricing? Do we know what the
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:28.980]   pricing is or? I think it was 199 and 250. Or eight and 10. I don't know. I'm going.
[01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:37.060]   No, is that norm? Oh, it's all norm. I love the norm, meme. I thought it was 200 and 250.
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:41.940]   I like it. I think you're right. For eight and 10 inches. 10 inches is such a nice size.
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:46.180]   Well, it's nice about that too. Is that one you can switch and have it in portrait or
[01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:51.060]   landscape. I really, really like that design. That's because of the weird fold in the back.
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:54.580]   The twisty thing in the back there. Yeah. Let's just stand it either way.
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:27:02.580]   Yeah. I want that a lot. You know, I actually, I know you laugh at me, but I like the Google,
[01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:11.780]   I mean, the Echo Show, the Echo version of this. And I got the Fire Cube, which is designed to-
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:15.140]   How's that? It's pretty, you know, okay, it's great. It works.
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:17.860]   I was compared to the Harmony. Does it recognize all your gear?
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:22.980]   No. It's not a, it's not a universal remote. It does recognize some stuff. So it recognized my
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:28.660]   TV. It does some TVs. It recognized my AV receiver. Some AV receivers. I have a Denon and an LG
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:34.420]   recognize those. I don't have, I have a Tivo. I don't have a set top box. It does recognize
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:40.100]   some set top boxes though, quite a few. So if you have an appropriate hardware setup, you could say
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:46.580]   things like Echo watch Oprah and it would turn it to the right, you know, would do all the
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:50.980]   doohickies and get on. It's really great to say turn off TV when you leave the room and it turns
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:57.380]   off the receiver, turns off the TV. But one of the things I really like about it is that it's
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:02.100]   essentially an Echo Show because if you say, what's the weather, it uses your big screen TV in the
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:06.500]   same way a show would to show the weather. If you're playing music, it does the same thing the
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:10.900]   show does. It shows the lyrics is a little karaoke kind of a thing where it goes the lyrics go by.
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:15.860]   And all of that stuff is great. You can, if you had the Ring doorbell or the Nest doorbell,
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:20.900]   you could say show my doorbell and it would be on your big screen TV. The thing I don't like about
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:25.220]   it is exactly the same problem I have with all the fire TV devices. They're basically a vehicle
[01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:30.740]   for advertising Amazon. So it's very Amazon centric, you know, and you get a lot of ads for
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:38.020]   Amazon Prime stuff. Man, because yeah, I was looking at that, but I have the Logitech Harmony Hub,
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:42.900]   which I have linked through Google and Echo. And you can control it with your voice, right?
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:49.540]   Yeah, the only reason to switch over was to get a little bit more granularity on like watch this
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:57.140]   particular show. But that's pretty like first world of me. That's like, can you say Echo turn
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:03.780]   the TV on? I can say Echo turn on television or you can actually custom turn off television.
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:09.540]   I can say turn on Netflix and it'll link to Netflix from the Roku with the fire TV cube.
[01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:15.060]   You can say watch Westworld, right? And it will know if you have HBO go install that will know to go
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:19.700]   there, but because there's Westworld, the movie in Westworld, the TV show, what it does displays the
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:25.460]   two. And then you say echo play one or echo play two. Right. So there's a little more interaction
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:32.500]   than you might want. Okay. Yeah, the only reason I was looking at it is for that next level granularity
[01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:40.020]   and because the I would put that on the top of my TV setup and it's got the IR right in there.
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:44.580]   In the Harmony, I have this little tiny little IR receiver that attaches to a cord and
[01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:48.820]   it sneaks out of the cabinet and my husband feels that it is offensive.
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:53.940]   Nice. I still use the most underrated set top box there is.
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:30:00.180]   What's that? The shield TV, which is an Android TV. I almost said shield TV.
[01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:06.100]   Yep. I really like it. If it had YouTube TV, does it have YouTube TV?
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:11.380]   I haven't looked. Does it have you? Does it have PlayStation View? Do you watch your view on it?
[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:17.300]   I do watch my view. I watch MLB TV. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But I mean, because I've got it,
[01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:23.140]   well, it's a Google home as well. It's a Chromecast as well. If you're into Samsung smart things,
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:27.860]   you can buy a $30 USB dongle, add Zigbee and Z-Wave videos and that was your smart home hub.
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:33.700]   Yeah. This is how Kevin just decided he didn't like smart things.
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:39.860]   I quite like the shield. I use the shield. Also, the Nvidia Go.
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:43.940]   Nvidia Go lets you play games on it. I have the control. It is a nice,
[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:47.620]   it is an underrated TV device, although not cheap. That's part of the problem.
[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:54.100]   Is it much more expensive than an Apple TV or a Fire? Yeah. Every you'll find it for like
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:59.700]   170 to 200, depending on if you get the controller or the game controller. That's the same as Apple
[01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:02.980]   TV. It's a little more expensive maybe, but it's just yeah, nobody knows about it.
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:08.340]   Chatra Marsworm and Sailor Lion saying, "Yes, YouTube TV is on it." So I have to install that.
[01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:10.820]   Yeah. Good to know. Thank you.
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:16.900]   I'd be more excited, except I also pay for cable. I also have an Apple TV. I'll
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:26.020]   sell a Roku TV. I have way too many ways to watch TV. New book coming out that the chatroom says,
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:31.780]   "You got to tell everybody about it's called Valley of Genius, the Uncensored History of
[01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:36.820]   Silicon Valley by Adam Fisher. I'm reading it right now. I'm loving it. It's actually already out.
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:42.180]   I think it's outright carsten or did I get an advanced copy? I have it. It's really good interviews
[01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:46.500]   with many of the people you know and many of the people you don't know who made Silicon Valley the
[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:52.980]   amazing place it is. Adam's going to be our guest on triangulation on the 22nd, I think.
[01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:55.460]   Is that right? Coming up this month. 20th.
[01:31:55.460 --> 01:32:04.020]   20th. But you can read an excerpt right now in Vanity Fair's hive. Google was not a normal place.
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:11.540]   Bryn Page and Mayor on the accidental birth of the company that changed everything.
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:19.220]   So if you want to get a sense of it, this is probably a great way to start.
[01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:24.420]   Lots of good interviews in this. It's a really fun book to read. The Valley of Genius,
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:28.740]   the Uncensored History of Silicon Valley, as told by the hackers, founders, and freaks
[01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:33.700]   who made it boom. I am really looking forward to talking to Adam about this.
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:40.740]   He interviewed so many, more than 100 people. What's nice is the book is transcripts of the
[01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:48.020]   interviews, which I kind of like. It's the Studs-Tircle method. You hear them in their own voices,
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:49.940]   which is really nice.
[01:32:49.940 --> 01:33:01.140]   Okay. What else do you want to talk about? Time, how can it breach? If you use Time Hop,
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:06.420]   which I did for a long time, in order to use Time Hop, you had to sign in through Facebook
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:12.740]   and then give it permission to access all of your other social accounts. They got breached on the
[01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:20.260]   4th of July. They say they caught the bad guys in progress, but some data was taken.
[01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:27.780]   They handled it well. They reset all of the tokens that allowed... Whoever got your
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:31.300]   information at least can't access your Instagram, Facebook, and all that stuff.
[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:38.820]   Seems like every week there's something going on. I know. I know. I'm getting...
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:42.660]   I almost don't want to report them. 21 million users, 21 million emails.
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:48.820]   Here's the... It's a lot. Yeah, they published what they did really nicely, I thought. Maybe this
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:54.100]   is GDPR. I bet it is. It's published at table of the number of breached records,
[01:33:54.100 --> 01:34:01.140]   and the number that were affected by GDPR. They're required within 72 hours to publish this.
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:05.780]   Maybe this is the first... Maybe one of the reasons we've seen so much breach information this week
[01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:11.860]   is thank you GDPR. Oh, but see, we're already desensitized. Oh, no! We are!
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:18.180]   Because just as Kevin said, there've been nothing but last week. Polar...
[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:28.980]   Yep. Do you use Polar Kevin when you run? I use Runkeeper when I run, but I use the Polar app
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:34.980]   because I had the Polar Android Wear watch for a while. So Polar Flow was the app, but as a runner,
[01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:41.860]   this is very common. All the apps, Strava, Polar, Runkeeper, will keep a map of your run. They'll
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:46.500]   tell you your pace. They'll tell you how far you ran all that stuff. And a lot of runners
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:55.540]   make it public. Do you make yours public? The data in terms of the stats, my pace, how far I went,
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:35:01.380]   etc. That's public. The maps are limited to my friends on the app.
[01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:11.140]   So the problem that happened with Strava is some smart reporter looked at the aggregate maps.
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:16.180]   And you could see places there wasn't supposed to be anybody. A lot of people running around.
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:22.420]   The heat maps. Yeah, we're heat maps effectively. And the military, of course,
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:28.500]   fitness is a priority. A lot of them use those apps. They were able to deduce there's some
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:32.020]   secret military bases that aren't on the map, but we can see them because there's a lot of
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:37.460]   military guys running around them. This one's a little bit different. Polar had a flaw in their
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:44.900]   API that'll and use simply simple serialized index numbers for all its users. So you were able
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:54.420]   to make requests for the data. I'm not clear if it was all the data or just the public data.
[01:35:54.420 --> 01:36:02.260]   It might have been some private data. But I think some of the blame falls on the users
[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:09.380]   because the Dutch newspaper that discovered this was able to, oh, here's a guy spends a lot of time
[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:16.100]   walking around the NSA. Let's figure out who it is. Oh, now let's see where he goes. Oh, that's his
[01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:25.380]   home address. That's bad operational security. So some of the blame goes on if you're a spy,
[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:33.060]   you probably shouldn't be wearing advice that publicly publishes your heat map. But also polar
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:40.260]   didn't do a good job in keeping that stuff private. I've played with the Runkeeper
[01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:45.540]   Health Graph, which is their API a little bit just to see if I can dig at my own data.
[01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:51.460]   And you needed to get tokens and IDs and credentials and all that. So
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:57.220]   I can't speak for all the companies, but they seem to have locked it down and they haven't had
[01:36:57.220 --> 01:37:00.340]   a breach yet. But you never know. It's getting the point where I almost don't want to use any
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:06.980]   cloud based anything anymore. Well, I was really bummed that Tinder is now encrypting your photos.
[01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:14.420]   That's a bummer. Apparently they weren't.
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:22.820]   There is so much data that is. Yeah, it's all out there. If you're putting it, look, guys,
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:28.260]   NSA guys, if you're putting it or whoever on the internet, you might want to think about,
[01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:34.740]   you know, who might get it? I always tell. So this, I will say, like the fact that Congress is
[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:39.540]   writing, I think they're writing letters to Google. Ron Wyden wrote to Tinder about this.
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:47.940]   Oh, well, I'm thinking about Google and the Gmail privacy policy. So they want them to testify.
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:54.180]   I feel like, hey, maybe this is a good time to talk about creating these sort of usable
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:38:04.020]   labels for how data is used. Because it's not like Congress is, I mean, yes, Google has these
[01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:12.900]   wonderfully opaque terms and conditions, but come on, people, no one reads them.
[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:18.020]   And now that we know this, maybe we should talk about making something more useful that
[01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:20.980]   everyone could read. Actually, this story annoyed the hell out of me.
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:28.020]   Okay. And I think I'm going to channel Jeff Jarvis on this one.
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:34.820]   Techtopantic. No, this started July 2nd. We didn't get to talk about it. I got to
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:40.740]   log into my Wall Street Journal so I can show you the whole article. But this, the Wall Street
[01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:48.660]   Journal has a long history. Jeff's pointed this out many times of sliming Google in its pages.
[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:54.660]   And you don't have to think too hard about why it might do that because, well, Google
[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:59.300]   probably takes a little bit of money off the table with its advertising. And the journal may not
[01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:06.340]   like that so much. There may be other political reasons as well. So they published what I
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:12.180]   considered a kind of a scurrilous article, text dirty secret. Okay, that right there.
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:19.780]   The app developers sifting through your Gmail. Well, if you read it carefully, what it really is is,
[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:26.660]   yes, if you sign up for a service that reads, you know, that, for instance, looks for
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:33.860]   shopping receipts in your Gmail and then finds better deals for you, I'm shocked, shocked to learn
[01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:42.500]   that it's reading your Gmail. Well, duh. You gave them the, you approved it. You said yes, and you
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:46.500]   wanted that service. You know, we know that some of these guys are pretty unscrupulous.
[01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:51.700]   Unroll me, which had a very nice feature, would let you unsubscribe from newsletters,
[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:56.500]   turned out they were gathering other stuff from your email and selling it to companies like Uber.
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:40:01.300]   And I immediately, you know, got rid of unroll me. So you want to be careful about who you give
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:06.900]   access to your Gmail to. But there's lots of services, same box, for instance, where you give
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:11.860]   them permission because they filter your email for you. Well, how would they do that? You have,
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:15.620]   they have to read your email. That seems obvious.
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:26.500]   The journals just shocked, shocked. And then they said, sometimes humans will even do it. And in
[01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:32.020]   those cases where humans were accessing the mail under very limited circumstances to do the machine
[01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:40.740]   learning to provide the service, how data miners see your email. If you're using any email program,
[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:45.140]   and this is almost all of them has anti spam protections, guess what? They have to read your email.
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:51.780]   What they got wrong and this upset lawmakers apparently, because that's what this is what
[01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:55.860]   precipitated those emails, those letters to Google, what they got wrong is they said, and Google's
[01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:59.940]   not paying any attention to this. So Google posted a blog post and response saying,
[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:07.460]   what no, absolutely we're paying attention to this. Every single person who asks for that kind of
[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:13.460]   permission has to go through our process in which we make sure that they're doing what they said
[01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:20.580]   they're going to do, not something else. We're very careful about that. It's probably a good
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:25.620]   idea to go to google.com/permissions and review who you've given Gmail access to. But if you give
[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:29.540]   them Gmail access, you can't very well complain that they're reading your email. That's what you
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:35.540]   gave them access for. So I think this is a case of the, frankly, of the Wall Street Journal hoping
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:39.300]   that lawmakers would then write letters to Google and get all upset.
[01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:45.060]   Because I don't know. Am I wrong? Maybe I'm wrong. I'm just channeling Jeff Jarvis. Am I wrong?
[01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:55.940]   No. I think there is a misunderstanding of how much data is gathered, how we use data.
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:42:03.220]   And I think it is shocking to people who may not be aware of that. So that is what I think
[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:09.300]   we should. I mean, yes, do I think the article was a bit inflammatory? Yes. Do I think people
[01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:15.620]   are really aware of what happens when they subscribe to these services? I don't think they are. I
[01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:21.380]   really don't. It's the same way I think people get surprised when I'm like, hey, you know, if you
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:24.660]   have the following home devices in your house, I could totally tell when you're home or not.
[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:32.660]   And they're like, what? It's so, I don't know. I think we have a long way to go to understanding
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:37.140]   exactly what's happening here. So is it Google's responsibility or the company that's asking for
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:42.740]   permission to read your email to be very clear? I think it's everyone's responsibility in this role.
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:48.420]   And that's why I think this is a great opportunity to create like there's some of the ideas or like
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:54.820]   a nutrition label for data. Creating a simple one, some are like like a good housekeeping seal of
[01:42:54.820 --> 01:43:00.500]   approval, but create a set of policies that make sense. So that would include things like,
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:08.020]   hey, do we share your data with third parties? I do. I do have to say that Google in response to
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:15.060]   heat in years gone by stopped reading your email. Yeah. Last year, they still, but they still have
[01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:19.940]   to read. They still have to scan it for Andy spam, but they stopped. They stopped using it for
[01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:26.340]   advertising. They stopped advertising against it. And you know, I don't care that Google like,
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:30.900]   I was aware of this, but plenty of people are not. Plenty of people, you know, someone says,
[01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:35.220]   hey, you should totally sign up for Gmail. This is awesome. You should totally sign up for it.
[01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:42.340]   And I don't think it's wrong that people expect this stuff to be easy and convenient to use. That's
[01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:47.460]   what we're trained for. And companies take advantage of that. So you can use, okay, so you're using
[01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:52.580]   Gmail, by the way, that is not enough. You then have to sign up for a service. Right, I know.
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:57.140]   But that's, I'm just saying this is how these like the tech press gets all excited or maybe a
[01:43:57.140 --> 01:44:01.700]   friend uses and like, Oh, you should totally try to use this. Right. You're like, Oh, that sounds
[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:06.340]   really cool. And you click through and you do everything. I do think we need better, like,
[01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:12.180]   Azure signing up for something. We need an alternative to a TOS or a ULA that does something in plain
[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:18.740]   English with like four or five main points that you could just be like, Oh, oh, they want that.
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:22.260]   It's kind of like now on phones. I mean, we're trained to be like, Hey, this thing wants to
[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:24.740]   use your camera. This thing. Once your microphone, do you want to allow it?
[01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:30.660]   The journal just pisses me off. Look at this picture that used this is just some people at Google I.
[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:37.060]   But of course, they use this picture in this article. And it looks like somebody's reading,
[01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:42.260]   you know, somebody in a Google hat is reading your mail. This is scummy. I'm sorry, journal.
[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:48.820]   That's scummy. I guess I come from the point of somebody who's technically literate going,
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:54.900]   well, come on. What'd you think? How would you can't you can't expect the rest of the world to
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:45:01.300]   be as technically used computers? Just go home, go get your buggy, it's very powered with shield
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:07.940]   wipers. Honest. I mean, this is this is like people who, you know, when we talk about credit cards
[01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:12.900]   and we're like, how do they not understand interest payments? But there are plenty of people who
[01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:19.540]   don't or who are in a position to not notice that. And you know, they are being taken advantage of.
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:25.220]   So this is Ernie, which is that service I talked about that you would sign up for. By the way,
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:29.620]   you get a great benefit. They look at your mail and they look for receipts. And then they,
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:35.540]   if they find a receipt, they see if they get a better deal, they negotiate a better price for you.
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:43.140]   They share their profits. So when you do it, it says, this will allow Ernie to read,
[01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:47.940]   send, delete and manage your email. It says it very clearly. And then there's an allow button.
[01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:54.340]   Stacy, what more do you know? So that that is fine. But not everybody does that.
[01:45:54.340 --> 01:46:00.260]   Yes. Like that. No, everybody has to. They have to access Gmail. Yes.
[01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:05.220]   Oh, OK, well, then never mind. Gmail is fine. It's all the other services out there.
[01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:09.460]   That's my point is that what do you want Wall Street Journal? Do you want me to come and hit
[01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:14.180]   somebody in the head and say, no, it said, just going to read your email. It says it.
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:18.820]   It drives me nuts. And I, and I, what I feel bad is now that Google executives,
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:23.060]   I mean, I don't have no reason to offend Google executive, but Google executives now have to go
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:29.540]   to Congress and explain, well, and Congress is completely clueless. It's some nitwit Congress
[01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:38.420]   person who read it in the journal. So God, this is terrible. I don't know what more you could do
[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:44.740]   than this. And that's actually that is it exactly what I'm asking for. Oh, OK. And I think,
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:51.140]   I think even the world. Yeah, the I for information, if I recall correctly, you can click that on the,
[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:57.860]   and get even more information. I bet most people don't do that. So maybe they go allow, allow, allow.
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:02.340]   Yeah. Yeah. But that's we got to stop doing that.
[01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:08.100]   This is what Google does. In order to pass a review process, non Google apps must meet two
[01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:14.020]   key requirements accurately represent themselves. They must be clear about how they're using their
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:18.820]   data. They can't poses one thing and do another must have clear and prominent privacy disclosures,
[01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:23.300]   only request relevant data. They should only ask for data they need for their specific function.
[01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:29.540]   Nothing more be clear about how they're using it. We review these applications to make sure they
[01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:36.180]   continue to meet our policies and suspend them when we are aware they do not. I don't know what
[01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:41.620]   Google could do that's better than this. I don't know how it could be better. If the journal doesn't
[01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:46.260]   like it, they should stop using Gmail, I guess, and stop using Ernie and stop using all these other
[01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:51.940]   things. Because I mean, I don't know what else you can do to make it clearer. I don't know. It just
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:57.140]   gets me angry. Yeah. No, then that's fine. I mean, I'm thinking about the things I sign up for.
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:48:03.300]   I'm like, oh, well, unroll me is a good example. I mean, they were doing more than they said they
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:06.660]   would do and taking more of their data, your data, and they were selling it to other people.
[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:12.340]   And Google should have caught that. Well, there isn't an audit process for something like this. So,
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:17.540]   it is unclear. Like, I assume they get complaints and that's when they look at someone, it's not
[01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:22.820]   like there's some person who's going through and checking this stuff. Maybe there should be.
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:25.940]   I mean, this blog post implied that it's an ongoing process.
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:32.420]   Yeah, but is it one person? Yeah, right. Yeah, that's right. Well, okay.
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:36.100]   Showing shipping. So in that case, when the member of Congress writes to you, Google,
[01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:40.100]   you should be, you know, say that, say that's, you know, do whatever you need to do to
[01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:43.940]   make it better. Create an audit trail. Yeah.
[01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:50.660]   Or you could do like the FCC doesn't just charge people $225 to review the complaints.
[01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:56.100]   Oh, that is so terrible. I'm so mad and that is so agitpie.
[01:48:56.100 --> 01:49:01.620]   Are you surprised? Are you surprised? I'm not, but.
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:06.740]   I don't even know anymore. I just don't.
[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:08.740]   It is a little bit of a misleading headline. So.
[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:16.900]   They didn't review every free informal complaint, right? And if you want, so an informal complaint
[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:23.780]   can be sent for free. But if you want to make a formal complaint, you have to pay a $225 fee.
[01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:32.820]   And that's the question is, does the FCC even care about informal complaints? We know that when
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:38.660]   somebody pointed out that there were millions of spurious comments about net neutrality,
[01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:41.780]   including some created by members of Congress,
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:48.340]   phonally created by people posing as members of Congress, the FCC didn't really care.
[01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:56.100]   So this is the change. Currently, it says the commission will forward informal complaints to
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:50:01.540]   the appropriate carrier for investigation. The carrier will underscored and italicized within
[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:05.300]   such time as maybe prescribed, advised the commission in writing with a copy of the complaint
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:12.420]   of the complaint and of its, with a copy to the complainant of its satisfaction of the complaint,
[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:17.620]   or its refusal or inability to do so. The new rule, the proposed rule, the commission will
[01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:23.060]   form forward informal complaints to the appropriate carrier for investigation and may set a due date
[01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:25.940]   for the carrier to provide a written response. Maybe we will.
[01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:31.380]   Yeah. So basically they're abdicating their responsibility to people.
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:33.540]   Yeah. Nothing new. Nothing new.
[01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:38.340]   In favor of the carriers, which is not, yeah.
[01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:41.620]   It's not going to be long before we're Kazakhstan.
[01:50:41.620 --> 01:50:46.500]   It already feels like we're in a second world.
[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:47.460]   Trump is top person.
[01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:53.060]   Trump is staying. So every evening, for the last four months in Kazakhstan,
[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:56.580]   social media websites have really slowed down to put where they're unusable.
[01:50:56.580 --> 01:51:03.140]   It happens for a couple of hours, just as many people are winding down from a day at work.
[01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:06.820]   So it turns out the reason this is happening
[01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:14.900]   is because the opposition group leader, the democratic choice of Kazakhstan,
[01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:18.980]   DVK, is getting online.
[01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:29.780]   So whenever he gets online, instead of just slowing him down, they slow it all down.
[01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:35.940]   I don't know if I can say is it campaigning or something? What's he doing?
[01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:43.300]   Well, so apparently he's, they call him an extremist group. He's a government foe,
[01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:51.140]   Mukhtar Abliazov. He appears to have only a marginal following. This is an article from Eurasia
[01:51:51.140 --> 01:52:00.180]   net has used online resources to spread the word. He's taken to deliver a political homilies
[01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:04.820]   through live video and Facebook often in the evening. Oh, I see why they don't just slow him down.
[01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:07.380]   Yeah. They want, they don't want anybody to be able to see it.
[01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:15.140]   Right. So the government even admits that, well, we slowed the internet down when he's doing that.
[01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:22.180]   That's great. This is not, I mean, this is not uncommon. This is something that happens all over
[01:52:22.180 --> 01:52:28.900]   the world during election cycles or to prevent protesting. I mean, we've seen it
[01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:38.580]   is it usual to be targeting one person? No, but slowing and throttling the internet is a time
[01:52:38.580 --> 01:52:44.420]   on our tradition. Tieders around the world. Can't watch the best of it. Jerry's going online.
[01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:54.180]   That's kind of remarkable. It's kind of remarkable. So that's a lot of power. If he were smart,
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:59.060]   he'd do like a Twitter or a text kind of base campaign around it.
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:01.140]   Yeah. He could say, change his schedule.
[01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:04.980]   Today we broadcast it 2 p.m.
[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:12.180]   Those are private internet hours, such a shame.
[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:17.700]   All right. Let's take one more break and then we can do picks and numbers and things like that.
[01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:26.660]   How about that? Stacey Higginbotham, Stacey on IOT.com. Her compadre from the IOT podcast.
[01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:33.300]   And Mr. About Chromebooks.com. Kevin Tofel. He's Kevin C. Tofel on the Twitter.
[01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:41.220]   And she's at Gigas Stacey. Do the Gigafolks ever, do they ever complain about that?
[01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:47.300]   No, why would they? No. I'm amazing. They should be lucky to be associated with me.
[01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:53.380]   I agree. I know we are. Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage is funny when you're
[01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:58.740]   buying a house. It's already an anxiety laden proposition. You're spending your running the
[01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:02.260]   largest check you'll ever write, spending the most money you'll ever spend. For the most,
[01:54:02.260 --> 01:54:04.820]   one of the arguably one of the most important purchases you'll ever make.
[01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:10.900]   Why add the insecurity with ratcheting interest rates? They seem to be going up, right? So Rocket
[01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:14.900]   Mortgage, our great friends from Quick and Loans, have come up with a great solution
[01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:23.540]   to help reduce the anxiety of home buying. With our friends at Quick and Loans,
[01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:29.140]   they've created the power buying process. Here's how it works. Quick and Loans will verify your
[01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:33.860]   income, your assets, and your credit in less than 24 hours, and then give you verified approval,
[01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:38.340]   which by the way, by itself is huge because whenever you make an offer, it's as good as cash.
[01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:43.780]   The seller knows you've got the money. You're good for it. So that's awesome. But once you're
[01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:48.980]   verified, you then qualify for this new thing, the all new exclusive rate shield approval.
[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:52.980]   They lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop. You got three months,
[01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:58.580]   and you don't have to worry about ratcheting interest rates. And if the rates go down,
[01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:04.820]   your rate goes down. So it's a win either way. The rates will not go up. They may even go down.
[01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:09.700]   This is exactly what you'd expect from America's best and largest mortgage lender,
[01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:16.500]   Quick and Loans, to get started, go to rocketmortgage.com/twig. Take all the anxiety out
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:22.740]   about a home shopping. Make it a pleasant experience. Make it fun. You're going in there
[01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:27.540]   loaded for bear. You've got the loan. You know your interest rate. It's guaranteed.
[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:32.740]   Now you're ready to buy. Rate shield approval only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions.
[01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:36.340]   Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on Quick and Loans data
[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:40.900]   in comparison to public data records. Equal housing lender, licensed in all 50 states
[01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:47.940]   at MLS consumer access.org number 30-30. Rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:54.020]   Just one more reason. Get set up with Rocketmortgage before you go home shopping.
[01:55:54.020 --> 01:56:05.540]   Rocketmortgage.com/twig. Did we mention Amazon buying pill pack before we've been gone for two
[01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:09.300]   weeks? Did that happen in the two weeks we were gone? Billion dollars? I think it did.
[01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:15.780]   I know we mentioned it. We didn't talk about the Google Game Console news.
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:20.740]   Oh, what do you think of that? I don't know. I think that's a rumor. This is from Kotaku,
[01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:26.500]   which is a gaming site. They say sources claim Google is planning a game platform to take on
[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:33.700]   Xbox and PlayStation. You know, the Nvidia Shield is a game platform. Android TV can be a game platform.
[01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:42.980]   The rumor is that it'll be a streaming platform with includes hardware and attempts to bring
[01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:46.420]   game developers under the Google umbrella. I don't know what that means, whether through
[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:51.700]   aggressive recruiting or major acquisitions. Kotaku said this is the word from five people who have
[01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:59.140]   either been briefed on Google's plans or heard about them second hand. Is that a source?
[01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:05.220]   That's not a source. Heard about this. Maybe. But I wonder why would they want to do this? I
[01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:10.660]   think, well, right. So you want to get the Twitch audience, right? You tried to buy Twitch. They
[01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:18.180]   lost to Amazon. Well, then maybe this is legit then data getting data from gamers.
[01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:23.220]   You know, they have the television platform for the next generation. What if they have the sports
[01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:30.020]   platform for the next generation? True. That was my only thought on this. I was just kind of curious
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:38.820]   because I am not a gamer. So I'm like, I would not. I, you know, have you done GeForce now? Have
[01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:45.380]   you used that Kevin on your shield? Yeah, the subscription based one where they stream the games.
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:51.380]   I did. You got to have a fast internet pipe, obviously, but you know, I couldn't even tell the
[01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:56.500]   difference between playing the same game on that versus my Xbox one at the time. I mean,
[01:57:56.500 --> 01:58:02.580]   1080p, 60 frames a second, and it's all coming from the cloud. It was amazing. It was the only way
[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:09.860]   I could play No Man's Sky because I didn't have a PlayStation 4. Now it's coming out of Xbox one
[01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:17.220]   after everybody lost interest. But I like it. You know, streaming games, you're right. It's more
[01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:22.340]   though that just bandwidth is really low latency as well. Yes, it seems to work pretty well, but I
[01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:28.420]   wasn't playing a first person shooter. So it's fine for No Man's Sky. It was it was the only issue
[01:58:28.420 --> 01:58:33.540]   with No Man's Sky is that the startup time was pretty slow. It took a while to get. Is it still
[01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:38.980]   like nine bucks a month to have that? I still have the membership and I haven't frankly played
[01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:43.780]   any games since No Man's Sky. Probably is one of many subscriptions I should probably
[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:48.980]   cancel. Isn't there a service that will look at your credit card bill and tell you what
[01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:53.620]   subscriptions you have? Yeah, if I let them look at my Gmail email. Yeah, okay.
[01:58:53.620 --> 01:59:03.060]   It is. It's called trim.trim.it. I use it. Let me see player unknowns battleground you could play,
[01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:07.700]   Fortnite you could play. Let's see what the game's GeForce now supported games. Oh, there's quite a
[01:59:07.700 --> 01:59:14.500]   few titles. Rocket League. It's not going to have every AAA title, but they add on a monthly basis
[01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:21.700]   decent games. Yeah, call all the Call of Duty games. The Elder Scrolls Skyrim. I love that game.
[01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:28.420]   It's 1080p, but that's good enough. You know, I mean, you have an Xbox one. I do. It's collecting
[01:59:28.420 --> 01:59:35.220]   dust. Yeah. Yeah. I bought a Nintendo switch and that's it for me. It's as complicated as I can get.
[01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:43.540]   Super Mario. Yeah. We have that. We do not have an Xbox. You shouldn't. Don't get one. It's about
[01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:49.060]   on that. We don't. I'm like Nintendo. We're a Nintendo family. Yeah. It's the family thing.
[01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:54.020]   They can buy mine. Oh, there you go. Okay. Work that out. Work it up between yourself.
[01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:59.700]   I'm good. We're good. All right. I think my parents have an Xbox that they used as like a video
[01:59:59.700 --> 02:00:04.740]   streaming platform. I use it for that. Way back in the day. Yeah. My Xbox one is,
[02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:13.460]   you know, has Netflix and all that stuff, but that's my problem. I have on one TV, my nice 4K
[02:00:13.460 --> 02:00:23.140]   HDR in my office. I have everything, the cube and Xbox, a Tivo, a Fire TV, an Apple TV, a Roku TV,
[02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:30.180]   everything. And I can watch Netflix on every single one of them, even on the Switch. Yeah.
[02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:36.900]   We have a Switch, but it's hooked up to my TV. All right. Stacey, is there something you'd
[02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:42.020]   like to talk about today? I have a lovely thing to talk about. So I am going to talk about something
[02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:46.580]   that is on sale for Amazon Prime Day and is sufficiently weird that you guys will be excited.
[02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:51.140]   I told you about it. I think a couple of weeks ago, whenever I was last on the show,
[02:00:51.140 --> 02:00:57.620]   I showed you the parts for connecting my sync to Amazon, the Amazon Alexa voice service.
[02:00:57.620 --> 02:01:05.460]   And I did it. Now, when she says sync, it's a sync. It's literally the kitchen sync.
[02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:14.180]   Oh, Stacey, this is great. This is the video she shows you how to do it. So what do you think?
[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:22.180]   So, all right, it's going to be $500 on Prime Day worth noting for the stainless steel.
[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:28.500]   There's two technologies here. One is capacitive touch. The second is the echo.
[02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:34.740]   If you are looking at upgrading your sync, I'm going to say go all in on capacitive touch.
[02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:39.780]   I think it's amazing. It means you just touch your sync anywhere in the faucet or the handle.
[02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:45.300]   It turns on and off. It's awesome. And if your hands are dirty, you could use your elbows.
[02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:49.220]   Sometimes I whack with my forehead when I'm holding a big pot. It's very nice.
[02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:59.940]   The second element is the Madam A enablement. It's pretty cool. I like it. I wouldn't spend
[02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:04.900]   an exorbitant amount of money on this. The nice thing is if you want the capacitive touch,
[02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:11.140]   it's only $25 extra to get the echo capability. The best feature is you can say,
[02:02:11.140 --> 02:02:17.220]   "Hey, Madam A asked Delta to dispense 48 ounces of water." That's kind of cool.
[02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:22.900]   It is cool. And my husband loves it. I get frustrated because I can never remember the syntax.
[02:02:22.900 --> 02:02:29.220]   So I'm always like, "Alex, or Madam A dispense 48 ounces of water." And she's like, "I can't do that yet."
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:33.940]   So that's... I did a pretty big review.
[02:02:33.940 --> 02:02:37.620]   You need to put labels everywhere with the syntax on your cabinets.
[02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:41.780]   So they actually give you a little card that comes with it. And it's like,
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:44.980]   "This is your coaster for your echo so you can see what to tell your sync."
[02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:47.620]   Which I'm like, "Oh, no."
[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:53.540]   I only have one question, Stacey. Is that how your sync is underneath really,
[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:55.300]   or did you clean it up just for the video?
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:58.900]   Oh, no, because I had to install something under the sync.
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:02:59.780]   So I had to...
[02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:04.100]   Where's the buckets, the sponges, the 15 different kinds of dishwasher soap?
[02:03:04.100 --> 02:03:06.580]   What kind of sync user are you?
[02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:12.180]   If you scroll down the story and you don't look at the video, there's a picture of me with all
[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:13.540]   of the stuff from the sync.
[02:03:13.540 --> 02:03:17.380]   So that's the inside with the ethernet kit.
[02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:17.940]   Oh, there it is.
[02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:19.700]   There's the sync stuff.
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:20.500]   I'm a few things.
[02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:26.420]   I'm glad to know you take off your shoes before you operate, as every good doctor should.
[02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:30.100]   I'm like, "It's electricity and water. I probably should have kept them on."
[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:32.580]   I would have wear rubber golaches.
[02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:36.900]   No, this is good. This is really thorough. Well done. Bravo.
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:38.580]   Super fun.
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:44.980]   Nice. StaceyOnIOT.com for her review of the Delta Touch Faucet.
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:47.620]   With Amazon Echo.
[02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:49.380]   You can get that on Prime Day.
[02:03:49.380 --> 02:03:51.140]   499.99.
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:53.620]   So what is it normally?
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:56.020]   499.99.
[02:03:56.020 --> 02:03:59.860]   This is the first time it's going to be available for sale for anyone.
[02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:01.220]   Oh, it's launching on Prime Day.
[02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:02.900]   It's launching on Prime.
[02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:03.300]   Oh.
[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:07.140]   And if you want ArtXtainless, that's 25 bucks more.
[02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:08.900]   It is a fancier finish.
[02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:09.940]   It's a brushed.
[02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:12.820]   And I asked because I am diligent that way.
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:15.300]   ArtXtainless looks like stainless only.
[02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:16.980]   There's more white and less yellow.
[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:18.180]   So it's a little bit brighter.
[02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:23.380]   Now, you did the expert installation yourself.
[02:04:24.100 --> 02:04:28.420]   If you had choice, would you pay $182.75 or would you do it yourself?
[02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:30.660]   Well, I already had the capacitive touch.
[02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:34.020]   So for me, it was a simple, like you open the things.
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:38.180]   If I had to replace a whole faucet, actually, I would just totally do it.
[02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:39.860]   Because I do everything.
[02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:41.140]   I try it and then I break it.
[02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:42.580]   My husband's like, oh my God.
[02:04:42.580 --> 02:04:45.460]   Time to call the plumber again.
[02:04:45.460 --> 02:04:48.100]   So nice.
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:48.260]   Yeah.
[02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:52.420]   Kevin, you got to pick a tip, something for us.
[02:04:52.980 --> 02:05:00.420]   I got a little new feature in Chrome that kind of should remind you of Android.
[02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:05.860]   Because the same feature that Android has with the app shortcuts.
[02:05:05.860 --> 02:05:08.660]   Like with you tap and hold on an Android app right now,
[02:05:08.660 --> 02:05:11.860]   you get these little shortcuts that will bring you to certain activities.
[02:05:11.860 --> 02:05:15.780]   You can now do that in Chrome OS on the dev channel for sure.
[02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:19.780]   And one of my readers just commented he's got it on the beta channel as well.
[02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:21.140]   So that's a good thing.
[02:05:21.140 --> 02:05:23.940]   And it's just a Chrome flag setting.
[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:27.700]   So Leo, you could just switch the flag on and you're good to go.
[02:05:27.700 --> 02:05:31.860]   It's an enable touchable app context menu, which is a mouthful.
[02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:37.460]   So you have to, obviously, you have to have an Android app to do this.
[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:37.940]   Install.
[02:05:37.940 --> 02:05:38.660]   That's correct.
[02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:39.140]   Yeah.
[02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:40.500]   It's not just for any old apps.
[02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:41.460]   Nope.
[02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:42.100]   Nope.
[02:05:42.100 --> 02:05:44.500]   And you have to turn it on in the Chrome flags.
[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:45.460]   In the Chrome flags.
[02:05:45.460 --> 02:05:49.300]   And it doesn't matter if the Android app is in the shelf or the app launcher,
[02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:52.660]   wherever it is, you can long press and get the shortcuts.
[02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:55.860]   When did they start rotating the wallpapers properly?
[02:05:55.860 --> 02:05:57.620]   I'm just so glad that they did that.
[02:05:57.620 --> 02:06:00.340]   With the surprise me feature?
[02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:01.220]   Yeah.
[02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:02.420]   For a long time, I was just,
[02:06:02.420 --> 02:06:05.540]   the surprise me gave me one wallpaper.
[02:06:05.540 --> 02:06:06.580]   Yeah.
[02:06:06.580 --> 02:06:08.820]   They have changed.
[02:06:08.820 --> 02:06:11.860]   You even have an older version of the wallpaper.
[02:06:11.860 --> 02:06:17.220]   There's a new one that's even better, very material design looking and all that.
[02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:18.580]   And yeah.
[02:06:18.580 --> 02:06:20.100]   Does it download new ones or?
[02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:23.700]   It actually goes out to a server.
[02:06:23.700 --> 02:06:25.780]   They have a service that's running with it.
[02:06:25.780 --> 02:06:27.220]   I think I believe it's the same.
[02:06:27.220 --> 02:06:32.020]   They're going to be putting it together with the same one that the Chromecast uses.
[02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:32.420]   What is it?
[02:06:32.420 --> 02:06:32.900]   Backdrop.
[02:06:32.900 --> 02:06:33.540]   Oh, I love that.
[02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:36.180]   Because that, you know, by the way, can have your own pictures and that as well,
[02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:36.900]   which is nice.
[02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:37.380]   Right.
[02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:37.700]   Right.
[02:06:37.700 --> 02:06:42.180]   So but you'll be able to get like backdrop type rotating pictures on the wallpaper,
[02:06:42.180 --> 02:06:44.740]   which is weird because we really never see the wallpaper.
[02:06:44.740 --> 02:06:45.780]   I know.
[02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:48.420]   But notice it's now going down into the menu bar.
[02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:51.940]   I don't know if that's a new feature too, but the menu bar is not separate.
[02:06:51.940 --> 02:06:54.420]   These are just little icons floating on the paper, which is.
[02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:54.420]   Yeah.
[02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:57.780]   There's a flag to have that as transparent or a color.
[02:06:57.780 --> 02:06:58.580]   So yeah.
[02:06:58.580 --> 02:06:59.940]   I don't think I set that.
[02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:00.580]   So it must be.
[02:07:00.580 --> 02:07:02.740]   Yeah, it probably came with the dev channel.
[02:07:02.740 --> 02:07:05.300]   Oh, though, that old dev channel.
[02:07:05.300 --> 02:07:06.980]   Got me an install.
[02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:12.740]   I wish Google when it runs photos of things for Chrome, for any background,
[02:07:12.740 --> 02:07:14.420]   would tell you where these places are.
[02:07:14.420 --> 02:07:17.220]   They do actually.
[02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:19.860]   They do on Chromecast.
[02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:21.460]   Mine does not.
[02:07:21.460 --> 02:07:22.820]   What am I missing?
[02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:25.060]   They do.
[02:07:25.060 --> 02:07:25.460]   Sorry.
[02:07:25.460 --> 02:07:25.860]   I'm cast.
[02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:26.100]   Yeah.
[02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:30.340]   When it first comes up, there's a little like MTV style little box.
[02:07:30.340 --> 02:07:30.820]   Doesn't it?
[02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:31.060]   Maybe.
[02:07:31.060 --> 02:07:32.980]   Mine just says who took the photo.
[02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:35.140]   Oh, yeah.
[02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:35.940]   Okay.
[02:07:35.940 --> 02:07:37.300]   So if you uncheck.
[02:07:37.300 --> 02:07:39.380]   Surprise me.
[02:07:39.380 --> 02:07:44.980]   It is now saying in the control panel, this is by Mike Raphman.
[02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:45.540]   But you're right.
[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:46.580]   It doesn't say where.
[02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:49.220]   It does give you a link to his website.
[02:07:49.220 --> 02:07:53.300]   So maybe there you'd be able to see in his galleries.
[02:07:53.300 --> 02:07:55.700]   So you'd at least be able to do some research.
[02:07:55.700 --> 02:07:57.060]   But yeah, I agree with you.
[02:07:57.060 --> 02:07:58.180]   I often want to see that.
[02:07:58.180 --> 02:08:02.340]   That's one thing on Windows, they have the Bing wallpaper.
[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:05.540]   And it does give you additional information, which is really nice.
[02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:08.260]   And this is a pretty one.
[02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:09.460]   These are pretty.
[02:08:09.460 --> 02:08:11.220]   I just, I mean, like some of these places, I'm like,
[02:08:11.220 --> 02:08:13.060]   Oh, I totally want to go for that.
[02:08:13.060 --> 02:08:14.420]   You know what?
[02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:18.100]   It's actually a feature Apple just added to the Apple TV.
[02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:21.460]   They actually mentioned it on stage during the WWDC.
[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:23.620]   Is now we'll tell you what you're looking at.
[02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:26.500]   Here's the new one.
[02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:30.500]   Oh, why don't I wonder why I don't have that.
[02:08:30.500 --> 02:08:32.420]   There's there's a flag for that.
[02:08:32.420 --> 02:08:34.020]   And it's got a little explore link.
[02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:36.340]   So you can actually get more information about the picture
[02:08:36.340 --> 02:08:37.940]   and who took it and where it is and all that.
[02:08:37.940 --> 02:08:40.580]   So it kind of is going with what you're looking for Stacy.
[02:08:40.580 --> 02:08:42.020]   Would you know what the name of the flag is?
[02:08:42.740 --> 02:08:46.340]   I think it's wallpaper picker.
[02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:48.660]   Actually, yeah, just do a find on the.
[02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:51.860]   Yeah, you'll find for wallpaper.
[02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:53.780]   It's a flag for everything in Chrome.
[02:08:53.780 --> 02:08:54.580]   Yep.
[02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:57.140]   Is it Chrome slash slash.
[02:08:57.140 --> 02:09:00.580]   From colon slash slash flags.
[02:09:00.580 --> 02:09:04.660]   I actually bookmark that, which is kind of silly,
[02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:05.220]   but you're right.
[02:09:05.220 --> 02:09:07.940]   There's so many flags that it doesn't make sense to type it all the time.
[02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:09.620]   Enable new wallpaper picker.
[02:09:09.620 --> 02:09:10.900]   There you go.
[02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:12.740]   That's the that's the setting enabled.
[02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:14.260]   Nice.
[02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:16.100]   It'll make it restart the browser.
[02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:17.460]   It does after restart.
[02:09:17.460 --> 02:09:19.780]   Anytime you change a flag, pretty much.
[02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:21.060]   It's quick.
[02:09:21.060 --> 02:09:22.500]   Yeah, it is.
[02:09:22.500 --> 02:09:25.460]   I already kind of mentioned my pick,
[02:09:25.460 --> 02:09:27.380]   which is a jump.chat.
[02:09:27.380 --> 02:09:31.460]   Do we want to mention do I want to mention this teletext?
[02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:32.660]   I think it's not it's gone.
[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:36.020]   I really like this site.
[02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:38.500]   But I think they're gone.
[02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:40.500]   T stop.co.uk.
[02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:42.420]   I found this.
[02:09:42.420 --> 02:09:47.060]   I like to browse like the pinboard popular and Reddit and so forth.
[02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:48.020]   And this was really cool.
[02:09:48.020 --> 02:09:51.700]   They were simulating a teletext terminal on a website,
[02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:53.220]   but it's it's gone now.
[02:09:53.220 --> 02:09:56.500]   So I can't make that my pick.
[02:09:56.500 --> 02:10:01.220]   Everybody we're out of time, but we have had some fun.
[02:10:01.220 --> 02:10:04.500]   Stacey Higginbotham is at Stacey on IOT.com.
[02:10:04.500 --> 02:10:07.140]   Subscribe to her free newsletter as I do.
[02:10:07.140 --> 02:10:08.900]   It's a great read all about IOT.
[02:10:08.900 --> 02:10:12.580]   And of course, she and Kevin do a great podcast together.
[02:10:12.580 --> 02:10:15.140]   What's the what's the name of that podcast?
[02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:17.460]   So people can ask for it on their Amazon Zekos.
[02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:20.900]   The Internet of Things podcast.
[02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:22.740]   You have to go with all the words.
[02:10:22.740 --> 02:10:26.580]   So you could say echo, listen to the Internet of Things podcast.
[02:10:26.580 --> 02:10:29.220]   You would say play the Internet of Things podcast.
[02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:29.780]   And you'd get it.
[02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:30.660]   And it shall happen.
[02:10:30.660 --> 02:10:32.340]   And it shall happen the most recent episode.
[02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:37.060]   Kevin Tofel's new site, newish site is about Chromebook stock.
[02:10:37.060 --> 02:10:40.980]  com on the web and then must read if you have a Chromebook.
[02:10:40.980 --> 02:10:42.900]   Or if you're thinking about a Chromebook,
[02:10:42.900 --> 02:10:47.780]   it's kind of the definitive information about the Chromebooks.
[02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:49.140]   You've done a really good job with it.
[02:10:49.140 --> 02:10:50.420]   Appreciate that.
[02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:50.820]   Thank you.
[02:10:50.820 --> 02:10:51.140]   Thank you.
[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:52.740]   Always great to see you and Norm.
[02:10:52.740 --> 02:10:55.140]   We didn't see Norm.
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:55.780]   We didn't see Norm.
[02:10:55.780 --> 02:10:56.660]   Norm was Norm around.
[02:10:56.660 --> 02:10:58.020]   He only heard of he.
[02:10:58.020 --> 02:11:00.500]   He's still recovering from his trip down to Washington DC.
[02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:01.860]   He took two Ubers there.
[02:11:01.860 --> 02:11:03.620]   He visited a bunch of museums.
[02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:05.700]   Oh, you got to see the picture.
[02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:08.340]   Go to Kevin's Instagram, Leo.
[02:11:08.340 --> 02:11:09.780]   Man, this picture is so adorable.
[02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:10.340]   What's your Instagram?
[02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:11.460]   Kevin Tofel?
[02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:12.260]   Kevin C Tofel.
[02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:13.140]   Kevin C Tofel.
[02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:14.820]   Is there a Kevin Tofel?
[02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:15.220]   Not for granted.
[02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:17.780]   See, is there a reason why he's that C?
[02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:18.660]   I hope not.
[02:11:18.660 --> 02:11:22.660]   But no, I just have always used my good international.
[02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:24.180]   Oh, Norm.
[02:11:24.180 --> 02:11:25.140]   Oh, Norm.
[02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:26.580]   Keep going.
[02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:28.260]   Norm and our nation's capital.
[02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:31.060]   Oh, how are you getting the toll booth?
[02:11:31.060 --> 02:11:32.580]   This is the best.
[02:11:33.380 --> 02:11:34.900]   [laughs]
[02:11:34.900 --> 02:11:36.980]   One hour into the vacation and the humans figure out,
[02:11:36.980 --> 02:11:38.500]   they forgot their cash.
[02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:38.980]   Nice.
[02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:41.060]   I suppose I can work a shift to bail them out.
[02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:42.020]   Oh, Norm.
[02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:43.940]   Oh, Norm.
[02:11:43.940 --> 02:11:45.380]   You're in the kids.
[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:46.260]   Fans everywhere.
[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:47.140]   Fans everywhere.
[02:11:47.140 --> 02:11:49.060]   That's so cute.
[02:11:49.060 --> 02:11:51.780]   What is, you said he's a Beijon Frise?
[02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:52.740]   Is that what he is?
[02:11:52.740 --> 02:11:53.300]   He is.
[02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:53.540]   Yeah.
[02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:54.900]   He is.
[02:11:54.900 --> 02:11:55.940]   Oh.
[02:11:55.940 --> 02:11:56.420]   Oh.
[02:11:56.420 --> 02:11:57.860]   Oh, Norm.
[02:11:57.860 --> 02:11:59.380]   Norm's napping.
[02:11:59.380 --> 02:12:00.580]   Yep.
[02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:02.020]   That's so cute.
[02:12:02.020 --> 02:12:02.580]   He's always napping.
[02:12:02.580 --> 02:12:03.300]   That's, yeah.
[02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:05.300]   He is a sweet dog.
[02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:07.940]   I wish my Beijon Frise chill is Norm.
[02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:10.180]   Mine was nice.
[02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:12.500]   Norm sleeps a heck of a lot.
[02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:14.900]   He can be pretty wild, but no, he likes to just crash.
[02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:16.260]   It's not a bad thing in a dog.
[02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:17.140]   No.
[02:12:17.140 --> 02:12:18.260]   No.
[02:12:18.260 --> 02:12:19.300]   In my humble opinion.
[02:12:19.300 --> 02:12:20.660]   [laughs]
[02:12:20.660 --> 02:12:22.980]   All right, everybody.
[02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:24.340]   We are so glad you were here.
[02:12:24.340 --> 02:12:26.260]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday,
[02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:27.540]   my last show of the week.
[02:12:27.540 --> 02:12:29.860]   Because I start on Saturday.
[02:12:29.860 --> 02:12:32.180]   If you want to see it live, you can.
[02:12:32.180 --> 02:12:36.660]   We do it about 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2030 UTC.
[02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:37.860]   You can watch it.
[02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:39.380]   Twit.tv/live.
[02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:40.820]   You can listen there too.
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:42.580]   We have an audio stream if you're at work.
[02:12:42.580 --> 02:12:44.740]   If you do go in the live show though,
[02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:46.100]   you should join us in the chatroom.
[02:12:46.100 --> 02:12:47.540]   IRC.twit.tv.
[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:48.340]   That's always fun.
[02:12:48.340 --> 02:12:51.860]   And if you can't do it live,
[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:53.140]   you can always do it on demand.
[02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:56.020]   Audio and video of everything we do available
[02:12:56.020 --> 02:12:57.380]   at our website, twit.tv.

[02:13:01.140 --> 02:13:07.300]   And of course, if you want to hear it on your voice activated device,
[02:13:07.300 --> 02:13:10.100]   play this week in Google.
[02:13:10.100 --> 02:13:12.180]   We'll do it.

[02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:15.460]   That way you'll get it.
[02:13:15.460 --> 02:13:17.700]   The minute it's ready every single week.
[02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:18.420]   Thank you, Kevin.
[02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:19.140]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:13:19.140 --> 02:13:19.940]   Have a great week.
[02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:22.020]   See you too.
[02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:22.420]   Thank you.
[02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:24.420]   [music]
[02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:26.420]   Bye!
[02:13:26.420 --> 02:13:33.420]   (music)
