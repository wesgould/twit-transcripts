[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.680]   Perch in the pigeon cam
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.280]   It was a brilliant brilliant job. You have named you now have named that that position
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.320]   Yeah

[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.360]   Philanthropist and among other
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.560]   Philanthropies the Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York. That's why we sing your
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.120]   Graduate School of Journalism every week every week
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.120]   Hi Craig
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.720]   Hey, it's my pleasure to be here. I really do listen to the show fairly religiously
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.100]   I am very much looking forward to the immoral panic
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:55.680]   Oh there it is and has put up moral panic triggered it
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.080]   Craig
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.040]   It's funny because we not water we invoke you all the time. What was it not water?
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.440]   You're not be water
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.200]   Oh, inquirer and minds got a no after 5 p.m. Yeah, it's okay
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.320]   Good milk. I am I am in New York now in pretty much our new our new home
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.200]   New York as it turns out is much better for my health really
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.040]   I
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.760]   Well, mostly I eat less badly
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.840]   In San Francisco, I would tend to fill up a refrigerator for the day
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.920]   But I have little discipline I practice the seafood diet
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.680]   And that's not good news weight
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.320]   in York I
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:56.640]   Get a little food, but if I want more food I have to decide if it's worth putting on pants
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.560]   So you're on the no pants diet is actually
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.440]   Whatever whatever substitute for self discipline works, I'll do
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.480]   I can't go out because I don't have any pants no pants diet. So you're in are you in Manhattan?
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:22.120]   Yes, we're pretty much in the village. Oh, nice even in the in the window you see a little bit of a
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.320]   bird feeder
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.320]   pigeons have been sporadically
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.720]   Trying to get into it and fighting among themselves. I saw them earlier actually now want to see some pigeon action. Yeah
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.720]   Wait, are there any other birds in New York? I
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.800]   Mean I live there, but I never saw anything else
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.440]   the dust
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.040]   There are doves and we have the occasional sparrow cardinal
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.840]   tufted tip mouse and
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.120]   A few others like that
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.360]   Craig are you a bird watcher?
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.760]   Pretty half-assed we put out food and water if the birds decide to visit us. That's good
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:08.800]   San Francisco a lot more variety. We've seen a lot of the wild parrots. Oh, yeah, that's
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.500]   Nice crakes a bird lover bird lover. I and we should we should note that Craig
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:21.080]   Today just just before announced hold on where is it here Craig a whole news for the philanthropy
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.280]   You pigeon philanthropy. Yeah
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.920]   What it was that
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.800]   So great gave a grant to
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.960]   Paloma sees on his hey Craig
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.240]   Yeah, we're in a Paloma Blanca
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.840]   As a dove yeah, you continue pigeon and dove rescue work for pigeon rescue.org. Oh
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.960]   Wow
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.760]   Yeah, I figure there are successor species. I should suck up to them
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.800]   Do you also invest in robots?
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:05.800]   I hedge my bets. I also have welcomed our machine overlords. Yeah, nice nice
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:14.640]   So that's really is this is kind of what you do now day and day out you don't run daily the daily operation at crakes lister do you?
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:20.320]   Well, I gave that job up in the year 2000 Wow
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.640]   People help me understand that as a manager. I suck
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:31.160]   I've retired I retired a few years ago
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:39.800]   Particularly considering that I'm just short of 70 now what you don't look at old
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:45.600]   Smoke you don't I would never have thought that no, you're not you're not that close, Craig
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.800]   Well, I'll be sick. I'll be 69 soon, but I need to do this
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:57.360]   Yeah, you're getting used to it is what you're doing. Yeah, I know one year old and I know he's trying to put me closer to 7 Craig
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.480]   I'm sick
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:04.440]   64 and I do the same thing with 65. Yeah, I've been I've been preparing myself for that for the years
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.440]   It's not easy
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.920]   Not make sure you
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:16.400]   Make sure you sign up for the appropriate parts of Medicare. I did I did I did very good because there's a penalty
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.280]   If you don't I just I was telling the yes crew. I did that yesterday, which is
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.080]   Yeah
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.240]   So you so you're full-time in philanthropy then basically yeah
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.240]   and you
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.200]   Have done a lot of things, but it seems if somewhat of a focus in
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.960]   journalism
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.000]   well
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.920]   Right now from my point of view and my background is computer science is somewhat abstract
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.600]   I'm looking at information warfare in different forms
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.360]   the big priorities these days are
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.840]   Like helping with cybersecurity
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:57.800]   Fighting disinformation or as the cool kids call it influence operations
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.400]   And also countering harassment
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.200]   First focusing on the worst of it, which is directed against women journalists
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.920]   There's other areas including helping vets
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.320]   Women in tech and as you've seen pigeon rescue
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.960]   Wow, by the way, here is the site Palomacy. It's pigeon
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.240]   Diplomacy at pigeon rescue org
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.720]   While you're at it, you will Craig Newmark and pigeons and there's some great pictures. You'll see
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.320]   Great kids up close and personal with pigeons
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:38.800]   Some people if I would do that. Yeah, I mean some people think of them as flying rats, but I guess Craig you're a open-minded fellow
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.160]   Well
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.160]   Those those were stunt pigeons
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.800]   Good as it turns out
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.440]   Pigeon pants is a thing they're diapers and
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:11:01.680]   You want to you want the pigeon to be wearing the diaper before it flies onto your shoulder to cool lovingly
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.120]   Note to self
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.360]   I'm just glad you explained that the diapers were for the pigeons
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.440]   I just was I was unclear at the beginning and now I understand
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:26.640]   Rather call them pigeon pants than depends. I like this now. Let me
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.440]   Let me let me let me be the journalist and ask you the hard question
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:38.220]   Greg is your supportive journalism because of a little residual guilt there are some journals that claim
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:44.140]   Craig's list was the end of journalism because you of course took over their class
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.100]   They're very lucrative classified ads. Well the
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.440]   In the recent years, let's see the last several years
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.680]   Economists and industry analysts have finally taken a look at the numbers
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.000]   because I
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.120]   Worried that Craigslist that is substantial effect. I assume there must be something
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:07.520]   Yeah, but some of the guys took a look at the numbers adjusted for inflation
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.280]   Looked at circulation
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.760]   Household growth at Tom Tom Bechtall
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.120]   I an economist took a look at this and he showed
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.800]   Starting in the 60s earlier
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.080]   When television news became a thing
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.520]   newspaper started dying oh that's interesting
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:33.000]   He shows in 2008 and 2009 how with the platforms taken off
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.440]   That's when newspaper revenue
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.300]   Plumbited right it's a big concern to me because like I say
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.600]   Trustworthy press is the immune system of democracy
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.000]   Perhaps it failed us in 2016
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.720]   My instincts tells us that Craigslist had to have some effect, but the economists tell me I'm just flattering myself
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.720]   I
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:06.200]   I'm looking at craze list and it's still exactly the same as it always has been which is
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.440]   I still go in this day and age kind of refreshing who doesn't go there. You need an apartment. That's the
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:11.600]   I
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   Is there a
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:19.240]   Like yeah, that's nice. Oh, no, I was gonna say I'm on Craigslist all the time. It is my recycling plan for
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.400]   Devices, yeah, it's the way I get in furniture. I'm just like yeah
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:30.480]   Deep Craig is there an origin story to the to the I use your quotes design. Yeah, I was gonna ask him that exactly
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.200]   I'm in 96 or so. I'm not real clear. I
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.200]   Realize that the emails I was posting
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.560]   I could write some code in Pearl
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.800]   That would turn those emails which were in a predictable format into web pages
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.840]   I could write a script which built index pages. So I had free
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.600]   Web publishing so it started right away as it got a little more complicated
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.600]   I realized that I have no design skills
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.400]   But no
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:11.040]   Thank you, I know to keep things simple and as it turns out
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:17.680]   simple and fast our great design points and what do you have against uppercase letters?
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.280]   That is a bit of a programmer cliche
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.720]   That is that I do like a lowercase. It's easier to visually parse
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.000]   But in the case of the name of the thing I
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.600]   Wanted to de-emphasize
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.800]   the role and presence of the guy named Craig
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.440]   and
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.120]   Craig has always been one of the most humble of
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.440]   Absolute original internet
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.680]   Foken so we appreciate it. Craig and I talked about when we chat his friends
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:59.440]   That I'm curious what the latest is is we compare gadgets and gadget hunger. Yeah, what's your current phones Craig?
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.920]   I'm afraid I've over-endosed
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:10.320]   Recently they don't have the I do have the sims on fold three nice. Okay. All right
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.440]   I want I want to get some input from you on that, but okay keep going
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.080]   Well, the deal is it is a substantial improvement over the two
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:25.120]   screens much better speakers better. It's faster more durable
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:31.440]   battery life has at best not improved and that's a source of some
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.120]   Irritation but I get a lot of proposals
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.240]   formatted eight and half by eleven PDFs and so
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:44.480]   Those are you know the screen is good for that. I do use my notebook for things
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.920]   But sometimes because sometimes you want a big screen and big keyboard
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.920]   But my my own is my main computer and
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:59.400]   And let it be known that Craig is a Chromebook user because I like you know
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.760]   Yeah, I'm a very aware
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:08.680]   Security is a
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:17.040]   Yes, I have actually taken some advice from Kevin. I will be upgrading our systems my wife and mine
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.760]   We have 22 nephews and nieces between us who all need
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:28.560]   Chromebooks or Chromebook upgrades. I should say 22, but I I haven't checked today
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.840]   Busy busy family
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.640]   That's cool. So what are you getting watching?
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.040]   Are you getting the answer spinner? What are you getting? I
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.640]   Was gonna ask him if he's getting a grand like a grandson or granddaughter
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.720]   Well, you know, we each have our own interests. It's okay
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.560]   You have a grand computer
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:59.720]   No, it's a tiny thing. I may get the HP chrome chrome base all in one. Oh, those are nice
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.040]   Yeah, I never I never move my
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:07.400]   Helps around right so you don't need a laptop. Yeah. Yeah, not really sweet
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.920]   So just the fold or do you have other other devices?
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:19.040]   Well, I do have the fold eyes a backup. I have an old pixel and
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.800]   I just know a cudum inside this microphone and a decent camera
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:29.840]   I'm gonna have to ask you about the microphone because everybody I know who's watching is gonna say what is he using not only does it sound good?
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.840]   It looks pretty sweet cool
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.920]   This is a tool a microphone
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.560]   startup a couple hundred dollars
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.080]   It does make me sound like an NPR announcer
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.920]   It's actually beautiful. I really like how it looks. It is
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.280]   That's cool. I do have a lot of tote bags. I'd like to give away
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:57.720]   Well for a small contribution you two can get a craig new mark tote bag
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:04.520]   So in fact craig I saw it you talked about it before the pre-show and I ordered it already
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:10.560]   So mine's on the way partly because in fact like Jeff you should get it to it's a USB USB C
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.320]   It obviously works with a chrome device chrome book device
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.280]   But also it has internal memory so you can record locally as you're as you're using it
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:23.360]   Which would be great for those times when as long as you don't yell at me for whatever my microphone choices
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.960]   I want I want everyone to be a witness. How could I yell at you? How could I yell at you? This is the official?
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.960]   Oh, you find your way. My
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:36.240]   Well, I ordered one too so
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:43.120]   The memory capacity will be good because my comedy tutor
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:47.360]   want some help recording a set sometime soon and
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.400]   I
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.640]   Redundancy is a good thing. So I'll be recording him on my phone and so on. Okay
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.640]   >> Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.640]   >> Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.640]   We haven't talked to you.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.640]   >> Wait, wait, wait.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.640]   Hold on now.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.640]   (laughter)
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.200]   >> You did that on purpose, Craig.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.520]   I can tell.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.760]   What do you mean your comedy tutor?
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:10.840]   >> Well, I know I'm not as funny as I think I am.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.880]   But around the corner here in the village, this guy who's been doing comedy for over
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:20.500]   50 years, he was very, very popular in the '70s.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.600]   We're trying to help a little bit.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:28.600]   And he has given me material to use, trying to help me with my delivery and timing.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.600]   >> You see how right I'm talking.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.600]   >> I didn't know this.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   >> The consensus is that he knew any Bruce.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.520]   He's not old.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.520]   >> Whoa.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.600]   >> And he says I have very little hope.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.600]   (laughter)
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.600]   >> At least he's honest.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.600]   He's not giving you false hopes.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.600]   >> I said, yeah.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:55.600]   At my age, everything I want for Christmas is at the drug store.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.600]   (laughter)
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.600]   >> I can tell he wrote that for you.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.600]   >> The delivery was pretty good.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.600]   I think you just kind of slung it in there.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.600]   You're under--
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.600]   >> Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.600]   >> Very nice.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.600]   Well done.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.600]   Can you say his name or is it secret?
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.600]   Is it private?
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.600]   >> His name is Dave Hynan.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.600]   >> Okay.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:18.720]   >> And he was much better known way back of the collection of friends I have here who hang
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.720]   out at the same coffee shop.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.720]   There's a handful of people who've been here 50 years.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.720]   And then there's a handful of people who just moved here.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.720]   So that's pretty cool about the village.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.720]   And I'm afraid you don't find in San Francisco.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.720]   I'm jealous because I think if I were going to live in New York, the village is definitely
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   the place to live.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.720]   It's beautiful.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.720]   You're right by Washington.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.720]   >> You're right by Washington.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.720]   >> You're right by Washington.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.720]   >> You're right by Washington.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.720]   >> You're right by Washington.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.720]   >> Are you going to do some over Mike's, Craig?
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   >> I'm going to do some over Mike's.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:17.720]   >> I think I need to stay focused on areas which in fact,
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.720]   Jeff Jarvis got me into.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.720]   He's responsible for my getting into a number of the
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.720]   fields that I spend most of my time in.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.720]   So it is his fault.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.720]   >> Nice.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.720]   >> No, no, no.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.720]   He gets the credit I don't deserve.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.720]   >> That's nice.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.720]   >> Craig was interested in and concerned about journalism
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.720]   and I'm not sure if it's a good thing.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.720]   >> I'm not correct because it's no doubt.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.720]   >> Yeah, as a journalist, I've got to thank you.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.720]   >> Yes.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.720]   >> Yes.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.720]   >> Well, the deal is that Jeff in 2017 got me to read the
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.720]   NATO Handbook on Russian Information Warfare.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.720]   It described the techniques the Russians used in 2016,
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.720]   but as it turns out, the same techniques had been used
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:03.720]   in an unpleasant manner against me years before.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.720]   So that actually really helped me out.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.720]   And now I'm helping out a lot of other folks.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.720]   >> It had been used against you.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   The Russians were out to get you?
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.720]   >> No.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.720]   Domestic Actors was the same thing.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   >> But they knew what they were doing.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.720]   >> This goes back to Octavian Caesar,
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   who was a part of the United States.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.720]   >> And I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.720]   >> Well, Craig, I also don't want to keep Craig too long.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.720]   I know he's got pigeons to diaper,
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.720]   and I don't want to get in the way of whatever your plans are
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.720]   for the rest of the afternoon.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.720]   But we are thrilled to have you.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.720]   We invoke you every week, as you know, and it finally worked.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.720]   >> Yes.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.720]   >> The remnants of Hurricane Ida just struck.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   >> Yes.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   >> Just struck your dark around side.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:44.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:51.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:58.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:28.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   >> I'm not sure if you're interested in this.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:51.720]   >> It was so long ago, Craig, I barely remember it.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:58.720]   Craig, I completely forgive you for that.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.720]   >> Craig, newmarkphilanthropies.org.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.720]   If you want to see all the amazing things, Craig is up to.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.720]   >> Thank you, my friend.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   >> We are very grateful to what you are doing.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.720]   We've done in this century as well as what you did in the
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.720]   previous.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   >> Thanks, Craig.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.720]   >> Thank you.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.720]   >> Take care.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.720]   >> Craig, newmark, ladies and gentlemen, let's all sing it.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.720]   >> Craig, you are.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.720]   Be careful, you might appear again.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.720]   >> And he's back and now he's angry.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.720]   >> See you at three times and he shows up.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.720]   >> I want to give credit where it's due.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   That was Craig's idea of when we summoned him from another
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.720]   world that he could appear.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.720]   It was hilarious.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.720]   >> Yes, I said it to Leo.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.720]   Leo said, oh, that's hilarious.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   >> We all fell for it.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.720]   It's a wonderful spot.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.720]   >> Did his joke writer come up with the placement?
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.720]   That was excellent.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.720]   >> I think that was my idea.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.720]   >> That was my idea.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   >> That was perfect.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.720]   >> That was a boss.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.720]   >> That was perfect.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.720]   >> Actually, I said he should appear in a circle.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   Jammer Bee said we'll put him in the gear.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.720]   >> Not a circle.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.720]   >> It was a mutual effort.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.720]   >> Well done, team.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.720]   >> Isn't he the greatest?
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.720]   >> Yeah, he's a sweetheart.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.720]   >> Thanks for setting that up.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.720]   >> Yeah, he's really sweetheart.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.720]   >> Yeah, thank you, Jeff.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.720]   >> He's such a good man.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.720]   It's actually great to see somebody who takes so seriously his
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:23.720]   responsibilities and genuinely tries to make a difference in
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.720]   the world.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.720]   It's really pretty cool.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.720]   It's really neat.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.720]   >> Also, journalists are pretty cool people.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.720]   So I would like to hang out and fund journalists.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.720]   I mean, we're amazing.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   >> Some of us.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.720]   >> We won't say who.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.720]   >> I'm not a journalist.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.720]   I just play one on TV.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.720]   I want to just say that right up front.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.720]   So anyway, let's take a little break.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   And then we actually have quite a bit of news to talk about on
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   this week in Google.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   It was so much fun.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.720]   I'm still kind of glowing a little bit.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   >> Our show today brought to you, and I mean brought to you quite
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.720]   literally by those great folks at Cashlight.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.720]   We really couldn't have done Twitch, the podcast network.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.720]   Without the help of Cashlight.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.720]   Way back in the beginning, we were trying to figure out how do we
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:14.720]   get a quarter of a million people download a show every week
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.720]   without killing our servers, because it was.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.720]   We tried BitTorrent for a while.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   Then Matt Lavina, Cashlight, called me up and said, "Let us
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.720]   help." And man, for more than a decade now, if you download
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.720]   anything, our video or audio, even if you go to the website and
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.720]   get the content, you're getting it from Cashlight.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.720]   The CDN, the best CDN in the world.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.720]   They've been innovating content delivery since 1999.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.720]   We've been using them since, I think, 2009, maybe.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.720]   They offer ultra low latency streaming now, which is really
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.720]   interesting to me.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.720]   We're not talking webRTC, and we know about the fillings of that.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.720]   The stream delays on Cashlight's ultra low latency streaming,
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.720]   less than one second.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.720]   They offer a great HTML5 player with an SDK, which you can embed
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   anywhere, websites, applications, even mobile devices.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.720]   The Cashlight is the fastest CDN for throughput globally, over 50
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.720]   points of presence all over the world.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.720]   So you're closer to your customers.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   And on their low latency network, your video streams will be
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.720]   streaming quickly.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.720]   Anywhere you have viewers, doesn't matter where, what continent
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.720]   they are.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:27.720]   And man, does it scale up to a million users concurrently, more
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.720]   than a million users concurrently.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.720]   You can ingest thousands of synchronous streams.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.720]   They've designed a platform that can transmux thousands of
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.720]   streams simultaneously.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:42.720]   With Live Failover, they can ingest RTMP, RTMP, SSRT, and more
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.720]   to deliver ultra low latency SLDP and HLS streams at the same time.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.720]   And of course, one of the things we always liked about Cashlight,
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.720]   I always loved about it, is they tailor your plan to your
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:59.720]   needs, your usage, your particular kinds of bandwidth spikes, all
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.720]   built on top of their reliable, robust global network with ingest
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.720]   and delivery, wherever you need it all over the world.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.720]   And the best 24/7/365 priority support.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:15.720]   Can I, by the way, just say that because they have all of those
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.720]   points of presence, they're the world's most reliable CDN backed
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.720]   by 100% SLA.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.720]   We're not talking one nine, five, nine, ten, nine, 100%
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.720]   100% a million concurrent streams five times faster than other
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.720]   CDNs and 100% SLA.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.720]   You're going to love Cashlight.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.720]   And they're nice people too.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.720]   They've been helping the world's central kitchen during the
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:43.720]   COVID crisis and so far have served warm meals to people in need.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.720]   They pioneered the first Anycast CDN infrastructure in 2002.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.720]   The best top technology automatically finds the fastest route
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.720]   to and from customer origin across their global network of
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.720]   pops for maximum performance and reliability.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.720]   If you're interested, can I recommend just go to
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.720]   twit.cashlight.com.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.720]   Bring along your CDN bill if you've got one, your usage,
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.720]   patterns if you've got them.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.720]   Check and see if you are overpaying 20% or more for a CDN.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:12.720]   Nice guys.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.720]   No pressure.

[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.720]   Thank you, Cashlight, for all you do for us.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.720]   Twit.cashlight.com.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:28.720]   This is the only show I'm going to bring this up on, but I think
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.720]   it's the kind of subject we should probably talk about on this
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.720]   show.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.720]   The committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riots,
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:41.720]   the insurrection, have demanded records from Facebook, from
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.720]   Twitter, from 4chan, from 8kun, from GAB, from Google,
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   from YouTube, from Parler, from Reddit, from Snapchat, from
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.720]   Telegram, from the Donald.win, from TikTok, Twitch,
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.720]   Twitter, Zello, and yes, phone companies, in fact, Marjorie
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:00.720]   Taylor, Creen said if you send them my phone records.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   (laughs)
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.720]   (laughs)
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.720]   She said we're going to shut you down.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.720]   I don't think she can do that, but anyway, obviously
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.720]   upsetting to some of you.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.720]   She had her boss had power to threaten.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.720]   They certainly can threaten.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.720]   But I think a lot of people, even people on the left, are
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.720]   concerned about this notion, certainly congressional
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:31.720]   committees have wide powers, but they want a lot of information.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.720]   How do we feel about this?
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.720]   What do they want that's not public?
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.720]   Oh, they want a lot more than what's public, certainly from the
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   phone companies.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:46.720]   Where do they want your texts, actually?
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   That's where you have to draw a line.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.720]   If it's not public knowledge, it's a price.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.720]   It's a warrant, but it is a warrant.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.720]   Well, if they have a warrant, and a, you know, a court--
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.720]   Well, Congress has huge powers to do this, of course.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.720]   Oh, this is congressional warrants, because--
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   It's congressional, but they still have a warrant authority.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.720]   Do they go before a judge, or do they go--
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.720]   No, no, they don't need to.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.720]   They're congressional committees.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.720]   They're Congress. Congress has this--
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.720]   That's the word of the government.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   Yeah, they have this power.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.720]   Okay.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:21.720]   So the chairman, Benny G. Thompson, wrote, "The select
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.720]   committee to investigate the January 6th attack on the United
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.720]   States Capitol is examining the facts, circumstances, and causes
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.720]   of the attack and relating to the peaceful transfer power in
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.720]   order to identify and evaluate lessons learned and to recommend
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.720]   corrective laws, policies, procedures, rules, or regulations."
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   So I think it's important to say that at least in this statement,
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.720]   they're not saying we're going after individuals.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:47.720]   This is for understanding so that we can do something going
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.720]   forward.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:55.720]   However, it says they seek a range of records from social media,
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.720]   including data, reports, analyses, and communications,
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:02.720]   stretching back to the spring of 2020.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.720]   They're also seeking information on policy changes, social media
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.720]   companies adopted or failed to adopt, including decisions on
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.720]   banning material.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.720]   You know, I haven't seen the demand--
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:19.720]   So Mike Masnick has it, if you go to the post on the rundown.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.720]   So all accounts, users, groups, events, messaging forms,
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.720]   marketplaces, posts, or other user-generated content that was
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.720]   sanctioned, suspended, removed, throttled, prioritized,
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.720]   labeled, suppressed, or banned from your platforms related to any
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.720]   items detailed in the request.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.720]   So part of what they're saying is we can go look at the public
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.720]   stuff, but if you already killed it, we want to see that too.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.720]   Well, then that's--
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.720]   That's I think legit.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.720]   Yeah, I think that's-- I mean, because it's the same thing like,
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.720]   you know, burning your letters after you're incriminating
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.720]   whatever, so sure.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:56.720]   Masnick calls it a social media fishing expedition and says--
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.720]   --to get issues.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.720]   Companies should resist.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:06.720]   I mean, if you published it socially, it-- I mean,
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.720]   screenshots and everything are there.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.720]   You wanted it to be out.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.720]   Yep.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.720]   Yep.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:15.720]   Yeah, I think I think I think it was public.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.720]   I think it's fair game.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:24.720]   I think your DMs should be considered like a first-class letter
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.720]   and requires a warrant.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.720]   Now, the question is, I don't know what the--
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.720]   as Leo just said, Congress can warrant-- can issue warrants as
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.720]   well.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.720]   Is it the same power as the court?
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:36.720]   I don't know.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.720]   Oh, it's more than the court.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.720]   It's more than the court.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   A congressional subpoena carries a huge weight behind it.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.720]   You need to summon a lawyer into the circle of--
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.720]   Yeah, no, it's my understanding.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.720]   This is absolutely powerful.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:56.720]   Okay, but when you go before Congress, what are the-- it's not--
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:00.720]   I mean, can you use that information to then later charge someone with like a felony or--
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   Well, that's the concern, isn't it?
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.720]   Well, I don't know.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.720]   Congress has broad authority.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.720]   I'll read you what PBS says.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.720]   But this is in the context of impeachment, by the way, but it's the same thing.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:18.720]   Congress has broad authority established by Supreme Court rulings to conduct investigations.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.720]   They can request documents or ask witnesses to testify.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:26.720]   Well, I'm not specified by the Constitution Congress has a long established history of using
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:32.720]   subpoenas to compel testimony when information is not provided voluntarily.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.720]   They have three options to enforce subpoenas in the face of defiance.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.720]   They can pursue criminal contempt, but they have to go to the U.S.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.720]   Attorney for D.C. to bring criminal charges.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:50.720]   That faces a fine of up to $100,000 in a maximum one-year sentence in prison.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.720]   But there are other things they can do.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:58.720]   I don't think-- you can send the sergeant in arms to detain them.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.720]   I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.720]   That seems kind of--
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   Mark! Mark! I'm at the door! Mark!
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.720]   They can also file a civil lawsuit.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.720]   So, while technically they have the power to imprison, they don't--
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   They don't.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.720]   I don't think they would use that.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:20.720]   And, yeah, it would be challenging.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:27.720]   There's a whole legal theory, actually, on how you should treat statements before a Congress
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.720]   in civil or criminal court.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.720]   And it's like, this is a thing.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.720]   Because this is all hearsay.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.720]   Oh, my God.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.720]   It's complicated.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.720]   Because it's not in the Constitution perspective.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.720]   So, it's complicated.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.720]   From the perspective of the company, in my view, there was an insurrection trying to overthrow
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.720]   our government.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.720]   And if the company says, "No, we won't give this to you," are they then complicit in the
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.720]   insurrection?
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   It's the other way to look at it.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.720]   Here's Mike Maslow's--
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:00.720]   Oh, everybody knows also parts of the law or society that says, "Oh, that wasn't really an
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.720]   insurrection."
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:05.720]   And people will fight that saying that it was not an insurrection.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.720]   That's just--
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.720]   That's the investigation.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.720]   That's just how wonky our justice system is.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:16.960]   You know, we just had a man that was killed by a police officer, so yet there was arguments
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.120]   that said, "No, he wasn't killed by a police officer.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:23.520]   He was killed from other stuff."
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.720]   But if we can't investigate if the investigative powers are limited--
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.720]   --are limited.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:34.320]   I'm doing a little devil's advocate here, or barking.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:42.080]   If the investigative powers aren't there, then how is the adjudication decided?
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:48.480]   One of the things Mike Maslow points to particularly as troubling as internal-- this is 0.11 of
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.480]   things they're requesting.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:54.320]   Internal communications, reports, documents, or other materials relating to internal employee
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   concerns about content on the platform associated with the government.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.320]   That's irrelevant.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.320]   Yeah, and I'm not sure why they're--
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.680]   I could be concerned about something.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.240]   You could be concerned about something or not.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.240]   What does that matter?
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.400]   That's absolutely irrelevant as to whether an engineer inside Facebook said, "Oh, I think
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.400]   this is OK."
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.400]   Another one said, "Oh, I don't think it is."
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:17.120]   Masnick points out that these companies, as we've said again and again, have First Amendment
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:22.280]   Protected Moderation Powers.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:26.440]   He says, "Forcing every company to turn over such information seems like a very, very slippery
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:30.760]   slope towards the government, turning that information back around and threatening or
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:34.960]   intimidating companies over these protected moderation decisions."
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:40.680]   Well, but they're being intimidated first by the majority of the minority leader in the
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:44.120]   house who's saying, "I'm going to come get you if you do anything, if you do any of
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:48.560]   this stuff, that the committee with its authority is undercutting the authority of the committee."
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.560]   No, threatening them.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.560]   So your intimidation is secured on both sides by the right in the law.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:39:02.280]   So I guess what I would say is I would hope companies would cooperate to the degree that
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:08.600]   they feel it's appropriate, especially with public or at some time public stops and not
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:13.800]   cooperate to the degree they think it's inappropriate, things like internal employee discussions.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.800]   That's private.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:22.240]   And say, "No, we're not going to give you that, sue us and let the court decide on that."
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.240]   And I would hope that that's the way a company responds to that.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.240]   I don't know.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.960]   We don't know yet how these companies will respond.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:34.440]   I can guess that Acoon is not going to give them anything.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.480]   They're famous for not giving any information.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.480]   Who won't?
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.720]   I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:40.720]   Acoon.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:45.840]   The successor to 4chan, 8chan, 8chan, 8chan, which is, of course, the home of the phony
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.360]   Q.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.200]   Not the real Q, I might add, but the phony Q, who's the son of the guy.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.600]   The party is parlor.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.800]   It all got leaked anyway, so that matter.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.480]   But that's how I don't want to leave.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.400]   Was it pronounced parlor or parlay?
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.720]   I always say parlor.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.200]   I always thought it was parlor.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.720]   Oh, they're not very Frenchie, I don't think.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.000]   I just thought it was to speak, and which is parlay.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.880]   So I'm like, is this a typical called French-Rise Liberty Fry?
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.440]   So I think you could probably assume they're not saying parlay.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.040]   Cheese, I should render monkey.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.520]   No, you're playing parlay.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.520]   You're playing off.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:26.960]   I get it, with this is a kind of a pun of parlay, and parlay, but I don't think they're that
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:27.960]   smart.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.760]   What is the Donald Darwin?
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.560]   I've never heard of that one.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.560]   I know.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.560]   To speak.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:34.560]   I know.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.680]   Sorry, I've been pronouncing it wrong the whole time.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:37.680]   Thank you all.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.680]   No, no, you can be right.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:39.680]   You can be wrong.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.600]   Honestly, we're not in touch with anybody at parlawn.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.600]   We don't know how they pronounce it.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.400]   I did find that I had a parlor log in.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.760]   Oh, I have an account.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.440]   So I guess I did that to protect my name.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.560]   No, no, I immediately signed up for it because I don't hang out there.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.200]   I don't hang out in sewers.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:05.000]   Well, I don't know if it's a sewer, but it's not my cup of tea.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   Let's put it that way.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   All right.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.360]   Like, these people don't want me.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.360]   I know it.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.600]   Oh, I go in there regularly bait them.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.240]   No, no, no.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:21.880]   So is the court of twig ruled here that public things, yes, private things resist.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.720]   Yeah, that's a good thing.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.200]   It's just going forward.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.840]   And if you put it publicly, man, it's public.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.040]   Somebody's shorted somewhere.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.040]   So private.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.320]   Yeah, I'm good on that.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.080]   I need to know more about this situation.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.080]   I'm waffling.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.000]   I just I can't make a call until I actually know more.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   Oh, come on.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.120]   What kind of what do you think?
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.080]   I'm a bad-handed.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.080]   I know.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.080]   We need hot takes here.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.080]   Hot takes.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.040]   Without hot takes, we have nothing.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.320]   I can't give you a hot take.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.520]   I can say if it's public, you should own it.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.120]   She can only give you a hot waffle.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.440]   That's not how the waffles are horrible.
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.440]   You know what?
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.840]   That's actually a nice little pun.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.680]   Instead of the queen of the hot takes, she's the queen of the hot waffle.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:07.680]   Queen of the hot waffles.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.680]   I like it.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.680]   I like it.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.680]   No.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.960]   That's going to be the title of the show right there, Hot Waffle.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:14.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.600]   Or Stacy's Hot Waffle.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.400]   No, I think we'll just leave it that hot waffle.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.400]   generic.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:25.440]   Yeah, I don't want to have any ownership of anything that's warm or hot or no.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.240]   Yeah, I think that that's not unreasonable.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.200]   I would expect that's what these companies would do.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.400]   That's what Apple does, is what Google does, where they resist, where they feel it's inappropriate.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.320]   You know, and up to the point where they can't.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.320]   Where, you know.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.320]   Well, all right.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:43.120]   What if they said, McCarthy, you're right, though we resist the whole thing?
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.120]   Well.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:45.120]   Is that wrong of them?
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.360]   No, I don't think so.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.360]   Really?
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.120]   I think that's wrong of them.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:54.520]   I think there was a serious thing that happened in the country and this was the mechanism by
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:58.480]   which it was done and we were all screaming all the time about how they ought to fess
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.800]   up about how things are, you know, anti-vaxx is being organized there and other things
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   being organized there.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.120]   And the government comes to them and says, tell us how this was organized there.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.120]   And they don't--
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.880]   Jack Dorsey, I think a reasonable-- the CEO of Twitter, the reasonable take would be,
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:17.480]   you know, this is unclear what your power is and how much of this I can legally and responsibly
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.480]   turn over.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.520]   I'd like a court to rule.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:24.840]   So we're going to respectfully say no until a court gives us a clarification.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.840]   That's fair.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:29.160]   Interesting to tell-- what's happens not here?
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.760]   Is that just under the Facebook or--
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.560]   Oh, that is interesting.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:33.560]   Telegram is here.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.560]   Yes, I would assume it's under Facebook.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.560]   Well, it must be because Instagram isn't listed either.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:47.400]   Anyway, yeah, I think, you know, I mean, look, this whole thing has been partisan mess from
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.600]   the beginning.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:52.480]   I'm not surprised that it's become partisan again.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:59.520]   And yeah, I mean, I would-- I think as-- I would like to get to the bottom of this, right?
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:03.160]   But you could see why Marjorie Taylor, Green and Kevin McCarthy are saying, you can't have
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.400]   our phone records.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.480]   Well, that's a different question.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:13.440]   But that is if there was illegal conspiracy to bring down the government through the phones,
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.680]   you know, we do it to the mafia.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.240]   Why not do it to the insurrectionists?
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:24.840]   Well, and you get phone records on people who are persons of interest in a case.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:32.240]   And so if you establish that Marjorie Taylor Green is a Jeff-- Jim, Jim Jordan is--
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.240]   Thank you.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.240]   Thank you.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.240]   Jeff Jarvis, that Jeff Jarvis-- Sorry, no, I--
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.240]   --is just--
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.240]   --cheese, facey.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.240]   Brane.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.240]   Brane.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.240]   Jim Jordan.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.240]   Jim Jordan.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.240]   Never mind.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.040]   Yeah, no, I think-- look, I want to get to the bottom of it.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:54.480]   I don't-- you know, there's things like, who are you talking to when you're over there
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.840]   in the corner making a phone call?
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.160]   Who are you talking through?
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:00.120]   That's one of the things, by the way, that a number of members of Congress do not want
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.320]   to talk about.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.320]   So--
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:07.760]   OK, now we understand it is not Jeff Jarvis.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.760]   It is Jim Jordan, because Jeff wears--
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.320]   What were you saying about that, Jack?
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.720]   What were you saying about that?
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.360]   Jeff is well dressed-- well dressed guy.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:22.360]   There's a battle going on over in Reddit that I've been watching with interest.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.360]   Fascinating.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:28.000]   So there is a-- at least one subreddit on the Reddit.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   More than one, I think.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.840]   But there's at least-- yeah, there's the r/r no, no, no.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:33.840]   It's a bad one.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:34.840]   I mean, but good ones.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.840]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:36.840]   There's--
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.840]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:44.640]   So until today, Reddit said we are not going to block the subreddit No New Normal, which
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:52.000]   has 124,000 subscribers and is really about not getting vaccinated.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   And because Reddit said no, we're-- you know, free speech, we're not going to ban them.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:07.200]   135 other subreddits, including some big ones, like the Macintosh subreddit, went dark, said,
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.880]   OK, we're not going to participate in Reddit.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.040]   We can't in good conscious participate in Reddit.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.360]   Power to the people, man.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.360]   It worked.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.360]   Good stuff.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.840]   Today, Reddit bowed to the pressure and shut down No New Normal.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:19.840]   Wow.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.840]   I don't think R. Querkey was affected.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.840]   I'm sad about that.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.840]   I'm sad about that one.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:31.880]   Because those Querkey people just are such whips.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.320]   They're wafflers and whips.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.800]   They're not focused on this.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.280]   By the way, nor did the Valheim subreddit.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.120]   So, you know, I think, yeah.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.600]   The site R. New Normal, according to Reddit, was guilty.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:49.000]   And this was the thing that finally put it over the top of a practice known as brigading
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:57.960]   where members of the subreddit are encouraged to go target the /r/covid group, for instance.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:04.320]   We found very clear signals indicating that R. No New Normal was the source of about 80
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:08.880]   brigades in the last 30 days, largely directed communities with more mainstream views on
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:13.560]   COVID or location-based communities that have been discussing COVID restrictions.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:21.560]   And that finally gave them, I think, the leverage to shut it down.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:32.840]   Oh, the people for, am I the people?
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:37.240]   They actually did it, which is the other Reddit thread that I am often on.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.560]   So they actually did stop.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:40.560]   Okay.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.560]   So there you go.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.560]   The core he's didn't.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:43.560]   A-I-T-A.
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.560]   A-I-T-A.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.560]   Yes.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.560]   I followed them, too.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:54.200]   Often, often wondering what the hell people are thinking.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.800]   But yeah, yeah.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:00.240]   And I noticed a lot of the subreddits that I participate in were shut down.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.160]   I guess they'll come back.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.280]   They'll come back.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.880]   So that's interesting.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:11.640]   I think that's actually kind of a good example of self-policing and a social network doing
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.880]   a good job of figuring it out.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.320]   Reddit did clarify its guidelines today to make clear that it prohibits posting health
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:25.760]   information that has been manipulated and presented a mislead or poses a risk of significant
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:26.920]   physical harm.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:31.440]   Oh, you follow Tifu?
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:35.280]   Or is it, is it, I am I the a-hole?
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:41.480]   Because Tifu also, Tifu, which has 10 million subscribers, today I f-ed up.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:42.480]   Is that, oh yeah.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.240]   Oh, no, I like advice call-ups.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:46.240]   Oh, okay.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.240]   So I really love this.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.480]   I'm like, oh my god, are these people real?
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:55.240]   Futurology also shut down.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:49:00.040]   Steve Hoffman, who's the CEO of Reddit wrote last week, he wanted the Reddit to be a place
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.120]   for open and authentic discussion.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.360]   Descent is a part of Reddit in the Foundation of Democracy.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:05.600]   I kind of agree with him.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:14.120]   But Reddit is also owned by Conde Nast and at some point, corporate interests take hold.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:17.760]   Pokemon Go subreddit was going dark and would stay private.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:20.760]   That's a big one.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:22.760]   So.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.520]   Someone in the chat just said there's a waffle one.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.880]   So I went to our waffles, but I didn't go to I love waffles.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:31.280]   You always got to be careful on Reddit.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.280]   I know.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.520]   I had not to wander off the well beaten path.
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.120]   Let's put it that way.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:38.760]   The well trod path is the safest.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.640]   No, I love waffles.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.000]   Not acceptable.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   Nothing good there.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   Waffles.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   Okay.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.040]   Hey, how about this one?
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:51.040]   This stimulated a little conversation in our house.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:57.640]   China has announced that if you're under 18, you can only play video games for one hour
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.480]   on Friday, one hour on Saturday, one hour on Sunday.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.720]   That's it.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.720]   It's crazy.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.200]   Depends on the kid.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   I'm okay with that.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.200]   Yeah, Lisa said that's a great idea.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.200]   I said, no, it's not.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.360]   No, that's not.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:17.360]   I mean, like, I know that like my daughter used to socialize.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:21.720]   There's whole communities of people who like do videos of themselves playing their games.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:25.480]   Look, we don't we can't judge because it's not our generation.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:30.400]   And their generation, this seems to be how they communicate.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:35.680]   One wouldn't want a child to become a complete addict, you know, but at the same time, I don't
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.280]   think three hours a week is much.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:42.280]   My mom and dad, and I'll never forgive them for this, said I can only watch half an hour
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:45.960]   of TV a night, which is three and a half hours a week.
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:47.400]   So it's not so different.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.960]   You couldn't even get a movie in once a week.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:50.960]   No.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.360]   I had to choose between man from uncle and batman.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:59.760]   It's like, God, what what hell am I in?
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:04.960]   You know, but what's the difference between your parents or me as a parent, putting this
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.160]   in versus China government?
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.840]   Is it because it's a good overlord?
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:09.840]   It's the answer.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:10.840]   Very good point.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:15.480]   Where it might be accessible for a parent to do should never a government should never
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.480]   be allowed.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:17.480]   Right?
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:23.560]   You know, because I thought it was a good idea to consider in my bringing and considering
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:29.000]   some of the things that I've seen with my own children and nothing against video games.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   But every now and then, I think kids need to get outside into some fresh air and, you
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.520]   know, oh, I do too.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:39.760]   I just think three hours a week is not very much.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.960]   It's not just any three hours.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.760]   It's just between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:43.760]   That's it.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:44.760]   Wow.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.760]   Not just any.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.200]   You have to all play at the same time.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   Wow.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.200]   Well, I guess that's more social.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.360]   I mean, in that way, it's like very much encourage it.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.360]   This is our moment.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.360]   Let's go.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.360]   Land party at my house.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:03.780]   So now that it is a short amount of time, but part of me gets it, you know, part of me
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:04.780]   gets it.
[00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:09.040]   But at the same time, I'm like, no, any parent of teenagers understands.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.880]   I'm not saying that.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.360]   Is this for everyone?
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.620]   Because like, what about the adults who are addicted to the adults could do whatever
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:16.620]   they want?
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:20.000]   It's people under 18 adults with taxpayers.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   I don't know.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   Do they?
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   What is do I don't even know?
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   Does their tax?
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   What is their tax?
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.320]   And I don't think you get paid at all.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.320]   In China?
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.320]   Yes, you get paid.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.320]   Yes, you get paid.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:31.320]   No, no.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.320]   They have salaries.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:38.320]   It's just the US tech companies don't pay them a lot.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.960]   How does that work?
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:43.200]   Is it work like it's here where you get paid and then it presents your income?
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:47.640]   Because like in this wasn't in the Soviet Union, you didn't get you'd get an allowance
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.640]   from the government.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.640]   Okay.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.240]   No, in China, you get paid a salary and you pay taxes.
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:54.240]   Okay.
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:58.280]   So it's more like the US model than the Soviet model.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:02.280]   Yeah, they have a progressive tax system.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.280]   Oh.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.280]   According to Wikipedia.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.780]   Look at that.
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:08.600]   With tax rates from 3% to 45%.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:11.040]   Oh, that sounds typical.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.440]   On all of your income.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.440]   Oh.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.200]   Does it sound so bad?
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.200]   Let's all move there.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.760]   Well, it sounds so familiar.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.760]   There will be no.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.760]   Yeah, it does sound so bad.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.800]   What we have here and what China does have is they have a government that looks at things
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.040]   like Jack Ma too much money.
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.040]   Taking out Jack.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.040]   I was like, Oh crap.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.040]   Okay.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.040]   Let me sell some stuff.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.040]   Let me stop.
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.080]   Also, also Jack Ma criticized the government.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.120]   So that's suddenly when he had too much money.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:44.720]   Well, I do think China is worried about income inequality.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.200]   I think they're keeping an eye on that for political reasons to say.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:54.600]   Oh, Scooter X says the site he pasted, which is not Wikipedia says 5 to 35%.
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.760]   So this is actually interesting.
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:03.360]   This is a table from PwC.com of the tax rate.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:09.000]   And actually I would be taxed less in China than I am here.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   You also would.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   There's a thought.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.840]   Oh, but they charge 20% on your interest in capital gains, etc.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.200]   So some of those you wouldn't have.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:21.520]   Well capital gains here is what?
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:24.640]   What's the maximum 30% 28% I think.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:27.920]   Marks and now are just are just spinning in their grades.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:29.920]   That's called communism.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.920]   Yeah, this is not communism.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:36.480]   To each according to his wants from each according to his abilities.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:41.160]   We just we just we just take it all and give you what you need and you should be happy.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.640]   I remember actually I was in St. Petersburg.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:45.040]   Oh, capital gains tests are less here.
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.040]   They're not 28%.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.040]   How much money you make.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.240]   I thought it was like 20%.
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:53.640]   It's yeah, it's based on how much you make in little chunks.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.640]   Okay.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.880]   So I probably should find out about all this stuff someday I will.
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:54:59.480]   I have a paid taxes.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:00.480]   That's their job.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.480]   Are you kidding?
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:02.480]   I'm a church.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:12.120]   Oh, in 2020 the capital gains taxes 0, 15 or 20% based on your tax bracket.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.120]   Okay.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.120]   Okay.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.120]   That's good.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:22.800]   Did you see Google's doodle yesterday speaking of vaccines?
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.800]   The mask one?
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.440]   Yeah, I really like this.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:31.400]   It said get vaccinated wear a mask save lives and then it linked to a local map of where
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:33.120]   to get vaccinated.
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:34.120]   Isn't that great?
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:39.240]   The all the little Google letters had little masks on.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:40.240]   That's pretty cool.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:48.200]   Some sort of outrage of people that are against the mask mandates and vaccination.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.720]   They're not looking information up on Google.
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.920]   They don't get their info from Facebook.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.400]   Do your research.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:58.880]   You would know the answers.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.880]   Let's see.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:00.880]   Come down.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:06.840]   How many stories did you do while I was gone?
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:07.840]   Where'd you go?
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:08.840]   You were gone.
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:10.000]   Didn't know you were gone, sir.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   Sorry.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.680]   We're still talking about China.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:16.000]   How about let's talk about South Korea.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.480]   He was steaming that blazer.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:22.120]   This needs some steaming I might add.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.240]   Hey, hey, hey.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.240]   The rupple look.
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.240]   You look like a professor.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.920]   Can you get a pipe?
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:33.280]   No, he doesn't look like a professor because he's wearing a t-shirt underneath.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.000]   He looks like some miscreant, but into a restaurant.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   A comedian.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   Oh, what I do.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   He looks like he was.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   He's.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   He's.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   He's.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   Let's load him.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   Let's load him a jacket.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   You're right.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.880]   I've worn those restaurant jackets.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:49.880]   They are not flattering.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.880]   That's a restaurant jacket.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:55.040]   It's a restaurant jacket.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:57.080]   Oh, that was a good one.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.080]   It looks good.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.080]   Sort of.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.080]   No, it's not.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.160]   Well, it does look a little big on you.
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:05.160]   It's just the sh- it doesn't go with your shirt, Jeff.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.160]   Okay.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:08.160]   Okay.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:11.120]   She's bitter because you guys said she was wearing a bib.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:12.600]   Well, that is true.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:16.400]   I mean, I cannot throw stones because I'm hearing a bib.
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:20.320]   You know, you look like you're a podcaster from the future.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.320]   I like it.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.320]   I like that.
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:27.720]   If you stay 60, 20, 40, stay 60, 20, 40.
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:29.760]   In South Korea, a law has passed.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.080]   We'll soon be signed into law.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:37.240]   This is going to be interesting that requires Apple and Google to offer competing payment
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:40.480]   systems in their app stores.
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:43.920]   This is something both Apple and Google have been fighting in the US and they've been fighting
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.200]   for a long time in South Korea.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:51.320]   Companies that failed to comply could be fined up to 3% of their revenue in South Korea.
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:55.880]   Apparently, we talked about this on yesterday on Macbreak Weekly, Apple says, "No, that's
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.040]   no problem.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:00.880]   We'll just bill the developers for their 30% share."
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:04.520]   We'll send them an invoice, which is very interesting.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.160]   I don't know how they're going to get that money.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:12.360]   That is only applies to obviously Korean applications, the Korean app store.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:21.600]   So I explain this to me a bit because now I pay through Apple.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:25.240]   And Apple takes 3% of everything you pay through that mechanism.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:29.200]   But if I paid through some other mechanism, Apple's just going to say, "You still owe
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.200]   us.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:31.200]   We're going to take you."
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.400]   Otherwise, if you don't pay, it's going to take you down.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:36.400]   It's like what the state of California did when Amazon wasn't paying sales tax.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.800]   At the end of the year, when you filed your income taxes in the state, they'd say, "Well,
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:43.680]   what did you buy online and give us that?"
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.920]   Any sales tax you didn't pay Amazon, you're going to pay us.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:50.880]   Not that it worked, but at least they tried.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:54.360]   But Apple still has the power to take down the app that if they don't get paid.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:55.360]   And Apple knows how many people...
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.640]   Yes, you don't pay Apple in this case.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.040]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.600]   But how would they know?
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.600]   They wouldn't know how much you got, would they?
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.600]   Well, would they?
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.600]   Well, unless they do some really intelligent...
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.400]   Oh, well, they're sending it to the developers?
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:07.400]   Yeah, so...
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.000]   Are they doing it to the users?
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.840]   So, you could do it right now.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.680]   No, no, they wouldn't know for either, but it would go to the developers.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:21.400]   But let's say I'm using Instagram and I want to buy something on Instagram instead of going
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:23.600]   through Apple, which it does right now.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.600]   Actually, Instagram's a bad example.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:26.600]   They don't sell anything.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:27.800]   But there's an in-app purchase somewhere.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.720]   It would go to PayPal or it would go to...
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:31.720]   The New York Times.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:34.160]   The New York Times is good example.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.880]   That's actually who would like to do this, right?
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:38.960]   New York Times would like to send you this stripe and have you pay stripe.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:42.400]   I don't see how Apple would know unless they're monitoring all the traffic going in and out
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:43.400]   of your iPhone.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.400]   Are they?
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.400]   Are they?
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:46.400]   I don't think so.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:49.120]   I mean, they have the capability, I'm sure.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:54.760]   In Korea, this has been nicknamed the Google Power Abuse Prevention Law.
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:55.760]   Oh, boy.
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:56.760]   Wow.
[00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:01.480]   No idea of what they're going at.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:06.340]   The Google Play Store accounts for 75% of mobile app downloads globally in the second
[01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:07.340]   quarter.
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:12.840]   Apple, 65% of app store consumers, spending in an app's purchases.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:18.360]   It could be a lot of money, billions of dollars and a significant hit to Apple.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:24.280]   But more importantly from Apple's point of view, it could be the first domino because the
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:28.640]   US is considering something like this, the EU is considering something like this.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.520]   So is this righteous?
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.520]   Is it a monopoly or is it fair game?
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:39.320]   But hey, it's my phone marketplace and I check the apps to make sure they're okay and that's
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.320]   what I deserve.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.840]   Well, here's the interesting thing.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:47.200]   Even though the FTC and Congress are looking at doing this, President Biden is bound by
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:54.200]   a trade law to protest it because it is a South Korean law impacting American companies.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:01:01.280]   And actually, I would support him because I don't think that's how this should happen.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.440]   Not by fiat.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:09.200]   You don't think another country should pass a law or do you not think that the US should
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:14.360]   pass a law or how do you think that's interesting question because I think it should really
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:19.800]   come down to, well, that's a good question because if it's not the government, do we
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:24.160]   wear the DOJ is looking at the no, actually, and the FTC and Congress.
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:27.160]   Congress is considering a similar law actually.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:31.920]   I think it was club a char introduced a similar law.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:37.000]   So I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.280]   I just don't feel like it's right.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.600]   Are you going to hottwaffle right now?
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.600]   I'm hottwaffling.
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.960]   It's all the rage.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.480]   It's all the rage.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:49.680]   On the one hand, in some cases, Apple is rent seeking.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:56.440]   You know, you could say legitimately, let's say, flappy bird wouldn't exist if it weren't
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:01.240]   for the iPhone and the app store and the revenues they're generating really.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.880]   It's reasonable for Apple to say 30% because if honestly, if you put it in a box and sold
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.520]   it in a, remember, there used to be software stores for computers.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.040]   If you sold it, they would take more than half.
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.400]   So 30% and Apple does the download.
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.400]   They do the marketing.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.880]   It's very easy for a developer to do.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.560]   It doesn't seem unreasonable.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:21.880]   It's a little different for a company like Amazon, New York Times, Netflix, who already
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:26.120]   have completely separate from Apple existing businesses.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.400]   And Apple's saying, yeah, and if somebody buys anything from you on our platform, you
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.960]   give us 30% of it.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.040]   Your analogy is right.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.720]   You're now, no, I think your analogy to the store is good.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:39.600]   If you're a blockbuster and you sell the video, yeah, you can still sell the video otherwise.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.520]   But if you want to sell it to the customer who walks into my door, blockbuster or Apple,
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.520]   I get a cut.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.520]   It's my store.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.520]   I get a cut.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:47.520]   My store.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:51.680]   Less than the traditional cut.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:55.600]   It's what Microsoft and Sony charge on their game consoles.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.160]   I think this is ready, Aunt.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.160]   Get ready.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.560]   I think this is a symptom of moral panic.
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.680]   I don't know.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:04.680]   What about so?
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.840]   But there's a carriage agreement here.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:12.480]   So if you think about us getting mad at ISPs because they're charging companies like Netflix
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.320]   for peering or they're going to charge people like net neutrality.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.520]   So they're going to come in and say, you need to pay us to get your website delivered.
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.280]   You would argue against that because consumers don't really have much choice right there,
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.280]   right?
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.280]   Well, that's the debate.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.280]   Is it a monopoly?
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:33.520]   And that's, I guess, so is it a carriage disagreement or is it just like a shelf space
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.200]   payment disagreement?
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.440]   And I would argue it's more like a carriage disagreement, especially on Apple because Google
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.360]   lets you sideload.
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.360]   That's just my take.
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.360]   That's my non-waffle.
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:49.160]   Yeah, in fact, of all the companies, Google seems like least likely the one you should
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.600]   censure for this because you could do it with Google.
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:53.600]   Exactly.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.600]   I don't know.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:59.520]   You know, this seems like moral panic, especially when you look at the nickname.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.520]   Exactly.
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.520]   That's the thing.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.960]   It's retribution against how cool they're too powerful.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:04.960]   Be South Korea.
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.520]   We were pretty good at the internet and then we kind of fell behind.
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:08.520]   Yeah.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:12.600]   I don't think they follow behind.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.600]   Everybody has Google jealousy.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.840]   Everybody has Google jealousy.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.920]   German has Germany has Google jealousy.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.400]   South Korea has Google jealousy.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.240]   But they didn't build Google.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:30.320]   I have Google jealousy because I do not have a headphone jack on my gosh darn Apple phone.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:35.720]   And you deserve to be lampooned for that bad decision you made.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:41.840]   And Samsung has taken the headphone jack off of their Pixel or their Flip 3.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:47.720]   But Google does have a headphone jack on their 5a and they have released this commercial
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.600]   to celebrate it.
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.000]   You mean the one that's having over here?
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.520]   Let me fix the audio.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.000]   Hold on a second.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   Is it what it's having issues?
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.080]   I believe I read that the 5a was having issues when two video bars.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:06.280]   But I have a jack in my lovely 3a XL.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.280]   Google is good to me.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.200]   Yeah, but they didn't put one in the 4 right?
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.200]   Well, or the 5x.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.960]   I'm hoping there's one in the 4a.
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.960]   Well, I think it's me.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.600]   I hope the A's have headphone jacks.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.600]   I don't.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.800]   I hope this means they'll be one of the six.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.880]   Although the renders don't look like they have headphone jacks.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.720]   I chose this and I was very excited about the headphone jack.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.720]   I have used it literally twice.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.280]   And maybe that's because I'm not on an airplane anymore without my buds.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.680]   That's the name of the line being put on airplanes.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:38.280]   But you guys have Bluetooth headphones which I find subpar.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:42.160]   They cut out, the audio quality is not as good as wired.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.480]   Let me just play a little bit of the...
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.080]   Why don't you play this thing so we can...
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.080]   The circle.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.080]   Perfect.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.080]   Simple.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.800]   It's a fake Sir Johnnie eye.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.760]   Some might say simply perfect.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.640]   A complete set of points.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:58.640]   All equidistant from a single point on one side.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.640]   So nerdy.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:00.640]   No beginning.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.440]   No end.
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:06.040]   No end to the beginning.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.800]   So round.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:10.040]   So circular, if you will.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.040]   I love Google.
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.720]   Little known fact, the Latin word for circle is circus.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.280]   Circus isn't that delightful.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:22.560]   And that delight inspired us to reimagine the circle.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:25.000]   For the new Google PC5A.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   Precisely 3.5 millimeters in diameter.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   Full of shtobish.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   This is hilarious.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.520]   For the finest premium grade copper and iron.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:37.000]   Housed in a uniform of die cast and your minion.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.840]   Fancy pronunciation.
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.000]   Hahaha!
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.440]   And then we have the feedback to deliver the satisfying feeling of clip.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.080]   Fancy pronunciation.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.560]   A circle, yes.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.640]   But also a hole.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:57.800]   A tiny black hole with a gravitational pull of a trillion collapsed stars.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.320]   A breath.
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.280]   Capable of transporting us.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:07.840]   Fantastic alternative oral dimensions.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:14.360]   Designed to welcome both 1/8 inch 3-pole TRS and 4-pole TRS connections.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:21.160]   A glorious achievement that draws from our past as it propels us into the future.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.160]   Yes.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.160]   Hahaha!
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.160]   Well played.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:30.920]   With a Google Pixel 5A with 5G, the circle has finally come.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:31.920]   Full circle.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.760]   Ok, 2 minutes.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.960]   Extalling the virtues of a headphone jack.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.400]   God bless you, Google.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.400]   Well played.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.400]   And you know what?
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.400]   Google is awesome.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.160]   Facebook doesn't have a sense of humor.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.320]   Microsoft I don't think has a sense of humor.
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:49.880]   Amazon doesn't have a sense of humor.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:50.880]   That is...
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.880]   I agree.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.880]   100%.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:53.880]   It makes me love you.
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:54.880]   Give him that.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.880]   Give him that.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:01.480]   Even in the face of Korea and moral panic, they've got a sense of humor.
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.480]   Very funny.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.400]   I like the whispered.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.200]   It's a headphone jack.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.200]   Hahaha!
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.800]   Yes, I like the whisper throughout.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:10.800]   The whisper's...
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.800]   And the seepinunciations.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.520]   The whisper's are great.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:15.000]   I don't know if they're going to run that on TV.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   I doubt...
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   Well maybe they will.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   Well two minutes now.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.160]   Well no no, but you can just do a cut down.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.160]   You can do a cut down.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.160]   I wonder...
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.240]   No, I...
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.800]   It's good enough to run on TV.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.920]   I just wonder if anybody would get it.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.920]   Like if...
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.920]   No.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920]   We get it.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.920]   I almost...
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.840]   I almost tuned it out.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:34.840]   I almost tuned it out.
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.840]   So I know normal folks would probably...
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.800]   Yeah, there goes Google again being fancy.
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.000]   And who knows who's Johnny?
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.240]   I mean most people don't know who's...
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.240]   Yeah they don't know.
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:48.680]   They haven't sat through 8 million Apple product launch days.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:49.680]   Sorry.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.680]   Another one coming up.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.440]   I think in about a week and a half I don't know.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:54.440]   No invitations going on.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.120]   Have they not sent anything out yet?
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.120]   Not yet.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:00.960]   So our thinking is that...
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:04.400]   So they don't want to do it the day after Labor Day which is Monday.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.800]   So they would normally do it on Tuesday.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.000]   So that's rules out the 7th.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.920]   Maybe they do it on the 8th, the Wednesday or more likely they'll do it on the 14th of
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.800]   following Tuesday.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:17.720]   So we'll learn it on the 7th, what they're going to do it on the 14th.
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.280]   I think that's what they're going to do it.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:24.380]   Now there was, you might have seen a rumor that Google was going to do it right before
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:31.920]   Apple's announcement which would be I think full hardy, bold, but full hardy.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.000]   That rumor has been debunked.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.100]   Prosser has said no, they're not going to do it and he's usually pretty accurate.
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:46.460]   He said my sources say Google is going to announce the Pixel 6 October 28th.
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:50.300]   No, announce or make available for purchase.
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:51.300]   No.
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:52.300]   Actually that was...
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.300]   He says launching.
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:54.300]   So let me get this right.
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:58.020]   Launching means available in stores.
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:02.300]   Better not be like my, the aces I can't buy which is just every day I check.
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:03.300]   Every day.
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.300]   So the...
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:05.300]   Announce is the presser.
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:07.580]   Launches when people can get their hands on.
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.580]   Exactly.
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:13.580]   So the original rumor came from bald Panda on Wibo which is...
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.620]   That sounds like no pants tech cover.
[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:17.340]   Yeah, they've been wrong before.
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:21.020]   They said it was going to be September 13th which would be the day before an Apple, a
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:24.180]   putative Apple event.
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:28.860]   Social media freaked out Prosser writes outright laughing at Google, but he says he looked into
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:33.700]   it and reaching out to a few of my best sources.
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:40.380]   He says the event will be October 19th which is a Tuesday.
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:41.740]   Put a mark in that one, Ant.
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:43.460]   We got to get ready to do that.
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:49.940]   And the launch will be Thursday the 28th, nine days later.
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:54.020]   That's when the market launch, it'll be in stores and it could be in your hands if you
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:55.740]   order it right away.
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:11:00.100]   So the made by Google event is the 19th.
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:02.780]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.300]   That's pre-orders.
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:07.980]   So the event could be the 19th or it could be earlier because you know you might announce
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:10.060]   it and say for ordering on the 19th.
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:12.740]   I want the phone in my hot little hands.
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:13.740]   Yeah.
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:14.740]   That's all I want.
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:15.740]   We all want the Pixel 6.
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:17.740]   Although I am again, I'm asserting...
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:18.740]   I thought that was interesting.
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.020]   Craig really liked the fold.
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:22.780]   I really liked the littler folding phone.
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:26.020]   I was in Best Buy and I got to say it's impressive.
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:27.020]   It's very impressive.
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:28.380]   It's a great screen.
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:33.020]   A little works for me as opposed to big.
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:36.540]   You know, I don't want a phone that's kind of a thick, fat, heavy phone that turns into
[01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:37.900]   a small tablet.
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:42.660]   I would rather have just this little pocket square sized thing that could fit right into
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:45.180]   your jacket pocket and then opens up to a normal phone.
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:47.780]   It's just like a pocket of stone shut.
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:48.940]   How did you know?
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:49.940]   You could tell?
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:50.940]   It looks good.
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:51.940]   It is.
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:56.740]   Because if you stick your phone in your jacket pocket, it's gonna go down.
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:58.540]   Yeah, your lines don't think it'll mess up.
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:11:59.540]   A restaurant jacket.
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:01.260]   Yeah, it looks like a pocket.
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:02.740]   Why was it gonna ask that?
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:05.700]   Which pocket would you keep that one in as opposed to...
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:09.740]   Well, the side pocket, you could put it in a breast pocket on a shirt.
[01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:10.740]   I don't know.
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:11.740]   I don't know.
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:12.740]   It's like a...
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:13.740]   It's more like your...
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:14.740]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:15.740]   Wait, let me see the clothes pinning.
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:16.740]   Packing ziggies.
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:20.140]   Okay, so here's an interesting thing.
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:23.020]   The clothes pinning is annoying, but I bought...
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:28.860]   Actually, I got it for free because I got credit from Samsung.
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:31.180]   I think they give you when you pre-order $150.
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.780]   $200 to buy something.
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:35.500]   So this is a $50 leather case.
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.100]   So without the case, there is clothes pinning.
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.380]   Do you have over the shoulder, John?
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:41.660]   There is clothes pinning.
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:42.660]   It's annoying.
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:43.660]   Okay, yeah.
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:44.660]   Oh, my God.
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:45.660]   I like that.
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:46.660]   Okay, but with...
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:47.660]   I don't know.
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:48.660]   But as soon as you swipe...
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:49.660]   I'm not against it.
[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:50.660]   But you're gonna want this case anyway, because it makes it a little grippy.
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:51.660]   Yeah.
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:52.660]   And it actually makes it a little classier.
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:53.660]   You can get it in colors.
[01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:55.660]   I think it kind of looks a little bit better.
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:56.660]   It's thicker.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:57.660]   Yeah, it's a little, but not...
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:59.740]   Yes, you know, it's really nice and thin.
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:03.580]   And then there's no clothes pinning because the case kind of makes up for it.
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:05.380]   And doesn't that look kind of nice?
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:06.380]   I love your little screen.
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:07.380]   It's just looking nice.
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:08.380]   I think it's really nice.
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:13.220]   All right, I'm gonna wait and see what the Pixel 6 looks like, but that could be my
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:14.220]   next phone.
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:16.340]   The software and Pixel is better, right?
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:20.940]   The problem with Samsung is they have to put their apps in addition to the Google Apps.
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:26.380]   Well, what's your experience with this one, considering you have had the Pixel line for
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:27.380]   several iterations?
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:28.380]   It's good.
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.380]   I think the camera's good.
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:33.980]   There were some knocks on the Flip 3's camera that said, "Oh, it's not as good as the
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:34.980]   S21.
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:35.980]   It's more like the S20."
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:36.980]   Well, you know what?
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:39.260]   The S20 is actually pretty good camera.
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:42.180]   This is portrait mode of Lisa.
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:47.140]   And I think Lisa will do anything for the company.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:53.580]   That color red is hard to render in digital, so I asked her to dye her tongue red.
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.220]   So I could test it.
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:58.740]   No, slushies, but very good.
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:04.620]   Here's a picture of we went out to dinner with Odocta and his daughter.
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:07.620]   And this is just the selfie camera.
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:08.980]   I think it's fine.
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:10.660]   Not only fine, I think it's a great camera.
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:12.660]   Oh, there's Odocta.
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:13.900]   Mugging for the camera.
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:15.820]   I think it's a really good camera.
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:20.620]   My only beef is the white balance is a little off with it in all of those shots that you've
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:21.620]   shared.
[01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:25.020]   And that's probably something in software that they could fix pretty quickly.
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:26.020]   How do you know it?
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.020]   Fix it after the fact.
[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:30.980]   Dr. Ant, Dr. Describe the symptoms of white balance being off.
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:32.060]   So how do you know that?
[01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:36.420]   If you go back, look at that one there.
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:38.020]   Notice everything is a bit blue.
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.020]   This is a little blue.
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:40.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:47.020]   And then when you look at this shot of them having dinner, what's normally sort of warm
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.940]   is it's got a green hue to it.
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:50.220]   Like look at Miss Lisa's face.
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.700]   Her face has a little green.
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:53.660]   Well, I think she's that way anyway.
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:54.660]   Let me get auto.
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:55.660]   She's jumping.
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:15:01.460]   See if I use the auto function that's just built in the Google Photos, it actually gets
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:02.460]   better.
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:03.460]   This is the original.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:07.500]   And of course, you can, you know, white balance it after the fact.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:12.380]   I just want to, I want to, I saw this, the image on glass.photo.
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:14.660]   Yeah, this is, this I put shared it there.
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:15.660]   On that glass.
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:20.540]   It doesn't really compress it or make the images look bad the way the other apps do.
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:21.540]   Yeah.
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.340]   And when I saw it, they're like, oh, she looks blue.
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:24.740]   I should have white balanced this.
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:25.740]   We're right.
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:27.900]   I should have white balanced.
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:29.460]   See, I'm, I'm.
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:33.420]   Man, what I'm taking away from this is I'm just never going to show in any of my photos.
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.580]   No, he's got a good eye.
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:36.580]   Actually, it's good.
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:37.580]   No, I see that.
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:40.660]   I'm like, yeah, he's never going to see any of this.
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:45.900]   Well, speaking of your office, I'm curious to get ants view of the AI photo upscaling
[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:47.700]   stuff that Google's done.
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:51.860]   And they do it in a Photoshop and I'm all for it because that's been around for a little
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:53.900]   while now and it's getting better.
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:55.140]   Oh, so it's getting new here?
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:56.140]   Getting better.
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:57.140]   Okay.
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:58.140]   It's getting better.
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:02.020]   Photoshop in Lightroom does it as well.
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:08.060]   And it also depends on your image because I've tried it with some of some older rebel,
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:12.700]   Canon rebel photos that I had and scales it up and it doesn't make it look any better.
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:17.580]   It makes it too jagged on edges thinking that it needs to be sharper, but it just gives
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:20.500]   it really, really jagged edges and it's not, not just not.
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:24.180]   So you're talking about the Adobe technology, yes?
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:28.020]   Adobe has their sensei of doing a super enhance.
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:29.020]   Yeah.
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:30.780]   The same way that Google is using this.
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:31.780]   Oh, okay.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:32.860]   I thought you were talking about Adobe.
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:37.100]   So this is the Google, the new Google thing AI photo.
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:44.620]   Now if this is the actual original and this is the result, that's kind of mind boggling,
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:45.620]   but I don't know.
[01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:46.620]   That's why I'm asking.
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:48.100]   Yeah, but okay.
[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:53.980]   So that image on the left, that's a lower resolution image, but it scaled up.
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:55.540]   So it's going to look pixelated.
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:58.980]   If it was just shown on your screen, it would look better, phone screen.
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:03.300]   Yeah, notice how bad it is.
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.660]   I think that's reasonable.
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:08.580]   Now what it can't do is make up infur, so this is not like, you know, in CSI, how they
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.460]   would always be like computer enhanced.
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:11.460]   Enhanced.
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.860]   Enhanced that license plate.
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:17.500]   And you're like, so it's not going to be able to fill in numbers or things that it can't
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:18.500]   see.
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:21.700]   What it's doing is it's saying, oh, well, this is how nose is normally.
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:22.700]   We know what it knows.
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:23.700]   Looks like, yeah.
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:24.860]   No, actually it's more interesting then.
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:27.980]   This is from the Google blog post, this SR3 technology.
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:33.460]   The model is trained on an image corruption process in which noise is progressed.
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:39.380]   So they start with a high quality image and they add noise progressively until it's only
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:41.900]   white noise, a pure, you know, pure noise.
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:43.940]   It was artificial dumbness.
[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:49.700]   It says this is what happens when we go in this direction and it learns then to take in
[01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.340]   the other direction.
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:53.540]   So it isn't saying that's what a nose looks like.
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:59.860]   It's actually saying based on the degradations we've seen over and over again, it's an interesting
[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:00.860]   way to train.
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:05.180]   And I have to say these examples Google's giving are really amazing.
[01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.620]   It's getting better.
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:07.620]   It wasn't.
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:10.580]   Do they have them on anything that's not basis?
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.420]   Yeah, they have.
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:14.060]   Yeah, pizza.
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:15.060]   Pizza.
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:21.100]   When I train, when I'm having for dinner, samples, I tried it with some landscape images
[01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:25.340]   and with landscape images, you get a lot of trees and whatnot.
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:28.020]   So there's detail with those leaves.
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:32.300]   And if you overdo it, it would almost look like more rain and then just like little
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:33.300]   razors.
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:37.540]   So you have to be careful with over sharpening.
[01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:42.300]   Also with including the SR3 model and the cascading pipeline, they write, we also introduce
[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:48.460]   a new data augmentation technique, which we call conditioning augmentation that further
[01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:54.140]   improves the sample quality results of CDM while the super resolution models in CDM
[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:56.820]   are trained in original images from the data set.
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:02.140]   During generation, they need to perform super resolution on the images generated by a low
[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:06.220]   resolution base model, which may not be of sufficiently high quality in comparison to
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:07.540]   the original images.
[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:13.060]   This leads to a train test mismatch for the super resolution models.
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:16.300]   Conditioning augmentation refers to applying data augmentation.
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:20.180]   You might be right, it might actually know about noses, to applying data augmentation
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:25.540]   to the low resolution image input image of each super resolution model on the cascading
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:26.780]   pipeline.
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:32.380]   These augmentations, which in our case include Gaussian noise and Gaussian blur, prevents
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:39.060]   each super resolution model from overfitting to its lower resolution conditioning output.
[01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:41.820]   So they're actually doing some wild stuff at this.
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:48.060]   And the post that shows how it's upsizing a train, a pizza, a burger, a dog, various
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:49.060]   others.
[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:53.020]   Here you go, you can show this John because we can actually watch it happen.
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:56.940]   It'll cycle through various models here.
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:58.060]   Yeah this is remarkable.
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:04.300]   This is very much center, enhance, zoom, enhance, center.
[01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.060]   This is straight out of Blade Runner.
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:12.300]   And my experience with this stuff is working best for images that you shoot with a high
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:13.300]   ISO.
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:17.940]   Meaning you shoot somewhere in this really low light, but yet you still want to get some
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:22.180]   details without a bunch of grain and noise.
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:27.140]   I've seen better effects with that because I've shot some sports here with the hard
[01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:28.140]   heads and what not.
[01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:31.740]   And it's just those field lights so it's dark out there.
[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:38.620]   And I tell it to enhance it and it does make it look way better than what you're doing.
[01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:42.100]   Are you able to use this technology or using Adobe or somebody else?
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:44.780]   I'm using Adobe's as pretty much the same.
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:46.940]   They're both sharing notes.
[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:47.940]   This isn't new.
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:54.060]   This has been at least since like 2017, 2018, somewhere in that area.
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:56.980]   It could be the models that Google is using.
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:00.740]   They're saying that they've got new models that are doing better.
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:01.740]   I don't know.
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.300]   And do I just do it a different way?
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:05.300]   Because they're pointing different ways.
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:07.180]   They're finding new methods to get there.
[01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:13.220]   So yeah, because I'm not sure which method Adobe uses.
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:21.580]   But they actually address this comparing their results with which is green to other
[01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:25.300]   techniques, including regression pulse FSR.
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:29.180]   I can't remember exactly which one of these two.
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:31.900]   I wonder where I stand on the confusion rate scale.
[01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:36.940]   You are way over to the right there.
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.580]   I would, you know what?
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:43.300]   We really can't judge us until they say here, you know, try this in Google Photos.
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:44.300]   Let's see.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:45.300]   The Ant Test.
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.060]   The Ant Test.
[01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:48.500]   I would submit it.
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:57.660]   It probably isn't the same as what Adobe is doing because I think this is this looks
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:59.540]   like Google do a blog post.
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:00.540]   Yeah, right.
[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.180]   Because why would they do it?
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:06.300]   Here are three different four different ways of doing it or three different.
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.580]   Bi-cubic regression.
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:17.300]   SR3, which is their machine intelligence technology and then the actual originals.
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:20.620]   And it's true that Google is doing a remarkably better job of coding.
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:21.620]   Who's doing it?
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:24.620]   He looks like a British poet or something.
[01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:28.460]   An unhappy British.
[01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:32.620]   Isn't that all the, I mean, that's all British poets.
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:33.620]   Yeah.
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:36.780]   Anyway, you know, I'd love to know more.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:41.580]   I'd like, you know, they don't, it doesn't seem like they're offering it, you know.
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:42.580]   Not a lot of it.
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:43.580]   This is from GitHub.
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:44.580]   Maybe there's source.
[01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:45.580]   I don't know.
[01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:46.580]   Maybe there's source code.
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:47.580]   It's interesting.
[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:51.580]   Google is publishing this research on GitHub, but Microsoft site.
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:54.460]   I have an example.
[01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:57.420]   I don't know if it'll translate though.
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.700]   So this is in Adobe's, no, go, yeah, go to his screen.
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.620]   This is in Adobe's Photoshop or a Lightroom.
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:03.620]   This is Lightroom.
[01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:09.340]   This is Lightroom using that enhance and this is the enhanced version of it.
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:10.700]   Yeah, I think that's trans-like.
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:13.940]   I think they're using other techniques like Bi-cubic.
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:17.820]   I don't think they're using Google's GANS-T, or AI stuff, ML stuff.
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:20.020]   Yeah, see, the original is definitely softer.
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:21.020]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:24.580]   It's Lightrooms and the enhance as well.
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:27.060]   That's almost like an unsharp mask and stuff.
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:28.060]   I don't--
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:31.900]   Should even up to the resolution if you look here.
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:34.060]   They're improving resolution as well, huh?
[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:35.380]   Oh, yeah, I see.
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:36.380]   Yeah.
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:37.380]   Oh, look at that.
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:38.380]   Big difference.
[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:39.380]   Huh.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:42.100]   Well, I have to say then, that looks pretty good.
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:46.020]   Given how much they're quadrupling the resolution, right?
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:47.020]   Right.
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:48.020]   Okay.
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:49.020]   It hurts to look at.
[01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:50.020]   It's too sharp.
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:51.020]   I don't know why.
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:54.300]   I'm just like, oh, too much.
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:55.300]   That one's really sharp.
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:24:00.020]   But again, this is a shot that's from really bad lighting conditions.
[01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:07.100]   So I tried to get as much detail as I possibly could because it's outside in the dark with
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:11.940]   these big football field lights that are not great for photography.
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:15.340]   But yeah, that's that.
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:19.540]   You're watching this week in Google, the Craig Newmark enhanced episode.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:26.340]   I threw it from hands-on photography, Jeff Jarvis, from the Craig Newmark Graduate School
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:29.060]   of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:31.900]   Stacey Higginbotham from StaceyOnIOT.com.
[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:37.940]   What did you talk about on the IoT show this week?
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:41.460]   Australia's due data law, a bunch of funding for companies, and--
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:44.420]   Lord, I don't even remember.
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:46.940]   Oh, the people who buy--
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:47.940]   I know.
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:48.940]   That was this morning.
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:51.540]   I had a guest who's really cool.
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:53.180]   He was from Invitation Homes.
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:57.260]   They have 80,000 homes for rent, single-family homes for rent.
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:59.340]   We talked about what they're looking for in smart homes.
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:00.980]   So it's really cool.
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:01.980]   That's interesting.
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:06.220]   All right, well, let's talk about Australia's law.
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:13.660]   The only story I've seen, which is a little weird, comes from an encrypted email service
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:15.260]   in Germany called Tutanota.
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:17.420]   This is from their blog.
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:20.100]   There's a Guardian story from last week.
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:22.100]   From last week.
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:24.900]   Yeah, because, yeah, we read the Tutanota.
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:25.900]   Tutanota.
[01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:26.900]   Tutanota.
[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:27.900]   Tutanota.
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:28.900]   Tutanota.
[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:29.900]   Tutanota.
[01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:35.900]   But if you-- let's see, let's go to the Guardian and get the-- let me get the--
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:43.700]   Unprecedented surveillance bill rushed through Parliament 24 hours.
[01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:49.420]   It's called the Surveillance Legislation Amendment Identifying Disrupt Bill 2020 gives
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:53.660]   the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission three new
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:57.060]   powers for dealing with online crime.
[01:25:57.060 --> 01:26:00.100]   Wail you hear this.
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:04.740]   And by the way, they'll have-- it says warrant, but it's not a judicial warrant.
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:09.820]   It can be issued by a member of the administrative appeals tribunal, which is apparently not
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:10.820]   a court.
[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:11.980]   It's an unjudges warrant.
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:16.900]   So when you hear the word warrant, it's a little bit lower standard than a court warrant.
[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:22.740]   Number one, data disruption warrant gives the police the ability to, quote, disrupt data
[01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:28.260]   by online data, by modifying, copying, adding, or deleting it.
[01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:29.260]   Add is bad.
[01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:31.100]   That is neutrality, folks.
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:34.380]   Well, for instance, they don't like the old report.
[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:39.340]   They can modify my tweet to say, the Australian government should be brought down.
[01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:41.780]   Well, OK, that's not true.
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:42.780]   No, it is.
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:43.980]   You're doing something illegal.
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:44.980]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:47.140]   Well, if you're doing something-- where is your note?
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:50.580]   I was going to add the story to the thing, but I don't see what the line is.
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:51.580]   I don't know.
[01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:52.580]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:53.580]   I'm not taking it from there.
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:54.580]   OK, it's not a government.
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:56.940]   You mentioned it, so I looked it up.
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:58.980]   Network activity warrant.
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:00.580]   Here's-- this is-- there's three new powers.
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:05.380]   "Alasapleas to collect intelligence from devices or networks that are used or likely
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:08.980]   to be used by those subject to the warrant."
[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:13.260]   Leo might be using Twitter later, so let's just get it all.
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:18.300]   "Account takeover warrant allows the police to take control of an online account, such
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:23.860]   as my Instagram, for the purposes of gathering information for an investigation."
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:25.780]   Yeah, this worries me.
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:28.740]   So it's talking-- I mean, is that your smart camera?
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:34.260]   Because that's-- so we talked about that, and we talked about the lack of judicial oversight
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:36.140]   on this.
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:40.220]   And guess what they're using as a justification?
[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:41.220]   Just guess.
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:42.220]   Child porn.
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:43.220]   Yes.
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:44.220]   Yes.
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:45.220]   C. Sam.
[01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:46.220]   Yes.
[01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:49.060]   I will say the media-- they did carve out a protection for the media, so--
[01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:50.060]   Oh, that's good.
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:52.220]   They won't take over your account, necessarily.
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:53.220]   The Murdochs.
[01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:54.220]   The Murdochs in charge.
[01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:55.220]   Yeah.
[01:27:55.220 --> 01:28:00.300]   These, my friends, these are the fruits of the already have moral panic.
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:01.300]   Yeah.
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:02.300]   Wow.
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:03.300]   This is where you go.
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:04.300]   This and the horrible Canadian legislation.
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:09.740]   These are otherwise smart countries who are doing awful and dumb and destructive things
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:10.740]   to free speech.
[01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:11.740]   China doesn't surprise you.
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:17.940]   Would you not argue instead of moral panic, it's just lobbying by self-interested corporations
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:19.660]   and parties?
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:23.500]   It's made possible-- good points, Stacy-- but it's made possible because the atmosphere
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:26.540]   of moral panic justifies this.
[01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:32.700]   It's, as somebody said on Hacker News, years of Rupert Murdoch propaganda.
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:33.700]   Exactly.
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:34.700]   Yeah.
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:36.500]   Again, speak, tech.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:42.140]   I hope we'll deal next with Canada because it's bad all around.
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:47.220]   So as I said, though, I only found this two to notice story and the Guardian story is
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:49.180]   older, so I'm not sure--
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:50.180]   It's a week ago.
[01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:51.180]   It's not that bad.
[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:52.180]   It's apparently.
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:53.180]   So--
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:57.100]   I think they passed-- so they passed it on Wednesday of last week.
[01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:58.100]   Oh, OK.
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:59.100]   So the-- all right.
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:02.900]   So we record our show on Wednesday morning, so same thing.
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:03.900]   So--
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:08.100]   When presented with the warrant from the administrative appeals tribunal, Australian companies,
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:13.460]   sysadmins, et cetera, must comply and actively help the police to modify, add, copy, or delete
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:18.300]   the data of a person under investigation, refusing to comply could have one end up in
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:21.220]   jail for up to 10 years ago to the bill.
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:25.420]   Required hacking activities could include altering, copying, and deleting data, intercepting
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:29.820]   and modifying communications, surveilling networks, and changing account credentials.
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:32.300]   If you trust the police, you got nothing to fear.
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:36.460]   And they've tried to force backdoors in all encryption in Australia.
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:37.460]   Yeah.
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:41.180]   And meanwhile, Germany is telling you, if you take down content because it doesn't meet
[01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:46.020]   your community standards, but it's also illegal, you have to dime the user and decide whether
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:51.220]   it's illegal and you dime them, which can do a lot of for trust.
[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:57.660]   And Canada is demanding the platform's report to law enforcement.
[01:29:57.660 --> 01:30:02.580]   I'm a Joe Biden Democrat, but I'm going to sound real libertarian right now.
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:05.700]   This is the problem with government interference speech.
[01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:13.580]   Well, in fact, they took a note of, quote, "Angus Murray's chair of the electronic frontier
[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:20.300]   Australia's policy team saying, 'This is now a regime in Australia where we have conferred
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:25.940]   power on law enforcement agencies to hack Australians and potentially overseas persons,
[01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:30.740]   computers, and to take over accounts and modify and delete data on those accounts.
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:34.780]   Australia doesn't have constitutional and shrine rights to political speech.
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:37.300]   They don't have a First Amendment and other human rights.
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:41.100]   But if we're going to give law enforcement these powers, that should be checked and balanced
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.420]   against a human rights instrument at a federal level.
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:45.580]   There needs to be some-- And transparency.
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:50.020]   I'm going to bet they can do it and you won't know they've done it.
[01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:51.020]   Yeah.
[01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:55.780]   So here's another copy of the story from Information Age.
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:58.540]   So this is an Australian Information Age.
[01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:02.100]   Oh, and this was passed on August 25th in case you're wondering.
[01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:03.100]   Yes, that's right.
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:04.100]   Yeah.
[01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:05.100]   So it was a week ago.
[01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:06.140]   Can we go to the Canada one too?
[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:14.980]   This is by Daphne Keller, who is a brilliant academic at Stanford.
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:20.980]   Working for the Cyber Policy Center, which by the way Craig funded, it's Craig Day.
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:27.780]   And she goes through the problems with Canada's proposed regulatory framework on harmful content.
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:33.460]   She says something terrible is happening in Canadian internet law and the people who
[01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:37.940]   care in the rest of the world are mostly stretched too thin to pay attention.
[01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:41.300]   Her post is on the rundown.
[01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:47.500]   Michael Geist, who I know well, is a Canadian professor of law who's very active in this.
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:51.260]   He said this is she says this is a thread listing some of the laws problems identified
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:58.700]   by Michael Geist and flagging a few resources showing where the laws major human rights
[01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:03.380]   problems exist.
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:07.980]   So it requires a 24 hour takedown provision, which we know from Germany means that too
[01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:10.780]   much gets taken down because you don't have any time to do anything wisely.
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:12.980]   You have no time for due process.
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:16.060]   You have no time for notification, though oddly, of course, Germany is now demanding
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:18.820]   that you notify within that period as well.
[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.300]   But we'll get to that later.
[01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:24.340]   Proactive monitoring filtering, which means that there is not just reported to you, they've
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:28.740]   got to go and find this stuff or their ass is brass platform reporting to law enforcement,
[01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:31.740]   which I mentioned before, which is what Germany is demanding to.
[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:36.420]   They're all want the platforms to dime their users sweeping regulatory powers.
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:43.980]   Well, that comes along for the cost of the party here and then ISP blocking.
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:45.940]   This is Canada.
[01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:48.020]   This is saying nice Canada.
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:50.220]   This is Matthew Ingram's Canada.
[01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:52.620]   You know, it's nice people.
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:53.900]   This is what moral panic.
[01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:58.380]   This is what the fear enables your rights, Stacy, that that's not the beginning.
[01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:03.340]   But if you've created this atmosphere through media's coverage against the Internet, oh,
[01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:04.420]   my God, it's all awful.
[01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:05.420]   It's accessible.
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:06.420]   It's terrible.
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:07.420]   Everything awful is happening in there.
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:08.420]   It's ruined society.
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:10.500]   Then it's easy to pass these laws.
[01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:13.540]   We should point out at this point, it is not a law in Canada.
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:17.580]   The government says it's taking comments until September 25th.
[01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:21.340]   But Michael Geis points out, giving the framing of the documents is clear that this is little
[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:26.820]   more than a notification of the regulatory plans, not a genuine effort to craft solutions
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:29.420]   based on public feedback.
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:31.420]   So really, it's not even a law.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:32.420]   It's a regulation.
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:33.420]   Yeah.
[01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:36.020]   And then you have the online harms.
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:37.020]   Yeah.
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:39.460]   I mean, it's just spraying all around the world.
[01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:42.700]   We're going to end up with many Chinese interns.
[01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:43.700]   Yeah.
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:45.700]   So that's my fear.
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:47.700]   All right.
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:50.380]   Well, it's happening everywhere.
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:51.380]   It's depressing.
[01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:55.380]   And if you say, well, it's Canada or it's Australia, my email provider is Australian.
[01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:57.380]   They would be subject to this.
[01:33:57.380 --> 01:33:59.140]   So I am subject to this as a result.
[01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:00.580]   Who is your email provider?
[01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:01.580]   Fastmail.
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:02.580]   Oh.
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:03.580]   Which I recommend.
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:05.780]   It's wonderful.
[01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:09.580]   And one of the reasons Toota Nota is writing about this, and I have a Toota Nota account
[01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:10.580]   as well.
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:11.580]   They're like proton mail.
[01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:16.180]   They're one of a number of end-to-end encrypted email providers.
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:22.980]   In my opinion, those are contradictory concepts because email can't be end-to-end encrypted
[01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:25.620]   by a provider.
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:28.740]   If you want to end-to-end encrypted, you have to encrypt it yourself.
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:29.740]   PGP?
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:32.180]   Using something like PGP, which is very hard.
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:34.580]   Or we're going to close system like MCI mail.
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:35.580]   Yeah.
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:41.740]   Well, if you're sending from proton mail to proton mail or from Toota Nota to Toota Nota,
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:42.740]   it's end-to-end encrypted.
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:47.860]   But as soon as you send it to a third party, let's say I send from Toota Nota to Gmail,
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:52.180]   all I can really send you is a link that says, I've encrypted this.
[01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:55.620]   You have to go to this link and to read it.
[01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:58.540]   And even then, there's no key exchange.
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:00.740]   So it's not as...
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:01.740]   I think it's...
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:05.820]   My position on this is a mistake to assume email can ever be end-to-end encrypted unless
[01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:07.180]   you're doing it yourself.
[01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:13.620]   If you really want private messaging, go to Signal or some other system, not an email
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:14.620]   system.
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:16.460]   But a lot of people use proton mail and Toota Nota.
[01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:18.260]   And as I said, I have accounts on both.
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:19.260]   But...
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:20.820]   Yeah, I thought you had mentioned proton.
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:21.820]   Yeah.
[01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:23.820]   It took to know this is the same as proton.
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:26.180]   Yeah, proton swiss, Toota Nota's German.
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:28.700]   Both countries have so far...
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:31.780]   Well, Europe has so...
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:35.020]   What Australia is doing here would not be illegal under GDPR.
[01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:39.860]   It violates some of the precepts about owning your data and being in control of it.
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:43.260]   So it's really interesting, I think.
[01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:47.540]   Amazon is building a live audio business.
[01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:48.540]   More competition.
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:49.540]   Or maybe they can buy you.
[01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:50.540]   Darn it.
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:51.540]   Oh, yes.
[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:52.540]   I love Amazon.
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:59.740]   What would you like to work for Amazon, Leo?
[01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:06.340]   Amazon's efforts, which are led by Amazon's music division, include paying podcast networks,
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:09.260]   musicians and celebrities to use feature use...
[01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:10.260]   And your celebrity?
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:15.700]   Their clubhouse-like feature for live conversations shows and events.
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:18.060]   They own Twitch.
[01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:19.740]   Yeah, they own Twitch.
[01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:23.340]   But they're doing it through Amazon Music, which is interesting.
[01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:26.500]   Here's my opinion on all this, because Spotify is even bigger.
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:28.620]   But I think it's...
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:34.100]   So it was funny, we were talking about music exclusives, which was all the rage for a
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:35.100]   while.
[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:39.060]   Apple had all these Taylor Swift album released on Apple first.
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:41.220]   And what the record labels in the artist realized...
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:42.620]   Hidal was the other one.
[01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:43.620]   You titled it...
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:46.260]   They realized it's a terrible business model.
[01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:50.340]   If you're releasing an album, it is far better for you to release it everywhere than to release
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:54.260]   it on an exclusive platform, at least even for a short period of time.
[01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:55.260]   It cuts into sales.
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:56.260]   Yep.
[01:36:56.260 --> 01:37:00.740]   And it's always been my opinion that if we are a podcast that wants to reach as many people
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:06.340]   as possible, it'd be nuts for us to say, "Oh, yeah, we'll give an exclusive to Amazon
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:08.140]   or Spotify or anybody else."
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:10.340]   However, if Amazon wants to give me a lot of money...
[01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:11.340]   All of that.
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:12.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:37:12.340 --> 01:37:13.340]   I could say...
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:15.340]   I could say you want to retire from Amazon.
[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:21.180]   Look, at Amazon's not a big spinner.
[01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:23.820]   They bought Wondery for a mere $300 million.
[01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:25.740]   We'd cost at least twice that.
[01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:28.620]   But I'm willing to deal.
[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:31.420]   That's hysterical.
[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:37.100]   Clubhouse said Sunday users create over 700,000 live audio rooms every day.
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:38.180]   Who cares?
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:39.500]   I have not touched it.
[01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:40.500]   Who cares?
[01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.300]   I was just talking to somebody today.
[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:43.300]   You remember Clubhouse?
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:44.300]   Who cares?
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:45.300]   You think over the world?
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:46.300]   Yeah.
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:51.340]   I've joined in on maybe two, but I get a gazillion notifications for it.
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:55.420]   Because for as long as I didn't even know they had an Android version of the app.
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:56.980]   They didn't for a long time.
[01:37:56.980 --> 01:38:00.380]   So their success is what's really stimulating all this activity.
[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:04.180]   Everybody say, "Oh, there's this lag between...
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:05.180]   Pivot to live.
[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:06.180]   Pivot to something.
[01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:07.180]   Yeah.
[01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:10.900]   So now everybody's doing like a Spotify bought a company called Betty Labs, which has an
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:16.140]   app called Locker Room, which is kind of like Clubhouse for live audio.
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.140]   And they launched with that...
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:18.140]   That was a terrible name.
[01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:19.140]   Locker Room.
[01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:20.140]   I know.
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:22.220]   Let's all go into the locker room.
[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:25.740]   That's why they renamed it Green Room.
[01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:27.580]   Now how do you feel?
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:28.580]   Better.
[01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:29.580]   Yeah.
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:34.460]   Twitter rolled out ticketed live audio events for its spaces feature this week.
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:41.420]   Facebook launched earlier this year a live audio app called Live Audio Rooms, which is
[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:44.140]   an even worse name.
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:46.300]   You can larp and lar.
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:47.500]   Discord has the stage channel.
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:49.700]   We've been using Discord for live audio.
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:53.900]   And now by the way, I should mention if you're a member of Club Twitch, we are also doing
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:56.900]   video.
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:59.740]   Can you turn on the video now?
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:04.540]   Because I guess we didn't have it with Craig was to occupying that machine.
[01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:05.540]   Yeah.
[01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:15.980]   But going forward, unless we have four hosts, we've always had the stage, which is live
[01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:16.980]   audio.
[01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:20.020]   We still have a stage up right now.
[01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:23.100]   There's only like eight people in there, including me and you.
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:27.540]   And so really, there's only five people in there.
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:29.260]   Somebody just ran out.
[01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:34.020]   But the thing about videos, we're limited to 25.
[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:37.580]   But as I point out, maybe we don't need more than 25.
[01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:44.100]   And what's nice is you can be in the live video and watching the video.
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:48.860]   And then if you go, at least on my machine, if you go into this chat room, it'll keep
[01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:51.100]   a picture and picture of the video going.
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:56.940]   So I think that's going to become a very nice way for people to watch and chat at the
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:57.940]   same time.
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:40:00.540]   But Discord has a limit on the size.
[01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:03.060]   So we're going to watch them watching us?
[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:05.180]   We don't have to watch them, but we could.
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:10.100]   And actually, you know, I was actually inspired a little bit by what our friend Alex Lindsey,
[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:15.660]   who is one of the hosts on MacBreak Weekly does with something called office hours.
[01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:17.100]   They stream all the time.
[01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:22.580]   I think this is the, this is a new medium I'm very excited about where you have a live
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:26.340]   presentation going on, but you have multiple other video streams.
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:28.340]   And people can ask questions or qubits.
[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:32.540]   He does cooking shows where somebody's a teacher and then there are other people cooking.
[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:35.780]   You see them in their kitchen doing the same thing and they're going, am I chopping this
[01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:36.780]   right?
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:42.020]   And I think I did this a couple of weeks ago with Philip Elmer-Dawitti at a bunch of Apple
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:45.660]   investors, subscribers, his website, PED 30.
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:51.860]   And they were asking questions was like, it's a really, I think it's an interesting format.
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:56.300]   So I think it's a really, it's a really, it's a really, it's a really interesting format.
[01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:59.180]   So I do think there's, there's something there.
[01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:02.580]   It's a kind of, and I think it's happened because we were all about used to the idea
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:04.660]   of Zoom meetings.
[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:08.580]   And it's just a broadcast Zoom meeting in effect.
[01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:13.900]   What I like with him versus say the Twitter spaces is that what it, is that what it's
[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:19.300]   called on Twitter spaces with, with office hours, because I've dropped in on it several
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:21.700]   times here at Nut recently.
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:26.900]   He has a bit of a voting system forest, what the audience interaction is.
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:28.060]   People ask questions.
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:29.060]   Yeah.
[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:34.620]   You know, people ask questions and it gets voted up because we don't want it to be just,
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:36.700]   hey, well, what mic are you using?
[01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:41.700]   You know, yeah, you know, he's very, Alex is kind of a fascist.
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:44.220]   So he's very, he likes to really control it.
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:45.220]   It's not a democracy there?
[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:46.220]   No.
[01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:47.220]   Oh, no.
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:50.500]   No, no, no, he runs a type ship and I, and I dig it.
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:51.500]   I dig it too.
[01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:52.500]   Yeah.
[01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:54.760]   I'm a little bit more than T.C.C. despite what Jeff says.
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:55.960]   No, you're not.
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:58.320]   You, you, you, you, you, you.
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:03.480]   When I go into Twitter spaces because I get a gazillion notifications about some space.
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:04.480]   It's too crazy.
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:05.480]   I should join.
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:13.980]   It's always people talking over each other and mutes or dogs and cats yelling in the background.
[01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:15.580]   It's just not a good experience.
[01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:19.100]   But what he's done is pretty much just done a little trial and error and figured out,
[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:24.540]   okay, we can really make this work with Zoom and using, I believe it's called Mccana.
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:26.700]   And it does make for a really good experience.
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:27.700]   Yeah.
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:30.860]   I found that, you know, and for instance, we've got the video now working in our video
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:31.860]   Discord.
[01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:32.860]   People are, don't, they mute their mics.
[01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:36.780]   They're not, you know, I think, I don't think you need to have too elaborate of a system.
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:38.420]   They're not savages.
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:39.860]   They're not savages.
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:43.140]   And so here, John show it because I have it on the screen now.
[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:46.060]   So if you go in, unfortunately it's going to immediately go to the screen and then I'll
[01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:48.100]   go to the screen and the screen and the screen.
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:49.100]   You get the idea.
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:52.980]   And if I, then if I go in a chat, we'll get a picture and picture that stays there so
[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:55.020]   people could be watching the show and chatting.
[01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:56.020]   That's cool.
[01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:57.020]   I think this pretty neat.
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:59.980]   I think that eventually we're going to use more of this.
[01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:03.700]   But I could see why there's some, you know, ferment going on.
[01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:09.100]   Telegram just announced today that you can effectively do a television station on Telegram.
[01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:10.100]   What?
[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:14.460]   They, they uncapped, they had a cap of, I think, a thousand live viewers.
[01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:16.020]   I don't know how they can afford this.
[01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:20.700]   They basically said, no, unlimited with the Telegram version eight, you can stream live
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:24.540]   to an unlimited number of people.
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:26.020]   They've eliminated the limit.
[01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:27.980]   So you can do voice channel.
[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:32.740]   They say clubhouse style voice channels with support for millions of live listeners, but
[01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:34.420]   you can even do video now.
[01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:35.420]   We're actually investigating.
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:37.980]   I'd like to investigate how to do that as well.
[01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:41.140]   So I think this is something that's happening all of a sudden.
[01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:45.140]   And I don't think the clubhouse model is necessarily the model, but I can see why everybody's
[01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:49.460]   trying to kind of get, get in on this while they can.
[01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:51.460]   I've been again, I've been in.
[01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:54.500]   I hear the platform that go in and.
[01:43:54.500 --> 01:44:00.460]   No, I was just going to say I've been in clubhouse rooms or whatever based on stuff
[01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:01.460]   that interests me.
[01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:04.740]   And they've been okay for the most part.
[01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:06.300]   It's not a lot of Oregon, of Bickering.
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:09.140]   It's just a lot of shared information.
[01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:12.140]   Then there's a couple of times you go in there and it's just a sales pitch.
[01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:15.700]   And I hope that that's not what all of these things are going to turn into.
[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:18.060]   It's just another room full of sales pitches.
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:19.820]   No, but I think that that's.
[01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:21.300]   Marketing takes over everything.
[01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:22.300]   Yeah.
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:25.620]   I mean, that's happened in podcasting too, but it's kind of it washes itself out and
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:27.660]   you can choose what you want to watch.
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:32.060]   And that's why I hope people like what we do because it's not, you know, it's we've
[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:34.460]   got a certain quality to it.
[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:36.220]   We're not doing marketing here.
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:38.860]   We're not chilling for anything.
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:44.140]   So anyway, I mean, I think this is, it's fun to watch this shifting media.
[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:46.300]   It really is.
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:50.060]   And Amazon says, hey, we should do that too.
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:45:01.780]   Amazon is now running 164 flights a day on its prime air delivering packages and cargo
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:02.940]   and all sorts of things.
[01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:06.380]   They opened an 800,000 square foot hub in Cincinnati.
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:11.540]   Which is probably why they're going to hire another 70,000 people.
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:12.540]   Yep.
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:13.540]   Yep.
[01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:14.540]   Getting busy.
[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:15.540]   I think it was this morning.
[01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:16.540]   They said 55,000.
[01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:17.540]   55,000.
[01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:21.820]   Tech and corporate in months in months.
[01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:22.820]   Wow.
[01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:23.820]   That's amazing.
[01:45:23.820 --> 01:45:24.820]   Welcome to the new regime.
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:29.940]   There was an article the Wall Street Journal did probably no, maybe it was the New York
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:30.940]   Times.
[01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:36.340]   They did it a couple months ago, but the reporter found out they have a hundred and fifty percent
[01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:38.020]   turnover rate.
[01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:44.340]   So imagine having that many people and knowing you're going to have to replace them one and
[01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:47.060]   a half times over each year.
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:48.060]   Well, they have crazy.
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:53.780]   According to the Orange County Register, which as we know is a bastion of democracy,
[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:56.340]   Amazon has found a solution.
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:58.340]   Hire pot smokers.
[01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:03.780]   I thought that was hilarious.
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:09.020]   The company is suggesting that contractors prominently advertise they don't screen for
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:10.020]   marijuana use.
[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:13.220]   Of course, we're in California where it's not illegal to use marijuana.
[01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:14.220]   Right.
[01:46:14.220 --> 01:46:17.900]   I saw that story in 80 places and then I saw that headline.
[01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:18.900]   Yeah.
[01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:22.980]   They're only testing for drugs like opiates and amphetamines.
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:25.340]   And they found that when they do that, more drivers pass.
[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:29.940]   Yes, because it's legal to smoke pot in California.
[01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:32.900]   And what you do at home after you driving is fine.
[01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:33.900]   It's up to you.
[01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:37.380]   I don't know if that headline is exactly the...
[01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:39.180]   No, it was a little much.
[01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:43.860]   I don't know whether it was just Tuskegee or funny.
[01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:46.020]   I couldn't tell.
[01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:47.180]   It's the OC register.
[01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:50.860]   I think it's Tuskegee.
[01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:52.860]   That's John Wayne's favorite county.
[01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:54.860]   I just want to point out.
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:55.860]   Yes.
[01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:56.860]   Well, it used to be...
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:46:57.860]   It's gone blue.
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:46:58.860]   It has gone blue.
[01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:00.100]   And you know why?
[01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:04.420]   Because all of these rich Republicans need people to cut their lawn.
[01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:15.060]   And so the actual percentage of Latinx people in the population has gone to over 50%.
[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:16.460]   Latino, sir.
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:17.460]   No, Latinx.
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:18.460]   Latino.
[01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:19.460]   There's a debate.
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:20.460]   No, no.
[01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:21.460]   We don't say Latinx.
[01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:22.460]   No, say Latino.
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:24.020]   I've actually confirmed this.
[01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:25.020]   Wait a minute.
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:26.020]   Confirmed it with what?
[01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:28.020]   The official Latino convention.
[01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:29.820]   I've asked the hand for...
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:31.820]   Oh, well, that makes Latino people happy.
[01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:32.820]   Well, I'll give you...
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:34.820]   And every last one of them.
[01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:36.460]   Because this is how I phrased it.
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:38.300]   And this is probably going to sound bad.
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:41.660]   I said, you know, I keep hearing Latinx.
[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:45.380]   And I swear it just sounds like some white person just made this up just for the heck
[01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:48.860]   of it and trying to make an issue out of something.
[01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:50.860]   What do you prefer?
[01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:53.980]   And I said, do you want to be called Mexican if you're Mexican?
[01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:54.980]   Yes.
[01:47:54.980 --> 01:47:55.980]   You want to be called Hispanic?
[01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:56.980]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:47:56.980 --> 01:47:57.980]   You have to call it Latino.
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:59.460]   Hispanic is a problem too.
[01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:00.460]   Right.
[01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:03.820]   And every single one of them said Latino is perfectly fine.
[01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:04.820]   Every single one of them.
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:10.660]   Well, I will see your five friends and raise you a colleague who wrote about this in The
[01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:11.660]   New Yorker.
[01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:12.660]   Word.
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:13.660]   Word.
[01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:14.660]   Oh, if you can...
[01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:16.820]   Which is the passion of Latinx readers.
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:20.580]   Well, but she's Graciela Moschkowski from Argentina.
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:27.140]   She started our Bilingual Journalism program at the Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig,
[01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:33.300]   Neumann, and started Latino Media Initiative and our Center for Community Media.
[01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:34.940]   Graciela is an expert.
[01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:41.300]   So she says in The New Yorker, line 148, wow, it was already in there.
[01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:44.060]   We knew we were going to have this conversation.
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:46.020]   Hey, hey, I have power.
[01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:48.020]   I can summon Craig Neumann.
[01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:50.820]   He is fast on the link.
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:53.380]   Yeah, Stacy's going to get...
[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:55.740]   Yo, you're a Googling during the show?
[01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:56.740]   Hey.
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:48:59.420]   This is Graciela Moschkowski, say.
[01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:00.420]   Much coffee.
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:02.740]   I'm trying to remember exactly.
[01:49:02.740 --> 01:49:09.340]   She's going through the history of it and she basically says it's okay.
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:10.740]   She uses it too.
[01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:11.740]   We use Latino.
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:13.300]   She primarily uses Latino.
[01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:15.060]   So I agree with you.
[01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:16.620]   So it's the same thing with...
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:17.620]   It's the point it is.
[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:18.620]   It's the point it is.
[01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:19.620]   It's the point it's like it.
[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:21.420]   And I respect that.
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:24.380]   I think it was Micah said, "Please don't call me African American.
[01:49:24.380 --> 01:49:25.380]   I'm black."
[01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:26.380]   Black dude.
[01:49:26.380 --> 01:49:27.980]   I think that that's fair.
[01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:30.780]   And certainly if a majority of...
[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:35.860]   We used to say Hispanic and then people said, "Well, it's not really Hispanic."
[01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:42.660]   Because if you're from Latin America, you may well have Indian roots, not Spanish roots.
[01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:46.740]   So I guess Latino was to reflect Latin America.
[01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:52.740]   And then people said, "But wait a minute, female Latinos are Latinas."
[01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:56.980]   So I've been saying Latinx just so it doesn't say male or female.
[01:49:56.980 --> 01:50:00.660]   It's just Latino or Latina.
[01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:06.300]   That's why I use Latinx, which according to a Pew poll, less than 25% of the people whom
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:08.820]   the term claims to name have even heard of it.
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:13.380]   In fact, the number of Latinx people who occur in Latinx is 3%.
[01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:15.100]   That's the 25%.
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:16.100]   Wow.
[01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:17.100]   Only 3%.
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:22.580]   Yes, and I can sit in my class and I can have someone from Argentina, someone from Mexico
[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:27.620]   and some Guatemala, their families, and Puerto Rico.
[01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.100]   And they will disagree with each other.
[01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:30.100]   But that's the problem.
[01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:31.100]   No one knows.
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:32.100]   No one knows.
[01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:33.100]   No one knows.
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:34.100]   So it's the same thing.
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:36.300]   I used to call them Native Americans.
[01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:39.020]   And somebody said, "No, no, call us Indians."
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:41.660]   But that's one person.
[01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:44.060]   So I don't know what the answer is.
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:45.660]   Feel sorry for us, poor white people.
[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:46.660]   We used to be in charge.
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:47.660]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:49.860]   No, we don't know what the hell they call anything.
[01:50:49.860 --> 01:50:50.860]   Anybody.
[01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:51.860]   No, I...
[01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:53.860]   I'm just trying to be...
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:56.180]   I'm not trying to be politically correct.
[01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:57.180]   I want to be clear.
[01:50:57.180 --> 01:51:01.620]   I'm trying to be sensitive to what people want to be called.
[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:03.340]   And I don't want to make up a name.
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:06.660]   And nor do I want to call people from China, oriennals.
[01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:08.660]   I want to find a lot of...
[01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:10.420]   Yeah, you should definitely not.
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:12.420]   I want to find an appropriate...
[01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:17.780]   I guess the real problem is lumping everybody in a group into some group.
[01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:19.300]   Well, that's the problem with Hispanic.
[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:20.300]   Well, it's arbitrary.
[01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:21.300]   It's arbitrary.
[01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:22.300]   It's ridiculous.
[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:23.940]   You could be Cuban.
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:25.180]   You could be from Argentina.
[01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:26.180]   Exactly.
[01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:27.380]   You could be from Lithuania.
[01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:28.380]   You could be from...
[01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:29.380]   So what is that?
[01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:31.660]   My students say they never recalled these titles.
[01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:35.740]   They were never called Latino, Latinx, or Hispanic until they came to the US.
[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:36.740]   Right.
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:37.740]   But we're a melting pot.
[01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:38.740]   And so...
[01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:39.740]   Well, everybody together.
[01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:40.740]   No, melting pot is...
[01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:42.220]   I was raised on a melting pot too.
[01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:46.180]   And it took me time to learn what a racist construct that is.
[01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:48.580]   Like, you're all going to be like us, eventually.
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:49.980]   Those of us were in power.
[01:51:49.980 --> 01:51:52.060]   The opposite's going to happen.
[01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:55.900]   Actually everybody's going to be light brown and I think it'll be beautiful.
[01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:57.340]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:01.580]   So what was I talking about when I said Latinx?
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:02.580]   No one knows anymore.
[01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:03.580]   I don't even know.
[01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:04.580]   I don't even know.
[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:07.060]   I know it's a world, but don't make fun of us for that either.
[01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:09.020]   I'm just trying to be sensitive.
[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:12.460]   I'm not trying to lump people into a category.
[01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:15.980]   I'm not trying to label anybody.
[01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:17.980]   You're all beautiful individuals.
[01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:22.220]   They're all hiring in their fleet of Boeing.
[01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:25.220]   Oh, we were talking about John Wayne liking John.
[01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:26.220]   John Wayne.
[01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:27.220]   That's right.
[01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:28.220]   That's right.
[01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:31.900]   And now there are more people of...
[01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:34.540]   I don't know what to say.
[01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:39.860]   They're more blue people than there are red people.
[01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:42.700]   Want people to bow their lawn and then you just went right.
[01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:43.700]   I know.
[01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:44.700]   I know.
[01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:45.700]   It's bad the whole way.
[01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:46.700]   It's not good.
[01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:49.020]   That was bad the whole way.
[01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:51.780]   Like, wait, as I'm going back, I'm like, oh, no.
[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:52.780]   I was eating my waffle.
[01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:53.780]   What?
[01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:54.780]   But now...
[01:52:54.780 --> 01:52:55.780]   I'm freaking lost.
[01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:56.780]   Australia.
[01:52:56.780 --> 01:52:57.780]   And it is words.
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:52:59.340]   Yeah, Australian government could edit his words and make it all.
[01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:00.340]   I'm sorry.
[01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:02.380]   I'm just an old dumb old white guy.
[01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:03.940]   I just applied for Medicare.
[01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:05.940]   What do you expect?
[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:09.100]   Generate generation.
[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:10.340]   Add a touch.
[01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:11.540]   Just call me that.
[01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:13.740]   I'm trying to be good.
[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:14.740]   But then...
[01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:16.740]   Stop digging this hole in the hole.
[01:53:16.740 --> 01:53:17.740]   They're totally different.
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:20.180]   Isn't there a change log today?
[01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:21.180]   Yeah, let's...
[01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:22.180]   Okay, hold on.
[01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:24.660]   Let's take a break and then we'll do a Google change log.
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:26.340]   Because I need to clear my mind.
[01:53:26.340 --> 01:53:29.420]   And that presumes there was anything in it.
[01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:30.660]   But yes.
[01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:34.660]   It was all the wrong stuff there.
[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:36.940]   The reasonable.
[01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:37.940]   Play the drums.
[01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:39.420]   It's time for...
[01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:44.580]   The Google change log.
[01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:46.820]   Part of the show I care least about.
[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:47.820]   But now that I've...
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:54.620]   Now that we've got a special section called What Stupid Things As Leo Said This Week, I
[01:53:54.620 --> 01:53:56.180]   now have a new...
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:53:57.180]   Less favorite.
[01:53:57.180 --> 01:53:58.180]   Thanks.
[01:53:58.180 --> 01:54:02.380]   The Google Calendar will break down how much of your work is spent in meetings.
[01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:09.020]   As if you wanted to know, there is a new time insights panel on the...
[01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:10.020]   I think that's great.
[01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:14.180]   On the Google Calendar showing how much of your work week is spent in meetings...
[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:15.180]   The tasted.
[01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:16.180]   No, the verb is wasted.
[01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:17.180]   Wasted.
[01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:18.180]   I agree.
[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:19.180]   I dig that.
[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:22.300]   I agree.
[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:24.900]   Clearly created by somebody who feels that way, right?
[01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:25.900]   No.
[01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:29.140]   Please note, you can only view time insights on a computer.
[01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:33.180]   So don't try to do this on mobile.
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:36.740]   You'll get with time insights a breakdown based on your working hours and the types
[01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:37.740]   of meetings you have.
[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:38.740]   How would you...
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:40.740]   You'd have to indicate it's not meeting.
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:41.740]   How would it know that?
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:42.740]   I mean, is this a meeting?
[01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:43.740]   More meeting.
[01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:44.740]   Frustrating meeting.
[01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:45.740]   Faculty meeting.
[01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:50.340]   Maybe they just base it on how many people, like if you have invites with multiple people.
[01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:51.340]   That's a meeting.
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:52.340]   There you go.
[01:54:52.340 --> 01:54:53.340]   Okay.
[01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:54.340]   It'll also...
[01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:57.540]   Yeah, because it will know, because it'll show who you spend the most time meeting with.
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:55:01.220]   You can also pin key stakeholders.
[01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:02.220]   We know them as...
[01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:03.860]   What do we know them as?
[01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:04.860]   Bosses.
[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:05.860]   Bosses.
[01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:09.260]   To make sure you're being in touch with them.
[01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:10.260]   Hovering over an individual.
[01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:12.860]   Oh, Leo, I'm going to send you an e-book.
[01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:16.900]   Google, the algorithm has detected that I have not gotten in contact with you, so I
[01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:18.140]   just wanted to let you know.
[01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:19.140]   Exactly.
[01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:20.140]   Exactly.
[01:55:20.140 --> 01:55:25.100]   Hovering over an individual, not recommended, I can tell you after the lawsuit I had just
[01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:26.100]   had.
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:27.100]   Well, hovering over an individual.
[01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:28.100]   I just hovered over you.
[01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:29.100]   He did, he hovered over his.
[01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:30.100]   He's...
[01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:34.780]   Will highlight the meetings on your calendar that include that person.
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:39.740]   It'll highlight meeting heavy days and time frames as well as meeting frequencies.
[01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:45.100]   This information is visible to you, not your manager.
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:49.980]   So you can assess how you're spending your time against your own priorities.
[01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:50.980]   Wow.
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:55.180]   Not nearly enough time watching TikTok drinking.
[01:55:55.180 --> 01:55:56.180]   Exactly.
[01:55:56.180 --> 01:56:00.420]   I'll tell you about my priorities.
[01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:01.420]   You can now...
[01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:02.620]   That's the Google Calendar.
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:08.820]   Now, Google's assistant has something new called Daylong Routines.
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:11.540]   It can turn on at different times of the day.
[01:56:11.540 --> 01:56:13.540]   Did you have you covered this, Stacy, in the...
[01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:14.540]   No.
[01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:15.540]   Yeah, Google Assistant.
[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:16.540]   You can see this.
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:20.700]   Next time you go to create a new routine from the Assistant Settings of the Google Home
[01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:24.860]   app, at the bottom of the screen, you'll notice a pop-up saying, "Would you like to
[01:56:24.860 --> 01:56:28.460]   schedule a Daylong routine?"
[01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:32.260]   When you tap, yes, you'll be able to choose which days a routine should run on under starters
[01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:33.260]   as well as a time.
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:35.380]   Oh, this is just scheduling routines.
[01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:36.620]   Yes, I did do this.
[01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:37.620]   Sorry.
[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:41.180]   I set different actions to be done automatically at different times of the day.
[01:56:41.180 --> 01:56:46.700]   So I could say on Monday, Thursday, and Friday, turn the lights down at 6 p.m. on Wednesday
[01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:50.660]   and Tuesday, do it at 5 p.m. or something like that.
[01:56:50.660 --> 01:56:54.220]   So this would be interesting for 2 o'clock every Wednesday, my time.
[01:56:54.220 --> 01:56:55.220]   Yes.
[01:56:55.220 --> 01:56:56.220]   Because I've got my lights for Twig.
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:57.220]   Twig.
[01:56:57.220 --> 01:56:58.220]   And get a waffle.
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:56:59.220]   Exactly.
[01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:00.220]   Yeah.
[01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:02.700]   So that's new.
[01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:08.140]   Google Assistant is rolling out another new trigger that starts routines when dismissing
[01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:10.100]   an alarm.
[01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:12.180]   So you can set an alarm for something.
[01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:17.340]   And then when you say, "Okay, I hear you," it'll start a new routine like, you know,
[01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:22.580]   making the morning coffee or playing the news.
[01:57:22.580 --> 01:57:24.860]   That's nice.
[01:57:24.860 --> 01:57:31.260]   And then there is a new quick phrases feature that will let you skip, "Hey, guacamole."
[01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:41.220]   This is something that comes from 9 to 5 Googles APK Insights.
[01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:44.300]   You know, they break down these APKs.
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:49.380]   Look at lines of code that hint at possible features, which may or may not appear.
[01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:55.820]   But it looks like there is an Assistant setting page for quick phrases.
[01:57:55.820 --> 01:58:01.620]   And there is an area in there that says, "Skip saying, 'Hey, you know who' for help
[01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:04.780]   with specific tasks."
[01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:06.620]   What do you say instead?
[01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:08.220]   "Hey, schedule friend."
[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:09.220]   Hey.
[01:58:09.220 --> 01:58:10.460]   You don't say anything.
[01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:16.220]   So there's a couple of those that, I don't know if you have to enable them, but it's like,
[01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:18.620]   turn off the alarm or set alarm for 7 AM.
[01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:22.660]   If you said set alarm for 7 AM, it would just say it to the air.
[01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:23.660]   It would say, "Oh, that means me."
[01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:28.180]   "Oh, okay, okay, I'm starting to turn on my clock over here and count down to get the
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:29.180]   moral panic of them."
[01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:32.700]   See, they are almost need every sentence you say.
[01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:34.500]   Actually, that's true, isn't it?
[01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:36.340]   The one, for instance, I love for AM.
[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:38.220]   "We've been over no, no, no, no, I'm waiting for Hey, Google."
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:39.220]   Well, I'm sorry.
[01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:43.300]   But it doesn't wait for Hey, who?
[01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:47.060]   But I like that they, as they started that with alarms, right, where you just say, "Stop."
[01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:48.060]   "Stop."
[01:58:48.060 --> 01:58:49.060]   I like that.
[01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:50.060]   So this is kind of like that.
[01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:55.220]   But it's so, you could send a broadcast, you can answer or decline calls, you can say,
[01:58:55.220 --> 01:58:56.540]   "What time is it?"
[01:58:56.540 --> 01:58:59.740]   If you, I don't know if I like this or not, you have to turn it on.
[01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:03.420]   But if you just shout into the ether, "What time is it?"
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:06.100]   It'll tell you.
[01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:07.460]   What's the weather?
[01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:08.460]   Turn the lights on.
[01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:10.580]   I like turn the lights on.
[01:59:10.580 --> 01:59:14.100]   Right now, I have to say, "Guacamole, turn the lights off."
[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:15.100]   Be nice to you.
[01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:17.540]   So turn off the lights.
[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:20.260]   Get a reminder, create a family note, how much time is left.
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:22.940]   Reset the timer, pause the timer, cancel the timer.
[01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:25.700]   You can even just say, "Set a timer for..."
[01:59:25.700 --> 01:59:26.700]   And the number of minutes.
[01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:27.780]   I want to turn this on.
[01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:31.780]   I think this might, it'll be interesting.
[01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:32.780]   I think it'll be good.
[01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:35.140]   I mean, because like, I was trying to think of where it would go wrong.
[01:59:35.140 --> 01:59:38.580]   Like, I might say to Andrew, I might be like, "Hey, can you turn off the lights?"
[01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:41.100]   But either way, if the lights get you not, I don't care.
[01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:42.100]   Who cares?
[01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:44.500]   Who needs a husband when you have Google?
[01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:45.500]   A gun?
[01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:46.500]   A gun?
[01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:47.500]   A gun?
[01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:50.980]   Actually, what happens when I ask Andrew to turn off the lights, he'll turn to the available
[01:59:50.980 --> 01:59:51.980]   assistant.
[01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:53.820]   Hey, turn off the lights.
[01:59:53.820 --> 01:59:57.980]   Well, my worst, because it's the great irony that it's like, you did this to our space
[01:59:57.980 --> 01:59:58.980]   heap.
[01:59:58.980 --> 02:00:00.700]   So I'm going to do it.
[02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:01.700]   How would he not do that?
[02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:03.700]   He has to do that, of course.
[02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:06.300]   It's like he's standing right at the switch.
[02:00:06.300 --> 02:00:07.700]   Like, it's right there.
[02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:08.700]   And he's just like...
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:10.460]   No, but no, this is like...
[02:00:10.460 --> 02:00:11.460]   Oh, no.
[02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:12.460]   This is like, something...
[02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:15.540]   No, he just doesn't know how to turn switches on and off anymore.
[02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:16.540]   That's the issue for me.
[02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:19.340]   He doesn't even think of buttons anymore.
[02:00:19.340 --> 02:00:20.340]   None.
[02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:22.340]   You've trained him.
[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:24.060]   No, no buttons.
[02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:29.260]   I will push no button before it's time.
[02:00:29.260 --> 02:00:33.620]   Google has added shipping and return labels to product listings and search and shopping
[02:00:33.620 --> 02:00:34.860]   tool.
[02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:39.220]   Which is interesting, I think, because it tells you going in, how much are you going
[02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:40.700]   to pay, can you return it?
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:41.700]   That kind of stuff.
[02:00:41.700 --> 02:00:43.780]   My label doesn't mean you get the label.
[02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:45.820]   It means it's labels then.
[02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:51.540]   Which I think is a pro-competitive move versus Amazon.
[02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:56.780]   Because in the recent work we've done around media companies getting into commerce, BuzzFeed
[02:00:56.780 --> 02:01:03.700]   and newspapers and so on, one clear lesson is Amazon Prime sells stuff.
[02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:08.860]   If the listing that the newspaper, Lyricutter, says this thing comes with Amazon Prime, people
[02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:10.940]   are far more likely to click on that.
[02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:13.100]   Because they've already invested in Prime and it's free shipping and they know what that
[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:14.740]   means and boom.
[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:18.420]   And now from the listing, if you can see that, oh, it's also free shipping.
[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:20.700]   Oh, the return policy is good.
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:22.980]   I wonder if that's going to happen.
[02:01:22.980 --> 02:01:23.980]   You know what?
[02:01:23.980 --> 02:01:24.980]   That's a good point.
[02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:25.980]   I wonder if that's why they're doing it.
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:27.740]   That's very interesting.
[02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:29.820]   Have you opened, do me a favor, Ollie.
[02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:36.620]   Open your Google photos because there are new AI generated albums in there.
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:37.900]   And I'm just curious what you see.
[02:01:37.900 --> 02:01:46.380]   I see summer, I'm sorry, sand and sea, which is interesting, spotlight on Leo Laport, my
[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:47.380]   favorite.
[02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:55.260]   But then I also see, and I don't know if this is new, I think it is, nine years, ten years,
[02:01:55.260 --> 02:01:56.900]   eleven years ago.
[02:01:56.900 --> 02:01:58.980]   The years went to dinner for a while.
[02:01:58.980 --> 02:01:59.980]   How about the top?
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:00.980]   Yeah.
[02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:01.980]   There's also a--
[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:02.980]   The years went to dinner for a while.
[02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:03.980]   Oh, there we go.
[02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:04.980]   Best of summer 20/20.
[02:02:04.980 --> 02:02:06.980]   I've been getting those for a while.
[02:02:06.980 --> 02:02:09.060]   Sometimes I get like-- There's some new ones.
[02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:10.060]   Awesome hikes.
[02:02:10.060 --> 02:02:11.060]   Yeah.
[02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:12.060]   I'm like, really?
[02:02:12.060 --> 02:02:13.060]   Yeah, those are new.
[02:02:13.060 --> 02:02:15.820]   But then it shows me things that were not actually hikes, which is always fascinating.
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:16.820]   Do you--
[02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:17.820]   Do any of you have a--
[02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:18.820]   This has a tree in it.
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:20.900]   Do any of you have a best of summer 2021 yet?
[02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:23.660]   No, but they send me those all the time.
[02:02:23.660 --> 02:02:27.220]   They send me the like the ads for buying a book.
[02:02:27.220 --> 02:02:30.900]   They'll compile a bunch for me and they're like family vacation because they know that
[02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:34.140]   I'm taking photos someplace else.
[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:36.140]   This is the sand and sea.
[02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:37.620]   Yeah, that was a great shot.
[02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:38.620]   Yeah.
[02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:39.620]   All of my best pictures are of Lisa.
[02:02:39.620 --> 02:02:41.100]   Isn't that interesting?
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:43.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:44.060]   All of them.
[02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:45.060]   I'm not kidding.
[02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:50.380]   I have a picture of the mold that was made by the-- by the diatrist today for my new orthopedics.
[02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:51.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:52.380]   Wow.
[02:02:52.380 --> 02:02:55.460]   I don't think I need to see that.
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:03:00.900]   Here's the best of your pediatric-- podiatric mold.
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:01.900]   Yeah.
[02:03:01.900 --> 02:03:02.900]   2021.
[02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:07.140]   I actually have a picture of a pediatric mold because we have a mold of my daughter's head.
[02:03:07.140 --> 02:03:08.140]   Oh, why?
[02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:09.140]   I mean, she was a baby.
[02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:10.140]   Did she have a weird head?
[02:03:10.140 --> 02:03:12.300]   She had a like a-- yeah, she had a flat head.
[02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:13.940]   Oh, but that's not a little round.
[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:14.940]   It deforms.
[02:03:14.940 --> 02:03:15.940]   Yeah.
[02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:16.940]   Babies skull through saw.
[02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:18.500]   Mine stayed flat in the back.
[02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:19.500]   Oh, really?
[02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:20.700]   Well, now that wouldn't happen.
[02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:22.660]   That's something you heard about me.
[02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:26.420]   Now they like make you pay money and they stick like a little helmet on your baby.
[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:27.420]   Oh, I've seen this.
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:28.420]   Did you get a baby helmet?
[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:29.420]   Such a crumb.
[02:03:29.420 --> 02:03:30.420]   Yeah, she had a baby helmet.
[02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:32.860]   So she'd have a round head?
[02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:35.900]   See, this is the kind of discrimination I think we have to fight.
[02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:36.900]   I'll be honest with you.
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:39.100]   Flatheads, we got to unite.
[02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:40.100]   Yeah.
[02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:45.820]   I'm like, Adam, we could shave your head and it's going to look amazing because we paid
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:48.220]   a lot of money for it to be perfectly round.
[02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:49.660]   It's perfectly round.
[02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:50.660]   You have a round head.
[02:03:50.660 --> 02:03:55.540]   But baby, it's normal for baby skulls to be deformed because the bones are soft initially
[02:03:55.540 --> 02:04:00.180]   plus they have the little hole in the top so that, you know--
[02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:02.220]   I like ants head shape.
[02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:04.780]   I used to be called bullet hit as a kid.
[02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:05.780]   Let's see there.
[02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:06.780]   Let's see the bullet.
[02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:08.780]   It's not much of a bullet now.
[02:04:08.780 --> 02:04:10.780]   No, it's a good shape.
[02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:11.780]   Good shape.
[02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:12.780]   I'm not going to--
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:13.780]   I gained weight but, you know--
[02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:16.740]   Well, I don't think your skull shows weight.
[02:04:16.740 --> 02:04:17.740]   No, I used to--
[02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:18.740]   Yeah, you have a bullet.
[02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:20.740]   You can get fat on your neck.
[02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:21.740]   You have head fat.
[02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:22.740]   Okay, your neck.
[02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:23.740]   That's it.
[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:24.740]   My neck.
[02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:25.740]   It's gotten bigger.
[02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:26.900]   No, that's because you lift.
[02:04:26.900 --> 02:04:30.500]   You got a big, big, thick lifting neck.
[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:35.260]   God, I saw his guns on Sunday.
[02:04:35.260 --> 02:04:36.260]   You get the--
[02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:37.260]   What?
[02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:38.260]   My massive biceps.
[02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:39.260]   Which I can't.
[02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:41.220]   Yeah, it was such a fun show.
[02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:46.540]   Yeah, he was-- we were trying to prove that Ant and Owen, JJ Stone, were not the same
[02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:47.540]   person.
[02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:51.940]   I don't know if we've convinced anyone, though.
[02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:52.940]   Let's see.
[02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:54.940]   Oh, hey.
[02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:59.700]   You can be glad Jeff you didn't buy the new Pixel Buds A series.
[02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:04.100]   He's already a firmware update to fix the volume bug.
[02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:05.100]   Oh, no.
[02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:07.020]   I just can't get this right.
[02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:13.700]   Well, the problem is my watchful calls, the one you love, is right when his has no volume.
[02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:14.700]   Uh-huh.
[02:05:14.700 --> 02:05:15.700]   The Jabra.
[02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:16.700]   So I was about--
[02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:19.580]   No, you take them back.
[02:05:19.580 --> 02:05:20.900]   They will give you more.
[02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:22.900]   They will fix that for you.
[02:05:22.900 --> 02:05:24.500]   Really?
[02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:25.500]   Your Jabras?
[02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:26.500]   Yeah, they had--
[02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:27.500]   Where am I taking back?
[02:05:27.500 --> 02:05:28.500]   There's all kinds of warranties on that.
[02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:29.500]   I can't remember where I bought them.
[02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:31.500]   Oh, well, let me see.
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:38.660]   Do you have the app on your phone?
[02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:43.660]   I feel that-- like, I register-- if you have the app, let's see, Jabra Support.
[02:05:43.660 --> 02:05:47.420]   Put the app on your phone.
[02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:51.180]   You can contact support right there from the app.
[02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:52.180]   And just say--
[02:05:52.180 --> 02:05:53.180]   And say, my left head button.
[02:05:53.180 --> 02:05:54.180]   My phone doesn't work.
[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:56.180]   My left head doesn't work.
[02:05:56.180 --> 02:05:57.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:05:57.180 --> 02:05:58.180]   Whichever.
[02:05:58.180 --> 02:05:59.180]   Whatever.
[02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:00.180]   Whatever doesn't work.
[02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:01.180]   Just tell them.
[02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:02.660]   I've got lifting neck.
[02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:05.100]   I need a new head.
[02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:06.500]   Thank you very much.
[02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:08.180]   I have flat feet.
[02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:09.940]   Is that what's wrong?
[02:06:09.940 --> 02:06:10.940]   Is that why you have a podium?
[02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:11.940]   Oh, you asked?
[02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:12.940]   You asked?
[02:06:12.940 --> 02:06:13.940]   You asked?
[02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:14.940]   I got hammer toes.
[02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:15.940]   I got flat feet.
[02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:16.940]   I got bones.
[02:06:16.940 --> 02:06:17.940]   Oh, my goodness.
[02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:18.940]   Okay, we got it.
[02:06:18.940 --> 02:06:19.940]   I got bones.
[02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:20.940]   I got bones.
[02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:21.940]   I'm old.
[02:06:21.940 --> 02:06:27.420]   This is just going to be-- we've gone from Medicare to Jeff's foot problems.
[02:06:27.420 --> 02:06:28.420]   And I'm done with it.
[02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:30.620]   You know what I did today?
[02:06:30.620 --> 02:06:33.940]   I ordered a special orthopedic pillow.
[02:06:33.940 --> 02:06:35.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:37.900]   No.
[02:06:37.900 --> 02:06:39.580]   Not from my pillow, I hope.
[02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:40.580]   No.
[02:06:40.580 --> 02:06:42.580]   But it wasn't Instagram ad.
[02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:44.580]   It wasn't Instagram ad.
[02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:46.980]   I know where all the dishes are.
[02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:54.380]   It's a special pillow for people whose shoulders hurt them when they sleep.
[02:06:54.380 --> 02:06:57.340]   It raises you up so you have room for your shoulder.
[02:06:57.340 --> 02:06:58.340]   I don't know.
[02:06:58.340 --> 02:07:02.660]   I don't know how people with shoulders sleep.
[02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:04.100]   There's no good weight.
[02:07:04.100 --> 02:07:05.100]   I mean, I can sleep on my back.
[02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:06.100]   And shoulders?
[02:07:06.100 --> 02:07:07.980]   Yeah, do you sleep on your back looking straight up?
[02:07:07.980 --> 02:07:09.780]   That's why he doesn't sleep.
[02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:10.780]   He has shoulders.
[02:07:10.780 --> 02:07:12.900]   I can't sleep on my back.
[02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:14.740]   I sleep somewhat twisted.
[02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:15.740]   It's weird.
[02:07:15.740 --> 02:07:16.740]   Yeah, me too.
[02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:18.740]   Because if I just sleep on my side, it's like this.
[02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:19.740]   Yeah.
[02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:21.740]   Yeah, that's why you need this special pillow.
[02:07:21.740 --> 02:07:22.740]   No.
[02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:24.300]   I'm not behind into that gimmick.
[02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:25.300]   No.
[02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:26.300]   You saw what it means to me.
[02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:27.300]   It may have been a mistake.
[02:07:27.300 --> 02:07:28.540]   It was an Instagram pillow.
[02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:31.060]   I'm sure it was a mistake.
[02:07:31.060 --> 02:07:36.380]   This is why I got off Instagram and then they pulled me in again and immediately I'm buying
[02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:37.380]   useless stuff.
[02:07:37.380 --> 02:07:38.380]   I need this way.
[02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:40.820]   We're clearly very lucrative for them.
[02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:42.380]   They're like, get this guy back.
[02:07:42.380 --> 02:07:46.940]   An incredible invention that looks directly inside your ear.
[02:07:46.940 --> 02:07:47.940]   Why?
[02:07:47.940 --> 02:07:48.940]   Oh, yeah.
[02:07:48.940 --> 02:07:49.940]   This is the story you can see.
[02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:50.940]   I saw this ad.
[02:07:50.940 --> 02:07:51.940]   You can see your hair.
[02:07:51.940 --> 02:07:58.220]   I understand.
[02:07:58.220 --> 02:08:02.820]   I don't understand Instagram.
[02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:05.460]   And I think they finally, because I bought the pillow.
[02:08:05.460 --> 02:08:06.860]   It's a high-five the pillow.
[02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:08.300]   They go, oh, we got one.
[02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:09.860]   We got a live one here.
[02:08:09.860 --> 02:08:12.420]   Sell on the ear camera.
[02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:14.540]   It's featured on the Kelly Clarkson show.
[02:08:14.540 --> 02:08:15.540]   Oh, my God.
[02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:16.540]   I can't believe it.
[02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:18.980]   I was trying to find the pillow.
[02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:20.460]   You're on old people Instagram.
[02:08:20.460 --> 02:08:21.460]   You're old?
[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:22.460]   Yeah, you're right.
[02:08:22.460 --> 02:08:24.340]   Because look, now I can sit for hours in total.
[02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:26.140]   Look at that.
[02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:27.340]   You're a bony butt.
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:28.340]   This ad.
[02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:29.340]   I hate you Instagram.
[02:08:29.340 --> 02:08:30.340]   I hate you.
[02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:34.980]   I don't even know what you're saying about me.
[02:08:34.980 --> 02:08:35.980]   Ages.
[02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:36.980]   I hate you.
[02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:40.420]   This is from the cushion lab.
[02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:41.420]   It's a --
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:42.420]   Those are some millennial colors.
[02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:43.420]   I'm not going to lie.
[02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:44.660]   Oh, man.
[02:08:44.660 --> 02:08:46.160]   Oh, man.
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:49.820]   This may -- it makes it possible for me to sit for hours.
[02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:52.540]   It says, oh, Lord.
[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:53.540]   The ads I'm getting.
[02:08:53.540 --> 02:08:55.740]   That's actually made from bony bonsfert of God.
[02:08:55.740 --> 02:08:56.740]   What's this?
[02:08:56.740 --> 02:08:57.740]   Oh, they're old, man.
[02:08:57.740 --> 02:08:58.740]   Eight of them.
[02:08:58.740 --> 02:08:59.740]   Eight of them.
[02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:00.740]   Eight of them.
[02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:01.740]   It's good.
[02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:02.740]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:03.740]   Hot Nashville stuff.
[02:09:03.740 --> 02:09:04.740]   Chicken chips.
[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:05.740]   What the hell are chicken chips?
[02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:06.740]   Hey, now I take that.
[02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:07.740]   Is that fried chicken skin?
[02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:08.740]   Yes, fried chicken skin for the wind.
[02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:10.740]   Oh, that's -- could not be worse for you.
[02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:11.740]   Oh, my God.
[02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:12.740]   Chicken chips.
[02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:13.740]   What the hell?
[02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:14.740]   Why?
[02:09:14.740 --> 02:09:17.740]   What are you getting on your Instagram ads?
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:20.100]   What are you getting on your Instagram ads?
[02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:23.100]   My ads are normally content-created here.
[02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:24.500]   It's lights and images.
[02:09:24.500 --> 02:09:25.500]   There it is.
[02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:26.500]   Here it is.
[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:27.500]   Here it is.
[02:09:27.500 --> 02:09:28.500]   They found it.
[02:09:28.500 --> 02:09:29.500]   By the way, take advantage, special Labor Day sale.
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:30.500]   Oh, yeah, you sucked them.
[02:09:30.500 --> 02:09:31.500]   You had to make your mind go out.
[02:09:31.500 --> 02:09:33.700]   Come on, you're going to sleep with another person.
[02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:34.700]   But wait a minute.
[02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:39.340]   The funny thing is, now that I see it, pillow not included.
[02:09:39.340 --> 02:09:44.940]   It's -- it's just -- they got you.
[02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:46.540]   They got you.
[02:09:46.540 --> 02:09:49.020]   It's a wedge for your pillow.
[02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:50.020]   Oh, my gosh.
[02:09:50.020 --> 02:09:52.260]   Oh, it's like 200 bucks, too.
[02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:53.260]   It was really expensive.
[02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:54.260]   Oh, you were such a schmuck.
[02:09:54.260 --> 02:09:56.540]   Oh, I'm such a -- well, it was 20 percent off.
[02:09:56.540 --> 02:09:59.740]   I really need to put some ads on Instagram.
[02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:01.220]   Pillow not included.
[02:10:01.220 --> 02:10:05.420]   It's just a wedge that you then put a pillow on.
[02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:06.420]   Oh.
[02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:08.780]   I have yet to get an ad.
[02:10:08.780 --> 02:10:10.780]   I'm still looking for one.
[02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:11.780]   Oh.
[02:10:11.780 --> 02:10:13.780]   Well, we'll see.
[02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:14.780]   Oh, it's --
[02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:19.780]   I'm getting Adam Schus, which is a fan of the show, by the way, who emailed me about something
[02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:20.780]   else.
[02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:21.780]   Adam Schus?
[02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:22.780]   Adam Schus.
[02:10:22.780 --> 02:10:23.780]   You're like these.
[02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:24.780]   Yeah.
[02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:25.780]   ATOM.
[02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:26.780]   ATOM.
[02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:27.780]   ATOM.
[02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:28.780]   Schus.
[02:10:28.780 --> 02:10:30.780]   And a fan of the show.
[02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:33.020]   Well, it's the most comfortable shoe.
[02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:35.420]   So he knows you got a podiatric problem.
[02:10:35.420 --> 02:10:36.420]   Yeah, he does.
[02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:37.420]   He does.
[02:10:37.420 --> 02:10:40.620]   That's why he -- that's why he texted me when he heard me talking about it.
[02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:41.620]   Yeah.
[02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:42.620]   All right.
[02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:43.620]   All right.
[02:10:43.620 --> 02:10:44.620]   I did.
[02:10:44.620 --> 02:10:45.620]   That's better.
[02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:46.620]   That's better.
[02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:48.180]   We just got made in pots.
[02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:50.060]   Do you know about those?
[02:10:50.060 --> 02:10:51.980]   I think I'm very happy with these.
[02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:55.140]   We got -- we got -- we got -- they're cooking -- they're cooking pans.
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:56.140]   Yeah.
[02:10:56.140 --> 02:10:58.060]   I'm thinking I'm very happy with these.
[02:10:58.060 --> 02:10:59.060]   Yeah.
[02:10:59.060 --> 02:11:00.060]   Also from Instagram.
[02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:03.260]   I'm still scrolling looking for an ad.
[02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:04.260]   Yeah.
[02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:05.260]   Yeah.
[02:11:05.260 --> 02:11:06.260]   They --
[02:11:06.260 --> 02:11:07.260]   You're communist.
[02:11:07.260 --> 02:11:08.260]   I didn't get ads.
[02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:09.260]   When I came back to Instagram, it's interesting.
[02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:12.660]   When I came back to Instagram, I thought, oh, there's no more ads on Instagram.
[02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:17.460]   I didn't get ads for months, and then all of a sudden, every third post, they had
[02:11:17.460 --> 02:11:20.260]   to figure out, well, what is his sweet spot?
[02:11:20.260 --> 02:11:22.540]   Ah, now we know.
[02:11:22.540 --> 02:11:28.860]   Ear examiners and pillow -- incline pillow -- ear camera.
[02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:30.220]   And that's -- Yeah, I didn't.
[02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:32.340]   -- the Google change lot.
[02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:33.340]   Wow.
[02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:36.140]   I'm so sorry.
[02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:38.140]   I'm so sorry.
[02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:41.580]   Why would you buy a pan with holes in it?
[02:11:41.580 --> 02:11:42.580]   It seems counter-productive.
[02:11:42.580 --> 02:11:43.580]   The grill.
[02:11:43.580 --> 02:11:47.260]   The grill when you do asparagus or something on the grill, wouldn't you?
[02:11:47.260 --> 02:11:48.260]   Steaming.
[02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:49.260]   I know.
[02:11:49.260 --> 02:11:52.340]   Why the pan with holes in it?
[02:11:52.340 --> 02:11:54.500]   This look, see?
[02:11:54.500 --> 02:11:55.660]   They're advertising it.
[02:11:55.660 --> 02:11:58.980]   Why don't you see how they describe the product?
[02:11:58.980 --> 02:11:59.980]   It's really somewhere there is.
[02:11:59.980 --> 02:12:03.300]   This is the made in ex-tekovos.
[02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:05.300]   There you go.
[02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:07.420]   It's a grill frying pan.
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:08.420]   Yeah.
[02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:10.020]   See, I told you.
[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:11.900]   It's made in Austin.
[02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:13.620]   Here's my first ad.
[02:12:13.620 --> 02:12:14.620]   Yeah.
[02:12:14.620 --> 02:12:15.620]   Capital One.
[02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:16.620]   Capital One.
[02:12:16.620 --> 02:12:17.620]   That's good.
[02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:18.620]   That's it.
[02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:19.620]   That means your good credit.
[02:12:19.620 --> 02:12:20.620]   I know you're rich.
[02:12:20.620 --> 02:12:21.620]   Yeah.
[02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:22.620]   Or percent.
[02:12:22.620 --> 02:12:23.620]   Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[02:12:23.620 --> 02:12:31.860]   My issue is I don't follow anybody on Instagram.
[02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:35.220]   So they don't really -- Yeah, if you don't -- you got to give them signals where they
[02:12:35.220 --> 02:12:37.380]   don't pay any attention.
[02:12:37.380 --> 02:12:40.780]   So Politico's gotten bought -- gotten bought in.
[02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:42.460]   They bought Politico.
[02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:48.100]   Actual -- actually -- actually, actually, the news corp of Germany.
[02:12:48.100 --> 02:12:51.420]   Yeah, they're the ones who are always going after Google, right?
[02:12:51.420 --> 02:12:53.300]   That's Google's arch enemy in Germany.
[02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:55.260]   Well, they're the ones who started -- Right.
[02:12:55.260 --> 02:12:57.260]   Like, "Lister" should subtract.
[02:12:57.260 --> 02:12:58.260]   Mustn't scare.
[02:12:58.260 --> 02:12:59.700]   I can never say that.
[02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:04.020]   Lister -- so they paid a billion -- which seems like a lot -- a billion dollars for
[02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:05.940]   the political -- Well, they overpaid for business insider, too.
[02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:08.540]   They wanted to be in the U.S. market.
[02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:09.540]   That tells you something.
[02:13:09.540 --> 02:13:16.940]   In fact, they wanted to be in the U.S. market on a site that is read by important politicians
[02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:21.100]   so that they can lobby against Google.
[02:13:21.100 --> 02:13:22.100]   So this is interesting.
[02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:25.820]   I know the CEO, Matiea Stufthner, is brilliant.
[02:13:25.820 --> 02:13:28.820]   He's also about six times huge, imposing.
[02:13:28.820 --> 02:13:30.300]   Jason's hate.
[02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:33.380]   They were taken private.
[02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:38.700]   He owns a huge chunk of the company with the founder's family.
[02:13:38.700 --> 02:13:41.500]   He's really smart, but it's a very conservative company.
[02:13:41.500 --> 02:13:42.500]   Built.
[02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:47.980]   Build is kind of the tabloid of Germany, except that the pages are really huge so the naked
[02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:49.540]   breasts can be even bigger.
[02:13:49.540 --> 02:13:50.540]   Geez.
[02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:56.980]   They built an insider, but they also are 48% owned by Kravus Koberg Roberts, a U.S.
[02:13:56.980 --> 02:13:57.980]   private equity firm.
[02:13:57.980 --> 02:13:58.980]   That's what they're talking about.
[02:13:58.980 --> 02:13:59.980]   Yeah.
[02:13:59.980 --> 02:14:02.700]   So, yeah, it's interesting.
[02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:08.540]   Do you think this is really a billion dollars to buy influence more than it is to buy a...
[02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:10.540]   I think to understand.
[02:14:10.540 --> 02:14:15.860]   And Politico was already, in my view, politically problematic and it's going to get more so.
[02:14:15.860 --> 02:14:23.140]   Politico was founded ahead of the 2008 elections by former Washington posters with the aim
[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:28.260]   to cover, of course this is coming from Reuters, to cover Washington in politics with the pace,
[02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:31.420]   analysis, and rigor of sports journalism.
[02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:42.780]   That's a little shot from Reuters.
[02:14:42.780 --> 02:14:47.180]   Salmon Rushdie, you may remember, is there still a fatwa on Salmon Rushdie?
[02:14:47.180 --> 02:14:48.820]   No, I think I lifted the...
[02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:55.980]   He wrote what was considered a blasphemous book about 30 years ago.
[02:14:55.980 --> 02:14:58.860]   He's written other books in Islam.
[02:14:58.860 --> 02:14:59.860]   Yeah, but it was...
[02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:01.700]   I can't remember the name of it.
[02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:02.700]   I liked it a lot.
[02:15:02.700 --> 02:15:03.700]   It was a good book.
[02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:04.700]   Satanic verses.
[02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:05.700]   Satanic verses.
[02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:06.700]   Yeah.
[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:11.460]   And it was under an order of death for some time.
[02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:12.740]   He's decided not...
[02:15:12.740 --> 02:15:13.740]   And I think...
[02:15:13.740 --> 02:15:14.860]   Did he win an Nobel Prize?
[02:15:14.860 --> 02:15:18.300]   He certainly very highly respected, highly regarded author.
[02:15:18.300 --> 02:15:25.020]   Decided not to publish his next book in print, but instead on sub-stack.
[02:15:25.020 --> 02:15:26.020]   Interesting.
[02:15:26.020 --> 02:15:37.180]   Book plus maybe some stories, plus interacting with the users, and sub-stack is paying him
[02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:38.180]   up front for this.
[02:15:38.180 --> 02:15:42.980]   Oh, this is another one of those sub-stack will give you half a million dollars.
[02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:45.100]   Yes, sub-stack likes controversial people.
[02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:46.100]   Yeah.
[02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:51.140]   I don't think Salmon Rushdie is controversial outside of Iran.
[02:15:51.140 --> 02:15:52.140]   Yeah.
[02:15:52.140 --> 02:15:54.780]   Well, they're international.
[02:15:54.780 --> 02:15:57.420]   Yeah, I don't know if sub-stack...
[02:15:57.420 --> 02:15:58.420]   I think sub-stack...
[02:15:58.420 --> 02:16:04.060]   Controversial, maybe not correct, maybe provocative.
[02:16:04.060 --> 02:16:05.060]   Somebody...
[02:16:05.060 --> 02:16:06.620]   This is going to drive traffic, which would make sense.
[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:09.340]   Well, Andrew Sullivan...
[02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:10.340]   Provocative.
[02:16:10.340 --> 02:16:12.340]   Provocative.
[02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:15.100]   Glen Greenwald.
[02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:16.100]   Provocative.
[02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:17.100]   Provocative.
[02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:20.500]   Just because you and I don't agree with them does not mean that they're...
[02:16:20.500 --> 02:16:21.980]   There's something wrong with...
[02:16:21.980 --> 02:16:22.980]   Why sub-controversial?
[02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:23.980]   I just said they were controversial.
[02:16:23.980 --> 02:16:24.980]   Controversial, yeah.
[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:27.300]   That's the point of provocative.
[02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:28.300]   Controversial drives traffic.
[02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:29.300]   Yeah.
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:30.300]   Yeah.
[02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:39.220]   He was the target of a fatwa 1989-ish issued by Aron Zaya Tolohomani over the Satanic versus
[02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:40.220]   provocative.
[02:16:40.220 --> 02:16:44.900]   Yeah, in Iran, everyone else thought it was amazing.
[02:16:44.900 --> 02:16:46.140]   Yeah, it was a really good novel.
[02:16:46.140 --> 02:16:47.140]   I'm just saying.
[02:16:47.140 --> 02:16:49.340]   And it was a novel we should point out.
[02:16:49.340 --> 02:16:50.340]   Yeah.
[02:16:50.340 --> 02:16:54.780]   Again, he's controversial for the Komeni...
[02:16:54.780 --> 02:16:55.780]   Komeni...
[02:16:55.780 --> 02:16:56.780]   I can understand.
[02:16:56.780 --> 02:16:58.620]   It's not exactly ambitious.
[02:16:58.620 --> 02:17:04.620]   He says, "I'm hoping sub-stack might allow a slightly more complex connection and give
[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:09.940]   me the space to talk about things that are just too big to discuss in tweets, which is
[02:17:09.940 --> 02:17:10.940]   pretty much everything."
[02:17:10.940 --> 02:17:11.940]   I think that, yeah.
[02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:12.940]   Yeah.
[02:17:12.940 --> 02:17:13.940]   I think...
[02:17:13.940 --> 02:17:16.620]   Basically, everything except for my bathroom musings.
[02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:17.620]   Yeah.
[02:17:17.620 --> 02:17:18.620]   I think that new technology...
[02:17:18.620 --> 02:17:21.020]   I mean, how long is this atanic versus?
[02:17:21.020 --> 02:17:22.740]   It's not tweet-sized, that's for sure.
[02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:26.820]   I think the new technology always makes possible new art forms, I would agree.
[02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:32.900]   And I think literature has not yet found its new form in this digital age, whatever the
[02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:35.460]   new thing is that's going to arise out of this new world.
[02:17:35.460 --> 02:17:36.620]   I don't think we've seen it yet.
[02:17:36.620 --> 02:17:37.620]   You agree?
[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:38.620]   Yeah.
[02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:39.620]   Jeff?
[02:17:39.620 --> 02:17:40.620]   Yeah.
[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:42.380]   I think it's worthy experiment.
[02:17:42.380 --> 02:17:46.740]   I think that's all true.
[02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:53.060]   I think authors didn't interact with their users because they're re-excusers.
[02:17:53.060 --> 02:17:55.620]   They're re-ears because they couldn't, really.
[02:17:55.620 --> 02:17:57.460]   It was wearing.
[02:17:57.460 --> 02:18:06.900]   And my friend, Paolo Quello, who's the alchemist.
[02:18:06.900 --> 02:18:08.460]   They have the most new-
[02:18:08.460 --> 02:18:09.460]   They have the most new-
[02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:12.580]   Are you friends for real with him?
[02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:15.740]   My daughter reads all his books in Spanish and loves himself.
[02:18:15.740 --> 02:18:21.020]   Well, she went to the Magellan Academy as I've learned from Instagram.
[02:18:21.020 --> 02:18:22.020]   Twitter.
[02:18:22.020 --> 02:18:23.020]   Twitter.
[02:18:23.020 --> 02:18:24.020]   Yes.
[02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:25.020]   Some social site.
[02:18:25.020 --> 02:18:31.460]   It's all the same to me.
[02:18:31.460 --> 02:18:40.860]   So Paolo's a wonderful guy and he kind of, I wrote about this years ago, he pirated his
[02:18:40.860 --> 02:18:46.340]   own books because he wanted to be in other countries and he put his own books up.
[02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:50.820]   I asked him at one point whether he was going to interact with readers while he was writing
[02:18:50.820 --> 02:18:51.820]   a book.
[02:18:51.820 --> 02:18:53.460]   And the first response was, "No, no, no, I can do that."
[02:18:53.460 --> 02:18:55.820]   And then soon enough, sure enough, he did.
[02:18:55.820 --> 02:18:58.580]   He was writing a book about fashion and have characters in fashion.
[02:18:58.580 --> 02:19:02.100]   So he went to his many, many followers and said, "I need some help here.
[02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:06.580]   Who's expert in this?"
[02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:08.780]   And friend, Paolo Quello, too.
[02:19:08.780 --> 02:19:11.460]   Well, I haven't talked on the wild.
[02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:16.140]   I'm talking about the lower third for those of you on audio, John.
[02:19:16.140 --> 02:19:20.500]   And formally one of San Francisco's 100 most eligible match teams.
[02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:21.500]   It says here.
[02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:22.500]   Is that accurate?
[02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:26.020]   It's a city where I was a bum according to Frank Sinatra.
[02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:31.740]   But anyway, Frank Sinatra wasn't dating journalists at the time.
[02:19:31.740 --> 02:19:32.740]   No.
[02:19:32.740 --> 02:19:36.100]   No, because he didn't like them.
[02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:40.500]   Anyway, Paolo then made a movie with his readers.
[02:19:40.500 --> 02:19:44.940]   They made the pieces, they took the characters, he made it with them.
[02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:49.140]   I don't know if it was that good, but I love to see authors experiment like this.
[02:19:49.140 --> 02:19:50.140]   It's great.
[02:19:50.140 --> 02:19:55.500]   I think Sam and Rushdie should do a TikTok musical of the Satanic versus just to drive
[02:19:55.500 --> 02:19:57.580]   and crazy.
[02:19:57.580 --> 02:20:01.420]   All right, all right, all right.
[02:20:01.420 --> 02:20:04.460]   Anything else we should talk about before we get to our picks of the week?
[02:20:04.460 --> 02:20:06.500]   Did I leave anything important out?
[02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:08.220]   There's so much of the rundown.
[02:20:08.220 --> 02:20:10.580]   It's a big, big jam-packed, good.
[02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:11.980]   I put lots of stuff on it.
[02:20:11.980 --> 02:20:12.980]   You did.
[02:20:12.980 --> 02:20:15.300]   And I think you didn't want to talk about the Linux birthday, sir.
[02:20:15.300 --> 02:20:17.740]   I've talked about it already.
[02:20:17.740 --> 02:20:18.740]   Happy birthday.
[02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:25.540]   Linux is 30 years old this week, posting from Linus Tarvalds.
[02:20:25.540 --> 02:20:31.300]   He was a graduate student studying computer science.
[02:20:31.300 --> 02:20:44.340]   He posted it on the news groups, which predate, of course, the internet in 1991.
[02:20:44.340 --> 02:20:46.020]   He was studying as a graduate student.
[02:20:46.020 --> 02:20:53.820]   He was using an operating system, not such a great operating system, called Minix.
[02:20:53.820 --> 02:20:56.900]   He posted a post saying, "What would you like?
[02:20:56.900 --> 02:20:57.900]   I'm writing.
[02:20:57.900 --> 02:20:58.900]   Here it is.
[02:20:58.900 --> 02:21:04.100]   I'm writing my own version of Minix.
[02:21:04.100 --> 02:21:07.780]   I'm just curious, no big deal, what you'd like it to be."
[02:21:07.780 --> 02:21:09.260]   And that, of course, started a revolution.
[02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:13.740]   It is now, I think, it's safe to say, the most widely used operating system in the world,
[02:21:13.740 --> 02:21:18.540]   considering it runs Android phones as well as...
[02:21:18.540 --> 02:21:21.860]   Can I ask you one quick question about a story?
[02:21:21.860 --> 02:21:22.860]   Sure.
[02:21:22.860 --> 02:21:25.180]   Google developing its own CPUs for Chromebooks.
[02:21:25.180 --> 02:21:26.900]   Does that signal to them?
[02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:29.580]   That means that they would make them or they wouldn't sell them to other companies to make
[02:21:29.580 --> 02:21:30.580]   Chromebooks with.
[02:21:30.580 --> 02:21:31.580]   What does that mean?
[02:21:31.580 --> 02:21:36.180]   Well, they're doing their own CPU for the Pixel 6.
[02:21:36.180 --> 02:21:37.180]   But the phones.
[02:21:37.180 --> 02:21:40.940]   Yeah, so they have to have as many places as possible.
[02:21:40.940 --> 02:21:45.620]   So it could be that they would build their own CPU, like their own hardware for the Chromebooks
[02:21:45.620 --> 02:21:46.620]   again.
[02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:50.100]   For other manufacturers or for other...
[02:21:50.100 --> 02:21:55.260]   It won't be a Pixel Box, sir.
[02:21:55.260 --> 02:21:56.740]   I guess they could offer it.
[02:21:56.740 --> 02:21:57.740]   Enjoy.
[02:21:57.740 --> 02:21:58.740]   I have a little hold.
[02:21:58.740 --> 02:21:59.740]   I can't pick the book.
[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:07.740]   This is from a Nikke Asia story, they say in 2023.
[02:22:07.740 --> 02:22:10.500]   I'm talking about the way my machine kept making it.
[02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:13.100]   Yeah, it's a while from now.
[02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:19.220]   The truth about the Pixel 6 Google design, it's really a system on a chip which is mostly
[02:22:19.220 --> 02:22:21.380]   Samsung's Exynos processor.
[02:22:21.380 --> 02:22:28.420]   Samsung will be making it with some machine learning stuff supplied by Google, some TPU
[02:22:28.420 --> 02:22:30.580]   units supplied by Google.
[02:22:30.580 --> 02:22:33.420]   So that's the problem is what does that mean?
[02:22:33.420 --> 02:22:34.420]   Your own CPU.
[02:22:34.420 --> 02:22:35.420]   That's what I was trying to get you to pay.
[02:22:35.420 --> 02:22:36.660]   Because they're saying the Pixel 6 is its own CPU.
[02:22:36.660 --> 02:22:39.020]   Well, it's just a rumor so we don't know.
[02:22:39.020 --> 02:22:40.020]   We just don't know.
[02:22:40.020 --> 02:22:43.260]   I mean, I think you're right, Stacey, if they're going to make it for the phone, they should
[02:22:43.260 --> 02:22:44.420]   make it for everything.
[02:22:44.420 --> 02:22:47.460]   Right, because that's the only way to get scale.
[02:22:47.460 --> 02:22:50.300]   And I'm guessing a manufacturer could put it in.
[02:22:50.300 --> 02:22:54.500]   Because if you're a manufacturer like an Asus or a Lenovo or whatever, you're already
[02:22:54.500 --> 02:22:56.100]   buying your chips from Intel anyway.
[02:22:56.100 --> 02:22:57.180]   It's not like you've got your own.
[02:22:57.180 --> 02:22:58.940]   So you could just buy them from Google.
[02:22:58.940 --> 02:23:03.540]   And these are, you know, their ARM architectures just as they are for the phone.
[02:23:03.540 --> 02:23:04.980]   And there are ARM Pixel books.
[02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:07.820]   I think this is the point is Chromebooks rather.
[02:23:07.820 --> 02:23:11.420]   Chromebooks will run on both Intel and ARM.
[02:23:11.420 --> 02:23:12.660]   Manufacturers use a variety of chips.
[02:23:12.660 --> 02:23:15.780]   They wouldn't have to use Google chips, but it'd be nice if, you know, I'm sure Google
[02:23:15.780 --> 02:23:17.620]   would like to sell them to them.
[02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:20.620]   But they would at least be clear on stuff.
[02:23:20.620 --> 02:23:23.460]   To like deeply integrate it, it actually could be.
[02:23:23.460 --> 02:23:28.100]   It's like, think about what you do with like more power efficiencies tied to the workload
[02:23:28.100 --> 02:23:30.260]   because you'll know what the workload is.
[02:23:30.260 --> 02:23:34.660]   Well, that's what Apple, that's exactly the benefit Apple has from developing its own
[02:23:34.660 --> 02:23:35.660]   silicon.
[02:23:35.660 --> 02:23:37.660]   There's a lot to be set for that.
[02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:38.660]   That would be great.
[02:23:38.660 --> 02:23:39.660]   Yeah, and Google's.
[02:23:39.660 --> 02:23:40.660]   There'd be a reason for them to do it.
[02:23:40.660 --> 02:23:42.940]   Google has the brains and the size and the money to do it.
[02:23:42.940 --> 02:23:43.940]   So you know, why not?
[02:23:43.940 --> 02:23:44.940]   Yeah, I agree.
[02:23:44.940 --> 02:23:46.700]   There's lots of reasons for them to do that.
[02:23:46.700 --> 02:23:47.700]   But don't get excited.
[02:23:47.700 --> 02:23:49.100]   It's going to be a couple of years.
[02:23:49.100 --> 02:23:50.100]   Yeah.
[02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:51.900]   What do you think?
[02:23:51.900 --> 02:23:55.100]   Hey, Jesus, what are you going to sell the CX9?
[02:23:55.100 --> 02:23:57.140]   I want to give you money, a lot of money.
[02:23:57.140 --> 02:24:02.620]   What did, did Craig say which Chromebook he was going to buy for all 22 nephews and
[02:24:02.620 --> 02:24:03.620]   a day?
[02:24:03.620 --> 02:24:04.980]   No, we should have found that out.
[02:24:04.980 --> 02:24:07.540]   I asked him, but I think he dodged it.
[02:24:07.540 --> 02:24:12.540]   Well, he might give one machine to his favorite nephews and aces, another machine to others.
[02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:13.940]   I don't know.
[02:24:13.940 --> 02:24:19.740]   He said he reads Kevin Tofol's about Chromebooks.com.
[02:24:19.740 --> 02:24:20.740]   Yes, he does.
[02:24:20.740 --> 02:24:22.660]   Kevin, what is Kevin like the best these days?
[02:24:22.660 --> 02:24:25.100]   Is it still the Acer?
[02:24:25.100 --> 02:24:26.100]   I think it is.
[02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:27.100]   I don't know.
[02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:28.100]   This is where Kevin was.
[02:24:28.100 --> 02:24:29.100]   I don't know.
[02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:30.100]   I don't say there isn't one size fits all.
[02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:31.100]   Yeah.
[02:24:31.100 --> 02:24:32.100]   But he's.
[02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:34.020]   This is a sore spot between Jeff and Kevin right here.
[02:24:34.020 --> 02:24:35.020]   Yeah.
[02:24:35.020 --> 02:24:37.780]   I just have to be the Thoritarian for you.
[02:24:37.780 --> 02:24:38.780]   He just reviewed.
[02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:45.580]   Just to say, this is appealing the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 with LTE built in.
[02:24:45.580 --> 02:24:46.980]   Oh, Jeff.
[02:24:46.980 --> 02:24:49.260]   And that is a real travel anymore.
[02:24:49.260 --> 02:24:51.460]   So you will someday you will.
[02:24:51.460 --> 02:24:52.460]   So I don't know.
[02:24:52.460 --> 02:24:57.780]   It does add quite a bit to the cost of it to have an LTE LTE radio in there.
[02:24:57.780 --> 02:25:01.460]   But this is he's always liked this particular Chromebook.
[02:25:01.460 --> 02:25:02.460]   I have to.
[02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:03.460]   I do.
[02:25:03.460 --> 02:25:04.460]   It's really nice.
[02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:06.460]   I want the I want the ACCX 9.
[02:25:06.460 --> 02:25:08.460]   That's what I want.
[02:25:08.460 --> 02:25:13.700]   I know that Kevin for what we've joked about this, but building a with his, you know, because
[02:25:13.700 --> 02:25:17.340]   he's doing his computer science degree, he started when he gets to some of the coding
[02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:18.340]   things.
[02:25:18.340 --> 02:25:23.260]   One of his projects is to build a like Q&A service where you answer questions and he
[02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:26.660]   gives you the best computers for you.
[02:25:26.660 --> 02:25:30.220]   So oh, but he's got to build that.
[02:25:30.220 --> 02:25:31.500]   That's not happening right now.
[02:25:31.500 --> 02:25:35.260]   So I should save this for my pick of the week.
[02:25:35.260 --> 02:25:37.460]   Actually, let's do the picks of the week.
[02:25:37.460 --> 02:25:41.060]   By the way, you haven't been doing picks for a long time.
[02:25:41.060 --> 02:25:42.460]   No, no, no, I do.
[02:25:42.460 --> 02:25:49.460]   I always have picks, but I'm sensitive to Stacy's need to keep her blood sugar elevated.
[02:25:49.460 --> 02:25:50.460]   The fact that we've already gone.
[02:25:50.460 --> 02:25:51.460]   I already need a waffle.
[02:25:51.460 --> 02:25:53.140]   We've already gone two and a half hours.
[02:25:53.140 --> 02:25:55.540]   So I and we have there's three of you.
[02:25:55.540 --> 02:26:00.420]   I on a lot of the shows, I just defer my own pick, but I have a pick.
[02:26:00.420 --> 02:26:01.420]   Like the excuse.
[02:26:01.420 --> 02:26:02.420]   Like the excuse.
[02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:04.420]   I'll give you a pick.
[02:26:04.420 --> 02:26:08.740]   And actually I will give you this one this time because I think Kevin probably already
[02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:09.820]   knows about it.
[02:26:09.820 --> 02:26:12.260]   But if he doesn't, he ought to know about it.
[02:26:12.260 --> 02:26:13.500]   Kevin does a lot in Python.
[02:26:13.500 --> 02:26:18.540]   I think he's still doing Python, yes.
[02:26:18.540 --> 02:26:23.260]   Because he probably knows about Python's Jupiter notebooks, which are a really interesting
[02:26:23.260 --> 02:26:27.180]   way to combine pros and code in one thing.
[02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:31.460]   Google has its version of Jupiter notebooks that's free to use.
[02:26:31.460 --> 02:26:35.140]   It has a free Python interpreter built into it.
[02:26:35.140 --> 02:26:37.380]   It's called Colab or Collaboratory.
[02:26:37.380 --> 02:26:39.740]   And it's really, really cool.
[02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:43.620]   Plus, it's a great way to code Python on a Chromebook.
[02:26:43.620 --> 02:26:45.300]   You don't have to install Linux.
[02:26:45.300 --> 02:26:46.980]   You don't have to install Python.
[02:26:46.980 --> 02:26:51.660]   You can literally run Python from your browser.
[02:26:51.660 --> 02:26:54.660]   So I wanted to mention this to anybody who wants to study or learn Python.
[02:26:54.660 --> 02:27:00.340]   I'm a big fan of the notion that the legendary computer scientist Donald Knuth called it
[02:27:00.340 --> 02:27:02.140]   literate programming.
[02:27:02.140 --> 02:27:05.780]   Of the idea that programming should be as much about writing the prose, the description
[02:27:05.780 --> 02:27:08.540]   of the code as it should be the actual code.
[02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:11.900]   And that's kind of what Jupiter notebooks and Colab oratory do.
[02:27:11.900 --> 02:27:17.380]   It allows you, and you get by the way with it, not only Python, but free access to GPUs.
[02:27:17.380 --> 02:27:18.540]   It's easy to share.
[02:27:18.540 --> 02:27:19.540]   It's free.
[02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:21.740]   They have a paid version, but you get machine learning with it.
[02:27:21.740 --> 02:27:25.900]   And you can see on this document right here, there's text.
[02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:26.940]   Looks like a regular website.
[02:27:26.940 --> 02:27:31.580]   But this is Python code, which you could press a button and it will run.
[02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:33.300]   And you'll get the answer right there.
[02:27:33.300 --> 02:27:39.700]   Similarly, you can have larger stuff that does visualizations because that's one of
[02:27:39.700 --> 02:27:44.220]   the things Python is used for and Jupiter is used for is data science.
[02:27:44.220 --> 02:27:47.660]   There's machine learning capabilities.
[02:27:47.660 --> 02:27:50.660]   It's done in Markdown and Python, which is really great.
[02:27:50.660 --> 02:27:55.940]   I think anybody who wants to learn to code or is a Python programmer who is maybe using
[02:27:55.940 --> 02:27:59.540]   Jupiter notebooks, this is Google's version of this.
[02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:03.380]   And one of the things that's cool about it is it saves your notebooks into your Google
[02:28:03.380 --> 02:28:04.380]   drive.
[02:28:04.380 --> 02:28:07.100]   So they're available to you anywhere you go.
[02:28:07.100 --> 02:28:13.020]   So here's a little Colab I kind of made up for the book, Python crash course.
[02:28:13.020 --> 02:28:19.100]   And I'm typing in both text and code, which is cool.
[02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:20.420]   So just there you go.
[02:28:20.420 --> 02:28:22.820]   See I did a pick Colab.
[02:28:22.820 --> 02:28:28.820]   C-O-L-A-B dot research dot Google dot com and it's free.
[02:28:28.820 --> 02:28:32.820]   And you get your own online, you know, GPU and CPU and everything.
[02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:38.220]   I think it's a really neat thing that Google's done and encourages good coding style.
[02:28:38.220 --> 02:28:40.180]   And now it's time for Stacy Higginball.
[02:28:40.180 --> 02:28:41.180]   Things.
[02:28:41.180 --> 02:28:47.860]   I'm going to take a page from Ant this week and recommend that if you can, and if it's
[02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:53.460]   something you feel comfortable with, donate blood, people are dire need of blood right
[02:28:53.460 --> 02:28:54.460]   now.
[02:28:54.460 --> 02:28:59.500]   And I will tell you that I am almost to my five gallon mark.
[02:28:59.500 --> 02:29:00.500]   So very exciting.
[02:29:00.500 --> 02:29:01.500]   All right.
[02:29:01.500 --> 02:29:05.460]   I got my gallon pin and then I stopped because I thought that's more than enough.
[02:29:05.460 --> 02:29:08.420]   So there's frequent flyer clubs and frequent leader clubs?
[02:29:08.420 --> 02:29:11.020]   Yeah, Red Cross gives you a little plastic pin.
[02:29:11.020 --> 02:29:12.660]   Wow, I didn't know that.
[02:29:12.660 --> 02:29:13.660]   Yours is cool.
[02:29:13.660 --> 02:29:14.660]   Oh, nice.
[02:29:14.660 --> 02:29:19.860]   I mean, yeah, the point is that, you know, if you can and it's something you're comfortable
[02:29:19.860 --> 02:29:23.900]   with, it is we always talk about like wanting to do more for people.
[02:29:23.900 --> 02:29:28.020]   This is something that you can do for people in like 40 to 45 minutes.
[02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:29.380]   You can listen to podcasts the whole time.
[02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:31.300]   Don't be scared.
[02:29:31.300 --> 02:29:32.980]   It's very easy to do.
[02:29:32.980 --> 02:29:33.980]   Yeah.
[02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:34.980]   Calm down.
[02:29:34.980 --> 02:29:36.140]   Good call.
[02:29:36.140 --> 02:29:37.820]   People forget about it, but just go.
[02:29:37.820 --> 02:29:40.180]   It's so it's really important.
[02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:41.180]   Okay.
[02:29:41.180 --> 02:29:43.300]   I feel so strongly about this.
[02:29:43.300 --> 02:29:44.300]   Really.
[02:29:44.300 --> 02:29:47.540]   So if you can donate blood, they're really desperate.
[02:29:47.540 --> 02:29:48.740]   How many pines in a gallon?
[02:29:48.740 --> 02:29:50.660]   Change a lot of the rules.
[02:29:50.660 --> 02:29:51.820]   There's eight pines in a gallon.
[02:29:51.820 --> 02:29:54.580]   So you donate a pint at a time, right?
[02:29:54.580 --> 02:29:57.220]   So that means you have donated 40 times.
[02:29:57.220 --> 02:29:58.220]   That's great.
[02:29:58.220 --> 02:29:59.220]   That's really good.
[02:29:59.220 --> 02:30:00.220]   Yeah.
[02:30:00.220 --> 02:30:01.220]   And you can only donate like four times a year.
[02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:02.220]   So I've been at this a long time.
[02:30:02.220 --> 02:30:03.420]   Yeah, you have to do a long time.
[02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:05.940]   This guy has donated 27 gallons.
[02:30:05.940 --> 02:30:09.500]   See your Lord.
[02:30:09.500 --> 02:30:10.500]   Pretty amazing.
[02:30:10.500 --> 02:30:11.500]   Yeah.
[02:30:11.500 --> 02:30:12.500]   I may not make that.
[02:30:12.500 --> 02:30:14.580]   But you can get out there.
[02:30:14.580 --> 02:30:18.140]   It's something easy you can do that really does have a big impact on others.
[02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:19.860]   Very, very cool.
[02:30:19.860 --> 02:30:20.860]   I agree.
[02:30:20.860 --> 02:30:23.940]   And how can they find out where to donate?
[02:30:23.940 --> 02:30:24.940]   Is there a place?
[02:30:24.940 --> 02:30:27.420]   Oh, you know, I go to...
[02:30:27.420 --> 02:30:29.300]   So we have the...
[02:30:29.300 --> 02:30:34.060]   We have the Northwest Bloodworks, but the Red Cross does the donation.
[02:30:34.060 --> 02:30:39.380]   Yeah, if you go to Red Cross.org, they have a Give Blood page that would allow you, if
[02:30:39.380 --> 02:30:43.140]   you allow locations to find a drive near you.
[02:30:43.140 --> 02:30:44.900]   And there are lots of reasons to give.
[02:30:44.900 --> 02:30:45.900]   So you just enter in.
[02:30:45.900 --> 02:30:50.020]   But it's not just the Red Cross, but certainly this is easy to do, I could say.
[02:30:50.020 --> 02:30:54.260]   Well, the Red Cross, I think, organizes all of the local blood banks.
[02:30:54.260 --> 02:30:55.260]   Ah, okay.
[02:30:55.260 --> 02:31:02.180]   So like, I switched blood banks to Bloodworks Northwest, and I used to be at Texas Blood
[02:31:02.180 --> 02:31:03.180]   something.
[02:31:03.180 --> 02:31:08.180]   As long as it's not vampires are us, you're going to be fine.
[02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:12.580]   Well, actually, I don't know how you feel about this, but there are commercial entities
[02:31:12.580 --> 02:31:14.460]   that will pay you for blood.
[02:31:14.460 --> 02:31:16.700]   I kind of prefer to give it to the Red Cross.
[02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:17.700]   Okay.
[02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:18.700]   Yeah.
[02:31:18.700 --> 02:31:24.620]   And then it only takes about 24 hours to recover the fluid you lose when you give blood.
[02:31:24.620 --> 02:31:26.780]   Yeah, they give you a little thin juice.
[02:31:26.780 --> 02:31:28.780]   And a little, you know, cookie.
[02:31:28.780 --> 02:31:29.780]   Cookies.
[02:31:29.780 --> 02:31:30.780]   Cookies.
[02:31:30.780 --> 02:31:31.780]   And chips.
[02:31:31.780 --> 02:31:32.780]   And chips.
[02:31:32.780 --> 02:31:33.780]   I get chips off the top.
[02:31:33.780 --> 02:31:35.900]   And I will tell y'all, I faint.
[02:31:35.900 --> 02:31:37.500]   Like every other time I get blood.
[02:31:37.500 --> 02:31:42.580]   So for me, it's a big deal to like sort of give blood, but you know, I still do it because
[02:31:42.580 --> 02:31:45.420]   it's a, it's really helpful.
[02:31:45.420 --> 02:31:47.500]   So again, not everybody can.
[02:31:47.500 --> 02:31:49.380]   So yeah, no, it's yeah.
[02:31:49.380 --> 02:31:50.620]   Oh, if you can, absolutely.
[02:31:50.620 --> 02:31:51.820]   I think it's a great thing to do.
[02:31:51.820 --> 02:31:52.820]   I agree with you.
[02:31:52.820 --> 02:31:53.820]   100%.
[02:31:53.820 --> 02:31:54.820]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:31:54.820 --> 02:31:55.820]   Jeff Jarvis.
[02:31:55.820 --> 02:31:56.820]   How about a number?
[02:31:56.820 --> 02:31:57.820]   A number please.
[02:31:57.820 --> 02:31:59.820]   Two crazy about my numbers.
[02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:00.820]   Number please.
[02:32:00.820 --> 02:32:03.540]   So I'm going to do not do a number.
[02:32:03.540 --> 02:32:10.220]   I was fascinated by watching a video of composer Hans Zimmer talking about how he samples and
[02:32:10.220 --> 02:32:13.300]   uses the computer as a musical instrument, but I'm not going to make that one.
[02:32:13.300 --> 02:32:14.300]   Oh, we are.
[02:32:14.300 --> 02:32:17.260]   It's artistic time.
[02:32:17.260 --> 02:32:22.340]   I'm going to do the first full image of a new Vermeer uncovered.
[02:32:22.340 --> 02:32:23.340]   What?
[02:32:23.340 --> 02:32:24.340]   Cupen was just released.
[02:32:24.340 --> 02:32:25.340]   What?
[02:32:25.340 --> 02:32:26.340]   It's slightly technology based.
[02:32:26.340 --> 02:32:32.060]   There was a Vermeer of a young woman standing at a window.
[02:32:32.060 --> 02:32:37.020]   And she had a nicely painted white wall behind her.
[02:32:37.020 --> 02:32:40.780]   But then through technology, through X-rays and other things, they saw that there was
[02:32:40.780 --> 02:32:41.780]   another image back there.
[02:32:41.780 --> 02:32:44.460]   And they first presumed the Vermeer didn't like it and painted it over.
[02:32:44.460 --> 02:32:47.300]   They found that the paint over had been done far later.
[02:32:47.300 --> 02:32:49.020]   They could tell by the layer of dust.
[02:32:49.020 --> 02:32:50.020]   That's shocking.
[02:32:50.020 --> 02:32:51.020]   What?
[02:32:51.020 --> 02:32:57.100]   They just, they restored it and got out a picture of a cupid.
[02:32:57.100 --> 02:33:01.100]   And so they're calling it a new Vermeer because it's a Vermeer we never saw before.
[02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:02.700]   It's shocking.
[02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:08.420]   So some prude decided to paint over because Cupid's naked.
[02:33:08.420 --> 02:33:13.620]   Well, because, well, because child porn, you know, that's the original moral panic.
[02:33:13.620 --> 02:33:17.940]   Take that beautiful Vermeer and paint out Cupid.
[02:33:17.940 --> 02:33:18.940]   Wow.
[02:33:18.940 --> 02:33:19.940]   Wow.
[02:33:19.940 --> 02:33:21.740]   I thought that was very cool and a little bit of technology.
[02:33:21.740 --> 02:33:25.380]   There was nothing new to Google moral panic even in the 18th or 17th.
[02:33:25.380 --> 02:33:27.660]   I want to show that I got some clasps.
[02:33:27.660 --> 02:33:29.980]   Yeah, she gets a clasps.
[02:33:29.980 --> 02:33:32.980]   Very cool.
[02:33:32.980 --> 02:33:33.980]   And Mr. Antprew it.
[02:33:33.980 --> 02:33:35.940]   Pick of the week.
[02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:38.140]   Mine are short and sweet again.
[02:33:38.140 --> 02:33:42.220]   Know those NFTs that we talked about of mine on the show before?
[02:33:42.220 --> 02:33:44.700]   Well, two of them have sold.
[02:33:44.700 --> 02:33:45.700]   Congratulations.
[02:33:45.700 --> 02:33:47.540]   It is a sell one for $224,000.
[02:33:47.540 --> 02:33:48.540]   No, it didn't.
[02:33:48.540 --> 02:33:49.540]   That wasn't me.
[02:33:49.540 --> 02:33:50.540]   Okay.
[02:33:50.540 --> 02:33:53.540]   Not the quarter million dollar one.
[02:33:53.540 --> 02:33:54.540]   Okay.
[02:33:54.540 --> 02:33:59.940]   I thought it was pretty funny that one of them sold and it's an interesting thing.
[02:33:59.940 --> 02:34:01.820]   I'm looking piece.
[02:34:01.820 --> 02:34:03.060]   I'll just leave it at that.
[02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:04.140]   It's nice and green.
[02:34:04.140 --> 02:34:05.140]   I'll say that.
[02:34:05.140 --> 02:34:10.460]   And it amazes me that the NFT marketplace, what people are buying and what they're not
[02:34:10.460 --> 02:34:11.460]   buying.
[02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:16.060]   And so putting up this green and yellow NFT in section.
[02:34:16.060 --> 02:34:17.220]   It's actually beautiful.
[02:34:17.220 --> 02:34:18.220]   It goes out the door.
[02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:20.060]   Oh, FOMO Finn is now the owner.
[02:34:20.060 --> 02:34:22.380]   Good job FOMO Finn.
[02:34:22.380 --> 02:34:24.020]   And it goes out the door.
[02:34:24.020 --> 02:34:25.300]   So that's just been fun.
[02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:27.300]   Just trying to figure out what are people interested in.
[02:34:27.300 --> 02:34:28.300]   That's a work art actually.
[02:34:28.300 --> 02:34:29.300]   I could see why they bought that.
[02:34:29.300 --> 02:34:30.300]   That is gorgeous.
[02:34:30.300 --> 02:34:31.300]   That is gorgeous.
[02:34:31.300 --> 02:34:32.300]   Look at that.
[02:34:32.300 --> 02:34:33.300]   Thank you.
[02:34:33.300 --> 02:34:41.540]   And then I want to know where you got it.
[02:34:41.540 --> 02:34:42.820]   I will say it's not mine.
[02:34:42.820 --> 02:34:43.820]   I'll just say that.
[02:34:43.820 --> 02:34:44.820]   Okay.
[02:34:44.820 --> 02:34:45.820]   There you go.
[02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:46.820]   Really?
[02:34:46.820 --> 02:34:47.820]   Is that natural?
[02:34:47.820 --> 02:34:48.820]   Is that how it looks naturally?
[02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:50.740]   No, that's a lot of post processing.
[02:34:50.740 --> 02:34:51.740]   It's beautiful.
[02:34:51.740 --> 02:34:52.740]   Wow.
[02:34:52.740 --> 02:34:55.500]   A lot of post processing.
[02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:58.580]   And then my other picks are more home based.
[02:34:58.580 --> 02:35:03.500]   We just want to shout out to the hardhead who had his first varsity game this week.
[02:35:03.500 --> 02:35:06.140]   And he was stinking it up in the first half.
[02:35:06.140 --> 02:35:07.460]   But look at this interception.
[02:35:07.460 --> 02:35:08.620]   Look at this interception.
[02:35:08.620 --> 02:35:09.620]   Yeah.
[02:35:09.620 --> 02:35:10.620]   He bounced back.
[02:35:10.620 --> 02:35:12.620]   The six baby goes in.
[02:35:12.620 --> 02:35:15.100]   He goes all the way.
[02:35:15.100 --> 02:35:16.300]   I wish he went all the way.
[02:35:16.300 --> 02:35:17.300]   He got close.
[02:35:17.300 --> 02:35:18.300]   Almost.
[02:35:18.300 --> 02:35:19.300]   Almost.
[02:35:19.300 --> 02:35:20.300]   He got close.
[02:35:20.300 --> 02:35:21.740]   But the team was down by two touchdowns in the fourth quarter.
[02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:24.300]   It was a it was a heck of a game.
[02:35:24.300 --> 02:35:29.940]   And everybody fought back and that play right there was part of the charge of swinging the
[02:35:29.940 --> 02:35:32.180]   momentum and they fought back and won my three.
[02:35:32.180 --> 02:35:34.940]   It was a heck of a game.
[02:35:34.940 --> 02:35:38.780]   And lastly, I want to give a shout out to my niece.
[02:35:38.780 --> 02:35:40.380]   This hasn't been public knowledge.
[02:35:40.380 --> 02:35:44.660]   But now my little niece stays with us.
[02:35:44.660 --> 02:35:47.380]   Moved out here to try to give her some better opportunities.
[02:35:47.380 --> 02:35:51.340]   And she's been playing on the JV volleyball team.
[02:35:51.340 --> 02:35:54.660]   And they got there for a swing last night.
[02:35:54.660 --> 02:35:56.620]   So how long has she been in school?
[02:35:56.620 --> 02:35:57.940]   There's a new school for her then.
[02:35:57.940 --> 02:36:00.660]   Not only a new town, but a new school and everything.
[02:36:00.660 --> 02:36:02.740]   How long has she been out here?
[02:36:02.740 --> 02:36:04.260]   She's been just a couple of weeks.
[02:36:04.260 --> 02:36:06.100]   She seems to have adjusted pretty well.
[02:36:06.100 --> 02:36:08.460]   She's playing on the part of the team.
[02:36:08.460 --> 02:36:09.540]   She's serving the ball.
[02:36:09.540 --> 02:36:10.540]   That's awesome.
[02:36:10.540 --> 02:36:14.100]   She she had a she had a nice she's had a nice couple games.
[02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:15.940]   They got their first win last night.
[02:36:15.940 --> 02:36:20.860]   Great way to kind of get into the culture in the in the school and get friends immediately.
[02:36:20.860 --> 02:36:25.740]   She's going to team and and you dig her because she likes she likes the raspberry pot.
[02:36:25.740 --> 02:36:29.180]   Volley ball pun and dick and all that.
[02:36:29.180 --> 02:36:31.180]   Digger.
[02:36:31.180 --> 02:36:32.180]   Bigger.
[02:36:32.180 --> 02:36:33.380]   Former volleyball player here.
[02:36:33.380 --> 02:36:35.180]   I appreciate it.
[02:36:35.180 --> 02:36:37.660]   I believe she said she had seven aces last night.
[02:36:37.660 --> 02:36:39.260]   I think Stacy was nice.
[02:36:39.260 --> 02:36:40.260]   Was a spike.
[02:36:40.260 --> 02:36:42.460]   I didn't get the watcher on a sink in myself.
[02:36:42.460 --> 02:36:44.060]   I was a spiker.
[02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:45.060]   Yeah.
[02:36:45.060 --> 02:36:46.060]   Yeah.
[02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:47.060]   You got the height.
[02:36:47.060 --> 02:36:48.060]   You get right over that.
[02:36:48.060 --> 02:36:49.060]   I was up at the net.
[02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:50.060]   I'll put over that net.
[02:36:50.060 --> 02:36:51.140]   Let the other people dig.
[02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:52.140]   You're going to spike.
[02:36:52.140 --> 02:36:57.020]   But you got one hard hit out the door and now are nieces.
[02:36:57.020 --> 02:36:58.020]   That's nice.
[02:36:58.020 --> 02:36:59.020]   Congratulations.
[02:36:59.020 --> 02:37:00.020]   I think that's really wonderful.
[02:37:00.020 --> 02:37:01.020]   She like it out here.
[02:37:01.020 --> 02:37:02.020]   She's only been here a little while.
[02:37:02.020 --> 02:37:04.020]   Oh, she's quite happy.
[02:37:04.020 --> 02:37:05.660]   She's really enjoying herself.
[02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:07.420]   I'm happy for and happy for her.
[02:37:07.420 --> 02:37:10.460]   We're going to get the whole pruit clan out here eventually.
[02:37:10.460 --> 02:37:13.180]   We're just going to get everybody to move out here.
[02:37:13.180 --> 02:37:14.180]   That's nice.
[02:37:14.180 --> 02:37:15.340]   It's great over here.
[02:37:15.340 --> 02:37:16.340]   Yeah.
[02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:17.340]   Thank you.
[02:37:17.340 --> 02:37:18.340]   Thank you.
[02:37:18.340 --> 02:37:20.180]   You got a host of Hands On Photography.
[02:37:20.180 --> 02:37:23.380]   You got something interesting coming up?
[02:37:23.380 --> 02:37:29.660]   Well, this week I am going to share my thoughts on Glass.Photo on the show.
[02:37:29.660 --> 02:37:34.860]   That's the photo sharing app that is supposed to be competing with Instagram.
[02:37:34.860 --> 02:37:36.100]   And I have my opinions on it.
[02:37:36.100 --> 02:37:38.260]   They haven't tried me to get a biopillow yet.
[02:37:38.260 --> 02:37:39.500]   I like it that.
[02:37:39.500 --> 02:37:42.500]   It's an interesting app.
[02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:43.500]   I'll say that.
[02:37:43.500 --> 02:37:44.820]   And then I did a little bit of feedback.
[02:37:44.820 --> 02:37:46.980]   I got some feedback from our listeners.
[02:37:46.980 --> 02:37:48.340]   I'm going to share that on the air.
[02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:49.580]   It's going to be a fun show.
[02:37:49.580 --> 02:37:50.580]   Good.
[02:37:50.580 --> 02:37:51.580]   Good, good, good.
[02:37:51.580 --> 02:37:52.580]   Always, always exciting.
[02:37:52.580 --> 02:37:56.340]   Hands on photography to it.tv/hop.

[02:37:59.860 --> 02:38:02.060]   Go there now.

[02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:04.220]   Oh, I have an event.
[02:38:04.220 --> 02:38:07.140]   Sign up for an event.
[02:38:07.140 --> 02:38:08.700]   This is my first event since last year.
[02:38:08.700 --> 02:38:10.260]   I was so burnt out last year.
[02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:11.260]   Okay.
[02:38:11.260 --> 02:38:12.260]   It's all in a RF sensing.
[02:38:12.260 --> 02:38:16.100]   So if you are one of those like super nerds who want to understand like Wi-Fi sensing or
[02:38:16.100 --> 02:38:22.460]   LiDAR or you're building robots and you want to understand Google Soli or Ultra Wideband
[02:38:22.460 --> 02:38:26.300]   for use in products, I have the nerdiest nerds who are going to come on and talk about
[02:38:26.300 --> 02:38:27.300]   this.
[02:38:27.300 --> 02:38:29.580]   And it's going to be awesome September 21st.

[02:38:42.500 --> 02:38:43.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:38:43.500 --> 02:38:44.500]   Yeah, yeah.

[02:38:45.500 --> 02:38:46.500]   It's just me.
[02:38:46.500 --> 02:38:50.500]   And I had to do this show so I couldn't finish all of my stuff in time.
[02:38:50.500 --> 02:38:51.500]   But I'm here.
[02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:55.500]   So I'm just telling people go to the front page, Stacey and IOT.com and you can register
[02:38:55.500 --> 02:38:56.500]   for the event.

[02:38:57.500 --> 02:38:58.500]   Yeah.
[02:38:58.500 --> 02:39:01.620]   And it'll be on the events page like as soon as I get off this, I can finish doing that.
[02:39:01.620 --> 02:39:06.020]   And Stacey does a wonderful IOT podcast as well with Kevin Tofel.
[02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:08.180]   And you can listen to it and subscribe there as well.
[02:39:08.180 --> 02:39:10.380]   Stacey on IOT.com.
[02:39:10.380 --> 02:39:14.060]   Jeff Jarvis, I'm scared to sing this, but I'm going to do it anyway.
[02:39:14.060 --> 02:39:19.380]   He's the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the...
[02:39:19.380 --> 02:39:20.380]   Great.
[02:39:20.380 --> 02:39:21.380]   Great.
[02:39:21.380 --> 02:39:22.380]   Great.
[02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:23.380]   Good morning.
[02:39:23.380 --> 02:39:26.100]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:39:26.100 --> 02:39:28.340]   Oh, he's tired of us.
[02:39:28.340 --> 02:39:29.340]   Ah!
[02:39:29.340 --> 02:39:31.340]   We got Stacey instead.
[02:39:31.340 --> 02:39:33.420]   Stacey's not noticing it again.
[02:39:33.420 --> 02:39:34.420]   She doesn't notice.
[02:39:34.420 --> 02:39:38.420]   What are you doing Stacey?
[02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:39.420]   You on Twitter?
[02:39:39.420 --> 02:39:42.580]   I'm answering questions about blood donation on the Discord.
[02:39:42.580 --> 02:39:45.860]   And your little dog too.
[02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:47.300]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[02:39:47.300 --> 02:39:48.700]   Thank you Craig for joining us.
[02:39:48.700 --> 02:39:49.700]   Thank you Craig.
[02:39:49.700 --> 02:39:50.700]   Newmark was great to have him.
[02:39:50.700 --> 02:39:51.700]   Yes, thank you.
[02:39:51.700 --> 02:39:55.460]   I ended up buying a microphone before the show even started.
[02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:58.700]   You'll find Craig's philanthropies of course.
[02:39:58.700 --> 02:40:00.060]   We should give him a plug for that.
[02:40:00.060 --> 02:40:02.500]   Is it Craig, Newmark, Philanthropies?
[02:40:02.500 --> 02:40:03.940]   I have to type it in.
[02:40:03.940 --> 02:40:04.940]   I'm leaving so.
[02:40:04.940 --> 02:40:05.940]   That's correct.
[02:40:05.940 --> 02:40:06.940]   .org.
[02:40:06.940 --> 02:40:07.940]   Let's get that right.
[02:40:07.940 --> 02:40:09.940]   Craig, Newmark, philanthropies.org.
[02:40:09.940 --> 02:40:13.220]   There's the cute little Craig himself.
[02:40:13.220 --> 02:40:14.220]   Oh, so precious.
[02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:19.940]   You don't want a picture of you.
[02:40:19.940 --> 02:40:20.940]   He's almost 70.
[02:40:20.940 --> 02:40:21.940]   What the heck?
[02:40:21.940 --> 02:40:23.940]   He doesn't like, he's a 12-year-old.
[02:40:23.940 --> 02:40:24.940]   No, he's not.
[02:40:24.940 --> 02:40:25.940]   He's 68.
[02:40:25.940 --> 02:40:27.940]   Don't rush to death.
[02:40:27.940 --> 02:40:29.620]   Dev's taken that personally.
[02:40:29.620 --> 02:40:31.540]   All right, so he's 63.
[02:40:31.540 --> 02:40:33.740]   You know, the whole phrase is blunt.
[02:40:33.740 --> 02:40:34.740]   Don't crack.
[02:40:34.740 --> 02:40:36.060]   He's getting pretty close to it.
[02:40:36.060 --> 02:40:38.580]   He looks like he's like 15 in this picture.
[02:40:38.580 --> 02:40:41.420]   He looks good.
[02:40:41.420 --> 02:40:43.860]   He looks like a British chimney sweep in that picture.
[02:40:43.860 --> 02:40:45.860]   Oh, hello, Harry.
[02:40:45.860 --> 02:40:47.860]   Chimney chimney chimney chimney.
[02:40:47.860 --> 02:40:48.860]   I'm Craig.
[02:40:48.860 --> 02:40:53.220]   I'm just like that one friend of the two.
[02:40:53.220 --> 02:40:57.180]   And journalists too.
[02:40:57.180 --> 02:41:02.140]   We do the show every Wednesday, 2 p.m. Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern 2100 UTC.
[02:41:02.140 --> 02:41:03.140]   Come on by.
[02:41:03.140 --> 02:41:04.140]   Watch us do it.
[02:41:04.140 --> 02:41:05.140]   Twitter.tv/live.
[02:41:05.140 --> 02:41:06.500]   Live audio and video streams there.
[02:41:06.500 --> 02:41:10.940]   If you're watching live chat live with us at IRC.tuit.tv.
[02:41:10.940 --> 02:41:15.460]   Of course, if you're a member of the club twit, you can also chat in our Discord.
[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:17.980]   Watch the video or chat in the text chat.
[02:41:17.980 --> 02:41:19.780]   We've got both going on.
[02:41:19.780 --> 02:41:27.060]   And of course, they are masters in the chat of the animated GIF and also flirting with
[02:41:27.060 --> 02:41:28.420]   Stacey apparently.
[02:41:28.420 --> 02:41:29.420]   Okay.
[02:41:29.420 --> 02:41:30.420]   Wait, what?
[02:41:30.420 --> 02:41:36.020]   I'm just saying, Tim, the Enchander loves you.
[02:41:36.020 --> 02:41:38.620]   And we're talking about blood-drote donations.
[02:41:38.620 --> 02:41:39.620]   Oh, okay.
[02:41:39.620 --> 02:41:40.620]   I don't think they're flirting.
[02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:41.620]   Okay.
[02:41:41.620 --> 02:41:43.140]   That's my least flirting topic.
[02:41:43.140 --> 02:41:49.020]   I do like Professor Panda Bear though, because he sent my wife not one but two hats.
[02:41:49.020 --> 02:41:50.540]   Thank you, Professor Panda Bear.
[02:41:50.540 --> 02:41:52.380]   And thanks to all of our club twit members.
[02:41:52.380 --> 02:41:53.620]   We really appreciate your support.

[02:41:58.020 --> 02:42:03.460]   Aet said, and also the Twit Plus fee, twit.tv/club-twit.
[02:42:03.460 --> 02:42:06.980]   And to me, versions of the show available, twit.tv/twig.

[02:42:09.580 --> 02:42:14.300]   There's an YouTube channel with all the versions, all the shows this week in Google
[02:42:14.300 --> 02:42:15.860]   shows.
[02:42:15.860 --> 02:42:18.140]   I think that's pretty much about it.
[02:42:18.140 --> 02:42:19.700]   Have a wonderful week.
[02:42:19.700 --> 02:42:23.580]   Everybody will see you right back here next Wednesday on this week in Google.
[02:42:23.580 --> 02:42:24.740]   Bye bye.
[02:42:24.740 --> 02:42:32.380]   I'm wearing the same shirt in our little, oh, that's fantastic.
[02:42:32.380 --> 02:42:35.580]   Android is constantly evolving.
[02:42:35.580 --> 02:42:40.140]   And if you're part of the Android faithful, then you'll be just as excited about it as
[02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:41.140]   I am.
[02:42:41.140 --> 02:42:44.940]   I'm Jason Howell, host of All About Android, along with my co-hosts, Florence Ion, and
[02:42:44.940 --> 02:42:49.740]   Ron Richards, where every week we cover the news, we cover the hardware, and we cover
[02:42:49.740 --> 02:42:52.940]   the apps that are driving the Android ecosystem.
[02:42:52.940 --> 02:42:57.700]   Plus, we invite people who are writing about Android, talking about Android, and making
[02:42:57.700 --> 02:42:59.900]   Android onto the show.
[02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:01.780]   Happy Tuesday at twit.tv.
[02:43:01.780 --> 02:43:03.100]   Look for All About Android.
[02:43:03.100 --> 02:43:13.100]   [upbeat music]
