[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.400]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, the show we cover the latest news from the Googleverse
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:33.400]   with Mr. Jeff Jarvis, Craig, townite, Craig, professor of journalism at the
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.400]   University of Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism and the Townite Center for
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.400]   Edith Prennoreal Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.400]   I got him in the way we're white-haired people.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.400]   And thank you, Craig Newmark, for giving them a lot of money so Jeff could do his job.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.400]   Is that a chair? Do you have a chair?
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.400]   That I'm sitting on, yes.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.400]   Oh, no, I mean.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   No, he's the Craig Newmark chair of something.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.400]   Oh, do I have a chair?
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.400]   Oh, no, the Townite chair.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.400]   I have the Leonard Tao chair.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.400]   That is the Northern Journalism Innovation.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.400]   He's sitting in the chair, the Leonard Tao endowed at the Craig Newmark Endowed.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.400]   The Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   In the Townite Center, which I direct at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   the City University of New York.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   He's a big shot.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   Former TV Guide Critic as well.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   Which we say, just to cut him down, a few pegs, so he doesn't get a big head.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:35.400]   Also, Stacey Higginbotham Pagehand, who is our IoT guru, our chip Maven.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   She is at Stacey.IT.com and does the IoT podcast with Kevin Tofol.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   You can find that there.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   Hello, Stacey.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.400]   Is there a feminine form of guru?
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   Was there?
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   That's why I said Maven.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   Well, Maven, guru, I accept guru.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   I don't know.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.400]   I'm sure it's whether they're used to the gender, like a guru at.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   That's really correct.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   No, please do not call me A.S.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   A guru at would be terrible.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   That would be a guru at.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   Although, gurus tend to abuse their followers and be problematic.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   True.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   So maybe I don't want to be a guru.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   You could be a shaman.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   I don't think I spoke enough or drink any weird tees.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.400]   That's okay.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   And I'm definitely not into sweat logic.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   You don't find people on the show you didn't see this before the show.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   She snacks weird.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   That's not weird.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   I know it's not weird.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   That's not weird.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.400]   It's healthy protein.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   It's a chicken for a snack.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   A snack is an excuse to have something that you shouldn't have.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   I had two peanut butter cookies.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.400]   Oh, that's a snack.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.400]   Oh, Lisa ordered Internet pretzels today.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   We got our Internet pretzels.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   What are Internet pretzels?
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   I don't know.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   But I've never bought an Internet pretzels on the Internet.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   But apparently that's what we do these days.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   That's our new thing.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   When I lived in South Jersey, did you know that besides being able to get milk delivered,
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.400]   you could get pretzels and chips delivered?
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   Well, there's a story behind that.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   Charlie's chips, right?
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400]   We used to have a milkman too in Providence.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.400]   We still do.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.400]   My mom has one in Cranston.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   Really?
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   Oh, we have one on Bainbridge.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   Yeah, I bet you do.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   But what happened is it got less and less lucrative merely to bring milk, cheese, and butter.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   So they started adding products.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   And I remember in Rhode Island, they started adding milk shampoo and milk conditioner.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   And you know, you just got to kind of, if you're going to deliver stuff, you got to expand true to the brand.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   So I do.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   This reminds me of the Schitt's Creek episode where he's like, he's got body milk in his store and everyone keeps coming up to him.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   And they're like, can you drink this?
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.400]   And he's like, it's body milk.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   It says so on the thing.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.400]   So, Todd, can you drink it?
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   Yeah, that's not answer the question.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.400]   Can you drink?
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.400]   You can't drink it.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   No, the answer is no, because it's body milk, not drinking, not throat milk.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.400]   Okay.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.400]   Okay.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   Okay.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.400]   Okay.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.400]   All right.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.400]   Okay.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.400]   Okay.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   Episode today, five, five, six.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   And there are never ending quests to find stories to talk about.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.400]   Because as you know, times have changed and there's not a lot of news, but there is some Google news.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.400]   Google is, according to the Verge, working on its own debit card.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.400]   Now, the weird thing is Google used to have a credit card.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   I remember getting it.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.400]   And they stopped it.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.400]   Yes.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.400]   I did too.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   So Google, this is short-sighted from Hyam Gartenberg.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   They're coming back, although it wasn't a debit card.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   And I guess the Apple card, which is Goldman Sachs bank.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   Yes, fancy.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.400]   Which is weird.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   Fancy.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.400]   I don't know.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.400]   I don't know.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.400]   Don't you have to have a certain credit rating to get it?
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   No.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.400]   Well, and wasn't there a big kerfuffle around men getting it and women not getting it?
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.400]   A couple of people, Steve Wozniak and David Heiner Meier-Hanson, who created Ruby on Rails,
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:20.400]   two well-known geek icons, both said, "I got a much better credit limit than my wife, who has my same finances, because she's my wife."
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.400]   But anyway, Apple says, "Yeah, well, we talked about this.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.400]   The ways of the credit score are varied and mysterious."
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.400]   But Apple said, "Okay, we'll fix that."
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   You know, Lisa got a better credit limit than I did on mine.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.400]   Well, some of that's not surprising.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.400]   So it's probably just based on your credit.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.400]   I mean, like I better credit.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.400]   It's personal credit, I would guess.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   Yes, exactly.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.400]   And if you're Steve Wozniak.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.400]   She's not buying the $1,600 thermomics.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.400]   Exactly.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.400]   Exactly.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.400]   Google wants to do a Google branded smart debit card.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.400]   You know, actually the Apple card, which I've had for a while, works quite well.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.400]   You get cash back.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:09.400]   The nice thing is it's tied to the watch, which is kind of something I guess Google still has Android Wear, but does anybody wear Android Wear?
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.400]   But the idea of it...
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.400]   But they might close Fitbit eventually.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.400]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.400]   And then Fitbit does have pay in it.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:25.400]   So nowadays, not touching money or credit cards, but contactless payment at the grocery store, if you have to go, is to be...
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.400]   Embraced.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.400]   So maybe this is a COVID thing.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.400]   I don't know.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.400]   I came today to do our maintenance on the...
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.400]   I think it's a data thing.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   Yeah, I think it's a data thing.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.400]   You're right.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.400]   So you can get a lot of information.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:46.400]   And like Facebook even has deals with credit card companies to say, "Hey, what are people buying?"
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.400]   And they...
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.400]   So I think Google's like, "Oh, I would love to know."
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   And about tying that back possibly into advertisements, you could actually say, "Hey, this person is buying the phone."
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.400]   And say, "Hey, this person saw this ad here."
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   They already do that.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   They already do that.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   Well, yeah.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   But so they have Google Pay, just like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.400]   But normally those work by you attach your existing credit cards to it.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   So what's different about Apple's credit card is you can use that as your primary payment.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.400]   Apple's is the actual charge card.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.400]   It's a credit card.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.400]   You rack up a bill, you pay it in the month.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.400]   The Google supposedly, according to the Verge, is a debit card.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   They're going to partner with Citi, Stanford Federal Credit Union.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.400]   It's a visa, but most debit cards are either a visa or a master card.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:37.400]   But it will take it right out of your bank account as opposed to adding up the charges till the end of the month.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   It will do virtual card numbers.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:47.400]   That's one of the real selling points on the Apple credit card is that the merchant doesn't get any information about you.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.400]   They don't even get your credit card number.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.400]   They get a token and they don't get your address, your real name or any of that stuff.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.400]   And of course, merchants hate that.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.400]   Google apparently wants to do the same thing, but you know who gets the information?
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.400]   Apple and Google, in Google's case.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.400]   So it's not like they're giving up any information.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   Customers will be able to use the Google Pay app to lock their card in the event of theft or loss, according to the Verge or lock the account entirely.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.400]   Google's app reportedly, and there is a picture of the app.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:24.400]   The app's leak is pretty well sourced will reportedly allow customers to easily track purchases using Google Maps and its database of retailers.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.400]   Would you get a Google debit card or not?
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.400]   I don't like debit cards.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   Why not?
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.400]   Because I don't like having a pin number.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.400]   Right.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.400]   It's the stupidest reason.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.400]   Right.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.400]   Some people don't like it because--
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.400]   I think that's a card of cards in full, so I'm like, oh, it's just that's like a debit card then, right?
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:52.400]   The rules protecting you, I seem to remember with debit cards, are not as strict as with credit cards, right?
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.400]   So in theory, you can get financially hurt more by a debit card.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   Although most banks voluntarily limit your liability with a debit card, I think.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   I don't know.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.400]   I don't mind a debit card.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   In fact, I kind of like it because I know it's going to come right out of my bank account and I'm not going to have to--
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.400]   but I do.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.400]   I pay off my credit cards, too.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   So, yeah.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:21.400]   The apple card I do use, I like it partly because it changes color depending on what you buy.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.400]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.400]   Talk about gaming, gamifying something.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   When you buy something with your apple card, if it's a grocery store, it's brown, if it's electronics, it's blue, so you get this nice rainbow.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.400]   Didn't you know what you just bought?
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   It's just a gaming thing, gamify thing.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   That's all.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400]   It doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.400]   Let me see if I can open my wallet and show you what color-- what color is your apple card?
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.400]   That could be a novel.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.400]   It changes color like--
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.400]   Mine looks like it's slightly stained.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   Can you show my-- over the shoulder shot, Jeff?
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.400]   No, you don't want it.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.400]   Is your number on there?
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.400]   No.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.400]   No, of course not.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.400]   It's an apple card.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.400]   So, you see, it looks like a little halo.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   But if I were to buy something at Apple, there'd be another color in there.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   And then when you pay it off, it gets white again.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.400]   That's utterly useless.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.400]   No, it's not.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.400]   It makes me want to buy stuff from different places so I can get prettier--
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   And he's telling us about it and other people like, "That's fine.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.400]   I'm totally going to go get an apple card."
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.400]   It's good.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.400]   And you get 1%, 2% or 3% back, depending on where you buy it.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.400]   Although, I think Apple is getting more generous with the cash back during COVID.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.400]   I think they're giving me--
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.400]   Do you--
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.400]   Is it at the Apple store?
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.400]   Yes, you get most if you buy it from Apple, yes.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:49.400]   So, since the stuff I buy from Apple tends to be high ticket items because Apple doesn't
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.400]   sell no cheap stuff.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.400]   Do you get some--
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   You get 3% off your Apple stuff.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.400]   I'm pretty sure I got a case there for under $40 once.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.400]   You get 3% off a thing that has a markup of about 80%.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.400]   Well, you know, why do you think they do that?
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.400]   Hey, do you have some-- are you a socialist?
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.400]   Apple's making some--
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.400]   Oh, I've never more, ever more, yes.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:22.400]   Yeah, nowadays, we're all maybe attending in a little of that direction.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:30.880]   Google says it's now displaying information for over 2,000 COVID-19 testing centers across
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.400]   43 states.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.400]   Not that you can go, but--
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:41.160]   Yeah, I saw that on the press conference, the president was showing a map of Maryland
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.360]   and how there was all these testing centers and saying, "I don't know why the governor
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.400]   had to buy tests from South Korea.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   Look at all these testing centers."
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.400]   Maybe it was--
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.800]   The cruelest part-- well, not that there's many cruel things, especially if you're African-American
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.920]   and Latino or disabled in this country.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.280]   But the testing world alone, the cruelest thing is making people--
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.280]   who are sick-- stay overnight in their car so they can get tested for disease.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.280]   It's a lie in that long.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.280]   You have to sleep in your car to get into a lot of places.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.280]   One place as it is.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.280]   Wow, yeah.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.280]   Especially in hard-hit areas.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:20.800]   In a sensible world, you'd call your doctor, and the doctor would say, "Oh, those symptoms,
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.280]   you need to come in right away and we'll test you."
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.280]   That's not how it works.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.280]   That's not how it works.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.280]   That's not how it works.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.280]   That's not how it works.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.280]   So in Boston, there's an app.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.080]   You go on, you put your symptoms in, and you can get an appointment.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.080]   That makes sense.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.080]   Yeah, Massachusetts is showing--
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.080]   You have to wait in the months.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:42.080]   Massachusetts is also hiring contact tracers, so they're ahead in a lot of things.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:47.320]   Verily, Google's sister company is offering free tests to people in parts of California,
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.880]   New Jersey, and New York, and Pennsylvania.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.480]   But you have to take an online screening, a symptom screening.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.760]   We are not close to the-- although in some areas, I guess you can get a test.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.760]   Anybody can get a test.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:05.040]   Most of the time right now, you get tested if you have symptoms, right?
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.040]   You know what I got?
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.840]   Which is illogical in and of itself, because what you're going to have to do to open up
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.840]   again--
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.840]   Eventually, yes.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.840]   --is you're going to have to trust those prices.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.840]   You don't know how to the disease.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.840]   That's right, because of the asymptomatic component.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.080]   Well, A.A. and pre-symptomatic, both.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:24.480]   My doctors and my Twitter list are very careful to distinguish between the two.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.200]   Asymptomatic means you go through the whole disease with no symptoms at all.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.920]   And that's the status to how prevalent that is, if at all.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   Right.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.120]   Pre-symptomatic is that you're contagious through three days before you start starting
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.120]   symptoms.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.120]   Right.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.120]   Oh, it could be up to a week, right?
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.680]   And that's not unusual.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.680]   That's their number of illnesses that that's the case.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.160]   That's not an unusual thing.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.320]   It's a pretty long incubation period.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.520]   It causes your health.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.520]   Where you're heading to the virus.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.320]   Because you're communicative, but you don't know you are, and you're walking around and
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.520]   all that.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.880]   That's why we are all staying home, right?
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.880]   Communicable.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.880]   Yes.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.480]   That's why we're all staying home.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.920]   I'm so tired of staying home.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.320]   Are you?
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.960]   Where would you go?
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.960]   Because you work at home, right?
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.960]   Right.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.840]   Well, like I, you know, at least twice a week, I would go work with a friend at a coffee
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.840]   shop.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.840]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.280]   Oh, just for an hour or two.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.280]   Oh, that's so exciting.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.280]   It's over.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.280]   Gone.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.280]   Life has changed.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.280]   Actually, do you have...
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.440]   What will we ever be able to do that?
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.640]   I look at now and watch Maxine.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.960]   If we get a vaccine.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.960]   If we do.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.960]   I watch...
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.960]   If we do.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.960]   And it's an if.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.960]   It is an if.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.400]   We don't have vaccines for HIV or colds or a lot of things.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.800]   I watch movies and I see people doing normal, what we used to do.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.800]   Yeah, I know.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.280]   I look at that on the screen and I look at it.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.520]   Hey, guys, separate.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.520]   You could get...
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.880]   It's so funny how quickly that gets in your mind, isn't it?
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.880]   It is.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.400]   Our dean is figuring out how to do social distancing at the school.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.400]   Right.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.400]   Right.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.960]   If some people start coming back at some point.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.600]   I think it's hard to imagine.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.760]   They're about to reopen last phase.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.600]   Have you seen the six foot office?
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.880]   The six foot office.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.880]   No.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.880]   It is by...
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.880]   Is it Gensler?
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.880]   I think?
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.880]   Hold on.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:08.880]   Here it is.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.880]   I've got it.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.880]   I'll put it up.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.880]   You found it?
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.880]   Yep.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   It's an architectural firm.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.880]   But what they did...
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.880]   Cushman Wakefield.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.880]   Oh, Cushman Wakefield, sorry.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.880]   That's a developer.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.880]   Yeah, developer.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.880]   So it consists of a six foot quick scan.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.120]   So they have a video.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.120]   Oh, okay.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.120]   Here.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.560]   I've got a video to learn more about, is this going to be our future office workspace?
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.560]   Hello.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.320]   Well, some parts of it are.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.760]   It does look like billions, doesn't it?
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.040]   Yeah, it's a fancy office.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.280]   I have a lot of questions about this intro segment.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.760]   Oh, looks just like billions.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.200]   With the ambition to get the world safer and sooner, Beckettburg.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.000]   So you enter, you do a little purification.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.560]   You get a little Purell shot.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.920]   Just like a cruise ship.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.920]   You walk down a complete...
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:51.920]   Oh, look.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.920]   Did you see their lines on the few ways?
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.920]   Yeah, their lines are going to tell them.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.600]   Six hours to get one person on an elevator.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   Okay, nobody can go in with you.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   Okay.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.560]   Is at the center of what's next.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.640]   So you have to step on that circle.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.400]   There's a circle in the elevator.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.720]   Stick to the rules.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.720]   Follow the signs.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.640]   Welcome to our new fascist state.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.120]   Right?
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.120]   One way only.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.760]   Take your piece of paper, bring it to your workplace.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.760]   Oh my.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.760]   Do you have to...
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.760]   What is the piece of...
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   Oh, the piece of paper goes under your computer.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.760]   Yeah, it's your hot-desking kind of thing.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.520]   So this is really interesting.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.520]   The carpet.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.440]   You'll see it in the video in a second.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.440]   Walk the off...
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.440]   Wait a minute.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.440]   Do you see it?
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.440]   One of our new rules.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.440]   You only walk one direction.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.160]   You can only walk clockwise.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.240]   What does it even look like to walk...
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.240]   That's so you don't...
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.240]   Oh, I guess.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.840]   Those two women were a lot closer than six feet.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.640]   Yeah, but they're not facing each other.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.640]   Oh, but they have a place in there.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.640]   They're far apart.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.120]   They're six feet apart.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.160]   And then these circles in the video...
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.160]   Underneath...
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.160]   It's a carpet.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.160]   That's not six feet.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.160]   I know six feet.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.760]   But there was a plastic barrier to between them.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.360]   Well, yeah, yeah, like air doesn't go over it.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.360]   Hi there.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.960]   Enter meeting rooms as indicated.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.800]   This is such a dystopian future.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.800]   This is out of a cushion in which you'll never...
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.800]   Oh, I thought I shared that.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.800]   Never lens.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.800]   So the Netherlands, they don't mind.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.800]   Okay, say that you put your...
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.080]   What's the point of the piece of paper?
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.080]   I don't get it.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.160]   To isolate you from this desk.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.000]   Yeah, so you don't put your stuff on the...
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   desk.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   This is terrifying.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   This is terrifying.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   So your keyboard goes spritzing around all the time.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Why do they have couches?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   There's no point in having a couch.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   But one person could sit on it.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   But yeah, so there's the office of the future.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.480]   And I would add to that, if you want to get really crazy, what's going to happen is you're
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.240]   going to have cameras places.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.240]   You might even have badges like Estimote.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.960]   I don't know if you saw, they have Bluetooth beacon badges now that for industrial workers,
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.640]   but you could put it on an office.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:00.200]   You wear this on your lanyard or as a thing around your neck.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.080]   And it'll beep whenever another person...
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.880]   Another beacon gets within six feet of you.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.200]   So basically, someone...
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.200]   Everyone has these.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:13.160]   And so as you're walking around, if people get within your space bubble, you'll hear beep,
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.080]   beep, beep, beep, beep.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.720]   And theirs will go beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.960]   And you'll be all like, ah, get away.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.920]   So my question, I have a couple of questions.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.960]   First of all, we have been surprisingly compliant, right?
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:31.440]   I would have thought, especially in our individual, like, the United States of America, there
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.840]   would be more people saying, "No, I ain't going to do that."
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.840]   But people have been...
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.280]   You walk down the streets of Petal in the middle.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.920]   The nuts are very small and numbers.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.560]   They're way too much coverage.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.560]   But there's nothing else to talk about.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.600]   TV has to do something.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:49.200]   So we're pretty compliant.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.760]   And I think that we might even do this.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.160]   The problem is, I think it gets in your head.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.880]   And pretty soon, you become a germaphobe.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.880]   Like you don't...
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:06.000]   Like if then the all clear sounds, you say, "But I'm still going to go clockwise in my
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.440]   office and put a piece of paper down because it's safe.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.440]   It's healthy."
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.720]   So I don't think...
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.800]   Here's the thing, even though we've been compliant, I feel like people are going to go, "No, I'm
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.920]   just going to get it."
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.560]   And if old people die, well, it's time.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.320]   Do you think people are just going to rebel and say, "Screw it."
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.320]   This is too much.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.080]   Only if you're Las Vegas.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.080]   That's about...
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.560]   And I mentioned that's about to happen in Las Vegas.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.920]   They want to, I think, May 1st, they want to reopen.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.520]   What do you only walk counterclockwise in the casino?
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.520]   Gamblers will love that.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.520]   They're already compulsive.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.400]   Gamblers will go, "Sure.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.400]   If it improves my chances of winning, I'll do anything."
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.880]   What if you're one of those people who feel that you've got to walk counterclockwise and
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.880]   don't want to go in?
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.880]   That's going to be really upsetting.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.880]   They're going to be problems.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:57.240]   So I think we will see some change.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.240]   I do think...
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.960]   I mean, I've been thinking about what happens if we don't get a vaccine and people don't
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:08.480]   have immunity for very long with this, if at all, because we still don't actually
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.480]   know that.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.160]   That's the worst...
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.320]   By the way, worst case scenario.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.480]   That is the worst case scenario.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.920]   We can't prevent it and we don't get a treatment.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.320]   It looks like we may have some treatments.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.320]   That's good news.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.200]   Not chloroquine, but we may have some treatments.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.160]   That might be some good news.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.440]   Maybe even the treatments involving plasma from people who've already survived it and
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.200]   have antibodies or maybe treatments.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.680]   But let's say worst case scenario, no treatments, no vaccine.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.920]   This is the new normal.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:42.640]   So then I think what will happen is most white collar work that can go remote will go remote.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:48.920]   And I think you'll see if children are less affected, you'll probably see schools open
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.480]   up with more social distancing.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.480]   We saw...
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.480]   What about teachers?
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.880]   I'm really curious to see what happens in Denmark.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.880]   Teachers will...
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:56.880]   They're out of the flies.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.880]   Well...
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.880]   We don't teach.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:03.280]   I worry that they will not be able to touch the children.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.280]   Online.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.520]   Honestly, I was surprised.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.720]   My kids been going to high school online.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.720]   Entirely online.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.720]   He's a senior.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:15.320]   But your kids in high school and my kids in middle school, but at fifth grade, you can't
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:20.040]   stick a 10 year old, maybe a 10 year old girl, but probably not.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.640]   Are they doing it now?
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.160]   Somewhat, but they're not really...
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.160]   Mine is...
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.160]   Oh, she's in middle school.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.160]   She's doing a great...
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.400]   But like, I mean, a few years ago?
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.400]   No.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.400]   And she's super conscientious.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.400]   They just don't have the...
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.840]   They don't have the attention span.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:39.840]   Parents don't have...
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.680]   And not to mention the fact that we don't have broadband everywhere, which is another
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.760]   issue.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:52.120]   So yeah, I think testing, I think good contact tracing, if we can develop something that
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.560]   is a more immediate test, you might...
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.800]   You know, checking for fevers constantly.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.800]   Carsten's...
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.800]   Maybe every day.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.360]   Carsten's wife, Kimmy, teaches kindergarten.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.760]   And he says they are not learning as much as they should be.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.760]   I think it's really a...
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.760]   Well, it's...
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.440]   There's gonna be a generation with a loss to year of schooling or more.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.440]   And we just gotta deal with that.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.200]   We gotta say that you went through a lot, and that's what it is.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.200]   I just put up a terrible...
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.200]   I think it's a resilient.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.200]   That's the thing.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.280]   ...for all the seniors graduating without walking.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:25.080]   You know, Paul Therott's daughter graduated from high school.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.080]   But you're right.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.080]   It's what...
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.560]   You know, people suffered in World War I, World War II.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.560]   You know?
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.960]   And then the whole generation had stories to tell for decades.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:42.040]   I just put up an MIT technology review piece on machine learning to check if your social
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.040]   distancing properly at work.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.040]   I just...
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.040]   Yes.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   I feel like...
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.040]   Yes.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.040]   There's also like...
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.040]   And you'll have a big clack in the...
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.040]   Get apart.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.040]   Get apart.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.040]   Get apart.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.040]   Well, it'll also be cameras.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   You'll have a little...
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.040]   This.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.040]   You'll have a little green squares and red squares.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.040]   That's where it's bad.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   Or maybe...
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.880]   And sensible.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:06.000]   And I don't think it'll happen because it's too dystopian.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.800]   And I think at some point people are just going to say, "Oh, the heck with it."
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   I'm going...
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:16.240]   I think it will happen in grocery stores and read settings for sure.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.240]   So we are ready at our grocery stores.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.920]   You can only walk certain ways.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.920]   There's one way I...
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.920]   Right?
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.920]   Well, that's good.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.560]   And the theory being if you cross, you might breathe on each other.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.640]   So this way you're at least breathing down somebody's neck instead of breathing in the
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.640]   face.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:33.280]   I'm going to have to get a neck mask now.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.600]   Yes.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.600]   You could...
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.600]   I think we'll see that kind of...
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.600]   And what happens to the economy if this becomes two years of the new normal or more?
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.600]   What happens to the economy?
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.720]   I don't think we'll grow for a while.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.720]   Unless we want to invest into something.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.720]   Oh, go backwards.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.720]   And what about all the people we're unemployed?
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.880]   We're going to have to have universal basic income.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.160]   Oh, there's major shifts of wealth.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.480]   Yeah, I think there's...
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.040]   I mean, we have enough with taxation.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.320]   We have a lot of levers that currently we're not pulling.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:10.120]   But I also think this is a good opportunity for...
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.840]   I mean, think about the things we are suddenly like, "Oh, crap.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.240]   We need to do this."
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.000]   Think about revamping healthcare and what that might look like.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.080]   Think about boosting broadband and investing in that.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.240]   Those are going to be jobs.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.600]   Think about dealing with climate change and electrification.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:34.520]   We actually could invest in those areas and build a better long-term everything and create
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.520]   jobs for people.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:40.880]   Well, we've built an entire economy essentially based on service.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.360]   That's really the US economy.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.360]   You know, it's interesting because I've already thought about this for Twit.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.480]   And we seem to be handling work at home fine.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.920]   I think we can continue indefinitely doing what we're doing.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.560]   It's not comfortable or easy.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.880]   You know, normally on Wednesday, you've been here for that, Jeff.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.040]   I think Stacey has it too.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.080]   We have lunch in the conference room.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.000]   We get food and then it's very social.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.040]   Everybody loves it.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.720]   So they did it today via Zoom.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.040]   I don't know how wet I missed it, but I don't...
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.120]   Well, I know what Carsten had.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.120]   I know what Carsten had.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.120]   What?
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.760]   I said bitterly.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.760]   What?
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.760]   Kayceau?
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:19.760]   You had Carsten, can't you?
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.760]   No.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.760]   Do you know?
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.760]   He said it to me.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.760]   He said it to you.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.760]   I don't know.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.760]   I was like, we don't know.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.280]   He said he had Taco Bell.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:35.240]   Did you get one of the drinks from the cantina?
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.240]   Carsten sent me a picture of him eating Taco Bell because that's how funny it will cost
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.240]   to me.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.240]   That's funny.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.240]   That's funny.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.240]   That's funny.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.240]   You need more Carsten.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.520]   Patrick had mini ravioli out of a can, Patrick.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.520]   I guess so.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.520]   Hi.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.520]   I've worked from home for companies for...
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.640]   I've worked for three different companies.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:05.960]   So the Daily Deal in New York, Time, Inc. and Giga Home and things like Slack actually
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:13.360]   remote work is you can still have social and create bonds of friendship or whatever
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.360]   virtually.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:22.240]   And I mean, yes, I also saw those people two, maybe three times a year for events.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:28.120]   But even if I hadn't, I really got a chance to get to know those people over social channels.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.880]   And that was part of the culture.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:37.160]   Like I noticed when I got to Fortune, it was really weird to establish myself as a virtual
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:42.360]   person there because they had already established a culture of physically present in the New York
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.360]   office.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.200]   They were mostly in the office at Fortune.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:52.680]   And I attended our editorial meetings every day via conference call.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.320]   And I think it can be done.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.320]   And I think people can...
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.040]   I mean, I'm still really good friends with all of my Giga Home colleagues.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.320]   And again, I didn't see them.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.520]   I've only met you once in person, Stacey.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.320]   Yeah, that's a good point right here.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.320]   Right here.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.600]   You've learned to hate me without ever being in the same place, isn't it?
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.400]   I want to physically hit you at least once a week.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.640]   I mean, there you go.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.720]   I'm looking to ask for.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.720]   So...
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.080]   Actually, when I met you in person, Leo, I thought you were a lot nicer than you are
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.400]   on the show.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.480]   I have different duties on the show.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.480]   I know.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.520]   I was like, "Oh, Leo is a delightful human being.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.920]   He isn't trying to poke me all the time being like...
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.840]   My duties to make the show interesting.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.280]   And I don't care about your feelings."
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:51.440]   It's funny because, yeah, in person, I am not a confrontational person at all.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.440]   I just want to...
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.440]   I was like, "How are it?"
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.440]   It's like, "How are it stirred?"
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.440]   Exactly, "How are it stirred?"
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.240]   It's funny because when I started in broadcasting, I was...
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.080]   In fact, somebody called me, he said, "You're Mr. Smiley Smiley.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.160]   Knock it off."
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.080]   I wanted to be liked.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   I want to be nice.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.400]   I want to be myself.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.320]   And I quickly learned...
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.320]   Well, not quickly.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.320]   It took me about 15 years.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:16.160]   But 15 years into my career, my failed career, I learned that the best way to be is like,
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.600]   "I don't give a damn."
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.600]   And screw you.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.560]   Like, yeah, "Award Stern's probably a nice guy in person."
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.560]   Right.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.480]   But he's kind of screw you in the air because it's much more interesting.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.480]   Nobody wants ingratiating.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.480]   Ingratiating is all that.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:36.240]   But that's the funny thing about broadcast is that every time I did a tryout for broadcast
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:41.280]   gig, TV critical of the air, you got to get the smile in your voice.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.280]   Right.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.240]   That's a little wrong because I used to do that.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.560]   I can smile at my voice.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.880]   You can tell, even if you're listening, that I'm smiling right now, can't you?
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.320]   Even if you're not looking, you know.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.920]   And I want to smile at you.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.920]   Yeah, it's awful.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.760]   As Stacy wants to punch you.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.760]   It's awful.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.760]   So you...
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.760]   I wasn't...
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.760]   The smiling isn't it, but...
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:01.760]   I did not...
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.400]   Jeff, you just come off as angry.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.960]   Yeah, angry's not good either.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:06.960]   What you really want to be...
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.960]   You're going to problem with that?
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.200]   You really want to be is insucient.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.400]   Like, you like me, don't like me.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.400]   I don't care.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.400]   I am who I am.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.400]   That's what you really want to be.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.560]   I'm too cool for school.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.560]   But actually, angry's not bad.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.560]   You're insucient.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.200]   You ain't getting on TV.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.400]   Well, that's actually true.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:28.720]   NBC's one word review of me when I was supposed to be their chief correspondent on the site
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.480]   was Leo Ich.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.480]   No.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.880]   David Borman told me that.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:43.400]   David Borman, who later went on to become the Washington Bureau chief at CNN and created
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.640]   the 3D virtual reporter.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.640]   Right.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:51.960]   And a great guy lives up here, but he was the VP in charge from NBC of the site and he
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.560]   said, "Yeah, because I was supposed to be the chief correspondent.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.720]   I was supposed to be like on the air every day."
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.720]   And he said, "No.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.600]   Let me tell you what they said in New York."
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.600]   Thanks, David.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.600]   Wow.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.080]   He pulled no punches.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.080]   That's all right.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.560]   They're broadcasting a deserving.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.040]   Did you see the article?
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.280]   There are a number of them.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.520]   Information had a good one.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:19.720]   People are getting burned out from Zoom because they're on camera all the time.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.640]   And we don't have that problem, do we?
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.160]   You know, I felt really bad for it.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.280]   Because I felt like this is kind of like a hate-click article, right?
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:33.000]   Because the lead was this woman who wanted to get her lips filled because she was like,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.760]   "Oh, my lips look terrible on camera."
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.760]   Right.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.760]   Man, why did they do that?
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:43.560]   Because I can totally see women are constantly judged by their appearances, right?
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.120]   And being on camera is hard.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:51.920]   I mean, you will never see me without a full face of makeup on the show, ever.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.880]   But this is...
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.560]   So this was the question.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.720]   Is it outside pressure or is it internal pressure?
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:05.120]   Because you know, a lot of people first hear their voice on a recording go, "I sound
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.120]   like that."
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.760]   And I think probably the same thing, people see themselves on camera and they go, "Oh,
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.240]   my God."
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.920]   And now they're forced to stare at themselves on camera hours and hours a day.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:19.280]   Or is it that they feel like they're getting peer pressure to you should really look better?
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.480]   Well, I think it's internal because there's an external need.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:29.160]   I mean, as a woman, I'm like, "I know I don't look professional unless I need a certain standard,
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.160]   right?"
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.680]   So you've got to look professional on these things.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.680]   It's true.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.680]   It's true.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.880]   I've always felt much more pressure.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.720]   They can't wear the same dress two days in a row.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:46.400]   There are even clothing rental companies designed for broadcasters that can really
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.400]   either do that.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:55.240]   Yeah, because if you're a weather girl or a news reporter or an anchor, "Guys, I wear
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   the same...
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.240]   I rotate my jackets.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.840]   I only have about 10 of them."
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.200]   I don't know where I differ.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:06.240]   But women can't, so there are literally rental things, mostly for weather reporters because
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:10.560]   they're wearing dresses so that they never wear the same thing twice.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.040]   Yeah, and they have to...
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.840]   Their own salary, by the way.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.840]   That's not something that's too unified.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:17.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.840]   The company doesn't pay.
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.840]   No.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.840]   No, no, no.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.480]   So, yeah, it's not awesome unless you're like Katie Couric.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.480]   I'm sure she's got some things in her contract.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.200]   Yeah, some people do.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.760]   In fact, when we first started on tech TV, we had a wardrobe mistress and we had...
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.880]   They would take pictures of us.
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.120]   She went out and bought a lot of clothes for everybody.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.920]   That went away really quickly.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.760]   That and the makeup artists disappeared.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.720]   You do your own makeup where your own wardrobe.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.720]   So that was expensive.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.720]   Oh, no makeup?
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.720]   Ooh.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.760]   Well, you had to put it on yourself.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.720]   That's when we knew tech TV was in trouble when they...
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.840]   There were three things that happened.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.400]   One was they got rid of the makeup artists.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.840]   Two was they got rid of the wardrobe person.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.920]   And three was they got rid of the oatmeal, the free oatmeal and the snack room.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.400]   That was really the thing.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.400]   That was the final straw.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.680]   When people couldn't have breakfast, right, Carson?
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.400]   You come in, no oatmeal.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.640]   Come on, man.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.880]   Next, it's going to be coffee.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.360]   So I've always made sure that we have lots of...
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.120]   No, you can't take coffee away from the germs.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.120]   No, no, no.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.120]   I can't take coffee away from anybody.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.120]   Are you kidding?
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.120]   Time-ache.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.920]   We had free pepperaged farm cookies and wine and beer.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.920]   What?
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:29.600]   They used to have a bar cart that drove around Fortune's office when the magazine closed.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.600]   Yes, right.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   On Fridays?
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.600]   Right, such a bad idea.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   Yes.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.560]   If you were a senior editor above, your credenza was stocked with liquor.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:43.560]   I actually had to send a memo saying no more drinking in the office because Anthony is
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.360]   a very talented mixologist.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.760]   There is still in the cupboard over here all kinds of booze and mixers and stuff.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.040]   And come, you know, well, it started.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.400]   It was Friday at the end of the week, right?
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.040]   And then it slipped to Thursday.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:01.640]   By the time, after a while, it's Wednesday, let's all get a drink.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:05.880]   And everybody was drinking in the office and I was really worried not so much that productivity
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.480]   would go down but that somebody would get an accident going home.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.480]   I didn't want that.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.480]   So we kind of...
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.480]   What was it?
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.480]   I think it was GitHub.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.480]   I don't remember correctly.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.480]   Had a whole stock bar there.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.880]   I thought, "Not good in an office."
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.880]   I think it's a company.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.880]   What if you were recovering?
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:19.880]   Exactly.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.880]   I just...
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.600]   I felt like it's nice.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.600]   Everybody's convivial.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.400]   I'm really happy you're having a good time and you're happy, but let's not do that anymore.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.400]   I don't want your office.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.480]   The office is Christmas party every week.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.480]   Christmas party every week.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.480]   That was pretty much it.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.880]   But boy, you make a good drink.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.840]   The drinks he made for the show that we did at Christmas show.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:48.240]   He made a different drink for every person on the panel.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.240]   So fancy.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.240]   And he had to match the person.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.960]   And for a man, he was not feeling...
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.960]   Yeah, he was sick.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.480]   God, can you imagine?
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:01.120]   In nowadays, somebody's sick making you drinks, you would jail them.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.120]   Jail them.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.120]   That's what I mean.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.480]   No, I'd be like, "Oh, the pill is all things."
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:10.840]   There's a PTSD psychic burden that we are all imposing upon ourselves.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.320]   And it's not gonna...
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.760]   I don't think it's gonna go away right away.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.120]   It's like the people in the Great Depression who are penny pitchers to their very last
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.120]   dying breath, right?
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.600]   It hits you in the brain.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.160]   I wrote about this.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:29.920]   The day that the death toll passed 9/11, it brought it all back for me.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.120]   And I realized it was the PTSD.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.120]   That's right.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.400]   You suffer still from PTSD from 9/11.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.520]   But that was one discrete event.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.520]   This has been...
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.520]   This is gonna habitually...
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.200]   Well, I wrote that.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.000]   This is 9/11 in slo-mo.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.840]   Yeah, very, very slo-mo, isn't it?
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:52.840]   Yes.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.240]   And now, of course, we far exceeded that death number.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.240]   Yes.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:01.400]   And it's gonna be much bigger than that because I finally, when the calculation that I proposed
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.280]   to editors three weeks ago, and nobody listened to me, and finally, the New York Times and
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:09.000]   the FT are doing it, they're looking at so-called excess mortality.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.080]   The total deaths over the average is more likely a count.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.080]   So many people are dying in home.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.840]   Autovax, as we don't have.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.840]   Right.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.840]   Right.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:20.840]   Not to mention all the divorces.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.840]   Well, that's a sheer repeat.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:27.040]   Not to mention all the divorces and the children who will be born in nine months.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.040]   What are the other, yeah?
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.000]   So I was trying...
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.280]   I was trying to find out on the Google story about Google helping you find unemployment
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.880]   data based on your state.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.320]   I can't find...
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.720]   I can't find the Google update on that.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.720]   I was wondering...
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.720]   This is an Engadget story.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.520]   Do you think they got it wrong?
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.520]   Let me see.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.440]   Well, maybe Google Chate pulled it.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.920]   I'm looking for the actual...
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.240]   Here is the Google link.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.240]   The Google link.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.240]   You're right.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.240]   Oh, no, it does.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.240]   Okay.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.240]   It does, no.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.240]   But it does.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.040]   If I search unemployment, I get help and information from Washington Employment Security.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.040]   Oh, it's in the search.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.760]   Ah, and they know where you are.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.760]   That's another thing.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.760]   I'm going to become more complacent about privacy.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.320]   We talked a couple of weeks ago about the Apple Google plan.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:20.480]   Now, by the way, France is upset because they say, "We have created a program, an application
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.760]   for your phone, but Apple will not let us use their Bluetooth information."
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:30.360]   Apple says, "You can't use Bluetooth location information if it gets sent away outside of
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.360]   the phone.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.920]   It violates privacy."
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.320]   And the French authorities say, "Who cares?
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.680]   We want it."
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.680]   And that's an interesting clash.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.840]   Oh, so the government wants more data than Apple can get.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:42.840]   Government wants more data.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:46.160]   I always tell you, I always say government is not your friend in privacy.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.680]   Government is the key enemy.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.680]   Right.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.080]   It is the primary industry.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.720]   And I think Apple's right.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.560]   So Microsoft...
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:57.000]   This week Microsoft put out privacy policies.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.840]   I just dropped it under security in our rundown.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.840]   Microsoft's security stance.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.000]   We'll just go with that.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.480]   It's their preserving privacy while addressing COVID-19.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:12.520]   And it's written by Julie Brill, who is now their chief privacy officer and used to be
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.520]   at the FTC.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.200]   And this list is excellent.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.720]   It's seven points.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:24.080]   It talks about obtaining consent, getting data only for public health, getting the middle
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:29.240]   amount of data, and let users store and control their data so they get to choose whether it's
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.240]   on their device or in the cloud.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:38.040]   And then you can't share it with people without consent or minimize what's shared.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:41.400]   And then delete it when you no longer need it for the emergency, which I thought was
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.200]   actually a pretty...
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.760]   That's a bold step right there.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:51.440]   So I actually thought these were excellent privacy protecting principles.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.440]   And I was...
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.320]   I wasn't surprised that Microsoft's doing this.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.320]   Brad Smith has been very forward thinking about this.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:01.720]   Julie Brill was on the FTC when the FTC started looking at privacy related to like IoT.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:05.200]   So Brad Smith is at the front of us, yes.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.800]   So I just thought this was good.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.320]   I don't know if you found the link yet.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.800]   Well, now we have somewhere.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   I was in the rundown.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:17.680]   A Republican senator is saying jobs and perchiots all on you from Missouri.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.440]   That's an abdication of their job.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.520]   It should be on everybody.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.840]   Sorry.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.080]   And I don't know.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:32.400]   Yeah, this is... I'm a little cynical when Microsoft publishes something like this because...
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.400]   Oh, sure.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.000]   They have an agenda.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.640]   They actually pushed forward facial recognition laws.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:43.000]   Washington State is one of the first ones and Microsoft basically wrote our facial recognition
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   use law.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.440]   Is it a good law?
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.200]   There are good things about it.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.600]   Like all laws, it's a compromise.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.320]   It's a common corporate jujitsu.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:59.240]   If you see a train coming down the track at you to cleverly write a law that protects
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:04.840]   your real interests while appearing to protect the public interest.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:10.520]   But that law does say that governments need a warrant.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:14.240]   There's a third party auditability on the facial recognition stuff.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:19.280]   And that's one thing that these guys do is they say, well, government really needs to
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.680]   prove they need it.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.520]   Meanwhile, but we're going to get it.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.360]   It's okay if we get it.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.800]   Well, we'll take that information.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.840]   It's like Google making a credit card saying the Apple saying the merchant's not going to
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.080]   get any personal information.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.320]   Yeah, but you are.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:39.360]   Well, to be clear, Microsoft with regards to COVID-19 data is saying one should have it
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.440]   except for the public health.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.440]   Right.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.680]   Companies, companies that need it for that.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:48.640]   And that when they're done, everything should be done.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.840]   That's the same as the medium post we referred to a couple of weeks ago where it was saying
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:57.440]   these are the things that you have to do to protect people.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.960]   And I agree with that.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.480]   But also in a crisis, at the beginning of the crisis, have the best intentions.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:08.200]   But when it comes down to it and people are dying, it may be that we all go, yeah, okay,
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.600]   fine, but please, Microsoft, give France the information.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.600]   Or Apple.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.600]   Apple.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.600]   Apple.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.560]   Give France the information because we need to save lives at this point.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.560]   It's being a little less.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.600]   You asked about this, you asked about this last time, how many people are going to use
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   it?
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.600]   I can't find it now.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:28.160]   Because all of these things are voluntary, right?
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.840]   Oxford did a study that if half usage, it reduces the art.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.840]   Huge jobs.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.640]   So you don't need 100% compliance anymore.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.560]   The number ask has to be 100% perfect.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:44.960]   Well, they were saying 60% compliance, but Singapore's track and trace.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.160]   Let's see where their compliance is.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.880]   Yeah, but they're an authoritarian government.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.880]   So I would-
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:54.080]   Their track and trace compliance is like at less than 20% the last week when I looked.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:43:01.280]   So that's why I said, so it was very, what is their app called?
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.440]   But Singapore.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.400]   So they're not, even though they could at this point, they're not enforcing the use
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.480]   of this app.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   It's still voluntary.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.840]   I guess not.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.280]   But why can't I find the name of it?
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.280]   That's all right.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.280]   All right.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.280]   I can't get the gist.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.280]   What's the name going to do?
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.280]   I'm not downloading it.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.280]   It's okay.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:24.360]   Oh, well, no, the name gets me the actual data point that I want because it was less than
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.760]   20% last week, but this week it may be more and maybe less.
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.040]   The point is I want to make sure we're factual.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.440]   You know me.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.280]   You know me in my journalistic self.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.280]   You know me.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:41.440]   I couldn't care less facts, Max.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:46.440]   This is why Stacey hates me.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.760]   No, I'm teasing.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.840]   I know you don't.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.760]   I loved.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:52.760]   Here's a perfect example.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:57.720]   Benjamin Netanyahu, whose trial was supposed to begin yesterday for corruption.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:00.080]   Oh, but the COVID.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.520]   Oh, but the COVID.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.080]   Let's close the courts down.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.560]   No trial.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:10.200]   The courts are closed down.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:15.960]   You watch because this is going to be a wonderful cover for a lot of companies and a lot of
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.600]   government corruption and a lot of corruption.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.160]   Oh, but the COVID.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:25.200]   It's going to be the new saying.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.080]   Of course, there's some terrible stuff going on.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:33.280]   Amazon has suspended 6,000 accounts worldwide for price gouging.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.440]   I was looking at a blood oximeter because I, you know, that's one of the things they
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:43.760]   say is if you do get sick, watch your oxygen level because that's an early warning sign.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.520]   And I thought it began to get lots of people can't find those right now.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:51.960]   Yeah, I have one and check the prices on them as they go up, up, up, up, up, up.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:58.080]   And the one I bought from via Tom, the price only 20% of the population has downloaded
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.760]   the tracing app from Singapore.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.760]   That's what you said.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.400]   You're exactly right.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.320]   I just, I needed to know that that was accurate.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.320]   It was accurate.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.320]   Oh, y'all know.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.320]   She's perfect.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.840]   And that was as of April 12th.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.360]   So that was a week ago.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.360]   It is surprising.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.360]   We're back to pulse.
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.400]   But, you know, maybe that's what happens when you have an authoritarian government.
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.840]   If they don't compel you to do something, you're going to not do it.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.840]   That's kind of the.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.120]   Well, it does a road public trust, right?
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.960]   Yeah, I just noticed the oximeter I bought.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:33.560]   The price has gone from $110 to $162 within a few days up and down.
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.760]   So I got the will you.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.760]   What is it?
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:37.760]   Will you?
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.760]   Will you?
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.360]   I put it in the rundown chat.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.360]   And you like it?
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.360]   Oh, to ring.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.360]   Love it.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.360]   Love it.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.360]   It's very good.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.760]   The idea this and there was a good article in the New York Times yesterday by an emergency
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.280]   room physician.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.280]   What he said.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.280]   Very good.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.880]   Wasn't that I thought what he really was terrifying and now I like I have COVID and I
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.880]   don't know it.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.880]   I mean, by God.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:05.720]   Well, what he said was, you know, we know that once your lungs just basically solidify
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:10.560]   that you can't breathe without moving your, you know, forcing them to breathe, that's
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.240]   when we're going to put you on a vent.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.000]   But that he said is really way down the road.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.120]   You turns out your lung function starts to fail very early on, but you don't notice
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:25.600]   it because you're still able to expel carbon dioxide.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.880]   So you don't feel short of breath.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:31.120]   But what's happening is the virus is damaging the surfactants in your lungs.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.680]   So you're not getting oxygen.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:38.480]   So an oximeter is a good early warning sign because if your blood oxygen goes, you know,
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.040]   normally be in the 90s, it should be nice seven.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:48.360]   But if it goes down precipitously, even if you can breathe, you highly to the hospital
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:52.800]   because that's he said, if we can get you then we can treat you and the treatment is
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.440]   on on forced oxygen, right?
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.440]   Well, that and they're starting to do that.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.400]   They're doing cannulas instead of events.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.040]   But yeah, and they flip you over and they flip you over.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.760]   There's all sorts of things that they can do.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.120]   It's like a heart attack or anything else.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.360]   As soon as you get there, the better.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.920]   But that's the crazy thing right now is that everybody's being told don't go in because
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.280]   they didn't have the capacity because they don't have the test.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.280]   They don't know.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.280]   Right.
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:21.720]   It got so bad in some cases that they were doing CT scans instead of because they didn't
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.720]   any tests.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:26.200]   The only way was to look at your lungs.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:32.120]   It's a horrendous abrogation of responsibility to humanity.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.120]   What's going on?
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.120]   It's awful.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:42.360]   You know the thing bothers me more honestly is all the failings of late stage capitalism
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.560]   in this country, the huge income inequality.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:51.040]   And it really bothers me more that more poor people and people of color are dying.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.040]   They're losing their jobs.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:55.680]   They're forced to go to work in a dangerous situation.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.240]   Because they can't afford to lose their job.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:03.720]   All of these issues, we upper middle class folk are surviving fine.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.360]   But I just breaks my heart.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:13.280]   So Nicole Hannah Jones, who's a brilliant journalist on the New York Times and investigative journalist,
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.360]   Ida Baywells is her Twitter account.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.760]   She said stop calling the clerks and the stores.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.360]   They're not their victims.
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.360]   It's insulting.
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.360]   It's not victims.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.520]   I get to go back in, breaks my heart, and I go to the store and these people they have
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:26.840]   to work because it's their job.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.160]   It's the only thing they can do.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.680]   And they're risking their lives because the protections are not very good.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:37.240]   So she said to call them heroes is to justify their exploitation by praising blue collar
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:42.280]   workers, public service, the progressive consumer is a swag of her cognitive dissonance.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.280]   But from the Atlantic.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:50.080]   Honestly, the poor grunts who had to go on to the front line and take the fire, they
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.560]   were heroes too, right?
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:59.440]   It is the people who have to face the onslaught.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:03.880]   And they're usually the poorest, at least advantaged among us, unfortunately.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:07.320]   And that's kind of like life.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.320]   It's not a good thing.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.760]   But that's what Stacey was saying earlier.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:16.840]   That's what those are the besides trying to build broadband and build infrastructure.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.440]   We have to rebuild the structure of society.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.440]   That's the thing.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.440]   The cracks are showing.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.000]   Oh, this brings out every bit.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   These inequities wall.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.520]   The cracks have been showing.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:32.800]   This is actually the utter just the cracks just collapsed everything.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:41.880]   U.S. Judge blocks Twitter's bid to reveal government surveillance requests.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.600]   This goes back six years.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.680]   Twitter has been fighting for us and we lost.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:53.880]   Yeah, they wanted to do a transparency report that would include surveillance requests received
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.440]   from the U.S. government.
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.920]   A federal judge said that would harm national security.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.680]   No, you don't.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.640]   You can't do it.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.640]   I can't.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.280]   I mean, I can't knock that.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.680]   That's the way it's supposed to work, right?
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.520]   I appreciate Twitter trying to fight for me.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.520]   I can knock it.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.520]   I can knock it.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.680]   Well, but what if it does hurt national security?
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:13.680]   I will.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.480]   I don't do my trust.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.480]   This government?
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.480]   No.
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:23.800]   It's not that we're stoked to let us know.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:24.800]   It's the courts though.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.600]   I mean, look, okay.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:31.200]   Yes, it's the courts, but the courts are stacked now.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.200]   So I just don't know.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:37.360]   My confidence in the system and in the courts has been purposely eroded.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:44.280]   And yet it is conceivable that it would damage national security to do this, right?
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:47.920]   It could, but I'm not going to know now.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.680]   I think we can work our way around national security.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.120]   I think we have solved those.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:57.400]   I mean, it violates national security that we do not live in glasshouses and don't have
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.040]   door locks, right?
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:08.680]   I mean, we have to make decisions about how far we want our privacy to extend and where
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.080]   we want the government.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:14.160]   And I think the government, because of its power, the power to bring the state against
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.280]   a citizen is so great.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:20.160]   They really have to justify the ability to look into our lives to the extent that they
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.560]   can with a lot of patience.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:27.400]   So I think they're trying to make a case.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:32.840]   I don't think the case they're been making is compelling.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:37.520]   So but if judges believe it, then we'll lose that.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:39.840]   I mean, you're right.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:46.320]   I mean, the theory is that you have a nonpartisan adjudication from somebody who's going to look
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.400]   at both sides and say, well, yeah, the government's made its case.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.400]   This could potentially be damaging.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.520]   So what was the name of the judge?
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:54.520]   Let's look up the judge.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:52:03.200]   She was from the Northern California US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers US District Court
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:09.240]   for Northern California, which normally is a pretty liberal jurisdiction.
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.160]   You know, I don't know this judge.
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.160]   Who's who is that?
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:15.360]   Well, of course, the Democratic know Obama wasn't great with this either.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.520]   No, no, she's probably in Obama appointment, I would guess.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:22.080]   But where does it say?
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.600]   So Obama, yep, Obama will put it.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:29.080]   So, but I mean, look, all we got is the system.
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.640]   I know.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.440]   But the system's being torn down.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.440]   So we just don't know.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:35.440]   My reflex now.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.440]   And we can.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.440]   How?
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:43.280]   I guess you also have to wait against the public need is what Twitter is reporting in this
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:47.160]   transparency report, important public information.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.120]   Let's talk about that for a second.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.120]   Because what does Twitter actually know about you?
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:56.120]   The only thing they can really report to the government is your IP.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.040]   Everything else is well, and yes.
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.640]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:00.640]   Your identity.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:05.440]   Look at what happened with the Saudi regime when they put agents inside Twitter to track
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.120]   who was behind certain accounts.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.920]   I'll give you an example from my own life.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.320]   My daughter, this was several years ago.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.040]   We've always had horrible troll problems.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.040]   I don't know why.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.480]   It's not my did, I guess.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:21.080]   But we've, my daughter, 10 years ago, maybe a long time ago, she was a teenager, she's
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:25.240]   a kid, got what was essentially a death threat.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:30.000]   And I wrote to Ev, because I knew him, and I said, "Ev, can you help us?
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   You got a kid.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   You got a daughter.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   You understand?"
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   No.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   We were lucky.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.960]   We found a Petaluma police detective who was willing to take on the case.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:42.160]   He filed a subpoena.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:48.200]   And using the IP information provided by Twitter, because they respond to a lawful subpoena,
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.760]   he was then able to get a colleague.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:51.760]   He found the location.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.560]   It was a Chicago ISP.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:59.360]   He was able to get a colleague in the Chicago Police Department to subpoena the ISP and
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:04.480]   said, "Who was using this IP address at this time on Twitter?"
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:05.480]   And they found it.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:07.200]   It was a kid.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:11.160]   The detective in Petaluma got the Chicago PD guy to go over to the kid's house, talk
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.360]   to his dad.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:14.520]   That was the end of it.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:18.600]   However, if it had been somebody who really did want to do the nasty things that this
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:24.120]   tweet said, you know, the question that the police ask is, "Are you in fear of your life?"
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.480]   And if you are, they can act on it.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:31.080]   So that was a government request for information.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.400]   I think completely legitimate.
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:38.160]   Now I think that that probably would have appeared in a transparency report as one of,
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:45.160]   you know, we got 700 government requests this year and responded to this many of them.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.440]   What does the public need to know that number?
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:50.040]   Is it important?
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:54.120]   It's important for journalists who are trying to track what's happening because they're
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:58.400]   not just, it's not just things like your police request.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:04.880]   It's also things like not Fiza necessarily, but it's a huge uptick.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:09.760]   And that probably would be my guess that it's the Fiza request that Twitter wanted to reveal
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.920]   and the judge said, "No, you can't."
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.920]   Right?
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.760]   Because those are national security interests.
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:19.080]   We're trying to get a terrorist and we think we can get them.
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:25.480]   And the Fiza court can even say, "And Twitter, you cannot say anything about this request
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:30.920]   because revealing the request will alert the terrorists the fact that we're on to them."
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:36.440]   So that's national security and that is, the Patriot Act does allow that.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:40.720]   And so it may well be, we don't know, that the judge said, "Yeah, I'm looking at some
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.560]   of these and some of these are that kind of Fiza report request."
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.560]   Right.
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:53.320]   But would harm national security to reveal the interest of the FBI in this person?
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.080]   I think that that could be.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:56:01.240]   Way back when I ran the whole sites, the most common subpoenas we got were from police chiefs
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:07.120]   trying to find out the names of the unnamed police officers who were using our forums
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.600]   to complain about the chief.
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:09.600]   Right.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.120]   Obviously that's not a good use of it.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.120]   That's not kosher.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:13.120]   That's not kosher.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.120]   And that happens.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.120]   So the point is you can't paint it all with one brush.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.120]   But that's a variety.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.120]   Right.
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:19.120]   But that's, but that's, and I don't think it's transparency.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.120]   You're trying to deal with it.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:23.080]   But does the transparency report give you the information you would need to say, "Oh,
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.360]   I see what's going on here."
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:27.480]   Gee, there's a lot of requests coming from police in New Jersey.
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:28.480]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:30.480]   Okay.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.480]   You know.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.080]   You also, I mean, those, those transparency reports are designed to act as a canary in
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:39.200]   the report or saying, "Hey, the government is," I mean, so basically to say you can't
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:43.960]   do that, it stops journalists, it stops national security reports from knowing.
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.960]   And it does, the Patriot Act does allow...
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:46.960]   I know.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:49.800]   I saw this episode of The Good Wave.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:50.800]   Goodness.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:55.000]   I think it's called a national security letter.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:03.120]   But I think the law already says that Twitter can't report that in their transparency report.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:07.480]   By the way, NLSs do not require prior approval from a judge.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:12.840]   So there, the Patriot Act gives law enforcement some sweeping.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:18.120]   This is the analogy that you want to pay attention to during this time.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:24.600]   Because of 9/11 and the terror in 9/11, we gave law enforcement sweeping powers that
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:27.200]   were never then retracted.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.120]   And here we are almost 20 years later, they still have those powers.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.120]   Right.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.600]   So sun setting is an important design element.
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   Well, and the Patriot Act does sunset, but it keeps getting renewed.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:38.840]   Keeps getting renewed, yeah.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:40.560]   And that actually is one of the things I...
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:41.560]   Go on.
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:42.560]   Go on.
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:43.560]   You go.
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:47.000]   Well, I was going to say I think it's really important for these track and trace efforts
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.440]   for COVID-19, for governments if they're trying to get people...
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:56.120]   If you're going to eliminate the opt-in, or if you're going to try to encourage people
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:58:04.520]   to do to share your data, I think having a very narrowly defined ask, and then sun setting
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:11.080]   that ask at either a timeframe or when we achieve a certain policy goal, like, you know,
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:14.240]   100 cases per day nationwide or something.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.560]   So I think having those kind of...
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:19.600]   If we're going to do some sort of nationwide surveillance for track and trace, we need
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:26.920]   to have those kind of sun setting, narrowly defined in rules that sunset.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:27.920]   Then there's...
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:28.920]   Okay.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:29.920]   There's two B.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.880]   You know, two B is kind of an interesting over the top streaming service because it's
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.560]   free, but it's ad supported.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.240]   Fox recently bought them.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:45.480]   They are now going to TransUnion, the credit bureau, to get information about viewers so
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:49.160]   they can do targeted advertising.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:52.960]   By the way, this is so not illegal that they put out a press release saying they're doing
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.960]   it.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:58.920]   This is so canoe ventures, which is a venture firm from...
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:05.960]   Canoe Ventures was a venture backed effort by a couple cable companies to do exactly this
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:13.000]   way back in 2009 or 2010 and it failed because people were like, "No."
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.280]   But yeah, this is the dream.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:20.600]   To be to be to you, B.I. said, the partnership will combine its understanding of content
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:25.920]   viewing behaviors with TransUnion's cross verified consumer database.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:31.920]   By creating a link from a device ID, it can draw insights around consumer preference.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:36.760]   "This is Matt Spiegel, executive vice president of marketing solutions and media vertical
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:38.880]   at TransUnion."
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:44.480]   The integration of TransUnion data assets can help companies connect the dots to gain
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:50.880]   a more comprehensive understanding of today's consumer and reach them with confidence, especially
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:57.200]   as they move and consume content in new ways, with identifiers such as third party cookies
[00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:59.120]   on the decline.
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:03.480]   As we don't like them and we're blocking them, and media consumption changing, alternative
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:09.880]   identifiers such as home IP address are imperative for building a strong foundation of individual
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:16.240]   level identity and reaching consumers on devices like connected TVs.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:22.720]   Well, your smart data's are oftentimes sending...
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:27.520]   They're not tying into TransUnion, but they are sending a lot more data than most people
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.520]   anticipate.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:32.680]   But that is the problem is that any individual data, you can say, "Well, what do they have
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:33.960]   the IP address?"
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:38.680]   But any individual data, once it's combined with these other streams and my God, the credit
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.160]   unions have so...
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:44.720]   Credit bureaus have so much information about every financial transaction.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.800]   If you can cross reference my IP address, figure out my name and then tie in my credit
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.240]   data, you know everything.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:59.000]   Yeah, and they'll use that to extrapolate out thing.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.280]   But all they're going to do is show ads.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:09.040]   Well Leo lives in an area where he's likely to get cancer, so we're going to send him
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.520]   some ads for some medicine, that kind of thing.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:13.600]   I don't know what's wrong with that.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:19.880]   It may be something, I mean, when I buy my house, credit reports going to definitely
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.080]   know that I have applied for mortgage.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:27.360]   Last week Leo was screaming that all targeting should be killed.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:33.640]   This is a case point in point of his role as provocateur.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:36.200]   Maybe yes, maybe no, you don't know my real opinion.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:40.080]   I don't know the real Leo.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:46.360]   To be says Laughlin Murdoch in a statement, "We'll immediately expand our direct ticket."
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.680]   This is Fox.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.240]   We'll immediately expand our direct ticket.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.240]   That's all I need to know.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.120]   No, yes, Fox is Disney now, right?
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.120]   No, no, this is Fox.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.120]   Oh, this is Fox.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.120]   Oh, that's all I need to know.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.120]   Fox Fox.
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:00.000]   Steve will throw it back because Fox didn't have any of this stuff with the sale of its
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.320]   assets to Disney.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.000]   They want to build up all this stuff.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.880]   That's why they bought 2B for $440 million.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.480]   2B will immediately expand our direct to consumer audience and capabilities and provide our
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.960]   advertising partners with more opportunities to reach audiences as scale.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:25.880]   Honestly, though, as somebody who's trying to sell advertising, advertisers want to advertise
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:28.720]   to people who are going to buy.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.920]   Otherwise they're buying ads that are wasted.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.880]   There may even be annoying to the people who see them.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.960]   It's not an unreasonable thing for an advertiser to say, "Well, I just want to advertise
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.880]   that people are interested in our product."
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:43.880]   It's not a harm to people.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:46.080]   The problem is not that.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.920]   The problem is if it's extended to other things like, "Oh, I'm going to also send this information
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:55.920]   to insurance companies to make sure that Leo doesn't get life insurance."
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.920]   Or they're going to go ahead.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.920]   Sorry.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.920]   You go ahead.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.920]   There's a little delay in the scalp.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:03.920]   I apologize.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.000]   Yeah, my internet must be terrible today.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   It is.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   It's not so bad.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:20.080]   I think it was Visa or MasterCard was looking at consumption patterns and social media things
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:25.840]   you post on social media to establish credit scores.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.160]   If you think about what if everybody who's watching the Real Housewives doesn't pay their
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.160]   bill on time?
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:35.200]   What if enough people who watch it don't?
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.800]   When you suddenly start getting these weird data scientists, you're like, "Woo, this is
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.800]   relevant."
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.440]   Well, you're not even going to get real housewives.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:43.840]   Real housewives build that running.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:46.760]   We want to lend money to people who watch Real Housewives.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.760]   Sorry.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:51.440]   Nobody could have said a desk and say, "Oh, that equals that.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.720]   It's just the correlation's going to be there."
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:57.280]   I'll give you a privacy thing that bothered me today.
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.280]   What?
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:05.520]   I just got approved for 100% paid CPAP for my sleep apnea because of 9/11.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.520]   Nice.
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:09.680]   Well, the data goes right to Ettna.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.120]   Well, they want to make sure.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.120]   You have no choice.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.200]   And this is the reason why.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.160]   It's hard to quibble with this.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.560]   I'm really torn on this.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.400]   Ettna is paying for this.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.960]   They're putting out money.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:28.360]   So they want to make sure you use it because the health benefits of a CPAP machine accrue
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.520]   if you use it a certain number of hours a week.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.320]   Otherwise they spend a lot of money on something that's just sitting in the corner and they're
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:39.680]   still going to have to pay for your bad health outcomes.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:45.880]   So this is one of those cases where I think if it is, I think if the data--
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:46.880]   Oh, Stacey.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.880]   No, no, no.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:52.200]   I think if the data is narrowly, narrowly, it's defined.
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:56.040]   You opt in and you know exactly what's happening.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.320]   I kind of think it's OK.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.480]   I don't think they should get the actual health data.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:05.400]   But I do think saying Jeff has warned this is fair data for them to get.
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.560]   Oh, but they're getting the actual health data.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.560]   Why don't?
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:13.280]   So I want to make clear exactly where-- and that's the hard thing about talking about
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:19.560]   data sharing is we have to be very clear on what data we're actually sharing.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:23.720]   They require it to be worn four hours a night, which alone tells me that nobody can tolerate
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.720]   the damn thing.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:27.040]   Oh, no, people hate them.
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.000]   Well, thanks.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   You've not worn it yet?
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.440]   No, I've gotten it yet.
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:34.240]   Well, normally they would send someone to my house, a technician.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.840]   Are you shaking with the doctor?
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:43.240]   Usually the doctor gets the health data and the insurance firm gets the usage.
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.240]   Data.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.240]   Really?
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.240]   OK.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.440]   I mean, you should definitely double check.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:53.520]   It makes sense, though, because if somebody's been prescribed a CPAP machine and isn't
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:58.120]   wearing it, the likelihood of death and illness is higher.
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.560]   That's what insurance companies are trying to figure out.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.200]   I can understand why they want it.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.960]   Wait, so why don't they have a pill dispenser that makes sure-- I mean, well, this would
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.960]   be good too.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.960]   They'll treat your meds.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.960]   They'll treat your meds.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.760]   So the pill dispenser that takes pills, right?
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:12.760]   Yeah.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.760]   And that's what you do.
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:16.520]   The problem-- I can tell you why, but it's important.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.920]   Generally what's going to happen is these will be voluntary.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:19.920]   It's voluntary, Jeff.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.520]   You don't have to take the money.
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.520]   These are voluntary--
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.520]   That's exactly what it is.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:24.520]   Yes.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520]   You want to pay the whole thing yourself fine.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.520]   Fine.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.520]   You get it without the data.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.520]   It's voluntary.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.520]   And so that's how they get around it.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.360]   Nobody's making you take your pills.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.080]   Nobody's making you wear a CPAP.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:36.800]   But if you want us to pay for it, you better give us the information that you're wearing
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:37.800]   it.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.080]   And I don't think that's unreasonable.
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:46.160]   The problem is what you create is a class structure for privacy.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.640]   If you really want privacy, you have to be a little for it.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:51.640]   Yep.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:55.120]   And if you have to use the insurance to pay for the CPAP machine, well, you don't get
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.400]   any privacy.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.400]   Right.
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:06:59.400]   Which is interesting.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:03.800]   I can just afford it and have insurance as kind of a class thing nowadays.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:04.800]   Privacy.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:05.800]   Amen.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.280]   A lot of things are luxury.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.040]   Privacy is one of them now.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:17.560]   So, get ready because the Health and Human Services is built a tool called HHS Protect Now.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.880]   It's already up and running as of April 10th.
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:25.360]   It helps officials compile reports on coronavirus spread by collecting data from state and local
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.480]   government health care institutions and colleges.
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.600]   We don't know what the data is, but we do know where it's coming from.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.080]   Palantir.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:37.280]   Speaking of people you don't trust.
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:44.200]   Here's Peter Teal's shady company that has been doing this kind of thing for business
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:49.320]   for a long time collecting data from a variety of sources, compiling it.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:52.000]   I don't think they have their own data collection stuff, right?
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.880]   They just compile it from other sources.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.880]   I don't know.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:56.880]   Nobody really knows actually how it works.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.360]   Well, I feel, but I think this is a case where if the government gets its hands on the
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:04.720]   app data, what does Palantir do with it?
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:08.560]   Palantir, according to the Verge, has at least two active contracts with Health and Human
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:13.520]   Services, one they signed in January, one less than two weeks ago.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:18.600]   According to the Daily Beast, based on sources with knowledge of the project and confirmation
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:25.200]   from HHS itself, the HSAs Protect Now platform, which is set to be unveiled later this week,
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:29.000]   pulls data from across the federal government, state and local governments, health care facilities
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.720]   and colleges to help administration officials determine how to mitigate and prevent spread
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:36.200]   of the coronavirus.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.840]   Well, that seems fine.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:43.960]   187 data sets integrated into the platform, hospital capacity and inventories, supply
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:49.720]   chain data, diagnostic and geographic testing data, demographic statistics, state, this
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:54.560]   is what Palantir does, takes all these disparate data sources, combines them to give you actionable
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:55.560]   information.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:58.160]   Let's kill some black people and save some rich people.
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:01.840]   That's where you would find that information, though, is that's one of the pieces of information
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:02.840]   you could find out is.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:06.760]   Right, so this should all be, all that information should be public in a way that others could
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:07.760]   be using it.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:14.080]   HHS is relying on private sector partner contributions of data.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.440]   But for a good thing, right?
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:21.720]   One would hope, one would hope, but if it's not, it's an open source question.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:29.160]   So I wrote a piece this week about medicine's open information ecosystem and how we have
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:33.240]   things to learn from that.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:37.240]   One thing that you use pretty now is a data portal where a lot of tremendous amounts of
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:41.720]   data are going to be available to all researchers.
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:46.880]   Now if that's the case, I know what the data is and I can see where it's being used, then
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.880]   I'll have more faith in it.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:52.280]   But if it's being done and decisions are being made with it in the black box of government,
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:53.920]   that's what everybody complains about with algorithms.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.760]   But now it's our lives at stake.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:01.800]   Death panel or pre-crime, a couple of years ago, Palantir was working with the city of
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:07.240]   New Orleans to do predictive policing.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:08.720]   Even city council members didn't know about it.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:14.240]   The city had a contract which they recently terminated after six years with Palantir to
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.480]   figure out where crimes were going to be committed.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.560]   Wow.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.960]   Predictive policing.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:24.960]   So this is a kind of stuff.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.960]   I really don't trust Tom Cruise.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:28.760]   This is the kind of stuff Palantir does.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:33.680]   Yeah, if minority report style pre-crime policing happens, it's going to happen from
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:37.520]   companies like this.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.520]   I'm not surprised.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.160]   You want an open, so you actually wrote a good piece in Medium.
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.080]   You want a open information.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.280]   What was fascinating.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:52.880]   So I interviewed for, I had my Twitter list right there, bit.ly/covid-tweater-list.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:59.040]   And I interviewed for scientists so far who are amazing, which you can find on Buzz Machine.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:03.000]   And as I was listening to them and talking to them about how they operate in two ways.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.720]   One is the pre-print servers.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:06.920]   That is to say papers that have not been, uh-oh.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:07.920]   I haven't been--
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:08.920]   Go to Buzz Machine.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:09.920]   Go to Buzz Machine.com.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:10.920]   Go to Buzz Machine.com.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:11.920]   Medium back sheets.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:12.920]   I should have put this on Buzz Machine.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:13.920]   It's there.
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:14.920]   You can go to there.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:15.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:16.920]   I really hate Medium.
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.920]   I know.
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:26.880]   They have pre-print servers where papers are put up that have not been peer-reviewed yet
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.680]   and have not been published.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.680]   And yes, there are problems.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.160]   It can be problems with that.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:35.800]   But it's really amazing to see there have been 4,000 Covid papers so far.
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:40.920]   Some of them crap, but a hell of a lot of them very useful.
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:44.080]   And I looked at-- there's a paper that was done that's very controversial right now in
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:50.480]   Santa Clara County, California that looked and argued about the amount-- it was a serology,
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:56.240]   a blood study to find out how much was-- how prevalent is the virus.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:57.720]   There's much controversy about it.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:05.280]   Well, the same day five phenomenal epidemiologists and virologists came in and in great detail
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:10.200]   on Twitter criticized the report point by point and its conclusions.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.320]   The report itself hadn't been peer-reviewed, but in a way--
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.680]   This is not been peer-reviewed right now.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.880]   This is peer-reviewed at this point.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.120]   So I thought about this and I thought, well, yeah, that's the-- what we're all in as an
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:26.000]   open information ecosystem.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.400]   So I started off saying that we in journalism and media are no longer the deliverers of information.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.640]   The information's already delivered.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:33.720]   It's already there.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.840]   So what do we have to figure out is how do we add value to that?
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:42.400]   And what the doctors are doing that's so fascinating to me is they're adapting.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.840]   One of the doctors I talked to Angela Rasmussen from Columbia said that when she had her last
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.000]   epidemic, she didn't have preprints.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.920]   It took a year to get a paper out and get learnings.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.680]   Thank God we have this now.
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:52.920]   Now, meanwhile, we've had bad papers.
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.640]   We had the paper about hydroxychloroquine that went out into Twitter and then into Trump's
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:58.280]   brain and out his mouth.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.600]   And some people would die as a result.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.000]   It would appear.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.480]   But we've also had cases where-- but in that case, the doctors were on Twitter saying,
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:11.160]   no, bad papers, stop, don't judge this.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:19.280]   So medical Twitter, social media with the preprint world, is resulting in a phenomenal
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:23.800]   ecosystem here of information getting out and getting judged.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.520]   So you need some things in that.
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.280]   They needed a way to find-- they had to make things open.
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:33.360]   Number one, number two, they had to find ways to find the information and organize it.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.560]   Number three, they needed a way to criticize it.
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.920]   Number four, you needed a way to figure out who's really criticizing and are they any
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:39.920]   good or not?
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:43.120]   Because I've had people-- doctors come to me and say, that person, that guy, he doesn't
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.120]   belong on your list.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.120]   And here's why.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:50.240]   But you see what peer review has always happened offline in the past.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:57.360]   There is a risk, if everything gets published, that people will not be able to weigh-- yeah,
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.360]   sure, OK, great.
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:01.680]   It got peer reviewed in effect in public on Twitter.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:05.400]   But that doesn't mean that people didn't read the initial report and believe it, at
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:11.640]   the New York Times published it, they're not seeing the Twitter takedown of it later.
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.200]   So there is a few steps to do it in this public.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.200]   Right?
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.280]   The New York Times today had a piece.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.520]   I spent two hours this morning doing a tweet storm, believe it or not.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:23.480]   Or as Karsten called it, a tweet typhoon.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:24.480]   That was me.
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:27.320]   That was you, OK.
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:32.600]   So I feel like there should be somewhere better than Twitter for all of this to happen.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.600]   But no, that's the-- you see that?
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.560]   No, it's not.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.560]   That's the point.
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.560]   The doctors are using it.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.560]   They're using it brilliantly.
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.720]   They're finding each other.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.880]   And in the case of this paper, the New York Times, the Volten New York Times did a horrible
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:49.160]   story about that Santa Clara paper saying, well, this guy did it, and it could be in
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.160]   that community.
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.160]   People don't like somebody.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.160]   He didn't know that.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.160]   That's just poor science writing.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.160]   Right.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.160]   It's bad.
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.160]   You should never do a pre-- so there's rules.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:01.640]   You shouldn't do pre-print reporting until you go to at least two or three scientists who
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:05.240]   have credentials, who give you a different view, and you include that in.
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:09.360]   Now, in the case of this paper, this guy's stuff is being used by the people who are
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:12.560]   out there demonstrating like zombies saying, stop this.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:17.880]   It's not necessarily his fault, but they're using it to say, see this isn't so bad.
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:23.480]   And so they didn't even Google them.
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.800]   So the Times didn't do its job.
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:30.000]   The job should have been here is how epidemiology is being politicized.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.360]   Here's what you need to know about it.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.360]   And so on and so on.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.520]   So I was ready to go and look and say, well, I wonder what Santa Jose is happening, because
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.680]   Santa Jose took sports reporters and put them on the COVID beat.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.280]   Well, I was wrong.
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:40.280]   Great report.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.280]   Excellent.
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:42.280]   Excellent.
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:45.280]   Well, you know, standard among sports reporters is a lot higher.
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.800]   Well, this is a science report.
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.280]   Just a science report.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:54.280]   But my point is that we're all in this open-day from an extenculosystem, right?
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.280]   It's just there.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.440]   You can't do anything about it.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:57.440]   You got to deal with pre-prints.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.960]   You got to deal with social media.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.320]   How do you use it well?
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.320]   And medicine is teaching us how to use it well.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.600]   So the rest of the job should be able.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:10.740]   The responsibility of journals of record like the New York Times is to do their work
[01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:12.720]   before they publish.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:16.800]   So pre-prints are published without any screening.
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:22.480]   But before they republish the information in a pre-print, they need to do their job.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.480]   Exactly.
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.480]   And maybe, you know, let me do it a little bit.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.480]   So, you're going to slip through, aren't they?
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.480]   I mean, that's what-
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:35.520]   Let me just throw this out as a working journalist who has worked recently in what is a very
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:38.640]   high-pressure environment.
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:42.400]   You don't always have time.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:47.440]   You're usually working against a- this should have been up an hour ago, deadline kind of
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.440]   thing because it just came out an hour ago and somebody else has already issued a broken
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.520]   thing or a broken thing.
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:17:01.080]   And what happens is you will try to be calling your sources, but you know, they're also busy.
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.680]   So I get it.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:08.560]   These things should not be happening, but this is part of the challenge of doing news
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.400]   in real time.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.400]   Right.
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:15.960]   And so Stacey, but- but- but- but when we come on this show and there's been a story
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:18.760]   that's happened and I've seen something out there and it involves one of your areas of
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.960]   expertise, I wait to hear what you say about it because you have expertise and I trust
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:28.720]   you about that and that is your brand and you're not going to ruin that.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.720]   And that has value.
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:30.720]   Yes.
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.720]   And what if experts don't agree?
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:33.720]   Well, as you do-
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:36.320]   You find the way it was present, they don't.
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:37.320]   They don't.
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:42.320]   The journalism world is firing people like me left and right because we're expensive.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.320]   They bring in-
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.320]   I know that.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:48.160]   They bring in so many young people who, I mean, and I've trained a lot of young journalists.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:53.160]   You know what I'm like, oh, you are just not smart, but it's not that they're not smart.
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:56.400]   That's why I'm doing this stuff is to try to train them too, is to say this is what's
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.400]   out there.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.400]   Right.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.400]   But they can't-
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.400]   But they-
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.400]   But they-
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:05.040]   Put those journalists on GA beats where they're literally re-running press releases and then
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.040]   something happens.
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.040]   No, I agree.
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:11.440]   But even in this case, Stacey, maybe this is to your point, even the New York Times
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:12.440]   screwed it up badly.
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:13.440]   Right?
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.120]   And my point here was it wasn't hard to go on.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:20.600]   There were five epidemiologists with long Twitter, well known, people that any science
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:25.320]   supporter would know, Mark Lipsich, others, and it was easy to find them on Twitter.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:30.840]   And there they were within hours had given a peer review and the New York Times ignored.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.800]   So should we not read the New York Times instead read Twitter?
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:37.000]   Well, in some things, yes.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   Oh, God.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000]   This was really bad editing.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   It's not a good piece of a very depressing story.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   Because I wasn't reading Twitter.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   Twitter is not-
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   Twitter is not-
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   Twitter is not-
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   Twitter is not an immediate brand.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000]   I was reading five great epidemiologists-
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.760]   I had to read each shows who to read.
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:49.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:50.760]   Not a thing.
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:54.360]   When the media says Twitter says that is the greatest lie of all.
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.560]   Twitter doesn't say a thing.
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:56.560]   Right.
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:57.560]   Right.
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.560]   That's a whole mess.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:18:59.560]   Should you wait what the world-
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:05.800]   Well, it behooves one to remember the immortal words of Stacom.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:11.760]   Friendly reminder in times of uncertainty and misinformation, anecdotes are not data.
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:17.520]   Good data is carefully measured and collected information based on a range of subject-dependent
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:25.720]   factors, including but not limited to controlled variables, meta-analysis, and randomization.
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:27.360]   Let's not forget.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.840]   Let's not forget.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.200]   Stacom didn't forget.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.200]   You shouldn't forget.
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.160]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:37.360]   In my Twitter story today, I said, "Listen, I'm not a science reporter.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.440]   I'm a guy who re-tweets Stacom's admirately."
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.040]   And rate my room on Skype.
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:47.040]   Yes.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.560]   Jeff, you've been leading me to the Zeitgeist lately.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:50.560]   I really-
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:51.720]   That's what this show is.
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:52.720]   Oh, my God.
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:53.720]   That's what we're supposed to see.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:57.440]   This week in Zeitgeist, we named it wrong.
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.440]   Twizz.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:19:59.440]   It's Twizz.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:03.240]   We're re-branding the whole damn thing.
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.440]   Well, can we get a new theme song with it, please?
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.440]   I'm a pro-twizz.
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.440]   I'll be honest.
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:08.440]   I'll be honest.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.440]   I'll be honest.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:10.440]   We'll get a new theme song.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:11.440]   It's not going to be this week in one-shirts.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.640]   It'll be this week in Zeitgeist.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.840]   So by the way, I didn't know the Jason-
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:16.840]   Right.
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:17.840]   It's music.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:18.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:21.440]   So I said, can you please write us a damn theme song?
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.640]   Well, Willy.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.920]   We should get a better theme song.
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.920]   I admit it.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.920]   We should.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:27.920]   I like it.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:28.920]   I know orders as much as a heurist.
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:29.920]   We don't hear it.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:30.920]   The audience hears it.
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.480]   We don't hear it.
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:36.040]   What if we have deep mind because they do have a composing thing?
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:39.220]   We'll just have deep mind compose something for us.
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:40.760]   There's nothing more appropriate.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:41.760]   I'm a Jason.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:42.760]   I'm a Jason.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:43.760]   I'm a brilliant.
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:44.760]   It will be weird.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:47.200]   It will be weird.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.600]   That's true.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:53.480]   Let's take a little break for our one and only fine advertiser.
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:58.400]   And then we shall bless you as Stacom says bless.
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.400]   Stacom bless.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:04.040]   Our show today brought to you by this week in Google, brought to you by Zipper Cruder.
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:08.600]   By the way, I should as parenthetically mention the many of our employees are also brought
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.160]   to you by Zipper Cruder.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:12.040]   We use them and love them.
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.760]   But here's a message they sent.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:17.000]   Right now, we cannot be overwhelmed.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.320]   We have to work to keep our loved ones safe and protect our communities.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:24.840]   We have to work to stay strong, to stay connected, to stay focused.
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:29.400]   We have to work to inspire, to innovate, to build new solutions.
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:33.320]   But for all of this to work, we have to work together at Zipper Cruder.
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.640]   We connect employers and people every day.
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.120]   But today is different.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:42.320]   We're partnering with first responders, government officials, the medical community,
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:47.040]   the innovators, and the manufacturing, transportation and food distribution industries.
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:52.720]   We want to make sure we're finding the right people for the right jobs right now.
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.000]   Let's work together.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.120]   And the website is zippercruder.com/worktogether.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.360]   I kind of admire this.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:03.640]   I really need some nice piano music behind it, some dramatic piano music.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:07.640]   But you get the idea, zippercruder.com/worktogether.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:12.640]   Especially if you're looking for people in these vital industries right now.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.640]   Zippercruder is great.
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:17.360]   Zippercruder.com/worktogether.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.200]   And thank you, Zippercruder.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.200]   Thank you.
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:24.520]   And thank you for not running away from the topic as a sponsor, from being around and
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:26.320]   recognizing we're all in this together.
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:32.440]   I mean, it's a challenge because of course you don't want to be a downer in an ad.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:36.120]   I'm seeing on TV a lot of, and that's why I said the piano music.
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:40.760]   We all have the same, somebody's writing piano music, making a lot of money for the dramatic
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.640]   Jason, quietly Jason.
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:45.480]   Maybe that's what we need, some dramatic piano music, right?
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.080]   But you see a lot of those ads.
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:49.320]   My favorite is the Uber ad.
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.520]   Have you seen the Uber ad?
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:51.520]   No.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.520]   Oh my God.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:55.120]   I don't watch TV.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.280]   I wonder if I can play it without...
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:59.000]   I'm not a snob.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000]   I just don't like to watch it.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000]   Let me ask...
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.280]   That was a delayed reaction.
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.280]   Let me ask Karsten.
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:05.280]   That's how good...
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.280]   If I...
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:08.000]   Can I play the Uber ad?
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   Here.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000]   This is from ad age.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   This is the Uber ad.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.720]   I'll play it a little bit, but I'll play it like in a little window.
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:16.720]   There's the piano music.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:17.720]   Very important.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:21.320]   Kind of the minor key.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:24.200]   People looking out a window, waving.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:26.160]   They're all sheltering at home.
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:27.160]   They're sad.
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.200]   They're eating on their roof.
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.360]   They've got a dog, but nothing much else.
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:35.160]   Look, she's handling the box with tongs.
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.760]   Resuming each other.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:41.200]   Oh, they've turned their house into a playground for the children.
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:45.120]   Playing frisbee, washing, foods, dancing.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.320]   This is the Uber ad.
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.760]   There's no cars in the Uber ad.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.120]   There's just a lot of people at home, actually.
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:52.120]   Somebody painting a heart on their window.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:54.280]   A dog licking yoga.
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.280]   People...
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.280]   Which dogs do?
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.600]   Eating the toilet paper.
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.800]   There she is giving her husband a shave.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.440]   That's not going to happen, Lisa.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:02.440]   They're hugging.
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:03.440]   She's pregnant.
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:04.440]   She's looking out the window.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.160]   People looking out the window now.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.120]   Now there's a little baby looking out the window.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.280]   There's an old man looking out the window.
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:14.480]   And then stay home for everyone who can't.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:18.200]   Thank you for not riding with Uber.
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:19.600]   It's the nicest thing Uber has done.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:20.840]   It's a wild ad.
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.240]   Thank you for not riding with Uber.
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:28.840]   You see, I put in the rundown chat of the dog's courage is beautiful.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.840]   Dove's always been good on that kind of thing.
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:31.840]   Dove's been good on this.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.880]   So, Dove, this is the poor healthcare workers.
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:37.640]   They're these massive world stuff on their faces just get mangled by it.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.640]   So they...
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.640]   And so they said...
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:40.640]   Dove beauty products.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.640]   No, no, no, no.
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:42.640]   Don't be cynical.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:43.640]   No, I'm not cynical.
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:46.760]   Oh, you should be cynical when it comes to Dove.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:47.760]   They're hard to tell.
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:48.760]   Well, that's what Stachem says.
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:49.760]   They're hard to tell.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.520]   Stachem says, "Always remember, I'm a brand.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.440]   I'm trying to sell you frozen meat product."
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.040]   But there's good brands.
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.040]   But there's good brands.
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:59.840]   All of our sponsors, for instance, are good brands.
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.680]   They are indeed.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.200]   I love you.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.080]   I know you wrote this, Jeff.
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:10.120]   "Sneutie times journos ask is Twitter good?"
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:16.200]   And it's a panel discussion among really mostly cooking and style columnists at the New York
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.520]   Times about, "Is Twitter good again?"
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.280]   Kind of, yeah.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.880]   I don't want to spook it by writing about this.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:28.040]   I think part of it is just the absence of feeling of dread that you should be doing something
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.160]   better with your life.
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:33.760]   You know, every time I read Twitter, and I got to just follow different people, I guess,
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:35.880]   I get depressed.
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:38.040]   It's depressing for me.
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:41.400]   You don't follow enough corgi columns.
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:45.240]   Or I don't know if that's going to help.
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:50.960]   Twitter is like wonderful for pictures of dogs and adorable things.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:55.040]   But then the bad stuff sneaks in too.
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:58.920]   Well, I mean, that's the way the world is.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:01.600]   Yeah, but I don't need to go there.
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.840]   It's like when you're meditating, you choose what to focus on.
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:07.480]   You're like, "I see this and I'm letting that go.
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:09.760]   I see this and we'll embrace it."
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:12.760]   So okay, let's just do a little sample of my Twitter feed.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:17.840]   Elon Musk tweets, "There are now 420 operational Starlink satellites."
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.520]   Because let's help you here.
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.520]   Unfollow Elon Musk.
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:21.520]   Let's start with it.
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:22.520]   I just want to point this out.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.760]   I just want to point this out.
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:24.760]   That sounds like it.
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:26.280]   But you follow board Elon Musk.
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:27.800]   Yeah, I do actually follow.
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.400]   So this sounds like, "Oh, that's cool.
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.400]   They've got 420."
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:34.720]   And then you realize 420 is code for marijuana smoking.
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:37.080]   And so he's doing a marijuana joke.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.480]   Okay, you're right.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:40.480]   Unfollow.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.480]   Okay.
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:42.480]   All right.
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:43.480]   You're right.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:44.480]   All right.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.480]   Now, let's do it.
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.480]   He'll fix this up.
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:47.480]   Now, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:48.480]   While you do that, you're going to replace it with a corgi.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.480]   You got to replace it with a corgi.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:54.480]   Every time a Twitter feed dies, a corgi gets its wings.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:55.480]   Okay.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:56.480]   Yes.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:00.080]   I'm not a fan of corgis, but all right.
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.680]   Don't, don't, don't.
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:08.080]   Here's this guy by corgi named Duke from Eduardo Erolis.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.360]   That is not a corgi, but it is adorable.
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.040]   It isn't a corgi, is it?
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:15.800]   So this is this even even corgi Twitter is full of liars.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.800]   That's not a corgi either.
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.040]   Oh my goodness.
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:26.440]   A corgi smeared with jam and passed out on the floor after eating too much jam.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.440]   Okay.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:32.120]   Here's a, now these are corgis.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:34.680]   This is a group of corgis is called a coorganization.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.680]   Okay.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:36.680]   I'm not following corgi stuff.
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:37.680]   Do you feel better now?
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:39.320]   No, it feels a little bit better.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.760]   No, that's horrible.
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.720]   Well, then what?
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.680]   Here's, here's another one that I like.
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:49.360]   VCs congratulating themselves quoting my hero Paul Graham.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.960]   That's a, by the way, a good feat.
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:54.600]   This is Paul Graham within YC.
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:57.360]   We effectively reinvented last names.
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:02.400]   So many founders share the same first names that we started saying, for example, Steve
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:08.360]   from Reddit, which is exactly what Steve do Reddit means in French or Steve Von Reddit
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.560]   in German.
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:13.520]   Capone Graham is usually a little more profound than that.
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:14.520]   Okay.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:15.520]   There's father Robert.
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:16.520]   He thinks he has.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:20.960]   He's got MFing snakes in his MFing broadband box.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:21.960]   Yeesh.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:23.600]   That's got, oh yeah, they love that there.
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.800]   It's got worms, squirrels like it too.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:26.800]   Yeah.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.960]   That's going to slow it down.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:30.720]   Oh, Peter Frampton, 70 years old.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:32.520]   Peter apparently doesn't know how to use Twitter.
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:37.200]   See, he's, he's, quote, his cutoff, but I'll click it so we get the whole thing.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:38.200]   70.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.200]   He's 70.
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:40.960]   Peter Frampton comes alive.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:41.960]   Okay.
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:42.960]   Fine.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:43.960]   How things work?
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.680]   This is how machine learning checks if you're social distancing properly.
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:47.880]   See this is good.
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:50.160]   There's probably somebody from you, from you.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.840]   Do you follow Quanta magazine?
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:52.920]   This is what I saw earlier.
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:54.920]   I like Quanta magazine.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:55.920]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:56.920]   See these people?
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:57.920]   Not, not so they're red.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:58.920]   Oh, look at all the red boxes.
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:00.960]   These people are bad, bad.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:01.960]   So what do we do?
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:02.960]   We get a mobile cop.
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:03.960]   We get a mobile cop.
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:04.960]   Right.
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:07.800]   See, I walk next to my wife because, you know, I've already got her germs.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:08.800]   Right.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:10.800]   I don't know.
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.840]   And then there's Trump, which I don't want to see.
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:13.840]   Okay.
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:14.840]   Joel, a friend.
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.280]   I know art when I see it.
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:20.240]   It's a helicopter chase on this freeway for one of the 405.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:21.240]   Okay.
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.800]   There's my friend, Ant.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:23.800]   So that's okay.
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:24.800]   Ants.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:25.800]   Good.
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:26.800]   Stake them.
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:27.800]   From Stake them.
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:28.800]   Pris Hayes is God.
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:30.800]   Pris Hayes.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:36.120]   He's one of those MSNBC guys, Jim Acosta from CNN, right?
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:39.480]   He's a White House correspondent for, is it CNN?
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:42.880]   Can we ask Fauci what he thinks of possible second wave during flu season?
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.520]   Why is he asking this on Twitter?
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:47.000]   Jim, you're in the briefing.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.760]   Why are you asking this on Twitter?
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:49.760]   Why?
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:50.760]   Why?
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:55.520]   So what was happening was Redfield, the head of the CDC, I think, was moving on.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:30:01.000]   I don't have the sound on, but I'm guessing he had to walk the plank, as Fauci did before.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.240]   Oh, poor Fauci.
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:09.240]   Because Redfield said the second wave is going to be worse and Trump was enraged.
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:12.240]   Trump is enraged should be the Twitter motto.
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.240]   Mm-hmm.
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.240]   All right.
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:16.320]   See, I'm already- I don't follow Trump.
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.120]   Well I don't follow him, but you can't avoid him.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.120]   I refuse to.
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.120]   You can't avoid him.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:22.120]   It's all-
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.360]   Yes, you retweet him sometimes.
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:27.080]   I actually will- I refuse to follow him.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:30.080]   I will get angry and scream at him, but that's why somebody is-
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:34.000]   See, people like you get Trump in my feed.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.920]   I don't like Twitter.
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:40.560]   Well, Ant, Ant, you know, a filter-
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.960]   I should only- Yeah, I should only follow Ant.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:45.240]   That's what I should do.
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.960]   That's the filter.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:50.680]   This is scary, but it's okay.
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:55.520]   I'm going to consider the source, which is a very progressive left-leaning publication
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.680]   called In These Times.
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:02.880]   The head of the postal workers union says the postal service could be dead in three months.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:03.880]   The postal-
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:04.880]   Yeah, that's old.
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:05.880]   The postal-
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:06.880]   June.
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.120]   No, this is April 16th, 2020.
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:09.120]   The postal service can't-
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:10.120]   No, but-
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:11.120]   What?
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:14.960]   Sorry, the story is that they were talking about it when Trump-
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:17.080]   But there's going to be money?
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:19.960]   There's going to be money for the postal service.
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.480]   No, there's not-
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:26.600]   He denied it, so they were like, "Well, then the postal service will shut down by June."
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:28.640]   So the story itself is not new.
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:29.640]   Sorry.
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:30.640]   Okay.
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:31.640]   So I shouldn't worry about it.
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:32.640]   Right, no.
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:35.160]   The postal service is going to be just fine, right?
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.560]   A lot of people did buy stamps.
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.720]   Which is just so means.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:43.480]   If the postal service is gone, that stamp is worthless.
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:45.840]   I just want to point out.
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:49.080]   The FedEx and UPS are not going to honor your postal service stamp.
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:50.920]   We will still have-
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:53.600]   I think we constitutionally don't we have to?
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:57.560]   Isn't it in the US Constitution of the United States of America that there was-
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:59.040]   Well, what does that mean anymore?
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:00.040]   Well, all right.
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:03.040]   We're supposed to have three arms of government, too.
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.040]   Zoom, okay.
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:06.800]   You say I'm angry, Stacey.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:07.800]   Yes, I know.
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:08.800]   Yes.
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:09.800]   I'm angry.
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:11.760]   I don't listen to this show because it's like more Twitter.
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:15.800]   Well, let's leave Twitter and let's go back to talk.
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:18.840]   We're talking about- Do we have a change log?
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:20.880]   Let's- You know what, Jeff?
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:24.120]   Do you have that- the drummers and those horn guys?
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:25.120]   Bring them in.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.120]   Let's do the thing.
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.520]   How do you play a trumpet with a mask on?
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:29.520]   That's a hard thing.
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:30.520]   It's not well played.
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:31.520]   Listen, you can tell.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.680]   That's quite well done.
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:41.200]   Google has added a feature in- I don't know.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:42.680]   Do you want this?
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:44.680]   It's rolling out slowly.
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:48.560]   We're going to change the sensitivity of the Hey Google.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:51.480]   Oh, I 100% do.
[01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:53.960]   Is your Google responding too quickly?
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.920]   No, it's not responding fast enough.
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:57.920]   Oh, you want to turn up the sensor?
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.920]   Oh, you want to be- Oh.
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:02.400]   Yeah, because I walk downstairs and there's one.
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:05.720]   I don't know what it is about the acoustics or the- I don't know.
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:08.200]   But I'm always constantly- I'm right next to it.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:10.040]   I'm like, Hey, G, what's the weather?
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:12.160]   Because it's right by my front door before I walk the dog.
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.680]   So I'm like, no coat.
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:16.680]   And it's- I always have to like shout it.
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:18.200]   So I'm proud of this.
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:20.240]   So this is not available to everybody.
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:25.440]   When it is available, it will be on the app in the privacy section.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.200]   It's got a new settings page.
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.960]   You got a little slider.
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.960]   A little slider.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:33.400]   You got in the middle, you got default.
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.520]   In the left, you got least sensitive on the right.
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:38.680]   You got most sensitive and that's per speaker.
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:42.000]   So I can see that you would want this maybe if you've got a speaker in the living room.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.600]   It's always waking up with a TV show.
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.480]   You would make it less sensitive.
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:50.920]   And then for you, when you walk the dog, the one nearest there, you'd make it more sensitive.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:55.640]   Does that mean- I don't know what more sensitive means though.
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:57.440]   Like it's listening harder?
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:02.480]   I assume- No, I assume it will be less discriminatory.
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:04.280]   It might generate more false positives.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:05.880]   I'll see if I can turn it on and tell you.
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:06.960]   That's a good question.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.960]   That's a good- that's a good answer.
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:12.240]   Google Fi is getting eSim support.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:18.040]   That means you can use it on your new iPhone.
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:25.440]   I don't think it'll still do the secret sauce of Fi is that it goes between T-Mobile Sprint
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:29.440]   and US Cellular or Wi-Fi depending on what works better.
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:34.720]   I don't know if you have to have special hardware to do that or not, but at least you
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:37.120]   don't need a SIM.
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:42.360]   You could set it up by going online, which is nice.
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:46.600]   That's a feature of the new iPhone or all the iPhones is they have eSims, no physical
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:48.520]   SIM.
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:52.000]   And Google Fi is a very good choice for data, actually, I think.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.720]   I have it on my iPad, but I put a SIM in, but I guess I don't have to anymore.
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:58.520]   So that's nice.
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:03.680]   In, for example, India, they have mostly phones with two SIMs.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:06.600]   Is the iPhone and India have two SIMs or?
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:10.000]   Yes, I think they have a dual-sim iPhone for India.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.560]   You kind of have to in India because the areas covered by carriers, first of all, there
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.880]   are many, many carriers and the areas covered are small.
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:20.960]   So it's not unusual at all that you would have different carriers depending on where
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:24.320]   you are in your neighborhood.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:28.520]   But Facebook, we'll go back to, I guess, in a second, Facebook's been a fortune investing
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:29.520]   in India and post-op.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.520]   Oh, yes, that's our next story.
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.520]   After we finish.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:32.520]   Okay, fine.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:35.600]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:42.440]   There is an old adage that no computer program has ever really done until it can fetch email.
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:45.160]   Google Meet is adding Gmail integration.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:47.160]   Oh, not going to help.
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:50.000]   Just what you needed.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.680]   Grid layout and improved low lighting quality and more meat, of course, is the app that
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.240]   is getting a lot of usage.
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:58.920]   We do a lot of Google Meetings now.
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.520]   It's been crap for me.
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:01.800]   It's not good as good as Zoom.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:09.920]   I think, and by the way, I should mention Zoom has really gone the extra mile to improve
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:10.920]   security.
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:12.400]   They just released version 5.0.
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:16.400]   As we mentioned last week, Alex Stamos, well-known head of security at Yahoo!
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:20.680]   And Facebook, don't blame him for all the bad stuff that happened, he says.
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:22.760]   But he came in as a consultant.
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:28.320]   They hired a former Microsoft security person who's really good as a Katie Missouri.
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:31.000]   Very, very, very good.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.200]   They've rewritten, they're really working on improving their security.
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:41.600]   So I feel like Zoom, because it is the easiest to use and because everybody you know wants
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.640]   to use Zoom, it was really important.
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:45.600]   It's an opportunity for Zoom.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:48.120]   And the good news is they took it seriously and they seemed to have done that thing.
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:50.840]   I had a two and a half hour call with somebody in Vienna.
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:55.040]   And her sound kept going off.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:56.040]   I couldn't figure out what it was.
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:57.040]   The video was fine.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:00.320]   I don't know if it was Zoom or if it was her machine.
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:03.120]   But it was very weird.
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:08.280]   YouTube is going to YouTube music, which is replaced in many cases Google music.
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.560]   And if it hasn't yet, it will for you.
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:14.560]   Has added a new tab.
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:16.360]   Explore.
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:18.200]   Explore.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.360]   So I have subscribed, in fact I'll do it right now.
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:23.560]   I've subscribed to Google music forever.
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:28.280]   And all of the features I guess are slowly migrating over.
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.280]   Let me see.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:30.360]   Oh, I don't have the new tab yet.
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:33.360]   I don't have an explore tab.
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:37.080]   But maybe someday soon I will.
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:39.600]   Music discovery is actually a fairly important thing.
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:43.840]   One of the things, Spotify keeps winning, not because they have more songs.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:46.800]   Everybody's got the same libraries roughly.
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:50.520]   Not because maybe the user interface, but because of their playlist capability, which
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:52.440]   people love.
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:56.800]   And I think because of the Discover Weekly playlist that they make every week for you.
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:57.880]   So you can discover new music.
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:02.240]   I think that's a really important part of any music service.
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:06.800]   And Google's probably looking over their shoulder at Spotify saying, how can we be more
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:07.800]   like them?
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.320]   This will replace the now-defy-
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:10.480]   Well, it's Spotify.
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:11.480]   Go ahead.
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:15.000]   I was going to say they were first with lots of integrations.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.040]   Like remember how you used to only get Google music in like Google-y places?
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:21.040]   Right.
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:26.640]   So I think that's another advantage as an independent purveyor of streaming music and
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:29.680]   having the widest catalog for a while.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:32.440]   I think that's kind of that helped it.
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:35.400]   I'm going to run down a rat hole real quickly here.
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:38.800]   But then I'll get back to the change log.
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:43.080]   But Sonos, which was the king of all this, has announced they're going to do a radio
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:45.080]   station.
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:48.160]   Sonos radio, it's a free streaming music service.
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:49.720]   It has a lot of radio stations.
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:55.240]   They're going to combine not all but many of the radio stations on iHeart and CBS and
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:57.040]   radio.com.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.760]   They'll also have their own Beats 1 style station.
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:05.640]   Apple has a station on their music thing that will play music.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:08.360]   Again, this is I think is about discovery.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:14.280]   Of course Sonos people still trying to find some value in that overpriced speaker.
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:15.280]   Customers can listen.
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:16.280]   I feel bad.
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:20.840]   Worldwide, Jeff via the Sonos app on their Sonos devices and will be located in the
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:21.840]   room.
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:22.840]   What do you do?
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:24.840]   Global radio stations available for our customers.
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:28.840]   Sonos's original programming will be available in the US, Canada, UK, Ireland and Australia
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:31.040]   starting yesterday.
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.040]   So I'll have to try it.
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:34.040]   It's available now.
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:39.280]   There'll also be ad free artist stations, Pandora style.
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:42.520]   The first station will be centered around too bad.
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:44.720]   Radiohead frontman Tom York.
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:47.000]   Is that okay Jeff?
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000]   He's okay, right?
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.320]   I think that would appeal to a lot of these.
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:53.160]   Most buyers out there.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:54.160]   Probably.
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:55.640]   Radiohead, we love it.
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:57.120]   Brittany Howard of Alabama shakes.
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:58.120]   I like them.
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:59.120]   David Byrne.
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:00.120]   Love him.
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:03.280]   And third man records are going to be new artist stations launching regularly.
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.560]   So that's just a, it's not a Google.
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:10.080]   It's not a Google, but it's a sideline related to the new explore tab in YouTube music.
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:18.360]   And finally, the Google Play Store is pushing health and fitness apps.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:22.680]   And Android TV gets a stay mindful and fit row.
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:24.280]   I don't know anybody uses Android TV.
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:25.280]   I do.
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:26.280]   I have a shield.
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:27.280]   So there's a new row.
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:31.880]   The whole thing is organized around rows and it'll be a get mindful and fit row.
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:33.680]   You know, there is actually a good reason to do that.
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:34.680]   See, look at that.
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:35.680]   You got your Peloton.
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:37.960]   You got your dance fitness with Jessica.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:39.960]   These are all I think mostly paid.
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:41.400]   But anyway, there it is.
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:43.040]   Your home.
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:45.600]   Your stay mindful and fit row.
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:51.240]   It is the case, I believe that your prognosis if you get COVID and aren't we all going to get
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:52.400]   it eventually?
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:41:00.720]   It is better if you are fit and you do a lot of aerobic exercise so your lungs are strong.
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:01.800]   Excellent.
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:04.040]   So do it.
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:07.480]   And that out there that get the drums.
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:08.560]   Drummers stop smoking.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:09.560]   It's time.
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:10.960]   Get off your break.
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:13.320]   That's the Google change lock.
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:18.480]   What a kettle drum.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:22.400]   Now we can talk about the big acquisition from Facebook.
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.400]   Well, not even an acquisition.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:25.400]   Or an investment.
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:27.960]   Yeah, they only have 10% of it.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:29.640]   10% for a lot of money.
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:33.200]   But for $5.7 billion.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:34.240]   Wow.
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:36.920]   What is this thing that they bought?
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:38.000]   Phone company.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000]   It's a phone company.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000]   I bought 10% of a phone company.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.160]   Which is affiliate of the largest company in India.
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:51.520]   And the thinking is that they acquired, is it geo?
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:53.280]   Is that how you pronounce it?
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:55.800]   They acquired geo because they want to beef up.
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:56.800]   They didn't acquire.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:57.800]   They got 10%.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:58.800]   I'm sorry.
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:41:59.800]   Pardon me.
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:05.600]   Invested in geo because of online payments.
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:06.760]   And right now they are.
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:09.960]   Yes, they're building WeChat is what they're doing for India.
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:10.960]   That's right.
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:12.720]   And they are not a big player.
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:13.760]   They're not a big player yet.
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:15.280]   So they got to do some aqua.
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:17.880]   I'm sorry.
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:19.880]   Investments.
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:20.880]   Investments.
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:24.840]   Just say they bought them as if you want to acquisition acquired a minority stake.
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:26.280]   They acquired a minority stake.
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.280]   10% not that much.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.280]   Okay, fine.
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:29.280]   Just but it was a lot of money.
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:30.840]   It's a freaking long.
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:31.840]   It's the biggest.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:34.440]   It's the biggest cash haul that Facebook.
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:35.440]   How much did they get?
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:36.440]   Instagram for one billion.
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:38.280]   Instagram was one billion.
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:39.440]   No, the biggest one was WhatsApp.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:41.440]   They spent 22 billion.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:44.800]   Depending on the stock price, a lot of money on WhatsApp.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:47.640]   This is only a mere 5.7 billion.
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:48.640]   2.7.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:52.480]   And to be fair, WhatsApp was their chance to be like WeChat.
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:53.480]   Right.
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:55.840]   Well, but that's a good point Stacey.
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:58.000]   Maybe they're kind of making these.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.120]   First of all, they got the money, right?
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:01.040]   5 billion big deal.
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:05.880]   And they need to get these partnerships going so that they can make WhatsApp, which is already
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:09.560]   popular in India, but they want to make it the full featured payment thing.
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:12.280]   And there's other companies already in the sales.
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:17.440]   So I saw speculation today that Lyft prices down so far that Google has to buy it tomorrow.
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:18.840]   Of course, there's speculation.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:19.840]   I saw that too.
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:24.480]   But is there must be some real bottom-feeding opportunities now?
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:25.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:26.480]   Oh, there's tons.
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:31.200]   I mean, this is the time when lots of people in the IoT world, we're seeing lots of companies
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:40.120]   that do drone-based or remote, not monitoring, but going to view things like analysis and
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:41.920]   checking into stuff.
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:45.840]   That is off the charts high because a lot of firms are looking to buy assets.
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:51.480]   And so they're trying to get a sense of the quality of those assets because it's time
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:57.280]   to come in and, you know, I am being chided.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:59.040]   Chided I say by the chat room.
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:03.920]   No, by the chat room for having missed so many important change log items, I'll do them real
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:04.920]   quickly.
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:06.480]   Fortnite is now on the play store.
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:10.600]   Remember for a while Epic Games said we're going to sideload this.
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:11.600]   They've given up.
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:18.040]   They're going to give Google their 30% because it's so important to be on the play store.
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:25.080]   YouTube has debuted a new slate of with me originals during the coronavirus pandemic.
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:26.840]   I don't know what with me is.
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:29.200]   It's the hashtag with me campaign.
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:35.400]   For instance, the creator games presented by Mr. Beast will be a live event with a popular
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:36.400]   YouTuber.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:40.320]   I never heard of him, but okay, Mr. Beast challenges others on the platform to compete
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:43.120]   in games from their respective homes.
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:49.160]   Another example, stay home with Young Blood, a weekly series that follows the singer-songwriter
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:52.600]   in a rental apartment where he's quarantined with four friends.
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:54.480]   Oh, God.
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:59.440]   Every substitute is a distance learning show which brings in celebrities like Carly Claus
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:04.400]   and Ken Jiang to teach lessons about subjects such as coding and biology.
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:08.000]   I wonder which of the two Carly Claus is teaching.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.480]   There's a lot of these things.
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:11.200]   We're doing a thing on Friday.
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:16.800]   I should mention 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:22.920]   We're going to use this new Netflix plugin for Chrome that lets you watch along and our
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:28.600]   hosts and a variety of invited hosts will be all will all going to be watching the Tiger
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:29.600]   King together.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:30.600]   Oh, God.
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:37.440]   No, we can't play the Tiger King for you.
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:39.760]   You have to have Netflix.
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:44.680]   But if you put this plug in this Chrome plug in on, it will allow you to sync up with our
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:46.160]   view of Netflix.
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:52.200]   You'll see us watching and you can watch along and we'll all react together.
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:55.560]   Some of our hosts have never seen Tiger King.
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:57.800]   I've never seen it, but I can't watch it.
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:00.240]   Do you want to you want to join us?
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:01.240]   Nope.
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:02.240]   Nope.
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:03.240]   Come on.
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:05.560]   I can't handle those.
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:07.840]   I used to live in a place like this.
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:08.840]   Oh, okay.
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:10.240]   And I cruelty to animals.
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:11.240]   Were you in a cult?
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:12.760]   Were you a member of a cult?
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:14.520]   Was never in a cult.
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:15.520]   Okay.
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:16.520]   So down.
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:17.520]   I can live in Texas.
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:18.520]   Does that count?
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:19.520]   Yes.
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:20.520]   Go to Netflixparty.com.
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:25.840]   Netflix party plug in so you will be ready to watch Tiger King with us.
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:27.000]   You don't actually have to watch it.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:32.520]   You could just listen to us going, Oh my God.
[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:34.640]   Mystery Tiger Theater 2020.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:36.640]   Yeah, with all the Twithos.
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:38.840]   Oh, what do you see?
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:40.480]   You see the Twithos.
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:43.680]   Yeah, but you, but you don't see tight because we can't play Tiger King.
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:44.680]   Right.
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:48.000]   You can't play Tiger King, but you see a screen watching it and you can play it.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.600]   That plug in lets you play it in sync.
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:53.640]   The all ideas people get together, families get together, watch a movie together.
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:58.680]   Kind of like zooming at the same time, but this extension does it for you.
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:04.040]   Google store has refreshed product categories with Pixel Nest, Stadia and Pixelbook brands.
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:10.960]   This is the the rump Google change log provided by scooter X in the chatroom.
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:15.720]   And we're going to have to have Jeff just do a little finger drumming.
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:23.000]   So phones are now Pixel connected home is now nest gaming is now so they put brands on all
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000]   the categories.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.440]   You see the difference laptops and tablets are now Pixelbook.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:31.520]   So they're just putting their brands up there instead of the generic headers.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:34.480]   I don't know what that means.
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:37.040]   No, I wouldn't call this bager.
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:38.040]   It's yeah.
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:43.680]   I mean, okay, I mean, I missed it.
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:51.840]   Pixel has added a universal watch list for movies and TVs to Google search.
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:58.720]   So mobile users can first search what to watch to get Google suggestions organized at the
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:01.560]   top of search results.
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:02.960]   And then you can filter it by show.
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:04.680]   So here's the here's what it looks like.
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:06.320]   It's on your mobile.
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:10.360]   So you search for what to watch and then you'll get some suggestions.
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:17.880]   I don't know if that's any better than any other what to watch thing, but okay.
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:19.160]   Maybe Google's got more information.
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:20.920]   She'll propose stuff really good.
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:24.240]   I feel like there's a lot of these recommendations.
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.000]   I even get it on YouTube TV.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.360]   So maybe that's what it is.
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:29.360]   Maybe it's the YouTube TV version.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:30.360]   Okay.
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:34.360]   And now that's the rump Google change lock.
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:36.360]   Yeah, rump.
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:41.360]   Am I misusing that term?
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:44.360]   No, I think he's running session.
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:46.360]   Are you talking about the butt?
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:47.360]   No.
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:53.440]   If you have a meeting after a larger meeting, that's called the rump session.
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:55.960]   A meeting held after the right because the rump session is.
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:56.960]   So that was the right.
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:58.120]   I have never heard of this.
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:59.120]   How interesting.
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:00.120]   It continues after the meeting was adjourned.
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:02.120]   The average has the tail end.
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:04.880]   The tail is well, oh, yes, that's why it is the rump, right?
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:05.880]   That makes sense.
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:08.840]   It's the bit after the bigger bit.
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:12.480]   When the person you don't like, then you get the real business done.
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:15.480]   So we're going to do from now on a rump change log.
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:17.680]   Just to look, no, it'll never end.
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:20.680]   I think you're going to wait till I leave and then do a rump.
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:22.920]   A rump twig or twiz.
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:24.760]   All right.
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:25.760]   I want to wrap.
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:27.160]   We will be a rump twig.
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:28.160]   Why?
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:29.160]   Because it's after this one.
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:30.160]   I won't be here.
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.160]   Oh, no.
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:32.160]   And it's after this one.
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:33.160]   Where the hell are you going?
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:34.160]   You can't go anywhere.
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:36.280]   Oh, you can't go anywhere.
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:38.480]   I'm getting my Botox shots.
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:39.480]   Oh, good.
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:41.520]   I could come back with Botox and COVID.
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:45.440]   By the way, she doesn't do this for vanity, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:47.440]   She's just a very tense person.
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:51.760]   And if I did do it for vanity, that's just fine.
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:52.760]   Right.
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:53.760]   But look at her forehead.
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:54.760]   It's seamless anyway.
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:55.760]   It doesn't matter.
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:57.560]   She has no lines, although.
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:00.240]   Right now I have nothing because my video is so blurry.
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:01.760]   Yeah, we can't see anything.
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:02.760]   Yeah.
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:04.960]   OK, it's for your migraines.
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:05.960]   So good.
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:06.960]   Good luck.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:16.680]   I want to now do the rump twig, which is where we do the Stacy's Thing, Jeff's Number, and
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:24.480]   Leo's Tool starting with Stacy's Thing.
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:29.640]   Stacy's looking around like, oh, Stacy, you don't have to have a thing.
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:30.920]   Last week I had two things.
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:31.920]   But let me tell you.
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:34.520]   Let me do my thing because it's a thing you would like.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:36.000]   Oh, do your thing, yeah.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:42.880]   One of the engineers at Twilio, Christina Sunu, she's in the IoT developer community.
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:44.280]   See, this is right up your alley.
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:46.080]   She's going to be on my show next week.
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:49.200]   Oh, so my thing is your thing.
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:55.760]   She decided to build a data tracker for an internet connected sourdough starter.
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:58.200]   This is genius.
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:00.360]   And Twilio, it turns out, I didn't realize this.
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:03.360]   They have an IoT developer kit.
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:05.440]   And so she used that.
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:08.640]   It uses Twilio narrow band, which uses the cell signal.
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:09.760]   She says, why did I do that?
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:13.320]   Well, because your Wi-Fi maybe isn't perfectly reliable.
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:14.440]   It doesn't use a lot of data.
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:15.840]   It's not very expensive.
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:18.320]   You can get a Twilio account fairly.
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.720]   That's free, I think, in the developer kit.
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:22.360]   And then you'll need a LiPo battery.
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:24.240]   You'll need an Arduino.
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:32.800]   And you'll need the sourd.io GitHub repo.
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:35.280]   You also need an MQTT broker of choice.
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:37.640]   And you have to be-- I'm sorry-- in the US.
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:40.880]   No sourdough outside of the US allowed.
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:46.000]   But this is-- I mean, honestly, I don't anticipate a lot of people doing this.
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:50.480]   But it's pretty cute because what you want to do with your sourdough, you need to monitor
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:53.800]   temperature, moisture, and most importantly, size.
[01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:56.320]   And this does all of that.
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:02.120]   The humidity produced as the yeast respirates is delightfully detectable, she says.
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:03.560]   We can actually-- should we look at her monitor?
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:06.800]   Let's just see if we can see how her sourdough is going.
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:08.640]   Oh, look at that.
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:11.120]   The humidity is spiking.
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:12.560]   Temperature is very consistent.
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:15.200]   Well done, Christina.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:20.400]   Distance, which I guess is how much it's grown, is field chart 3.
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:25.520]   I think her sourdough is at a peak performance right now.
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:28.680]   But the bread monitor, nothing's happening because I guess she doesn't-- she's not baking
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:29.680]   right now.
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:31.480]   She probably has not made bread yet.
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:32.560]   No, no.
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:34.680]   She's too busy making sourdough monitors.
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:43.880]   I think this is exactly what engineers do when they're stuck at home.
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:46.000]   They make sourdough bread monitors.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000]   I love it.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.480]   And it's-- yeah, she's coming on the show next week, not just to talk about this, but to
[01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:58.040]   actually talk about how any of us-- I know a lot of people who go and buy pies or art
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:00.040]   we knows, myself included.
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:02.640]   And I'm like, yeah, I'm going to hook this up and do something with it.
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:03.640]   Right.
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:05.640]   And then I'm like--
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:06.640]   This is incredibly cool.
[01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:08.120]   So she's going to help us get over that hump.
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:09.120]   Yeah.
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:10.120]   Yeah, it's pretty cool what she did.
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:12.120]   And I imagine a nice looking thing.
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:16.000]   A 3D printer would help a little bit for the enclosure.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.480]   It goes right there on top of your sourdough, which by the way, Christina is looking mighty
[01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:23.840]   fine, mighty fine.
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:27.600]   There you go.
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:30.960]   She's planning another bread monitor in the future that connects with SuperSim, which
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:32.200]   is worldwide.
[01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:34.000]   So stay tuned.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000]   Stay tuned.
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000]   I like Twilio.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.800]   Yeah, they were sponsored by Show.
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:40.000]   Oh, love them.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.000]   I like them a lot.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000]   I love them a lot.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.800]   In fact, I've met some of their engineers.
[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:45.800]   This was like a year and a half ago.
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:49.080]   But yeah, come with it.
[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:50.080]   Nice.
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:52.080]   Jeff, do you have a--
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:56.840]   Well, I could do something boring like telling you that Netflix has almost 16 million new
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:58.600]   subscribers, double what they expected.
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:01.000]   So everybody can watch Tiger King with Leo.
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:06.560]   But instead, over earlier, I said we can't say that Twitter says this or Twitter says
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:07.560]   that.
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:11.520]   Well, according to Fox News, Twitter is going to berserk over the discovery, something you
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:14.240]   could make in your thermal mix, Leo.
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:15.240]   Yes.
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:17.560]   White Castle Pate.
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:22.040]   What is in my castle pate?
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:23.600]   That is the most disgusting thing.
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:30.160]   Going through my videos in grandma's church recipe book, 10 White Castle hamburgers, water,
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:31.920]   and sour cream for topping.
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:38.000]   Blend burgers in blender, which is where you do it, or in a thermal mix, a few at a time.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:43.280]   Dadding water is needed for a thick, hard, quotes dough.
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:49.280]   Spread into lately greased loaf pan or round mold, bake at 325 for 45 to 50 minutes, cool
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:53.160]   and unmold, serve with crackers and sour cream.
[01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:55.120]   Actually, it's probably delicious.
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:55:02.200]   Although, if I'm going to do any burrow, I'm going to blend some speculose cookies and
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:03.640]   make speculose butter.
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:05.200]   Is that not the best thing you've ever had?
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:08.200]   The best thing you've ever had.
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:09.200]   The best thing you've ever had.
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:10.840]   Actually, the speculose is a little too sweet.
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:11.840]   It is too sweet.
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:15.000]   It is, but it's still delicious.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000]   I have a hard time with it.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.000]   Delicious.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.240]   Jeff, I want to vomit now, but I found a thing for y'all.
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:22.240]   Oh, oh, no.
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:24.280]   I always forget stuff like this.
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:25.280]   Good.
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:26.280]   Yes.
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:29.520]   I figured this is more of a Leo thing, but since Leo did a Stacy thing, I feel okay.
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:30.520]   Fair enough.
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:33.520]   Fair enough.
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:37.160]   We all know about Rosetta at home and folding at home.
[01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:42.080]   Both projects trying to take proteins and analyze them on behalf of science for COVID-19.
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:45.680]   Everybody's like, "Yeah, I'm going to do this now.
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:46.680]   Yay."
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:51.200]   But you can only do it on PCs until Bologna.
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:54.960]   They are a container management software for IoT companies.
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:57.080]   They actually ported this to ARM.
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:01.160]   Now, you can do these jobs on a Pi or not on Arduino.
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:04.200]   You do need some pretty significant memory.
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:07.200]   But now you can do it on some of your random ones.
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:12.720]   Say you bought a Pi and you thought you were going to make a sourdio, sourdio thing.
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:13.720]   Sourdio.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:16.280]   But instead, you were like, "I'll do it later."
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:19.360]   Right now, you could just put it to work doing some folding at home.
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:20.680]   With your old laptop or Raspberry.
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:22.720]   I do have a spare Raspberry Pi.
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:24.120]   Of course you do.
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:27.560]   This is a small network right now, only 1,221 computers.
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:29.320]   Maybe we can add to it.
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:32.480]   It's foldforCOVID.io.
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:35.000]   FoldforCOVID.io.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:39.480]   I know somebody who's going to put that to use in another way.
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:40.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:41.680]   Bring in other people to contribute.
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:43.680]   I won't even say the best.
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:47.960]   So let me ask you because, I mean, why not?
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:54.120]   Except that, is this really helping anything, this folding at home or Rosetta?
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:57.640]   Because it is using a lot of power, like a lot.
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:58.640]   Like, yeah.
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:01.560]   I know it's the most powerful computer ever.
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:06.920]   But is it, I mean, is anything coming of this or are we just all just kind of burning candles
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:07.920]   in the business?
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:11.440]   Well, they're assigning jobs and analysis.
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:14.640]   So there is a central unit that's assigning people to say that.
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:15.640]   No, I'm going to look at all that.
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:21.800]   So if, I mean, the idea is that everybody looks at all this stuff in their spare, a few
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:22.800]   time.
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:23.800]   Maybe we'll find something.
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:24.800]   Okay.
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:27.760]   Like, SETI at home found all those aliens.
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:31.520]   Well, maybe there are no aliens to find or maybe they don't want to be found.
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:32.520]   Okay.
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:33.520]   So it's, yeah, I'm all right.
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:35.200]   Would you want to be found by us?
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:36.200]   No.
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:37.200]   You want to hide?
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:38.200]   I just-
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:39.680]   And maybe we don't want to be found.
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:40.680]   Let's be real.
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:43.800]   I mean, if it's, I don't know the people put this together.
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:47.000]   It used to be at Stanford and then some guy took it and now it's somewhere else.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.720]   And I just, I want it to, I want it to be good and useful.
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:56.240]   But it is using an on-trivial amount of electricity.
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:02.520]   And as long as it's good, you saw my friend who wants to bring this to another arena to
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:04.200]   get shared computing power.
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:12.520]   And I were talking about this and, you know, I mentioned things like efforts to deal with
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:19.240]   analyzing genomes of COVID, the computing power.
[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:20.240]   Cool.
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:21.240]   It could be useful.
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:22.240]   Maybe it's not.
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:23.240]   I mean, it's just using computer.
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:24.240]   Oh, it is using computing power.
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:29.560]   I have seen there was a company at CES that used computing power to like keep people's
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:31.760]   homes while folding.
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:32.760]   So-
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:34.960]   So thank you, Karsten.
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:36.160]   He sent me a subreddit.
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:38.200]   There's great subreddits on Reddit.
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:41.360]   And this is one I actually follow called Ask Science.
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:43.560]   And this was posted eight years ago.
[01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:44.560]   But okay.
[01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:45.560]   Okay.
[01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:48.080]   You know, folding on home has been around for 20 years.
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:50.120]   Has folding at home really accomplished anything?
[01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:56.200]   And response again, eight years ago from a guy who does unequivocally, yes, I do drug
[01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:57.680]   discovery.
[01:58:57.680 --> 01:59:00.760]   One important part is knowing the molecular target, which requires precise knowledge
[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:03.040]   of structural elements of complex proteins.
[01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:07.760]   By the way, it's that's the same kind of thing we have to solve with COVID-19.
[01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:11.400]   Some of these are solved by X-ray crystallography, but folding at home has solved several naughty
[01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:15.440]   problems for proteins that are not amenable to this approach.
[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:21.000]   One line is we are actively designing drugs based on the solutions of folding at home.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.520]   And that's just in my particular research.
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:28.160]   So and then there's another guy with cancer drug discovery.
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:31.880]   He says sometimes you really need sheer computing power.
[01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:36.880]   And that's what you get from these giant, you know, clusters of computing.
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:44.400]   So I'm going to amend my cynical comments and say, yes, it's worth doing.
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:45.400]   So fold for COVID.
[01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:50.160]   Well, there is someone actually in the comments talking about what you talked about.
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:54.040]   Maybe it's not the most efficient way of going about this, but it's the way we have
[01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:57.320]   because all of our super efficient supercomputers are already doing other things.
[01:59:57.320 --> 02:00:01.000]   They're busy doing other things, you know, going through.
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.400]   They're modeling climate change.
[02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:03.400]   Yeah, stuff like that.
[02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:04.400]   Yeah.
[02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:12.120]   I am going to end the show with a fine tweet from Rex Chapman.
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:15.440]   "Quarantine stuntmen."
[02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:19.200]   Are you ready for two minutes and 17 minutes of stuntmen who don't have any movies to be
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:21.480]   in watch and enjoy?
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:28.280]   Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this episode of this week in Rump Google.
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:36.120]   Thank you for joining me.
[02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:37.640]   And I encourage you.
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:39.080]   17 minutes of this.
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:40.080]   There's a lot of it.
[02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:46.080]   I encourage you to follow Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter and a Medium and at BuzzMachine.com.
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:53.600]   He is, of course, a highly esteemed holder of the Townite Chair for Entrepreneurial Journalism
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:59.760]   at the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark School for Graduate Journalism.
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:01.560]   And there's some stuntmen.
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:02.560]   And we're in there.
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:05.360]   Somewhere in there is the City University of New York.
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:06.760]   Thank you, Stacey Hickenbotham.
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:08.360]   Always a pleasure.
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:10.080]   I guess Stacey on the Twitter.
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:12.600]   And of course, Stacey on IOT.com is our website.
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:17.880]   Subscribe to our free newsletter and follow them for the IOT podcast.
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:18.880]   I'm excited.
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:19.880]   I'm going to listen to the Twilio.
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:21.720]   Christina is going to be great next time.
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:22.720]   She's next week, obviously.
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:24.520]   Next week on the IOT podcast.
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:26.880]   You can get all that at Stacey on IOT.com.
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:27.880]   Watch.
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:33.080]   They're still fighting for...
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:38.760]   So if you aren't watching, what we're seeing here is a bunch of stunt people punching the
[02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:43.600]   camera and then the next stuntman takes over as if he got punched and then responds,
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:44.600]   "What?"
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:47.040]   Oh, he's got to clean his hands first.
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:48.040]   Okay.
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:49.040]   Very important.
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:50.040]   And then responds back.
[02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:51.040]   That was nice talk.
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:53.560]   This is actually really, really, really a cute video.
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:54.560]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:59.760]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, round 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2030 UTC.
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:02.280]   You can watch us do it live at Twit.tv/live.

[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:36.360]   Even if you watch it live, subscribe because it's good.
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:37.360]   It's good.
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:39.160]   And you want to hear it again.
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:41.800]   This week in Zeitgeist Show.
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:43.600]   Sorry about the bad theme music.
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:45.640]   Did Jason say do some yell-
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:46.640]   No, I don't know.
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:49.640]   I think he needs the boss to tell him to.
[02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:50.640]   Okay.
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:52.160]   That might cost extra.
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:54.320]   Yeah, I think that's true.
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:55.320]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:56.320]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:57.320]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:02:57.320 --> 02:02:58.320]   Have a great, safe week.
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:02:59.320]   We'll see you next time on this week.
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:00.320]   Bye.
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:01.320]   Bye.
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:03.820]   (light music)
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:06.400]   (upbeat music)
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:08.980]   (gentle music)
