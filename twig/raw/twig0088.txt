[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.480]   The show that covers Google and the Cloud.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.000]   And of course, we couldn't do it without our great panelists
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.760]   starting with Gina Trapani from San Diego, California.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.960]   Greetings.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.600]   Blogger@smarterwear.org.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.480]   It's great to see you.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.040]   She's a glee.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.160]   But see you too.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.840]   Proud to be gleeked.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.000]   Oh, yes, of course.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.600]   Oh, yes.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.520]   And Jeff Jarvis also here.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.800]   It's always good to have Jeff on the ranch, on the reservation.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.760]   His book is due out in two days, the final edit.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.680]   Well, not do out, do from me.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.560]   Yeah.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.840]   You're due out of your hands into the hands of the giant--
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.200]   enormous metal machine that will--
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.200]   do they still use hot metal?
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.760]   No, no, no.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.080]   They should.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.280]   I want a letterpress version of your book.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.840]   I like that.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.120]   I like to feel the type on the page.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.480]   Yes.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.800]   Hey, we've got a Googler with us.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.960]   I'm very happy to welcome the Uber tech lead for search
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.120]   quality and user happiness, Dan Russell.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.480]   Dan, it's good to have you.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.160]   Good and Todd?
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.200]   It's good to see you too.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.640]   Does the card actually say Uber tech lead?
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.240]   My card actually says Uber tech lead with the UM-Lout--
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.440]   With the UM-Louty--
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.120]   where's church quality and user happiness?
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.240]   Wow.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.720]   That's not even a tweet.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.960]   I mean, it's just too long.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.560]   Right.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.720]   I can barely fit it on your lower third graphic on the video.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.480]   It's stretching out.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.560]   We had to combine, concatenate search quality
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.480]   and user happiness into a Germanic single word.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.600]   And only on this show would we use concatenate
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.600]   and ascentance.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.720]   That's true.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.040]   I will try, I love this show.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.920]   This is a smarter show than your average geek escapade.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.960]   So Dan, how do you quantify user happiness?
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.600]   And how does search quality lead to user happiness?
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.680]   Well, I think you know that people
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.320]   are pretty happy as they're searching.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.360]   This is one of the reasons why Google is where it is.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.480]   The quality part is--
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.720]   it was the career we response.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.560]   It was a search engine results page.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.520]   I actually contain the stuff you care about.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.160]   Happiness, well, comes from a lot of things.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.840]   One thing it comes from is whether or not
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.440]   you get that sense of delight.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.320]   So if you, for example, did weather San Diego,
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.040]   you would instantly get this sort of--
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.040]   what we call the one box result at the top,
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.680]   this sort of little cartoony thing that shows you.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.800]   It's that stuff that you don't anticipate.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.320]   You type in something like 23 euros in USD
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.000]   and it converts it pretty automatically.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.240]   You might not have expected that.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.440]   But that's a kind of delight.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.720]   That's a kind of way of making people happy.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.040]   We spend a lot of time and effort
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.560]   to make sure we do that on a constant day-to-day basis.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.560]   So things like the Uber Tech Leoger,
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.080]   which appear to be mere whimsy, actually--
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.400]   there's a philosophy behind that.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.960]   It's about delighting.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.160]   The Google doodles, the graphical elements
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.680]   in the search results page, all of that
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.560]   is really consciously put together
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.320]   to create an experience for the end user.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.480]   I hesitate to use deliberate and happiness
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.240]   in the same sentences, but yes, it's a very conscious,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.160]   thought-out thing that we want.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.760]   It's a part of our brand we want to preserve.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.440]   It's interesting.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.480]   Is that from day one?
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.720]   Jeff, you would probably know.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.800]   Is that from day one?
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.400]   I don't know.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.080]   Dan, I don't know better.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.000]   How long have you been at Google, Dan?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.240]   I've been here about five and a half years now.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.240]   In a group of terms, that's an old term.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.600]   For a happiness job.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.280]   How do you prepare for happiness, Jeff?
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.720]   Wow.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.240]   The drug's really good out there.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.520]   And who did you work for before?
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.840]   Charlie and the chocolate factory?
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.600]   I mean--
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.160]   Kind of.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.360]   I worked at Apple for five years.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.960]   OK, they're experts in the same thing.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.480]   I worked at Xerox Park for 12 years, and I worked at IBM.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.960]   Well, you have quite a--
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.640]   That was your unhappy period, I agree.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.160]   It just proves I can't hold a job.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.640]   What'd you do at Park?
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.960]   Kind of the same stuff.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.520]   I was not a user happiness researcher there,
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.080]   but I did human computer interaction.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.160]   The key problem at that time was we
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.720]   were building big hairy copiers for Xerox.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.920]   And big hairy computer systems and all this.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.040]   And we were trying to figure out,
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.680]   how can we make that simple and easy to understand?
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.880]   And that sort of led to a large part of the info-vis world.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.040]   How do we make the graphics, the computer graphics,
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.760]   the interaction so that you can actually explore data,
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.360]   you can understand it.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.280]   It led to things like the Xerox stars.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.200]   You remember that?
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.680]   The Alto.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.240]   Yes, the Alto predated that, but yeah, exactly.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.600]   How can we make all that stuff easy to use,
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.680]   easy to understand?
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.520]   That's what I changed.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.720]   Gina just took Edward Tuftey's class.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.520]   Oh, I saw it.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.040]   I did.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.560]   I did.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.440]   It was really good.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.960]   So it sounds like user happiness is about Google
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.560]   trying to anticipate-- and this is--
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.840]   Jeff talks about this a lot-- Google
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.200]   trying to anticipate what it is the user is looking for
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.120]   and getting that moment of like, oh, yeah,
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.680]   that's exactly what I wanted.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.640]   Maybe a step sooner than I thought I was going
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.960]   to have to click off to weather.com
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.600]   to get the temperature in San Diego, which, by the way,
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.760]   will always make you happy.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.160]   But it's right there on the page.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.240]   And sort of along the lines of instant, Google Instant
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.080]   often delights me and knows what I make suggestions.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.360]   Well, there's Google Suggests and then Google Instant.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.040]   And it sort of knows where I'm going with a query that
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.280]   has words that could have many meanings.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.760]   Right.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.480]   So that's exactly right.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.360]   That's one way-- if we could read your mind in some way
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.240]   or sort of help to press what's coming next, that would be great.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.640]   And so instant is exactly that.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.400]   It's one of those things where, as you type,
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.760]   it's running the query in the background.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.600]   And often, it will give you the results
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.960]   before you realize that those are the results you needed,
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.080]   which is fantastic.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.600]   And the role of Suggest, as you know,
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.800]   is that it puts up the suggested queries
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.600]   that other people have made on that same topic.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.760]   And often, that will let you help to refine the idea.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.120]   So often, we'll see people, either in the lab or in the field,
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.600]   where they're trying to work out how to ask that question.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.200]   And they'll see something in the suggestion box.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.160]   And they'll say, ah, that's it.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.840]   They click on it.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.200]   Bang.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.160]   They're done.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:17.660]   Yeah.
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.280]   I always say that Google wants to--
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.120]   that Google wants to intuit your intent.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.600]   And then, that the God of Google is relevance.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:32.760]   And those who act like relevance is just randomness.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.960]   I say that it's not serendipity is unexpected relevance.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.040]   So I didn't expect it.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.560]   And I would like this or know this or need this.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.440]   I still want to get back to the measurement thing then.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.800]   So when you invent something new and crazy,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.320]   like I don't know, oh, plus one.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.760]   Which we're going to talk about in a sec.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.960]   I know.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.720]   I wanted to say it first.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.520]   So that's not like doing an AB test.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.440]   How do you test that?
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.040]   For something like plus one, we do dog fooding to begin with.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.800]   And so we build out the prototypes.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.560]   We then deploy it internally and do an extensive series of sort
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.160]   of gee, how did you like it asking all the Googlers we know
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.160]   sort of checking it that way.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.080]   So we get a ground truth checked very early on.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.040]   The other thing we often do will do lab studies
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.560]   where we will bring people in, NDA them,
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.720]   see if they can understand what that's all about.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.760]   So we do have a combination--
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.840]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.880]   Yes.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.920]   We'll bring them in and have them do some tasks
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.040]   and try to recreate as real an experience
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.520]   and watch how they use it.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.960]   We also watch the ways in which they don't use it.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.400]   So we're also trying to measure their level of non-understanding
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.320]   or unhappiness.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.120]   It strikes me there's a fine line between love and hate.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.320]   And sometimes by attempting to do too much,
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.640]   you can actually peeve people off.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.560]   And I think there's a little bit of a drawback
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.720]   to testing it on Googlers.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.960]   I think that this is one of the criticisms that Googlers
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.280]   often gets is that the in-house tested stuff,
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.800]   often Googlers are not like you and me.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   They are not represented in general population.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.600]   They probably are like Gina and Jeff and me.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.160]   But they're not like real people.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.520]   They're not like real people.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.560]   That's a key idea actually.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.240]   So part of my job is actually to get out of Google,
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.840]   get out of Silicon Valley, and go other places in the country
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.200]   and other places in California.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.400]   So a couple months ago, I was in Merced, Meriposa,
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.160]   Eastern California interviewing people there,
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.320]   seeing how they understood parts of the Google user interface,
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.160]   the parts of the Google experience.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.360]   So you're absolutely right.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.440]   If you ask nine out of 10 people here in the valley,
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.520]   understand what a file structure is.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.200]   That's not true in the rest of the United States.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.600]   I'm not sure I understand it.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.400]   You know, we've said--
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.640]   we've said this a lot on this show
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.040]   is that what Google needs is not more computer scientists
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.080]   but more social scientists.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.240]   Is that kind of what you are as a hybrid?
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.800]   No, actually, I have a PhD in artificial intelligence.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.760]   Oh, well--
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.520]   But I was at work and out for you.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.920]   I recovered, got better.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.280]   And actually, what really happened,
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.280]   the seminal experience for me was being at park.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:19.120]   And I had been working on a very fantastic total AI logic
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.120]   theorem-proofing system that would help people use
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.680]   this very complex copy that we built.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.280]   And we did an early user study.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.040]   And we actually had a Nobel Prize winner come in.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.560]   And he was completely lost using that system.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.560]   Oops.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.600]   This is my-- on the road to Ephesus moment.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.240]   And I realized that you could have the most fantastic AI
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.120]   in the world.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.920]   But if the interface doesn't communicate what it's about,
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.400]   doesn't make sense, you're lost.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.120]   So that was really the moment I switched from doing AI
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.720]   to doing HCI.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.120]   And that's when I started realizing
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.440]   I needed to understand the humanity of it
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.400]   and how people really thought what they really understand,
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.680]   what they like, what they don't like.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.640]   Little side note, four o'clock this afternoon,
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:11.000]   we're interviewing Ray Kurzweil, another AI legend.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.720]   I wonder what his road to Ephesus was.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.160]   So let us-- what we're going to do, Dan, you're here.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.160]   If you guys want to ask Dan some questions,
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.960]   we have a lot of Google news as well.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.040]   I guess I'll leave it to you, Gina and Jeff.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.680]   You want to quiz Dan some more or include him in the conversation.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.320]   Let's talk about plus one, for instance.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.640]   Yeah, let's talk about plus one.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   I'm wondering how much Dan was involved in that
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.720]   and whether we should chat about it while he's with us.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.480]   Yeah, let's briefly discuss what it is.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.760]   It sounds like you can dig Google search results, basically.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.520]   Yes, you can basically plus one just to let you know.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.680]   I was not really involved in that.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.680]   I certainly know what it is.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.880]   And calling it the sort of digification of results,
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.960]   saying that you like a particular result
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.720]   so that it shows up higher in your next time you search
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.920]   for something like that, that's basically what it is.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.120]   It is an effort to try to take advantage of the global network
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.680]   of people and what they know and try
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.440]   to build that in a little bit more.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.800]   You realize that that's an important part of our online experience.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.520]   How can we do something with that?
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.560]   No, it does show up.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.240]   I don't see it yet on the Google--
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.360]   on my Google results.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.600]   Does there go a little thumbs up?
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.480]   You can sign up in the lab.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:27.960]   Ah.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:27.960]   OK.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.480]   OK.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.400]   You have to opt into the experiment.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   Ah.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   So that's actually a good point because we
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.320]   do a lot of experiments about different kinds of things.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.320]   We're constantly changing the UI.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.840]   I guess people know this generally,
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.320]   but we're constantly running hundreds and hundreds
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.840]   of experiments on live traffic.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   And this is one of them.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.760]   And in this case, you can opt into it.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.320]   In many cases, we're doing things
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.960]   where we move things around or change the colors or the layout.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.480]   Or something.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.200]   Don't tell me.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.720]   I know.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.480]   I've caught you doing that.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.000]   That's true.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.400]   That's true.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.560]   So you do it to some of the users, a subset of the users,
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.680]   and see what happens.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.000]   That's right.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.280]   We do a random selection.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.200]   So it's like a 1% or a 5% or something like that.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.920]   And it's basically all random selection.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.280]   And so by that, we can tell whether or not-- with a change,
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.640]   we've made actually is a positive change or a negative change.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.640]   And that's another important aspect of what we do.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.120]   So we do things like lab studies, we do field studies,
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.760]   and we do live traffic studies.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:30.840]   That cuts says the address is Google.com/experimental.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.720]   I've been trying to find it.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.280]   OK, good.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:37.200]   Google.com/experimental.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.560]   So how do you get metrics?
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.880]   You are the metrics Dan on how speed--
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.480]   I mean, you're not watching people.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.160]   You're not doing eye tracking on your users out there.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.320]   How can you tell what kind of result
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.680]   you're getting with them?
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.080]   We have a lot of sort of secret sauce analysis on that.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.160]   So I'm not going to tell you a lot of details about that.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.920]   But what we're doing basically is seeing whether or not
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.000]   people are successful at completing their task.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.840]   Now, we don't always know what their task is,
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.000]   but we do have measures that tell us
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.480]   that the experience is going well for them.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.840]   In essence, we're trying to see if you're in a flow state.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.680]   If it's working--
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.680]   Oh.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.200]   Oh.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.200]   Oh.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.200]   Oh.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.480]   Flow is the word.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.560]   Flow is the word.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.520]   The word.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.120]   We don't exactly have a flowometer.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.720]   But we do have ways of sort of seeing whether or not things
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.120]   are clicking the wrong well for you
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.920]   and you're going from smoothly from thing to thing to thing.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.920]   And that's the--
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.720]   There is a little bit of timing kind of sort of.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.400]   Yeah, that's a good way of thinking about it.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:44.160]   It's also things like looking at my urologist,
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.880]   but we won't go there.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.400]   OK.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.520]   So I turn it on now.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.440]   And so I see a little-- this is interesting.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.920]   I see a little plus one box.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.400]   Now, how is-- now, I've seen this before within my account.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.520]   I can rearrange search results.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.720]   But this is not the same thing.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.240]   This will say, to whom?
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.880]   That this is a better result, for instance, than others.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.840]   It's basically-- well, what we're doing right now
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.520]   is it's just affecting your results.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.520]   But in general, you can think about--
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.720]   we're going to be using this information to help potentially
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.160]   change the way in which we think about assessing relevance.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.120]   But--
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.160]   You don't have a berry button, a good news.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:23.640]   A what?
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.320]   A berry button.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.640]   That was what pretty much killed Dick.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   Oh, oh.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.920]   I had this like--
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.920]   No dislike.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:31.920]   Minus 2.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.920]   That's right.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.120]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.440]   The map cuts world that is trying
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.880]   to find more signals of quality to improve search results?
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.400]   Yes, it is.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.080]   This is us helping Google.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.120]   We're constantly looking at many, many factors
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.760]   to improve quality.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.560]   If we can figure out some--
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.440]   that every third character, if it's a constant,
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.080]   improves the quality, that's something
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.360]   we'll try to discover with our data mining
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.440]   and our experimental studies.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.880]   A MAT also points out in the chat room
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.760]   that you can block results, guys, by clicking on a result
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.680]   and then clicking back.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.520]   And there's the Chrome extension of block sites.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.440]   And I presume that's more data for you as well
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.400]   as to what problem sites there are.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.480]   Right, that's right.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.280]   So that's an extension you have to add, of course.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.400]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.120]   So our goal in all of this is try--
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.080]   how can we make the search results increasingly relevant
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.520]   to you?
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.600]   And if we can make it more relevant to you
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.320]   by using a plus one signal, that's fantastic.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.920]   This is all part of our goal to make you happy.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.920]   So I totally understand that.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.480]   And I think this is cool.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.880]   From a user perspective, though, it makes me feel like,
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.200]   I'm so confused.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.800]   There's starring, there's bookmarking, there's sharing
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.400]   and liking and reader.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:45.960]   There's--
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.520]   Well, and I get different results,
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.000]   depending if I'm logged in or not.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.800]   You have to log in for this to make any sense.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.560]   But when I log out, I actually get different search results.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.360]   My profile's on top when I'm logged in,
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.520]   when I'm not logged in, it's down
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.000]   up towards the middle of the pack, which actually is nice.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.360]   It wasn't on there at all before.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.360]   So I appreciate you're at least giving me a profile.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.760]   That was Matt, not me.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.600]   Thank you, Matt.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.360]   Thank you, Matt.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.680]   For a while, I actually asked Matt about that.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.200]   And for a while, Matt said, oh, you're a celebrity.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.280]   We don't put your profile in search results.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.120]   Thanks.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.720]   Matt has the smoothest time.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.240]   I know.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.120]   He's so charming.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.400]   He can make you feel like a rock star.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:26.920]   Thank you.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.600]   All they can say no.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.160]   So me and Mick Jagger, we have the same issue.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.680]   Thank you.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.400]   Well, I think this plus one is an experiment.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.280]   I know you can only do it one experiment at a time
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.800]   if you go to that Google.com/experimental.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.080]   That's kind of cool, though.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.080]   There are other experiments.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.800]   It had a pretty big launch for an update and experiment.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.080]   Because those experiments kind of update fairly often, right?
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.640]   I guess some get more attention than others.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.360]   That's right.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.000]   There are lots of things that go absolutely nowhere.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.480]   Some that take off really well, and then
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.760]   they get incorporated into the main search results mechanism.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.440]   So some experiments fail.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.240]   If you're not failing at some experiments,
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.320]   you're not doing something right.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.560]   You're not trying hard enough.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:07.840]   Yes.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.000]   Completely agree.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.320]   Whereas Lady Gaga said, if I'm not standing in Marissa's shadow,
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.680]   I must be off campus.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.040]   Something was like that, though.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.320]   It was something like that.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.280]   Something like that.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.800]   Right.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.280]   It's worth knowing that we run, like I said, hundreds
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.760]   and hundreds of experiments.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.240]   And I would say the vast majority of them don't work.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.320]   And that's OK.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.400]   But we learn something in the process.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.720]   We learn things that don't work.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.720]   And so we can try to design the whole experience,
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:43.560]   design the visual appearance of the page, the way things flow
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.320]   from one property to the next.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.720]   All things start to work together to be better.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.720]   It's very cool, actually.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.640]   I think I love seeing a little bit behind the scenes
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:58.000]   of the process, because this is such a difficult thing
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.960]   to do and so challenging.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.560]   It is.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.080]   And from my perspective as a researcher on this,
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.480]   the challenge is both at the very large end, where
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.080]   we look at, say, millions of interactions into logs,
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:17.000]   but also looking at the personal one-to-one kind of end of it.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.480]   For example, I've been interviewing people
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.640]   about how they, for example, use the advanced search page.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.280]   And I've had people say, I think this.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.640]   Unfortunately, that doesn't show up in logs.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.600]   And so part of my job is to bridge the qualitative behaviors
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.160]   we see in the field, the people saying,
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.480]   "Ick," or saying they love it, and then being able to go look
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.360]   for evidence elsewhere in the log behavior.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.560]   So we need a schema 5 element that
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.840]   can grab user facial expressions when they--
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.560]   Oh, that'll be good.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.720]   Google would like to watch you while you look at this page.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.680]   Say yes or no.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.440]   There's also a big issue of unintended consequences,
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.600]   because Google is so big and so powerful.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.800]   I'll give you an example.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.280]   Amanda Hasser wrote an interesting guest blog post.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.400]   I think it was on TechCrunch.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.160]   She's a recipe writer and wrote a great cookbook
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.960]   for The New York Times.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.960]   And she pointed out that billions of recipe searches
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.280]   a month on Google, billions, it is simply
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:20.160]   the largest, most influential arbiter
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.840]   of how to cook food in the world, much more so than any food
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.480]   blog than Epicurious or any magazine.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.760]   And she said, Google recently made a change,
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.200]   a seemingly sensible change, to the recipe search.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.400]   You can constrain the search based on an ingredient amount
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.840]   of time to cook it.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.200]   And I think there was a third constraint.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.200]   But she said, this has an unintended consequence.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.800]   People are going to make worse food,
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.760]   because it artificially promotes sites
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.960]   that have the manpower to put this metadata into their recipes.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.880]   And the simple cooking blogs that just
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.560]   have great recipes are going to be left out with this kind of thing.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.960]   You must pay attention to these kind of unintended consequences,
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.040]   but it's very hard to predict.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.480]   It is.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.120]   The good news about that particular thing
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.760]   is the micro format syntax is relatively simple to do.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.520]   So the amount of manpower it takes, person power it takes,
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.880]   is really small.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.760]   I mean, you can go in and just very quickly edit that HTML
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.760]   and just add it to the product.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.320]   But that also points out that the longest cooking time
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.240]   is an hour in this constraint.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.200]   She says, so let's say you want to make Casa Lai.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.080]   There is no Casa Lai that takes less than four hours to make.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:30.680]   That's right.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.720]   Or a decent love of bread.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.240]   Right.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.080]   So she found a lot of Casa Lai recipes.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.600]   There's a one minute Casa Lai.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.400]   But it wasn't Casa Lai, really.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:39.960]   Much, much, much.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.320]   And there's also SEO issues where people will artificially
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.720]   change the calories or the cooking time,
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.640]   lying about the calories, things like that.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.720]   You know, we have SEO for absolutely everything.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.560]   I'm not surprised we have SEOs about K-Cal's as well.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.080]   Right.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:54.520]   Right.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.080]   So--
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:55.580]   Right.
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.080]   I think--
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:56.840]   I want to call you a--
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.280]   Oh, it was the Huffington Post, by the way.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.040]   I should just real quickly say it was not TechCrunch.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.560]   This is a Huffington Post article from March 24th,
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.040]   if you want to read it from there.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:05.040]   Sure.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:05.560]   The micro--
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.280]   That's a problem there.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.120]   I agree.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.320]   But I think that Amanda's right that if you get to--
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.600]   I know a lot of food bloggers, and they're bloggers.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.840]   They're not data sites.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.360]   They're not going to do a micro format.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:17.860]   Right.
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.000]   And they're not going to know how to--
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.400]   it's hard enough for them to figure out, you know,
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.800]   going beyond what they do.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.680]   And so it really is Google's job to format for them.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.080]   I would like to--
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.360]   Well, to the extent that we can extract that metadata
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.360]   and assemble it properly, we will.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.160]   It's largely a problem of making the parses robust enough
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.680]   so that they can crawl arbitrary content
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.440]   and then extract the metadata and do the right thing.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.520]   It's very hard.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.200]   To give you another example of that,
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.520]   we also have this fantastic feature in Search called
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.360]   Define.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.080]   So you say Define, colon, word, like Define, colon, peruse.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.520]   And we crawl the entire web looking for definitions.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.240]   Peruse is blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.280]   And that's a kind of thing where we have unintentionally
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.560]   made the world's biggest dictionary as well.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.240]   But what's it doing to the dictionary manufacturers?
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.960]   It's another resource.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.520]   It doesn't exclude them.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.240]   So when we started Epicurious back of the day, back in the '90s,
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.400]   we had thousands and thousands of recipes
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.480]   from gourmet and bone and appetite.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.520]   We had the same problem then with metadata and getting them in.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:28.720]   And we had them taped Honest to God by troops of monks.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.040]   Yeah?
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.000]   Monks are good.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.560]   They have--
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.040]   Fantastic.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.080]   Good attention to the tale.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:32.920]   And they're beat amongst.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.160]   The only problem was that when you hit a certain part of the year,
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.840]   they had to break off to make their fruitcakes.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.520]   Oh, you had all those monks.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.040]   They're good.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.360]   The mechanical turf of the '90s.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.680]   So they were Honest to God real monks.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.120]   Oh, I've had those trappas, fruitcakes.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.920]   Well, at least they weren't in the fryer business.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.560]   Oh, thank you very much.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.920]   He likes puns too.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.000]   So I'm just going back to Amanda's article.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.200]   And it's best place to go to her blog,
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:02.560]   Let's Not Give Huff Po Anymore Credit, food52, the number 52.com.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.920]   Did Google read this?
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.920]   And is there a response to this?
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.840]   I mean, obviously, you can't jump to respond either,
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.440]   because then you might have other side effects.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.640]   No, I personally haven't read that blog yet.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.560]   But there are many, many blogs on Google,
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.800]   and I can't read them all.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.440]   I try to stay busy on top of stuff.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.480]   But that particular one I don't know about.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.920]   It's an interesting indictment of--
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.480]   and I only bring it up because it's
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.120]   about unintended consequences.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.920]   I'm sure Google, with every intention
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:36.680]   of improving recipe search made out of these three parameters,
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:40.200]   what's interesting to me was also that a billion recipe
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.600]   searches a month just shows you the power
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.600]   that you wield.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.880]   I think there's a different-- I think it's kind of savvy web
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.600]   users know that if I'm looking up a word,
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.920]   I use Define on Google a lot.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.920]   But if I really want to see the whole definition,
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.200]   I'll glance at Google's definitions aggregated
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:58.960]   from various sources.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.720]   Then I'll click through.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.800]   It's kind of the way I deal with Wikipedia.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.720]   I'll skim Wikipedia if I just want to kind of overview.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.760]   But if I really want to know the details,
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.600]   I click through to the sources.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.880]   The original sources.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.600]   And I know that that's kind of--
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.000]   I spent a lot of time on the web, so I've kind of figured that out.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.080]   But I don't know.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.680]   I think that's something that users should know about too.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.560]   By the way, Google did respond.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:24.920]   Kavi, who is in the-- he says, I'm the product manager
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.240]   at the Google Search Quality Team.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.720]   And it was one of the people who helped create recipe view.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.120]   Long, thoughtful response.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.920]   So Google does pay attention.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.960]   Absolutely.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.320]   Wow, that's quite a response.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.560]   Really long, long, thoughtful response.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.060]   Yeah.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.680]   I also brought up a link just now to Jonathan Stray,
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.160]   who wrote a blog post this week that got around a lot of attention
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.360]   on the editorial bias, that it-- human bias-- that is built
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.680]   into any algorithm.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.520]   Yes.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.920]   And we know it's there.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.200]   We'd sometimes forget about that.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.400]   But of course, it's there.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:53.900]   Right.
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.160]   I mean, editorial bias is everything.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.760]   I mean, I was going to say there's editorial bias in everything.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.400]   We tend to think of libraries as not being--
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.720]   having a particular point of view.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.560]   But in fact, every book in the library is curated.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.080]   Someone had to acquire it.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.240]   They had to decide to not pick out the other 10,000 books.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.600]   And so libraries have a bias as well.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.080]   In fact, it's much smaller than the corpus
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.720]   that we operate under.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.920]   David Weinberger does a great spiel on that,
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.920]   co-author of the Plutre manifesto that goes through Dewey
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.880]   and says there are--
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.320]   There's a bias there.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.520]   100 numbers for Christianity and two for Judaism
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.840]   and one number for everything else in the world.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.240]   That's an excellent bias.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.640]   And I think people feel like, oh, computer algorithms
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.600]   are inherently unbiased, but somebody writes the algorithm.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.120]   That's right.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:40.640]   Yes, right.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.040]   In fact, there's the guy right there.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.640]   Another thing I want to bring up about unintended consequences
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.720]   is one of the things I discover when I go out
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.280]   and watch people search because I do that a lot is they'll,
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.880]   for example, land on a very long search page, results page.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.480]   And they won't be able to find the word
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.440]   that they're looking for.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.560]   And so what do they do?
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.800]   Well, if you're a DigiRatus, one of us,
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.080]   you know how to use Control-A for command F or edit fine.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:12.000]   And in my researches, I've discovered that 90%, 90%,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.160]   the US internet using population does not
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.120]   know how to do that.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.360]   That means when they land on that landing page,
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.800]   they cannot find the thing that they're looking for
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.440]   and they have to read through it line by line.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.960]   And if it's 140 screenfuls long, that makes them crazy.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.800]   So you notice in the preview thing that we did,
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.240]   if you click, it actually will highlight the search terms
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.720]   on the preview doc so you know where to go look for them.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.960]   Yes.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.920]   Yeah, and Gmail does that as well, right?
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.920]   Gmail does the kind of yellow highlighter.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.320]   Exactly.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:43.840]   Yep.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.760]   Yep.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.840]   So that's one of these things where we found out something
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:48.960]   that we hadn't anticipated.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.440]   We added a new feature that's intended
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.080]   to really accelerate people's use of the tool
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.040]   so that they can get to their results faster.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.600]   They don't have to think about it as hard.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:03.200]   We can just make their life faster, simpler, more efficient.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.320]   Actually, I really like what you've done with the search.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.600]   The recipe search, now that I look at it on the left side,
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.080]   we can turn off ingredients.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.440]   Yes, of course, admittedly, cooking time
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.920]   only goes to up to 60 minutes.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.240]   And calories only go up to 500 calories, but that's, you know,
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   if you're a fool, if you're looking at Casa Lai
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.520]   and say, well, I'd like the 15 minute version.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.200]   But there's, look, the search results are great, frankly.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.000]   And I love this, you know, additional capability.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.080]   I don't think it's anything wrong with it.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.280]   And look here, something different with the confi risotto
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.120]   to Jean Paella and Yolke.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.160]   What are other areas of life that will be good
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.360]   for this kind of search?
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.000]   Well, for this kind of meditative, faceted search, you mean?
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.840]   Well, generally anything that has meditative, right?
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:56.160]   But more generally, there are large numbers of domains.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.440]   And I'm not going to give you any pre-announcements here,
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.960]   but you can imagine areas of knowledge
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.320]   where there are different facets like this.
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.320]   In this case, we have dimensions like calories
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.440]   or ingredients or something,
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.800]   where you want to include or exclude particular properties.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.480]   The easy one would be something like, you know,
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.000]   imagine something that does travel.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.920]   That's the example that everybody uses.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.800]   I want to have things that fit within these constraints
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.880]   and not those.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.840]   So any time you have a domain of knowledge
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.480]   with a lot of dimensions, a lot of constraints,
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.480]   you can apply.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.040]   So you can do a free tale.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.640]   I mean, in terms of travel, what I would wish
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.080]   is I could do that with restaurants
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.160]   and go to the next level of knowing what their menu is.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.360]   Well, you can do something like that
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.720]   with our shopping results now.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.000]   You can, for example, limit it to within a particular price range.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:40.840]   Right.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.120]   Another instance of that.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.440]   One thing we talk a lot about on this show
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.440]   is the rapid ascendancy of social search
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.760]   and Facebook's advantage there over Google.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.720]   And that would be another way to add metadata
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.560]   to add search refinances with social.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.600]   But it's a thorny, challenging thing
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.920]   to incorporate social into the user experience
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.480]   in a way that isn't, first of all, creepy.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:04.840]   Right.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.720]   Want to go right up to that creepy line, but not cross it.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.680]   But also useful.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.600]   What are you doing there?
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.000]   Well, first off, I'm not involved in that.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.680]   So I can't tell you any stupid stuff.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.960]   I don't even have any good secrets to tell you about that.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.800]   But you can imagine you're absolutely right there now.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.400]   You recognize the issue, of course.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.080]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.480]   And it's clear that it's a great repository.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.280]   And of information like this.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.200]   And it's clear that search is becoming increasingly personal,
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.400]   increasingly social, increasingly local.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.800]   So there's all these new properties
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.840]   that we'd like to be able to bring into it.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.360]   And this is something we all have to try to figure out.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.000]   I want to thank you, Dan, for joining us.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.800]   We really appreciate it.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.360]   You're going to lose the conference for a few minutes.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.680]   We don't want to have the same thing happen
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.560]   that happened last time.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.880]   So yeah.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.280]   I will let you go.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.680]   But it's really great to talk to you.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.280]   Thank you for volunteering to be on here.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.120]   I really--
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:56.960]   My pleasure.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.720]   I really appreciate Google's openness and willingness
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.400]   to talk in a public forum about what it's up to.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:03.920]   It's great.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:03.920]   All right.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.440]   Thank you, Dan.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:04.920]   Take care.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.520]   Thank you for having me.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.020]   Yeah.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:06.680]   It's great to have you.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.200]   Dan Russell is uber tech lead at Search Quality
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.680]   and User Happiness at Google.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.720]   We're going to take a little break, come back,
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.600]   and talk about lots of other news with Google.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.840]   And then we'll have Casa de la for all.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.160]   But I'm cooking it right now.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.320]   I got the 15-minute version.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.520]   It should be ready in a second.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.520]   But first, let me talk a little bit about go to Assist Express,
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:32.120]   those great folks who make it possible to do remote support
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.680]   without tearing your hair out.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.120]   Anybody who supports family, friends, or does it
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.480]   in business supports clients, colleagues,
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.080]   knows how challenging telephone support is.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.440]   And you don't always have the ability to go down the hall
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.200]   or across town or across the country to fix the problem.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.840]   So this is where go to Assist Express
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:50.520]   is so useful.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.800]   It allows you to do remote access to the problem.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.080]   Fix it yourself without walking somebody through it.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.160]   And it is incredible.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.480]   If you're on the phone with somebody, you send them a link.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.120]   They install it 30 seconds later.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:05.080]   You're in Mac or PC completely cross-platform.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.960]   Fix a Mac from a PC and vice versa.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.560]   And just the easiest to use.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.800]   First of all, it's fast.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.560]   Nobody's going to use a remote support platform.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.200]   No tech person's going to use a remote support platform
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.920]   if they have to move the mouse and wait as they watch
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.560]   the pointer go across the screen.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.560]   This thing is just about as fast as can be.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.800]   Citrix really knows how they do all sorts of clever tricks
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.120]   to make sure that it feels snappy and responsive.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.520]   They even do things like allowing
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.720]   to have eight sessions at once.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.520]   So you can start and install on a machine
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.640]   and then move to the next and start a scan and move to the third.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.200]   And that way, you're much more efficient with your time.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.960]   That's probably why Frost and Sullivan, which
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.360]   is an industry analyst group that specializes
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.640]   in this particular sector of software, gave,
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.960]   go to Assist, Express, the name, market-wide world leader.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.160]   Number one, remote support solution, worldwide.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.200]   Easy to use, 100% secure using 128-bit SSL.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.560]   Very simple for your clients.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.640]   They don't have to have it installed.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.480]   You just send them a link.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.600]   As I said, it couldn't be easier.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.000]   It is just a great way to do support.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.480]   And I want you to try it.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.560]   Believe me, one of the things I insist on
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.840]   with all of our advertisers is a chance for you
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.280]   to try before you buy-- and Citrix has been great about this--
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.080]   not just try it for an hour.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.720]   30 days, free.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.760]   Go to assist.com/twig.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.080]   G-O-T-O-Assist.com/twig.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.840]   I know a lot of you who watch our shows
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.480]   are in the support business, your IT professional, software
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.480]   support people.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.840]   Certainly, we all support family and friends.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.920]   This is a tool you want.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.680]   They have day passes for those of us who don't do it all the time.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.320]   Go to it as well as the monthly subscription.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.760]   Go to assist.com/twig.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:52.200]   We thank them for their support of this week in Google.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.320]   Gina, I wanted to ask you about this word now that honeycomb will
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.240]   not go open for some time.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.040]   Yes.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:33:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.120]   So Andy Rubin said that they rushed the Zoom, the Motorola
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.800]   Zoom, which is the honeycomb sort of fine.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.240]   Oh, you mean the one we spent $600 on that Motorola Zoom?
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.120]   It's not ready?
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.880]   Oh, somebody else bought one.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.960]   This is so a little birdie at Google who shall remain nameless,
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.800]   sent me a Motorola Zoom.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.600]   Oh, you have to buy it.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.520]   Well, that's--
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.040]   Yeah, I've been test driving it for a week.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:23.480]   What do you think?
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:23.840]   Wow.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.040]   So what do you think?
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.360]   Well, it's my first tablet.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.960]   So I'm having that first novel, like, holy crap, tablets are cool moment.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.640]   But I also-- I like it very much.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:35.360]   It's a big slab O computer.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.480]   The on button is in a really weird place.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.720]   But I like it very much.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.560]   I'm still getting used to it.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.600]   I've only had a few days with it.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.880]   And I'm probably going to give it away to one of my contributors on ThinkUp.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.120]   But for the most part, I like it.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.200]   I wouldn't have spent my own money on it.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:52.760]   I still think that the price is too high and honeycomb is still not fully baked.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:53.280]   Well, that's the question.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.120]   Bring this back to this story.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.760]   That's this story, right?
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.240]   Right.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:03.160]   So Google is not releasing honeycomb source code, which has open source enthusiasts
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:08.800]   and religious in zealots up in arms, how open really is Android.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.400]   I have to tell you.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.080]   And this is probably going to get me in trouble with some of the more sort
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.840]   of religious types.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.880]   I'm OK with it.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.560]   I'm OK with Google holding on to honeycomb until they feel like it's ready to release.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.920]   I don't think-- if you've taken shortcuts in code and you've written crappy code,
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.880]   especially if you're Google, you don't release it yet.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.120]   I think they rush honeycomb to market.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:35.960]   The Zoom is obviously still unfinished for whatever their reasons were, maybe the iPad.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.360]   But honestly, I think that Google should have a little more control
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.000]   over Android.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.360]   I'd like to see them up their standards a little more and enforce some more rules around who
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.080]   can put the Google name on every device and what it does.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.920]   So I'm OK with this for now.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:55.640]   And I know I'm supposed to be enraged, but Android is open enough for me.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.240]   People are upset they feel like Android is using open source as a marketing tool,
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.200]   but it's not truly open source because true open source projects,
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.280]   the sources-- there's committers outside committers.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.200]   There are nightly builds.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.240]   The source is always available.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.040]   Google holds back and does releases and batches.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.280]   And now this honeycomb release, there's no telling when it's going to happen.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.200]   Isn't this what happens though?
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.640]   Every time-- it seems-- my memory is that every time there's a new version,
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:24.240]   there's a period of time, sometimes months, between the release of the version on phones
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.200]   and the open sourcing of that version.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   Right.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:27.720]   Right.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.200]   That is true.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.720]   So is this different?
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.480]   The difference this time is that there's no date.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.920]   I mean, they announce what was-- we're not releasing this yet.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:36.760]   And there's no--
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.720]   Maybe never?
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.480]   It sounds like the way for never, yeah.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.280]   And I mean, it's not--
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.960]   I don't think it's going to be never.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.800]   That's that--
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.200]   No, no, I just mean that there'll be a next version of--
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.000]   Well, they'll spurs.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.200]   Ice cream bar.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:48.720]   Ice cream.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.920]   Or sandwich, whatever the thing it is.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.000]   That this one may never be ready for prime time.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.440]   Gee, let me ask you this.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.560]   In the older days of software, the choice that you always made was whether you used it
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.720]   inside your enterprise, then you can always fix it.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:05.920]   If you had to shrink wrap it for others, it had to be of a higher quality disadvantage.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.320]   Is that true even in something like Android?
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.480]   OK, fine.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.480]   We can make the Zoom work.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.520]   We can work with Motorola.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.280]   And it'll be fine.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.240]   It'll work.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.560]   But if this thing starts propagating against other devices, we could have a lot of problems.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.600]   I think even more so.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.160]   Even more so, right?
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.160]   In phones, it's even more so.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.880]   And that's the company line, right?
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:28.320]   Is that releasing this code would create a bad user experience because folks would
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.320]   start putting on devices and it's just not ready.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.480]   They took shortcuts and there's code there.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.480]   They don't want to release to the world yet.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.360]   It's a big deal when you put code out there, especially when you're Google, you know, because
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.640]   everyone's going to grab it and start using it and you don't want bad code to kind of
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.640]   propagate.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.600]   Well, Andy Rubin also said that we did it for a tablet.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.400]   We didn't want to think.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.800]   This is a quote from Bloomberg.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:54.200]   We didn't want to think about what it would take for the same software to run on phones.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:58.240]   It would require a lot of additional resources and extended our schedule beyond what we thought
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:58.840]   was reasonable.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:37:59.840]   So we took a shortcut.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.960]   In other words, they said we're going to make it available for a tablet.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.720]   Right.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.720]   But it's going to take a while to get it ready for phones.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:06.880]   I don't, I agree with you.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.880]   I don't think that's so awful.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.640]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.640]   I don't think that's so bad.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.480]   But you know, you have someone like cyanogen, you know, he would have grabbed honeycomb and
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.760]   had made it ready for any, you know, you could try it on your phone if you wanted.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.440]   If the compatibility to smaller screens wasn't there, it would have been a crappy experience.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.120]   It would have been bad, you know, a bad.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:28.320]   So which hurts Google more holding it back or putting it out as a crappy experience?
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.320]   Uh huh.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.040]   I would say I would say they should hold it back.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.240]   If it's not right.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.160]   Yeah, I kind of agree.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.760]   I think it's a lot of a really interesting line here.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:43.240]   Especially since it never really is fully open source in the sense that you can't go
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.400]   to GitHub and download honeycomb.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.520]   You couldn't go to GitHub and download Gingerbread.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:52.800]   You couldn't do that with any of them until Google officially dropped the code.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.200]   So this is no different.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   Exactly.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.520]   Well, it's no different only that it's not, it's not clear when it's going to drop.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.360]   Normally it drops after the first, you know, devices that run it, you know, come out and
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:06.240]   there's an expectation that's coming out and, you know, the Robin community is ready.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.360]   So you know, people are upset because they feel like this sets a bad precedent and Google's
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.560]   grabbing more control of the source and they're not contributing back upstream to Linux the
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.560]   way they should.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.240]   They're not behaving sort of like good open source community members.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.680]   You know, I think Google just needs to make Android a really good experience.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:26.360]   I think they need to do what they need to do in order to achieve that.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.320]   But they're walking a tough line and I think they're doing it.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.000]   I mean, I don't think anyone's really done this before.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.920]   So they're sort of blazing a new, a new path.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:39.040]   It doesn't, it doesn't bug me, but I can see how some open source zealots, you know,
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.480]   are upset that this is a bad precedent.
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.080]   Open source zealots get upset if you call it Linux.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.960]   I mean, it's not, I mean, there's all sorts of, you know, it's not a, it's not a monolithic
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.720]   community and not everybody's upset and some people aren't.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.720]   Right.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.720]   That's true.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.760]   I would say it's pretty clear that Android is not a traditional open source fully open
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.120]   project nor has it ever been.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.120]   Right.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.120]   And Google's a company that makes money.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.520]   When it almost be developed in Android.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:09.840]   So there almost needs to be a different word for that between, between API and open source.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.760]   There's this kind of controlled source.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.840]   I mean, it's, it doesn't really bother me.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.920]   I think Google, I'll tell you one thing.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:27.800]   Google's put so much value into open software in so many areas, in so many ways that I
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.480]   think you can cut them a little slack on this.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.480]   Maybe not.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.480]   I don't know.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.160]   But it just doesn't feel to me like they're, this is malicious.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:39.880]   In fact, I think they're being very, very transparent and saying, Hey, this was, this
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.880]   isn't ready.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.840]   I mean, I thought that the real story here was the admissions that, you know, we've
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:49.520]   instead we took shortcuts and we shipped this device before it was ready and we know it.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.160]   And we're saying at that concern, I was like, well, it's kind of remarkable.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.160]   It's like, Oh, okay.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.480]   Google does that.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:59.720]   I mean, that's to me, if there's a, I'm sure Jeff, you wrote about this, but it's, it's
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:04.160]   kind of stunning how open they are for a publicly held.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:10.560]   I mean, I interviewed Eric Schmidt on the topic for the book and this will be controversial
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:14.840]   too, but he argues that Google is, and I quote him as open as it can be.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:15.840]   Right.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.840]   I'd say that's true.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.840]   And you can't make the algorithms open.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.000]   You can't reveal certain financials beforehand.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.760]   But that, you know, that he says that if you have a problem, you write down the problem
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.760]   and you do that.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.360]   You know, there's, there's a, in the Google cafeteria this week, there's a lot of crow
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.240]   on the menu.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:40.200]   This is one and not to go too far a field from this topic, but the FTC of one of the
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.200]   next.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.200]   The buzz, the buzz crow.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.200]   The buzz.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:50.480]   They did a settlement with the FTC over the privacy problems with buzz, which of course lasted
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.280]   about a weekend, but they were, you know, as we, we criticized them a great deal for them,
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.160]   they were pretty severe.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:00.960]   And the admission on Google's own blog of the problems is pretty stunning.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.840]   Well, they just said we screwed up and we did this wrong.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.840]   And this is what we're going to do.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.840]   We're going to take our medicine.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.080]   And I know there was a lot of negotiation behind the scenes about that that I'm sure
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:12.320]   around a different kind of like it though, that they just said, Hey, they threw themselves
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.320]   into it.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.320]   And they apologize again today.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.400]   Update on buzz user trust really matters to Google.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.280]   That's why we try to be clear about what data we collect and how we use it.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.200]   That said, we don't always get everything right.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:30.080]   The launch of Google buzz fell short of our usual standards for transparency and user
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.800]   control.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.400]   While we worked quickly to make improvements, regulators, including the US Federal Trade
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.920]   Commission, unsurprisingly, wanted more detail about what went wrong and how we could prevent
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.960]   it from happening again.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:46.920]   We'd like to apologize again for the mistakes we made with buzz.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.720]   We are 100% focused on ensuring our new privacy procedures effectively protect the interests
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.080]   of all our users going forward.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.480]   That's Alma Whitten writing.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.840]   She's director of privacy, product and engineering.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.840]   Good for Google.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.360]   I don't want to sound like a Google fanboy, but that's you rarely see people fall on the
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.360]   sword like that.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.360]   That's true.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.360]   But you know, this FTC settlement is kind of embarrassing.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.960]   I mean, this is unprecedented, right?
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.840]   I mean, the FTC is going to check in on Google.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:14.720]   The FTC is basically going to be babysitting Google's privacy practices for the next 20
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.400]   years, just not in that blog post.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.600]   They said every two years, but it's going to be for the next 20 years.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.600]   Holy cow.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.600]   That's kind of a big deal.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.760]   Jeff, has this, has it something like this happened to any other company in terms of
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.760]   privacy?
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:32.080]   Microsoft got a, remember, pretty big slap on trust and they had a regulator sitting
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:36.560]   in on Microsoft, I think still is sitting on Microsoft decisions, but I can't remember
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.560]   anything like this with privacy.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:41.040]   Oh, if you go to the, on the list, I think is the, is the official FTC release.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.480]   Oh, I'll find it here.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.640]   That's on there as well.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.640]   FTC.gov.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.360]   Let's see what the FTC says.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.120]   And you know, the odd thing about this one to me is this is like the FTC found that it
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.120]   was malicious, deceptive.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.120]   Dissective.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:57.800]   Because what happens was if you, if you, I forget that it's funny wording because if
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:03.680]   it's, if you go with the wording was, but it says, if you click on, you bet this will
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.680]   happen.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.680]   And no way that'll happen.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.640]   Or whatever the language was, a little farther down.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:13.160]   And you know, the odd thing about this to me, again, sweet, sweet.
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:17.560]   On the day, buzz was launched, Gmail users got a message announcing the new service and
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.200]   we're given two options.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.200]   Sweet.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.200]   Check out buzz.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:26.440]   By the way, this is more of that delight that Dan was talking about or na, go to my
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:27.440]   inbox.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.080]   You know, I have to admit the FTC is right here.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.480]   Nobody wants to be a na kind of person.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.520]   We all want to be a sweet person.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:39.000]   Well, what they're really saying is that if you clicked on that, you were still including
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.960]   buzz in ways you didn't know.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:41.960]   This is a stake.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:48.520]   You know, but what's not in here is, and I had this problem to 11 privacy commissioners,
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:53.560]   including Canada and Germany sent a letter to Eric Schmidt about a year ago advising that
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:57.360]   Google should not put out betas.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:02.720]   Now that shows such a complete misunderstanding of this new culture where the government people
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:06.560]   think that failure is death because people will come after them.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.520]   You will make a mistake and we might not allow a mistake.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.520]   Exactly.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.840]   And this whole idea that they're going to open up and the process of opening up this
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:18.480]   collaboration and mistakes are necessary in that process.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.520]   And it's part of learning.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:25.640]   They're bringing this government mindset, this old classical industrial mindset to the
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:29.680]   new digital age and there's nothing clear to me that shows that difference in the private
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.360]   way of doing things and the public way of doing things.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.840]   And if you're going to put out betas, the irony of buzz, of course, was it should have
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.720]   been called a beta and that might have saved them a lot of problems.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:39.720]   It wasn't a huge mistake.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.120]   They didn't say it was a beta?
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.120]   No.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.840]   No, major product release from Google was not a beta.
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:45.840]   That's ironic.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.520]   It was the one that most needed to be.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.520]   Right.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:54.640]   But what what disturbs me about that is that they're saying you shouldn't try things in
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:59.240]   public in collaboration with the public that you should make them perfect beforehand.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.680]   Of course, there is no perfect.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.640]   And I find that very disturbing in our new culture.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:05.640]   I agree.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:13.800]   You know, at the same time you have today, for example, three senators are trying to take
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:18.680]   out of all the app stores, an app that will tell you where DWI checkpoints are.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:22.480]   Now, I understand their objection to it most certainly, but the problem there.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.160]   Hey, if they can put it in the newspaper, they could put it in an app.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.160]   Bingo.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:29.000]   And so is there a First Amendment protection of apps?
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   Hell yes.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.160]   So, so Google's problem here with buzz is that did they F up?
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.800]   You bet they did and they admit they did.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:43.400]   And if they did that with, you know, audacity and nastiness and left it up forever and didn't
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.280]   care, that's one matter.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:49.400]   But if they said, Oh, okay, we learned we fixed it and we all remember that weekend when
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:54.920]   they spent the whole weekend hauling ass to fix this, then what the government is saying
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:59.760]   here is that even if you make a mistake for a short time, you're guilty of something.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.520]   And that's going to make everyone more cautious except lawyers in terms of getting jobs.
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.600]   They're going to stop you from doing anything saying, well, the FTC could come after you
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.440]   if you screw up here.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.200]   And that's chilling on innovation.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.440]   And I'm a very, for that reason, I'm now getting very upset.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.160]   I'm getting back in Jeff mode here.
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.160]   I'm getting.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.160]   I agree with you though.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.160]   Be upset.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.160]   Yes.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:24.880]   The FTC is pissing me off again because this is none of their damned beeswax.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:25.880]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:26.880]   Okay, I will disagree.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.160]   No, not not not.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:33.360]   But to the extent that they went to this, the extent that they said that a short term error
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:36.360]   is as bad as a long term error.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.360]   But okay.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:43.280]   I mean, I think demanding no betas is one thing, but the FTC saying we'd like oversight
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:46.960]   is not that's that's that's representing our interests.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.400]   And I think Google, it's in their interest that they have that you have to see people
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:54.440]   sitting there because that reassures people about what people are scared of Google.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.240]   So I think this is in Google's interest.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.240]   Fine.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.480]   I'm going to ask you this video.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.840]   Is this the most heinous case in privacy?
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:01.840]   Oh, hell no.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.840]   Right.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:05.760]   So it's this the one that should have brought down this hammer.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:09.480]   Well, but you know, but you have to set a precedent.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.480]   They had to set a precedent.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.920]   They had to make a statement.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:12.920]   Right.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.280]   This was the buzz thing was a huge failure.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.200]   And there were real consequences, right?
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.560]   Andrew McLaughlin's, you know, contact list was published.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:21.200]   I mean, that was a that was a pretty serious consequence.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.320]   I have to say I looked at what the FCC did.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:27.040]   I don't want chilling effect on innovation either, Jeff, but I looked at what the FTC
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.760]   did and said, okay, you know, they lowered a pretty heavy hammer.
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:34.400]   And I encourage our listeners to read both the Google blog post and then the FTC statement
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.440]   because they're the tone is very different.
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.440]   On both sides.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.080]   Yeah, Google has its tail between its legs.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.080]   I mean, you're really gone.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.840]   And as we said, for a reason, it was a screw up.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.880]   It was it was a polyly handle.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.720]   I absolutely agree with all that.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:52.160]   I just but but it was a technical error.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.440]   It was not malicious.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.440]   It was a bug.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:49:03.520]   Well, actually, Leo, no, they're kind of saying that the Google lied to you that if you clicked
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:07.800]   on that, well, I guess, and this is a question to an intent that we can't answer.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:12.240]   And do you think that there was an intent to gather information against our will?
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.240]   No, I don't think so.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.840]   I think I think it was not a technical error.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.560]   I think it was a human error, but they said Google offered a turn off buzz option that
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:21.880]   did not fully remove the user from social network.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:27.740]   So that is, is, Colossely stupid on Google's part, right?
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:31.240]   It's and they've done Colossely stupid things that put them in a bad position.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:37.120]   The, the grabbing of data from Wi-Fi and Street View, you know, had that was a that was a
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.120]   bug.
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.120]   That was an error.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:43.500]   But, but well, even if it wasn't, you know, some say that it was a geek going too far,
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:48.400]   it had no commercial use, but the damage to both Google and the cause of technology and
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.800]   innovation was great.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:54.080]   Google's going to understand that it has this, this higher calling, but we also have to be
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.080]   cautious.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.360]   I think, and I'm going to sound like a libertarian.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.360]   I'm not.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:03.440]   I voted for Obama and Hillary Clinton, but government intervention at this level, I would have
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:07.560]   referred a settlement that was more fully private that Google came up with very open
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:15.080]   ways on its own than the FTC now having clear government control over this.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:20.280]   Yeah, but I don't know what it's for.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:26.040]   I don't think that I, I guess I, I don't fear the FTC having oversight of Google and
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.320]   I think it's in Google's interest.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.560]   To be honest, I think that's one of the reasons Google was quick to tuck its tail between
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:36.880]   its legs is this is something that Google, this is a potential, there's a minefield for
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:43.440]   Google and so it's something that they probably really truthfully welcome because that will
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.920]   improve people's trust.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.520]   Google has to have our trust.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.040]   Well, they're dead.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.240]   Then that's not just Google.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:54.720]   That's the entire industry and I, you know, I, I fear the do not track legislation that's
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:59.320]   coming up, which will surely pass because do not anything is going to pass in Washington.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:02.680]   But that could be very, very damaging as I've said on the show before to the business
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:04.480]   of media.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:08.840]   And so I've been critical of the ad industry that they, and media industry that they've
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:12.200]   been absolutely colossally stupid because they have not been transparent.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.240]   They've been deceptive.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:17.480]   They've creeped people out and they should have been very different.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:22.160]   So the issue here isn't so much that Google should have had the hammer come down.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.840]   The issue instead should have been that the industry should have.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:26.840]   Well, that's true.
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:31.800]   That if we're, that Google and the FTC could have worked together to say we're going to
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.360]   the positive way to put this was we screwed up and we're going to turn around and we're
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:38.920]   going to set a new bar and privacy for the industry.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:44.040]   To think how bad it would have been for Google had the FTC and Google looked like they were
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.040]   in collusion.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.360]   They said, and the FTC said, Oh, no problem.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.360]   It's Google.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.960]   You could trust them and said, you know, fine, everything's fine.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.880]   Google wanted to be spanked, needed to be spanked.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.960]   I see what I'm saying.
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:52:01.200]   There's a huge risk if the FTC doesn't spank them much bigger risk than having some guys
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.000]   sit there in the, in the meeting.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   Big deal.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.640]   Send them over to the cafe, have a nice lunch, enjoy.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.480]   It's a good job.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.480]   I'd like that job.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:12.880]   Can I be the privacy watchdog?
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.880]   I'd like to do that.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.080]   We're going to take a break.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:19.480]   When we come back there is a lot of news, including James Gosling going to Google, which
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:23.120]   I think is a huge story, but that's just me.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.800]   Before we go on, I would like to tell you a little bit about a great place to have a
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.800]   website.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:32.240]   It's called squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:36.800]   We use it right now for our inside Twit blog, and it's been such a joy to work with.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:40.880]   First of all, so easy to design a squarespace site.
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:46.840]   So easy that in fact, if you go to squarespace.com/twig right now, you could try it for free.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.000]   No credit card needed.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   Just name your site.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.880]   I mean, literally do it right now.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.160]   You'll have a site in three seconds.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:56.040]   Name your site, use a password, email address, enter the letters, the capture letters so that
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.560]   they, you know, know that you're not a robot.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:04.200]   And now you'll have a site and all the squarespace benefits, the amazing hosting, the incredible
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:08.640]   artist design templates that get just started, but then the complete creative control you
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:14.040]   have after the fact with sliders, you don't need to know any special HTML or CSS tricks,
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:17.280]   of course, if you do, there's nothing you can't do.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.160]   You can make it look like, well, just look at the examples.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:24.360]   You can make it look like the best looking sites in the world.

[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:55.080]   I have half an hour now to use an Android phone.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.080]   I wonder if I can make a phone call.
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:58.080]   Huh.
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.080]   [laughter]
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.080]   [phone beeping]

[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.080]   Oh, that's weird.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.080]   [laughter]
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.080]   It disabled the driver.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.080]   [laughter]
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.080]   Okay.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.080]   Apparently I'm calling somebody.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.080]   Wow.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.080]   Look at that.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.080]   So is this supposed to be the SDK emulator?
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.080]   But it didn't take any time to look.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.080]   But I don't understand how it's doing this.
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:25.080]   In the SDK emulator, a lot of this stuff -- phone calls are disabled.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.080]   [laughter]
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.080]   As they should be.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:34.080]   There's like a rack of Android phones at the Amazon headquarters that are making calls for Leo right now.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.080]   Well, we can't get through, but we'll let you know.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.080]   [laughter]
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.080]   That's pretty cool.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.080]   The cloud player is really cool.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.080]   It's like -- this isn't -- this is an --
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.080]   this is a common old news story, but it's a new since I was --
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.080]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.080]   It's new.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.080]   It's a good story.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.080]   You get five gigabytes free to store documents and multimedia.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.080]   Oh, it's not just -- it could be other --
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.080]   Oh, it's anything.
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.080]   It's anything.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.080]   So you can see your documents, too.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.080]   I just thought it was music and video shows anything.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.080]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.080]   This is the beginning of cloud storage of anything.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.080]   And if I buy an album from -- once a year from Amazon, I get 20 gigs free.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.080]   And the albums are there for free no matter what.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.080]   So -- whoo, whoo, whoo.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.080]   There's like a WebDAV interface.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.080]   Is there any interface to it, Gina?
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.080]   There is like a -- it's a browser-based uploader.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.080]   This is the thing I didn't like.
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.080]   This is the thing that --
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.080]   There must be an API, so --
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.080]   I agree.
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.080]   It's not Dropbox.
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.080]   It is not Dropbox.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.080]   It's not Dropbox.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.080]   So Dropbox nailed this, right?
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.080]   And Amazon hasn't quite gotten there yet.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.080]   I mean, the -- the MP3 streaming is awesome.
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.080]   So you can listen to your music wherever you are.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.080]   That's really awesome.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.080]   But -- but right, it doesn't have the Dropbox client.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.080]   So it's not this, like, constant sync.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.080]   It's a browser-based uploader.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.080]   I'm hoping that's going to get a little better.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.080]   But -- but yeah, it'll scan your entire iTunes library
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.080]   and upload what you want to -- to it.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.080]   And if you buy an B3, like you said, from Amazon, which I always do,
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.080]   because iTunes drives me crazy.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.080]   Those will get tore for free.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.080]   This is huge for them.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.080]   I mean --
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.080]   It is.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.080]   So they barely beat out Google -- by all accounts -- beat out Google
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.080]   and Apple to this.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.080]   Yep.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:09.080]   And what excites me so much about this -- going too far,
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.080]   which is what I always do.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.080]   That's why I start in trade.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.080]   This starts to kill the networks.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:18.080]   You add this to Netflix having a new show that they bought.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.080]   You have this ability to watch this stuff.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.080]   Everything's changing.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.080]   It's changing a lot fast.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:30.080]   And the whole idea that you can control our media and content
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:34.080]   and bits starts to go out the bloody window.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.080]   So now I'm just uploading files to this folder.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.080]   Yep.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.080]   So there does need to be some sort of -- it would be nice if it was web dev.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.080]   I bet it is web dev if they would just like that.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.080]   They need an app.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:47.080]   But if it's web dev, then it would just be -- anything could use it.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:51.080]   I'm trying to get Werner Fogle's, who's the CTO of Amazon on the show.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.080]   So we'll try to get him next.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.080]   Good.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.080]   That'd be great.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.080]   So and now can I share this with people too?
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.080]   Is there a share?
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.080]   I think so, yes.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.080]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.080]   I'm going to try that.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.080]   Oh, man.
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.080]   I'm liking this.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:07.080]   I just thought -- I completely missed the real import of this.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.080]   I thought, oh, it's just music.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.080]   No, no, no, no.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.080]   This is Amazon AWS comes to the common man and woman.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.080]   Wow.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.080]   For back up.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.080]   Because now Microsoft's offing SkyDrive 25 gig.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.080]   So everybody's in this business.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.080]   It's funny, Amazon's getting all the attention.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.080]   Microsoft's been doing this for months, but nobody's paid any attention to that.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.080]   Well, here's the --
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.080]   Well, here's the --
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.080]   I don't sell any music.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.080]   Does this compete with Chrome?
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.080]   Chrome OS.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.080]   I think it enhances Chrome, right?
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.080]   Sure.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.080]   Because all your stuff is where you need it to be.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.080]   Similar to Dropbox.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.080]   I mean, you can listen to your playlist.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:44.920]   We kind of had this conversation on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.760]   I think probably Google welcomes this.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.920]   I don't think this is a competition.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:51.840]   This empowers Google.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.720]   They didn't want to sell -- I mean, they did talk about Google Music, but I think they
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.600]   didn't really want to be in the music business.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.440]   Let Amazon do that.
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.560]   I don't think they really care if Amazon has an app store.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.120]   That's good for Android.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.120]   Look at that emulator.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:06.880]   That's fantastic for Android.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.960]   Let somebody who knows retail knows how to do all this do that.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:13.160]   And Google doesn't make money particularly that way.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.320]   Although they do now have in-app purchases.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.320]   I wonder if they're going to take it 30% off.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.320]   But I'm asking someone else, though.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:24.040]   If you look at that emulator and you realize that you could run programs on Amazon, I guess
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:28.360]   what I'm asking is, does Amazon at some point get the ambition to have an OS?
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.360]   Hmm.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:32.160]   What do they need an OS for, right?
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.360]   I mean, they just have a UI.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.120]   You have -- because they love control, right?
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.040]   They love to be able to be -- they're rather Apple-like.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.840]   I'm sorry, I'm listening to my music.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.680]   It's hot, you know.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:49.600]   Oh, this is so cool.
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:50.600]   Wow.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.600]   Isn't it?
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:55.480]   Now, don't please try to analyze why I played another one, "Bites the Dust."
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:56.480]   Apple.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:57.480]   Apple.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.480]   Very interesting.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.480]   Wow.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.480]   Oh.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.520]   Good for you.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.520]   I'm glad.
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:08.240]   So we're going to see Google Drive anytime soon.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:12.200]   I mean, there's been rumors about a G Drive similar, you know, that offer something similar
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.400]   to this for a while, right?
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:17.560]   And Google Docs has sort of touched those line a little bit.
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.880]   It'll be interesting to see what that offer will be like.
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:24.120]   The other thing is, one of them better by Dropbox fast.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.120]   Oh, God.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.480]   Dropbox is now suddenly worth 30 billion.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.480]   I like something.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.720]   I mean, Google Docs is nail-syncing.
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:31.920]   You know, that's what I love about it.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:32.920]   It is really --
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.920]   It's not just that it's in the cloud.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:34.920]   Distributed.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:43.600]   There is a Java-based solution that's very Dropbox-based or similar to Dropbox that is
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.720]   owned by LaSee called Walla.
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:48.880]   You know about Walla?
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:52.280]   This could be the dark horse in all of this.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:59.920]   Secure online storage works very similarly to Dropbox, but you can -- it's a peer-to-peer
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.920]   system.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:06.960]   You can add to the Walla storage that you own for free by giving up some of your local
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:10.080]   hard drive space to Walla.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:14.880]   Oh, like a peer-to-peer situation like --
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:15.880]   Yes.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.520]   It's similar to Dropbox in features.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:24.040]   Well, business perspective, that's so fascinating that it's like Netflix getting out of discs
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.120]   to go into online.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:27.160]   This is LaSee getting out of hard discs in your home.
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.160]   I know.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.160]   Isn't that funny?
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.160]   Cooled your stuff up.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.160]   What are you doing?
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.120]   They sell in the secure online storage.
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.120]   Very smart.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:39.440]   And so, you know, it's kind of an interesting, a little bit of a different model than Dropbox.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:44.880]   Randall Schwartz told me about this, but you can buy, of course, space, but you can also
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:48.080]   trade -- you can trade space.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:52.680]   You can give them space, which is really -- Gina, is there any security issue there,
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:53.680]   you imagine?
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:58.920]   You know, I don't love the idea of strangers sort of reaching into my hard drive and using
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:06:59.920]   space.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:03.600]   There are a couple programs and the names are escaping me, but there are these programs
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:08.200]   where you can set up a deal with like your best friend across town and say, "Hey, I'll,
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.720]   you know, back up to your computer if you back up to my computer."
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.240]   And I love that kind of federated.
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:16.680]   I mean, I love the idea of being able to share hard drive space and people that I trust.
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.560]   But you know, whenever you -- whenever you're there a peer-to-peer program's running on
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:24.440]   your machine with ports open and, you know, there's always security risks.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.440]   It's a little scary.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.440]   Even if it's Java.
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.440]   It's a little scary.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.440]   Even if it's Java.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.440]   Oh, man.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:33.320]   The people in Google, Kansas, are so upset.
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.760]   Topeka changed his name to Google.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.800]   Google even kind of changed their name to Topeka in a nod back, but it's not Topeka.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:44.600]   It's Kansas City that gets the gigabit.
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.360]   And --
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.600]   Topeka reported the crestfallen.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.600]   That's a great --
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.600]   That's kind of a gadget.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.640]   Yeah, that's an gadget headline.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.400]   I wonder if they actually talked to anybody in Topeka.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.400]   I love it.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.720]   I want to see stricken photos of citizens of Topeka.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.720]   Oh.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.720]   Oh.
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:06.360]   Google reps say it's the beginning, not the end.
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:07.920]   This is just the first market.
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:10.880]   Please, oh, please.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.840]   That's a -- you know, that I understand as a kind of a promoting the idea of gigabit,
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.560]   but does Google want to get in that business?
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:17.560]   That's a weird business.
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.560]   Does Google --
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:24.240]   Well, I guess in a way that might forward their interests.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:28.360]   This is -- if they hadn't played the doubles deal with Verizon, I'd still think they were
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:32.080]   on the side of net neutrality, but I hope we leave that now.
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:41.360]   YouTube says 33 million streams in 189 countries around the world for the grand finale of the
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.240]   YouTube Symphony Orchestra.
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.360]   That has to be a record for the number of streams.
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.920]   I can't even believe.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:54.480]   I remember just a few years ago when Live Aid got -- they had 170,000 streams and people
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.560]   said the most streams ever amazing.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:57.560]   33 million?
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.320]   That is nuts.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.240]   That is some serious traffic.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:07.240]   Actually, the total -- oh, no, wait, the total mobile live streams is 2.8 million.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.240]   Geez.
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.240]   Mobile.
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.480]   What did they play?
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:11.480]   I don't know.
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:14.400]   You know, like this isn't Lady Gaga, folks.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.520]   This is -- this is Google changing the culture.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.240]   Here, I'll -- yeah, that's true.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.240]   That's a good point.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.240]   That is a good point.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.840]   It's a symphony freakin' orchestra.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.960]   At least it was an opera.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:36.680]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, Shostakovich's Symphony and D minor -- this is -- I don't
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.680]   know, I made that up.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:38.680]   Is that Sydney?
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:39.680]   Is that the Sydney Opera House?
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.680]   Where is that?
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:41.680]   That's beautiful.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:42.680]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:43.680]   I pushed the wrong button.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.680]   There we go.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.280]   Now you're watching it.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.160]   So we're going to take a little break, come back.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.320]   I'll leave this on.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:51.040]   This will be our musical interlude.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:57.400]   It's probably a complete violation of all this holy, but I'm going to play it anyway.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:02.080]   We will take a break, come back with your tip number and tool of the week.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:07.440]   But first, this word from our friends at MailRout -- I've talked about this before.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:13.840]   It's since 2004, I've been using MailRout to stop spam on my LeoVille server.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:18.800]   If you run your own server -- and that's the key on all this -- if you run your own server,
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:23.240]   go to mailroute.info and find out about simply the best anti-spam filtering.
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:29.600]   One of the reasons I like it is that you don't actually see the spam on your server ever,
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.000]   which you've got to love.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   You just simply change your MX record to point to mail route.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.680]   Your mail goes to mail route.
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:42.480]   There's the music.
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.440]   It goes to mail route.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:50.000]   They filter out all the lumps, so you don't have to see them.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.520]   And it comes back to you spam-free.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:53.280]   Give it a try today.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:57.760]   10% off for the life of your cat when you go to mail route.info.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:03.640]   Here it is, the -- from the sands.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:11.080]   To the seas.
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:16.080]   To the YouTube symphony orchestra, the whole idea was like these people played the individual
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.840]   instruments on YouTube, and then they put it all together.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:23.240]   I think so.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.840]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.480]   Let's jump ahead.
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:31.000]   Nice organ.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.920]   So then they bring them all together later.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:38.200]   Obviously, they're now all in the same place.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.400]   That's the cool job.
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.920]   Yeah, Phantom of the Opera time.
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:48.200]   There's a giant pipe organ at the Sydney Opera House.
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.920]   33 million people watched this?
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:55.080]   That's bigger than the Eurovision sound song contest.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.640]   I mean, that's huge.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.640]   That's incredible.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.360]   And so, folks, this is a big medium.
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.360]   They streamed this.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.880]   I mean, only Google would have enough server power to do that.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.560]   But by-con passed by-by.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.440]   Yeah, I think this is exciting.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.600]   It's good for people like us.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.600]   All right.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.960]   We've got to get out of the way here because we've got another show coming in here, The
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.080]   Fabulous TNT with Mr. Tom Merritt.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:22.760]   So let's get to Gina Trapani's -- I like the music.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:29.400]   Gina Trapani's tip of the week.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:34.960]   Speaking of Cloud Player, if you've got an Android phone, the Amazon MP3 app can stream
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:38.560]   your playlist directly to your phone, which works really well if you're running out of
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.680]   space on your phone like I am.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.680]   You can -- I've got Wi-Fi at the gym.
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:46.240]   I can stream my kind of workout with playlists, which I've got going on here.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.640]   I've got some Lady Gaga and some Klya there.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:48.640]   I did.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.600]   I immediately deleted all my hard drive-based stuff.
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.600]   Right.
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.120]   You can free up space on your phone, stream.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.280]   And obviously, it works much better over Wi-Fi.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.400]   And also, you can transfer items to your phone.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.280]   So there's a download button within the Cloud Player app.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:05.920]   So if you do want to grab a file before you are somewhere where there isn't Wi-Fi, you
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.440]   can do that as well.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:11.240]   So if you haven't checked out the Amazon MP3 app for Android, which is still in the approval
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.360]   process for iOS, definitely check it out.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.360]   You've got the store or the player.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.360]   Yep.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.360]   And then -- oh, look.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.360]   Wait a minute.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.360]   Wow.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.320]   So this is -- remember I copied those files over just a minute ago?
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.000]   They're now here on my phone.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   Yep.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   Wow.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.080]   That's pretty cool because they're audio files.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.760]   And then there's the Queen stuff.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.040]   So this is all playing from the Cloud.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:36.480]   It's much nicer than connecting your phone with a wire to transfer over the files.
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.480]   Yeah.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:43.480]   Store all -- and the nice thing is if you buy music from the Amazon store, it doesn't
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.120]   count against your 20 gigabyte total.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:49.600]   So you could have -- this has got to be really scary for Apple.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.600]   It's really good.
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:54.680]   Well, not only that, but the music labels and the entertainment copyright holders are
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.680]   so --
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.680]   Sony's a little worried about it because they have similar secrets.
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.400]   And apparently, they're not too happy.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.400]   Right.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.600]   They're not too happy at all.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:02.800]   The Amazon will fight that fight though.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.800]   I'm sure that --
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:07.800]   -- other companies are going to be doing that.
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.640]   Come and get us, baby!
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:11.960]   Your number of the week, Jeff.
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.760]   I hope 33 million was in your number.
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:14.760]   No, it wasn't.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:21.000]   There was -- in the campaign to ruin the show and now make it not this week in Gaga, two
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.480]   weeks in a row, you ought to mention Lady Gaga, nine million followers.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.480]   Wow.
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.480]   On Twitter.
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.480]   Is she the top?
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.480]   Top followed now?
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:35.080]   I mean, she's got the mega-stardom, but also she uses the tool well.
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:38.200]   She talks to her fans in an authentic way, you know?
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:41.560]   Not to use that term, because it's overused.
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.360]   So that was a simple number.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:47.720]   Well, my tool of the week is -- I think pretty exciting.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.960]   Let me just pull up the screen.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:51.080]   It's cloudgirlfriend.com.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:56.760]   So here's -- no, I'm just kidding.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:00.160]   The social network girlfriend step one, define your perfect girlfriend step two.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.840]   We bring her into existence step three, connect and interact with her publicly on your favorite
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.000]   social network, step four, enjoy a public long-distance relationship with your perfect
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.640]   girl.
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.240]   They say launching soon, but due to hide a man, we're only able to accommodate a limited
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.600]   number of users to this site, registered early to get in line.
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.520]   So just in case you wanted a girlfriend, I don't know if there's a cloud boyfriend,
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.520]   but there is a --
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.840]   So glad that the show did not land on April Fools.
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:24.840]   So glad.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:27.520]   Oh, I think this might be April Fools.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:29.520]   You think?
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.520]   I think so.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.520]   I'm signing up.
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:35.040]   Okay, welcome back.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.560]   Neil Dash and April Fools.
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:41.000]   He did a great piece a few years ago about how your joke is stupid.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   I'm going to --
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.840]   I love the April Fools backlash, but you know Google does something every year, regardless.
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.800]   And now this is my link for cloudgirlfriend.com.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:56.400]   Gee, I don't know why, but I have a link now to -- I'm going to tweet it.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.400]   I have a cloud girlfriend.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:02.440]   All right, the best way to get a girlfriend is already have one.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:03.440]   Oh.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:04.440]   I'm married.
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:05.440]   I guess that counts.
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.600]   I'm going to tweet it.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.600]   What the hell?
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:08.600]   Let's give it away.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:11.400]   No, my -- actually, my tool is insanely much more useful.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:18.120]   It's the new Google guru, an instant messenger, Google thing of a go.
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.920]   I don't know exactly what all it does.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.920]   It's a bot.
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:21.920]   It's a bot.
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:22.920]   It's a bot.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.920]   It's a bot.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:24.920]   How do it go back?
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:25.920]   Somebody said it goes back to 2001.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:26.920]   Oh.
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.680]   This is -- Remember when bots were hot?
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:32.240]   I used to have a Leo bot that would get smarter.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.240]   Yeah, I forgot.
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.080]   Yeah, it would get -- I put it in the chat room.
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.160]   It would get smarter and smarter and smarter.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.360]   You could teach it pretty soon in the chat room.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.720]   Anyway, this one -- let me see if I can pull this up.
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:43.440]   I don't have too many buttons on here.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.440]   So I'm in my instant messenger.
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.440]   It works with Gee Talk.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.280]   You add a guru at Google.com to your friends.
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:55.080]   And then you can ask it questions like whether -- you said San Diego is nice.
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.640]   San Diego.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.640]   And it will tell you that it is mostly cloudy 21 degrees centigrade.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:04.680]   It'll be sunny tomorrow, though.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:06.320]   It's a little cloudy today.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.320]   For us.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.280]   I could do other stuff with this.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.280]   But I don't know what it is.
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.280]   I just --
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.480]   Do you like to define an award calculator?
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:15.320]   Oh, I like that.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.640]   But isn't that Google search?
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.960]   It's Google search, but in an IAM window.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:20.960]   Basically.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:21.960]   Okay.
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:22.960]   It's cute.
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:23.960]   It's cute.
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.960]   I think maybe I should go back to cloudgirlfriend.com.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:26.960]   Yeah, at least --
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:30.160]   I don't think you have a friend who answers you or answers your chats.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.560]   It's kind of one or the other.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.160]   You could have a guru or a girlfriend.
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:36.400]   Gina Travani, thank you for being here.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:39.680]   Gina is at smarterware.org, the founder of Life Hacker.
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.720]   And of course, she created ThinkUp.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:42.720]   ThinkUpApp.com.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.720]   Great show.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:48.240]   How long before people can have their -- I mean, I guess you can run your own server.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:52.120]   Even on your own server, one of our community members is talking about creating a hosted
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.120]   version.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.800]   So if you're interested in that, please join us on the mailing list and let him know because
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:00.400]   he's kind of deciding whether or not he wants to launch something like that.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.400]   So that'll be --
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.400]   Sorry, yeah.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.160]   Idiot here wants to sign up that way.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.160]   All right.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.160]   Good to know.
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.640]   I'll pass on the word.
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:08.640]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.640]   Idiot.
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:10.640]   Not an idiot.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:16.080]   Is the author -- what would Google do and is going to go right back to his typewriter
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:21.640]   and finish editing his book so that we can see public parts soon in a bookstore near
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:22.640]   you.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.640]   Thank you for having me.
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:29.840]   I just saw that this was going to be your tip, Google Talk Guru.
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:30.840]   It was.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.600]   I decided to clear the way for you.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.600]   Oh, man.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.520]   Yeah, because I frankly am very light on tips.
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:39.280]   Well, frankly, she got a better tip than you did, Leo.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:40.280]   Yeah, actually I liked her tip.
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.400]   Her tip was actually useful.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:46.680]   Mine was just -- I am telling you the weather in San Diego on the look at his hat.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.320]   I have a soft spot for IAM bots, like I said.
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.320]   Two.
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.320]   Actually, 2001, but still.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.920]   The category in my IAM for bots.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:55.920]   Oh.
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:00.200]   I talked to a lot of bots.
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:01.560]   I'm going to make another Leo bot.
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.200]   That was your lonely -- I am very lonely.
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:04.680]   You go to your bots.
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:05.760]   Or your girlfriend.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:09.160]   Or your imaginary social media girlfriend.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.480]   Thank you for being here, everybody.
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:15.760]   This show airs every -- records every Wednesday at 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.880]   So you can watch it live at live.twit.tv.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:20.040]   And it's always a lot of fun.
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:23.520]   Of course, if you didn't get to see it live, you can always download it at Google.
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:26.120]   I'm sorry, at twit.tv/tuit.
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.360]   So Leo, soon the Google will have it.
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.520]   Actually, Google used to have a podcasting.
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.520]   I guess they still have a podcasting service.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:35.840]   Nobody uses it through Google IG.
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.080]   But best way to go.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.080]   Twit.tv/twig.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:41.080]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.640]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:53.640]   [MUSIC]
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.700]   you
