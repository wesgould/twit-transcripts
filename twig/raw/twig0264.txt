[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Yeah, the Google verse and all of that stuff.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Facebook.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I got schooled in Facebook.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I'm going to talk about it in a second.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   But first ladies and gentlemen, I give you Jeff, Jeffrey Jarvis,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   He's in his office right now on Times Square.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   He is the author of such great books as Public Parts.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   What would Google do?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Gutenberg the Geek, blogs@buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And is the closest thing to a public intellectual in the United States we have?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Oh, don't put a target on my back.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I was just supposed to say that it was a public intellectual.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   There is in France.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Well, of course, France.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Yeah, but also we don't really have that concept here, but I think you are.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I don't even know.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   You know, I've never really fully understood what the hell that means.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   It means, okay, well, let me first introduce Gina, and then I'll tell you what it means.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Gina Trappani, she's a public nerd.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Yeah, not an intellectual.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I'm proud of it.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   No, you're brilliant.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   No, you are an intellectual, but you don't.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I'm a public simpleton.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   You're a public nerd.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   That's okay.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Public geek.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   She founded Life Hacker.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Okay.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   That's just, you know, you could after that retire, but no, then she went on to do such great things as ThinkUp,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   ThinkUp.com.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And who could ever forget the Google Wave Bible?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Oh, you can't.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I really want to erase that part of your brain.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Do you have a box of them at home?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   She has the Google Wave book has the right to be forgotten.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I did.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   When I set up my standing desk, I used the box of books that had never sold or done anything as my footrest.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   So they actually did come in handy.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   In the movie, page one, David Carr and Brian Stelter and company about the New York Times, you see the copy of what would Google do, which David Carr uses only as a wrist rest.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Oh, that's so mean.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Oh, that's like almost intentional dig.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Oh, sure it is.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Yeah, that's what happens when you're public intellectual.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   So a public intellectual goes back.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   You know, we've had them in the days of Dick Cavett when there were actually places.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I loved it, Cabot.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   When there were places you could go on mainstream media and just be smart.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Gore Vidal was a public intellectual.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Right.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Mailer, Norman Mailer was a public intellectual.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Carson would interview people like that sometimes.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   So a public intellectual is somebody who is a well-known persona, but not because they're in movies, but because they're a writer, a thinker, they have big things to say.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And I think you count.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Hi, cosign.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I agree.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   No, you're putting a target on me, please.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   By the way, is that the new thing?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Is that a thing?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   A cosign.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I like it.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   A cosign.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Plus one.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   A cosign.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   So we had Robert Scobel on boy, it's great to have Robert on.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I love having people on Twitter who are polarizing to Vorex boy.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Those are the people who are really successful.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   You love them or hate them, but it gets people going.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And Robert and I had a fairly heated conversation back and forth for 45 minutes on Facebook.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   He said, "In one year, from now, you will come back to me and say, 'You were right, Robert.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Facebook is killing it.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   They are the social platform.'"
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I said, "What are you talking about?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   It's getting worse by the moment."
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   He says, "You're doing it wrong."
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   The position is, "Well, you shouldn't have to do anything."
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Anyway, we're going to have Robert come back and do an hour-long special on that.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   It cultivates your Facebook feed.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I like that being in the timeline of life so that a year from now, when he says, "Facebook is over."
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Again, I love Robert.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I think he's wonderful.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   But the bipolar nature of his technology loves and hates.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   No, I agree.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   The Robert Scobel seal of approval does not carry much weight.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   It tends to lose its glue effort.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   But I think he was making some interesting points.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   As he often does.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Chiefly that if you really care enough to put the energy into it, you can make Facebook
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   something you'll enjoy.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   So I've been trying to do it.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It ain't easy.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Well, of course, the big fight these days about Facebook is that number one, well, primarily
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   you don't know to whom you're publishing.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Same with Google+, but it's left out of the discussion.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Right.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Right.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   That's the primary issue.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And then the second complaint is that the Ferguson's don't bubble up and Pew has
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   studied out today.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   I didn't put it on the wind down.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   A variant of the echo chamber argument that people will not, they don't feel right having
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   harsh political opinions on Facebook.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   So, right?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I don't, I don't walk about a neighbor's house to borrow a cup of sugar and save.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   By the way, Barack Obama's great and you're wrong.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I think he's awful.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   As soon as I saw that study, I thought, oh, this is just a filter bubble back and Jeff's
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   going to have something to say about it.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   This is a clear, Cain Miller, who by the way gets things wrong more often than right.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   She writes from New York Times.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I've started, you know, as soon as I started filing, I thought, oh, because I just, I don't
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   know what it is.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   It's seems, get yourself right there.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Go back to the old.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   The internet, it seems, contributing to the polarization of America.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   As people surround themselves with people who think like them and hesitate to say anything
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   different now, as I said it is my response to this on Twitter was, if this is such an echo
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   chamber, how come all I see is arguments?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   That's a good point.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   We've talked about this before.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Before an echo chamber, all we'd say is cosine plus one that right.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   You're a mother.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Couldn't have said it better myself.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Right.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   How often do you see that?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   You don't because people are arguing their faces off on this stupid thing we call a net.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   This is, this goes back to the book Eli Parriser wrote called the filter bubble where he said
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   that what happens in these networks is you, this is not a, I don't think this is a, a, a
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   lot of people who are arguing their faces off on this.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   You cultivate your feeds, that's the whole point of Twitter and Facebook and everything
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   else that you cultivate your feeds to include only people you agree with.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   You read your news only to be, you know, to, you watch Fox News because you agree with
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   them.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   You watch MSNBC because you agree with them.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Well, if it's not a agreement or disagreement, it's also about relevance.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   And so the, the fact that Eli, I've debated Eli in public on this.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   That's, that's, that's a far worse filter bubble.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And number two, I do see lots of things from all over creation.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I see them on Twitter.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I see them on TV.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I see them.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I get bombarded kinds of stuff and, and, and, and argue that that these services shouldn't
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   give me higher relevance is ridiculous.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Well, and you also make the point that as, that from time immemorial, we have surrounded
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   ourselves with friends, loved ones, colleagues who agree with us.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Here in Northern California, you know, we pretty much pushed the Republicans to the
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   sea.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   The self.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I mean, I think, I think that you, you don't see people agreeing with one another as much
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   as you see them debate, but there's a lot of liking and favoriting.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   I mean, there's a lot of attaboy atta girls that go on that are a little more silent.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   I think liking and favoriting is kind of what I don't get much of that.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Nobody's got a point in me.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   No, well, but the, I think more to the point, and you do this in life, you try to arrange
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   things in such a way that you're surrounded by people who share your worldview.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Do you not?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Yeah, you do.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   You do.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.480]   Although, you know, it's interesting, like I, because of Facebook, I am connected to like
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.840]   distant family members or, you know, my wife is connected to coworkers and you get kind
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.080]   of a glimpse of their kind of internal life in a way that you might not with a distant
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.960]   family member or an acquaintance, right?
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.200]   So like there, there's certainly like family members and coworkers whose political views
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.320]   or religious views are so different than my own.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.760]   And I think in those circumstances, you know, there are certain topics I don't bring up
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.640]   at the holidays because I see the monologue, you know, or the dialogue going on on Facebook
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.640]   the rest of the year.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.480]   I don't engage with it because why I don't want to make any, you know, whatever, but it
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.520]   does, but that was what I thought of when I read this article.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.680]   Like, oh yeah, there are times when I just avoid certain topics or certain folks because
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.880]   I just, I just know it's only to get weird and bad.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.880]   All right.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.880]   It does.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.080]   Facebook is more the Thanksgiving table.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.640]   Twitter is more the treat court.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.640]   Right.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.480]   And so they're, they're different contexts for interaction.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:30.400]   But certainly more than you would get in life normally, you get the sending points of
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.400]   you.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.480]   Yes.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.840]   More than you would get in the New York Times or Fox News or MSNBC, you get other points
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.600]   of view and that's I certainly am exposed to.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.600]   I'm exposed to both sides of Israel Gaza, for instance.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:51.560]   You did a study in 2004, which you couldn't really replicate today because everybody's
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.400]   online, but there was some portion of people who get their news offline TV and such, some
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.760]   who get their news online, those who got their news online were more exposed to their
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.560]   opponents, arguments than those who got there.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.560]   There you go.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.040]   At the top.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.080]   I think it's true.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.080]   I just think it's true.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:12.160]   I think, and it's, I think I'm much more tolerant of opposing viewpoints than I used
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.760]   to be, to be honest, because of this.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.760]   I don't know.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.760]   You might also do your point.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.160]   I work for magnificent school.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:25.320]   CUNY is a temple to diversity because it represents New York and New York represents
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.240]   the world and we value that here tremendously.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.760]   And so I get different perspectives from my students, which is really important.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.760]   But I also, my friends online, I get people like Raffa Ali, who grew up, he brought a
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:41.800]   picture of, of, of he and his brothers going to school in a horse cart back in India in
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.800]   the day.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.880]   And I just begged him for more because it was a, it was a glimpse of a different life.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.440]   And he is a different perspective on the world.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.360]   And I have tons of friends like that online.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.880]   And I just value, I'm not going to go arguing with them.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.880]   I'm not going to say, well, you have a dumb life.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:04.600]   Because I don't, I'm going to savor these glimpses into their lives or friends of mine
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.640]   online who are from Turkey or from Iraq.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.280]   And that kind of diversity, I have far more of that today than I ever could have had living
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.920]   in my little summer.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:22.400]   So let's throw out both this New York Times article and the Pew study.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.840]   And while you're at it, throw out school with a bathwater.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.840]   Well, but to his credit.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.840]   Robert Johnson.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.840]   Joe, Joe, Robert Johnson.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.560]   That's, that is one place, Facebook particularly is one place where I see descending points
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.520]   of view because I follow, I follow people because I know them or because they're family
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.480]   members not because they agree with me.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.480]   Twitter may be more so.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.480]   I don't see much.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.040]   I don't see much.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.040]   I see more kind of.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.040]   I did this.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.040]   No, no, no, no.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.040]   I see that too.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.360]   But I, but I have a few friends whose political viewpoints differ greatly from mine.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.600]   I see a lot of their posts there.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.920]   Google plus I tend to pretty much see people agree with me.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.920]   You can also kill those who don't.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.840]   Yeah, that may be, that may be his part of it.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.720]   Google, I mean, I, but on the other hand, Google plus really lends itself to discussion
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.240]   so much better, I think.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240]   It really does.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.240]   Well, but I think that's important too.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:21.160]   I said, what we're seeing is, you know, the, the four matters.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.160]   There was a.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.160]   Oh, sorry.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.160]   Lights just went off.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.920]   Hold on a second.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:36.960]   Jeff is, is this plagued by the, the flinty parsimony of the university?
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.720]   The lights will turn off if Jeff doesn't move enough.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.720]   Your tax dollars at work, man.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.280]   By the way, I like that phrase.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.720]   I just made that a flinty parsimony.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.960]   It's a flavor of ice cream.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.880]   I'm going to, I should write that down.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.640]   I'd say I'm going to use that somewhere.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.440]   Maybe the title of this show.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.440]   You got it.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.880]   There was a famous study.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.880]   Simmons.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.280]   You must have been watching the Simpsons, the Simpsons marathon.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.280]   Mmm.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.280]   Persimmons.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.280]   This is what happens.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.280]   Did you play games for 20 hours?
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.280]   Nine.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.280]   Nine.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.280]   Thanks, please.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.280]   Start to abuse you.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.240]   At least my brain still works.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   I wasn't sure.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.600]   I love a sort.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.560]   So there was a famous, famous study done at the NIH, actually done by the father of my
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:32.960]   college girlfriend, John Calhoun, growing rats into an environment.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.520]   Remember that one?
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.880]   No, tell me more.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.120]   And they over, they overcrowded and then it all happened.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.120]   Yeah, that's very famous.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:45.080]   And the abreras and the rebridges and some rats staked out to good spot and then they overcrowded
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.320]   another spot and so on and so forth.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.760]   And so there's always been debate about this about Calhoun study and there was a, I just
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.520]   read yesterday an excerpt with a lecture about it now.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:59.680]   And I was having thoughts about the rat study with online because one of the arguments
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.400]   about the rats was not so much that they were overcrowded but that they were overstimulated
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.680]   with interaction.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.400]   And it struck me that the odd thing is online, especially on Twitter, we all act like a
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:20.160]   bunch of angry rats, but the truth is that we have all the space in the world.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.760]   We have unlimited virtual space.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.840]   There's no reason we should feel overcrowded and get grumpy, right?
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.680]   We should just be able to walk around anything that displaces us.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.240]   We should all be in harmony and happiness because we could ignore anything we want.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.680]   And why don't we?
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.680]   I don't have an answer to that.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:47.800]   I think our minds, most people's minds anyway, our minds are interested in dissenting points
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:53.400]   of view and maybe we even like a little bit of conflict and argument.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:59.680]   I like it in moderation, but I enjoy the healthy back and forth.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.840]   It's hard to find what I mean.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.320]   I mean, I think your experience is so defined by who you follow as well.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:10.600]   I mean, I don't know that I see a whole lot of debate and partially that's just my personality.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.600]   I don't like the conflict.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.600]   You don't like the conflict.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.600]   I don't love conflict.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:19.520]   So I was just talking to my coworkers about two people I follow who just got into it like
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.520]   in the middle of the night and it got weird and mean and it made me uncomfortable and
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.960]   I was just bummed out.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.680]   And I know that this is kind of lame on that debate.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.800]   A conflict shouldn't bug me so much, but I just don't see that that often.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:39.320]   But when I do see it, it makes me sad and I tend to either unfollow or mute or whatever.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.960]   But most of the folks that I follow are pretty chill.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.720]   So I think it just really has to do, I mean, I think that Jeff in particular invites debate
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.760]   because he's a writer and because he asserts opinions and I think people want to engage
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.760]   him with that.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.520]   But I don't know that everyone uses Twitter kind of that same way.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.800]   No, in fact, I think I'm the same as Eugene.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.400]   Mommy and daddy are fighting.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.840]   No, no, no.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.720]   I don't like I will go to great lengths to avoid conflict.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:08.320]   Even if I'm getting a crappy service or I just I enjoy I enjoy debate.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.480]   But once it gets personal and there's just are people start to call names, which happens
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.760]   so quickly, it feels like particularly on Twitter, it gets bad for me.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.760]   Not just Twitter.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.400]   No, no, it's the same on it's the same everywhere.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.640]   That's social media.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.480]   And maybe that's the flaws that we're not getting real conversations.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.040]   We're just getting flame wars.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.840]   Well, that goes back to Mike's point last week about Google plus is you actually can
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.720]   have conversations there, which requires control.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.840]   So there's this gap between openness or anything can happen and control where you can have
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.840]   civility.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.640]   Let's teach our kids to have respectful debates.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.840]   Well, yeah, and I think that the answer is not a technological answer.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.680]   The answer is a matter of societal norms and we're trying to figure out and get used to
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.680]   this.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.120]   You know, I'm back into my my techno panic from years past as I'm doing my research and
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:04.600]   there was a right after the telegraph started there were novels about women being seduced
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.440]   by men over the telegraph.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.440]   If only.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:14.440]   One of them was a famous novel and I love you stop.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.440]   Please kiss me stop.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.960]   I don't think it was Clive Thompson.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:23.440]   I think reviewed one of them recently and and it's pretty amazing stuff, but society,
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.440]   you know what to do?
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.800]   Well, my God, you can you can you think about it.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.320]   The telegraph was the first opportunity to have a lot of conversation with someone.
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.320]   Right.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.320]   Right.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.080]   You couldn't have done that before and that freaked people.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.080]   Well, think about it.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:42.800]   I mean, we don't nobody you never would have a flame war trolling in person face to face.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   People are more respectful.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   Here it is.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.040]   I do want to read next.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.720]   Wired love a romance of dots and dashes.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.520]   I'll achieve her there.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.200]   If you want to look at a chat, you can get it.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   I got it.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.520]   It's a good read.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.520]   Let's see.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.520]   Yeah, it's 1880.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.520]   Wow.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.520]   It's a romance novel.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.720]   It's just Clive who reviewed it.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.320]   Clive Thompson reviewed it.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.920]   This is and said it was actually surprisingly relevant.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.560]   At collision detection.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:22.080]   Wired love a romance of dots and dashes by Ella Cheever there.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.960]   The old old story in a new new way.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:33.600]   M D C C C L X X X 1880.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:39.560]   Mrs. Natty Rogers telegraph operator lived as it were in two worlds.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:45.760]   The one her office dingy and could tell there's two proportions flinty in its parsimony.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:58.120]   Oh, you remember my speaking about seeing and wondering whether a gentleman or lady?
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.040]   Oh yes, Quimby remembered and fidgeted on his chair.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.160]   He proved to be a gentleman.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.800]   Oh yes, exactly, you know, responded Quimby.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.960]   Looking anything but elated.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:12.000]   It must be very romantic and fascinating to talk with someone so far away.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.360]   A mysterious stranger that one has never seen.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.240]   I should get up a nice little sentimental affair immediately.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.240]   I know I should.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.960]   Yes, telegraphy has its romantic side.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.480]   It would be dreadfully dull if it did not.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.920]   Wow.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.920]   Very interesting.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.120]   Love and dots and dashes.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.680]   That is great.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.120]   So what is this?
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.680]   I'm reading this Claire Kane Miller and then I realize this is on a new thing that the New
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.120]   York Times started this spring called the Upshot.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.000]   What's their answer to Vox and 538?
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.960]   So it's the Times, but it's like snappy.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.960]   Data.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.800]   Man, we use data here.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.040]   Yeah, an opinion.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.240]   Like you don't want me to recline in my airline seat?
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:10.120]   Well, you can pay me by Josh Barra.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.520]   That's right above Claire Kane Miller's House social media silences debate.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:19.240]   And don't get mad if Burger King gets Canadian.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.480]   This is not your father's New York Times.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.280]   This is trying to have that kind of perspectivey thing.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:30.680]   And they have this is where they put their interactive charts and huh.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.880]   Data is.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.880]   Data is.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.520]   Wow, interesting.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:39.480]   So this is to appeal to the internet generation or something?
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.480]   It's web only.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.040]   There's no newspaper version of this.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.800]   I don't know if they quote some stuff in the paper or not.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.880]   I actually never looked at the paper.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.480]   The famous idea.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.040]   Actually this story is quite interesting.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.720]   Uber's secret agent.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.680]   So you see what Uber and the Verge gets credit by the way for a great big scoop.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.840]   What Uber's been trying to do to lift.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.160]   Now Uber and Lyft are both ride sharing services.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.920]   They're kind of disintermediating taxi cabs.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:13.400]   They use apps on your smartphone to order a ride and you get all sorts of nice features
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.120]   like you see where the driver is and so forth.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.280]   Lyft is somewhat more down market.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.840]   They have pink mustaches on the cars and the car can be older.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.920]   Uber the car has to be newer.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.760]   Uber has Uber X which is a little more like Lyft.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:34.000]   But apparently because this market is a zero sum market.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.160]   Any ride Lyft gets is a ride Uber won't and vice versa.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.200]   Uber's been resorting to some pretty dirty tactics.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:48.400]   Now there's arguments about this that whether Uber's goal was to waste money at Lyft or
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.000]   other Uber's goal was just to recruit drivers at Lyft.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.920]   I think it's the latter.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:23:01.080]   They have operations slog and the idea is they've hired a considerable number of street
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:06.720]   operators who get paid only on commission $750 a quarter of the average for each new
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.040]   Lyft driver.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.360]   They seduce over to the Uber side and what these guys get they get a burner phone.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.600]   They're supposed to move around in different street corners, call for a Lyft cab, get in
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.720]   the cab and start a conversation with the aim of getting that driver to become an Uber
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   driver.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.040]   How much better it is and blah, blah, blah.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:30.240]   The problem is of course once you've done that once you don't want somebody else doing
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.200]   the same thing and you don't want to get this.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.240]   So apparently there's a considerable number of cancellations that happen when people
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.280]   realize, oh, I've seen that.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.640]   I've talked to that guy already.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.440]   Oh, so that's where the cancellations were happening.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.440]   I hadn't realized that.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:49.280]   CNN had reported that Uber employees had ordered then canceled more than 5,000 Lyft
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:55.520]   rides and this is number from Lyft, of course.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.280]   Lyft says Uber is flat out lying to their customer.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.520]   I have to say even if it's just a recruitment, it's very aggressive.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.520]   Extremely.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.080]   Those unfair to those drivers who get canceled.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.520]   It's really, really, well, an unfair to the rider who doesn't get a ride because some.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:16.240]   Well, for that matter, demand pricing, if the demand seems unofficially high, it raises
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.080]   the pricing for everybody done.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.040]   I think the Verge has done some very good reporting here.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.480]   They've got the documents.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.280]   They've talked to slog recruits.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:30.040]   By the way, Uber has responded by reminding slog recruits that they have signed an NDA
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.800]   and they are not to speak to the press.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:38.280]   That's also interesting that there is obviously an Edward Snowden of the CAD world here.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.200]   Yeah, there's a leaker or two.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.120]   But these leakers are leaking out the documents and so forth.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:52.840]   This is all over the country, thousands of them.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.880]   I think the Verge has got nailed them.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:03.040]   Even if it's not canceling rides, and I believe that that probably is just a side effect,
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.040]   not the new one.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.960]   It's just for the second argument.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.520]   If they were just trying to lose the business, it's just like click fraud.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.520]   Right?
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.000]   I'm going to cost my competitor money.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Is that illegal?
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.400]   And not under what laws are illegal.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.400]   It's anti-competitive.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.160]   Is that what it would be?
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.160]   I wonder if.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:28.320]   I wonder if there are, I'm sure that that could be interpreted as some sort of anti-competitive.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.320]   It's fraudulent behavior.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.320]   Yes.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.040]   I'll tell you, it makes me not want to ride either Uber or Lyft.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.040]   But why not?
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.040]   I don't know.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.080]   I feel like Lyft is also kind of stirring the pot a little bit here.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:47.640]   These guys are in heart because they're the ones who said, "Hey, 5,000 rides canceled."
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:52.880]   These guys should be saying our highest priority is to make sure that you have a safe ride
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.440]   accommodated to your destination.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.160]   And that's what they should be concentrating on.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:01.640]   And by concentrating on this HUHA, it makes me wonder about how much they really care about
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.280]   customer service and how much they're just a volume business like the manufacturer of
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.000]   my light switch.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:16.840]   Again, with the Flint E-Parsimony, for the most part, ambassadors work at events, are
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.000]   in college campuses promoting Uber as a cheap and easy way of getting around town.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.800]   That goal to recruit riders, Uber calls, "slanging."
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.800]   But since at least mid-summer, some branded ambassadors in New York have been turning
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.360]   their talents against Lyft using Uber-provided iPhones and credit cards.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.440]   The contractors hail rides, strike up conversations with the Lyft drivers in an attempt to sign
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.840]   them up before they arrive at their destination.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.320]   In other cities, recruiters travel with driver kits that include iPhones and everything else
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.120]   a driver needs to get started on Uber.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.520]   By the way, it's not illegal, although the company's discouraging for drivers to drive
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.280]   for both Lyft and Uber, to have both.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.480]   I mean, haven't these drivers...
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:04.400]   I feel really conflicted about this whole thing, because on one hand, be ruthlessly competitive.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.400]   Is it illegal or not?
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.760]   I mean, I find the whole thing really kind of distasteful.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:13.280]   It's illegal to order a pizza to prank somebody by having a pizza delivered to their house.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.280]   Sure.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.280]   It's the same thing.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.520]   The cancellations are horrible.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:23.080]   The actual rides where the Uber folks are paying Lyft to give them the ride, but having
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.720]   this conversation with them in the car...
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.720]   Yeah, probably.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.720]   That doesn't seem...
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.720]   That doesn't seem...
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.240]   But I find it distasteful.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.800]   But as a business owner, it makes me question, what are my lines?
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.840]   Uber's very aggressively trying to recruit drivers.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:41.560]   The first question that came to my mind is, these drivers are aware that Uber exists.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.720]   They've clearly tried Lyft.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.720]   It's interesting to me...
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:51.680]   It sounds like Uber feels like they're giving these Lyft drivers the harder sell or something
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.840]   that they didn't know before.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.840]   I don't know.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.320]   I have always felt kind of wary of Uber.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.000]   Part of it is that they're getting built into all these different apps, including Google
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Maps.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.720]   It feels like there's this like, classic thing going on.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.840]   The Uber helicopters to the Hamptons just feel so...
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.680]   I don't know.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.320]   It seems catchy to me.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.400]   I think that's a brand issue.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:25.560]   Well now that it's out, it's a black mark against Uber for sure.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.120]   And yet everyone seems to think that they're the best way to get a ride.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.440]   And you hear the Uberization of everything.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.160]   Uber is this model for what startup should be?
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.760]   Or certain kinds of new innovation should be, and that also makes me nervous.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.760]   This is...
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.560]   There might be a little undercurrent, CD undercurrent of startups where there's such drive to
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:48.720]   succeed and turn and to grow and to appeal to the investors and make sure they're happy.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.200]   Maybe you would cross the line a little bit because of it.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.120]   Growth hacking and stick it back into tricks, right?
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.440]   To pump up page views or get users or whatever.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.440]   I mean, this is...
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.680]   Yeah, this is part of it.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.920]   It's what we operate by the wrong metrics, which you measure.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.200]   I'll be talking about it last week or not.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:14.880]   Isn't Uber beloved because they're modern, they're cool, they're not...
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.200]   They don't wouldn't do this kind of stuff.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.200]   They're the good guys.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.200]   Right.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.760]   They're empowering you to get a cheap ride.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.000]   They're empowering the driver to make a living doing this.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.120]   They could be so above it.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.120]   And they should be.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.480]   But this is where the metrics come in.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.680]   But who's judging their success?
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.040]   It's not writers and drivers at all.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.200]   It's investors.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:40.480]   They deliver kittens, they deliver ice cream, there's this high end feeling.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.440]   It feels like a premium service.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:47.520]   You know, like you're getting treated like a rich and famous person.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:52.080]   By the way, when you get an Uber car, do you sit in the front or the back?
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.240]   Oh, the back.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.240]   Why would you sit in the front?
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.240]   What do you say?
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.240]   The front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front?
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.240]   It's like you got it.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.240]   On the lift, I would sit in the front.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.240]   The Uber.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.240]   It's from Australia.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   In the Uber, I'm in the back, baby.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.240]   Why?
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.440]   Because of the brand difference?
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.520]   So there's a black car.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:17.080]   So there's a Lincoln Continental and a Toyota Celica.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.840]   With lift, I'm getting in the front seat because it's a lift from my buddy with Uber.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.840]   That's a driver.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.040]   And I'm in a black car.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.800]   Leo, Uber X, Uber X, I'm talking.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.800]   I don't do Uber X.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.800]   I don't know what that is.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.800]   Oh, I see it.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.800]   Okay.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.800]   I don't do.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:30.800]   I've only done Uber a few times.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.800]   I don't.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.040]   We don't have Uber or Lyft to Petaluma.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.040]   We have a taxi cab company.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.200]   It was very nice.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.400]   It's a very nice taxi cab company.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.440]   And actually, you know, I'm starting to like the taxi model.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.040]   I used Uber once in San Francisco.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.040]   I didn't even use it.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:55.120]   Ron from all about Android called me an Uber or tapped me an Uber to get back after doing
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.640]   all about Android and studio.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.640]   I don't know.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.640]   Here in Brooklyn, I call 7th Avenue car service.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.640]   Right.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.640]   Local business.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.640]   Interesting.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.960]   Because you have Uber.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.960]   You could do it.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.960]   I haven't used it in New York.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.960]   I don't know.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.960]   I think it's just old habits.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.960]   Huh.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.960]   I never use a cab.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.760]   I've been in a cab in five years and a year.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.760]   Wow.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.240]   Maybe that's an exaggeration that it's a rare day.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.040]   I'm a subway guy strictly.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.040]   I don't have no buses.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.040]   I just do subways.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.040]   Hmm.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.040]   All right.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.040]   I'm going to take a break.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.640]   When we come back, you guys can pick.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.120]   I see a lot of stories.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.560]   Nothing just wows me, but you guys can pick the stories you'd like to talk about.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:38.360]   Of course, we've got the Google change log coming up.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:42.720]   And I guess we could talk about Amazon getting Twitch, stealing it away from Google.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:46.160]   Apparently, in a bidding war, that might be of interest too.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.480]   I think we're still on the side.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.520]   It's not some doldrums quite, but I think I think this is the slow time.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:56.000]   Because in a week, we're going to have new iPhone, maybe even new iWatch is the rumor.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.640]   We're going to have a new Moto X.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.160]   I'm excited about that.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.000]   I've got a conundrum.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.840]   I've had this phone for a whole month.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.520]   I don't know what I'm going to do next.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:11.960]   No, I have a conundrum because I really like the OnePlus actually.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.960]   But I've loved the Moto X and I can't wait to see what they do.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.800]   And I want the 360 because it's round, even if it's a flat tire round.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.200]   LG says we've figured out we don't have to have a flat tire on our round.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.640]   Yeah, I can't wait for that now.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.720]   That makes me mad because I bought a square LG though.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.480]   I mean, it's like, come on, guys.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:33.000]   You said, again, there's a balancing act between coming out too soon and too late.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   And then of course, the new iPhone, which looks very appealing especially.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.800]   And I think that now the rumors are congealing that around the idea that there'll be not
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.920]   only a 4.7 inch, but a five and a half inch.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.920]   Five, five.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.800]   OnePlus One size.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.520]   I like it.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.520]   Big is good.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.520]   How old?
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.440]   I mean, how big is the current iPhone?
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.320]   Four inches.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.600]   And that's up from three and a half to years ago.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:06.320]   I mean, I make my phone and they're just like, what is that?
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.320]   Is it a tabletop?
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:14.120]   Like, yeah, the world is now divided between the the smallies and the biggies.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.560]   But it feels so normal to me now.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:21.880]   Yes, you get used to big and nobody anymore jokes about, oh, is that a side of beef you're
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.120]   talking into?
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.360]   It doesn't happen anymore except for among the iPhone crew who.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.720]   The one thing is, you were right.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.520]   The front jeans pocket doesn't work.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.440]   Oh, yeah, it doesn't work anymore.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.440]   It's true.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.680]   But I've always kept my phone in my breast pocket.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.680]   That's so nerdy.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.680]   It's like a pocket square.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.680]   That's exactly.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.680]   It's very stylish.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.240]   Oh, it's very Don Draper.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.240]   Yes.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.240]   No.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.240]   No, it's not.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.240]   No, sorry.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.240]   I wish it were.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.760]   You know why I wanted to wish I were Don Draper.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:53.880]   God, do you know how much I wish I were Don Draper?
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.520]   At least I have a great mattress.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.520]   Have you?
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:06.120]   If Don Draper had a mattress, he would have a Casper.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.760]   I am not kidding.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.120]   I bought, let me tell you, I spent a lot of time buying mattresses.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.920]   I don't know why, but late in the last couple of years, I bought several mattresses.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.320]   I got one that was too firm and then I got one that was too soft and now I've got one
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.320]   that was just right.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:25.280]   The problem is you go in the mattress store and you lie in the mattress with the E.B.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.480]   eyed person looking at you and you can't really tell.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.720]   Are you supposed to curl up?
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.720]   You can't tell.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.280]   You just lie there looking at the ceiling.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.160]   Oh, I guess I'll take that one.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:40.560]   I think in my head I like firm.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.560]   But then so I got soft, but then I don't like it.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.240]   The too soft is anyway, Casper's great.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:48.640]   One of the reasons the Casper's great is because first of all, they're very affordable,
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:53.840]   very well made, very nice mattresses and you have 100 days to return it.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:57.560]   So you have more than three months to see whether you like it.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.960]   You're going to get a great night's sleep.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.960]   Show the video.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:00.960]   We got my Casper.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.520]   First of all, this is hysterical.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.520]   Stripping's free.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.920]   It comes in a box.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:11.000]   This is a queen size mattress that's a small, like a college refrigerator size.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.560]   So you open the box, by the way, I didn't do it right.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.000]   They said open the box where you want your mattress to be.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.800]   I open it in the foyer, but that's okay.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.640]   And then it comes with a little opener.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.640]   It's a TIE-VEX sleeve.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.640]   You open it up.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:28.920]   And then it goes, and it plumps.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:33.800]   And now you've got a really comfortable mattress using just the right combination.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.800]   Watch this.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.720]   Of premium latex and memory phone.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.920]   So it's just what I want, which is soft on top with a firm underneath.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:42.920]   I don't know.
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:43.920]   I can't describe it.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.920]   It's great.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.160]   I'm asking comfort and support, very affordable.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:52.240]   You buy them online, completely risk free because you have free delivery and painless
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.440]   returns within a 100 day period.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:59.080]   Oh, nine night.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:06.480]   Casper people have a great sense of humor.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.480]   They sent me a book in my Casper box.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.480]   There's Lisa.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.480]   She loves it too.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.480]   They sent me Litten Stray.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.480]   He's eminent Victorians.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:19.840]   In the box, which is definitely puts you out.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.920]   Thank you, Terry, for that.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.840]   But it's really cool.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.040]   Statistically, they say lying on a bed in a showroom has no correlation to whether it's
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.040]   the right bed for you.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.040]   And I will vouch for that.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.040]   I've done it.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.040]   And I've...
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.040]   These are made in America.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.400]   They're really comfy.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.080]   They do a great job.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:44.640]   They even give you a little good night book that tells you how to live with your Casper.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.720]   You can put it right on the floor.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.720]   I liked this so much.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.200]   I got one for Henry for his dorm, not dorm, but his house, his college house.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.560]   And that's how he's going to do it right on the floor.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.720]   But we can also put it on a box spring or a slatted base.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:01.760]   It's well made, really nice, very comfortable, no springs.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:06.360]   If you've never slept on a foam mattress, you'll say, "Where's the lumps?"
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.360]   It's...
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.360]   They're perfect.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.520]   It's like just a piece of foam.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.520]   It really isn't.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.400]   It's really nice.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.560]   It's really nice.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.600]   And this cover can be unzipped and washed.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   I am very happy.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.120]   They have a very nice team there.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.720]   So I just want you to try Casper mattresses.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:28.400]   You'll find them at Casper Sleep, C-A-S-P-E-R, sleep.com/twig.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:34.880]   And save 50 bucks, by the way, when you use the offer code TWIG, T-W-I-G, $500 for a
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.800]   twin, $950 for a king.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:42.800]   Now compare that to the prices in the mattress store, plus 100 days.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.440]   Plus you don't have to go through all that mishigas.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.800]   I'm trying to say, "Is that mattress like that mattress?"
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.800]   No, I know.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:49.800]   It's so...
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.520]   The whole industry is made up trying to fool you.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.520]   Petaluma...
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.520]   It must...
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.520]   It's a very high profit industry.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.640]   Petaluma has like eight mattress stores.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.880]   And literally they're twice as expensive as the Casper.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.880]   These are really nice.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   I'm very happy.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.880]   People...
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.560]   When I showed a picture of the Casper on Twitter, a lot of people said, "I've been thinking
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.040]   about it, but I just...
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.040]   I want it...
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.040]   I like it."
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.240]   And yes, I do.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.240]   Very much.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.240]   You should try it.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.480]   And of course, 100 days to return it if you don't like it.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.840]   By the way, for every mattress that you purchase through this show, Casper is going to donate
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.080]   $50 to Child's Play, which is really nice.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.080]   That very nice charity that helps sick kids.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.080]   Nice.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.080]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.080]   Casper...
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.080]   You know what?
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.080]   They're really nice people.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.080]   Caspersleep.com/twig.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.720]   So you'll save 50 bucks and 50 bucks goes to Child's Play.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.520]   I'm shopping for one.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:40.960]   I know that if you get it and you don't like it, I'm never going to hear the end of it.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.960]   So...
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.960]   Oh no.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.720]   No, I know you, Jeff.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.440]   And you will like it.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.080]   I'm not kidding.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.680]   More than my light switch.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.040]   Well that I don't like.
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.440]   No flinty parsimony.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.920]   No flinty mattresses for me.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.160]   No!
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.800]   So let's do the...
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.080]   Why don't we play the trumpets and do the change log?
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.080]   Let's do it.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.080]   Let's do it.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:10.480]   The Google change log.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.760]   And now ladies and gentlemen, Jada, Tripani.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.200]   We've got a few things today.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:21.600]   If you're on iOS, Google has released updates to the Docs and Sheets app for iOS.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.600]   And this update lets you open, edit and save Microsoft Office documents.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.960]   They've also released Google Slides for iOS.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.960]   Yes.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.720]   Big new feature here in Sheets and Docs is you can edit Microsoft Office documents natively
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:37.560]   so you can open anything, create an office and then you can also save those files in
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.360]   their original office formats.
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:44.040]   You can create and edit Google Slides on iOS now with the new Slides app.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:48.440]   So yeah, get those before the new iPhone comes out.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:53.720]   Hangouts got a refresh in Gmail which adds this new contacts tab.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:54.720]   There's a little tab.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:55.720]   There's no...
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.720]   It's not a text label.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.400]   It's just a little kind of androgynous person icon.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:03.960]   You tap on that icon and it sorts your contacts by whether or not they're online.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:09.200]   So it puts your online contacts at the top and you can also pin certain contacts at the
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.200]   top as well.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.200]   So makes things...
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.200]   I want Hangouts to get better.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.600]   I feel like it's so close.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   It's just so heavy weight.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.880]   I don't know what's wrong but I really want to use Hangouts.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.720]   I really want to like it.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:23.800]   The Android Hangouts app just tries me nuts because I can't tell whether I'm sending a
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.000]   Hangout message or an SMS.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   Ah.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.280]   Most of my phone calls are with Hangouts though even at home because I can wear my headset
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.480]   and I sit on the computer.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   It's just easy.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:42.000]   Jeff, I think there might be a setting in Hangouts that lets you either set different
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   colors or separate SMS and Hangouts.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Oh, I'll look at that.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.800]   That's a typical.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.360]   Jarvis just complains, Gina solves.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:55.440]   No, but of course that's not the fault because Google wants just all your messages to be
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.040]   seamlessly together.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.440]   Kind of a la-eye message.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:04.040]   But yeah, Hangouts is still a little bit clunky in that area.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:08.160]   There's a big update to a very old app.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.480]   Do you guys remember Google News and Weather for Android?
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.680]   It came out forever ago.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.680]   Oh yeah.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.760]   Has it gotten any love for a really long time?
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.760]   And boom.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:23.000]   Version 2.0 just dropped adding material design.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.440]   It's got the card layout akin to what you see in Google now.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.840]   There's support for local news and weather for multiple locations, a new, resizable home
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.800]   screen widget.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.720]   It's for Android 4.0 and higher and it's rolling out gradually.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:42.360]   I mean, we covered this last night on all about Android and I thought, well, why not
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.200]   just Google now?
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:48.400]   The difference between news and weather in Google now is that news and weather is actually
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:53.480]   kind of a full featured news app with different sections, technology sports where you get
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:59.360]   sort of in a more conventional typical newspaper, whereas now recommends news based on the
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.920]   things that you search for that you find in Google.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.440]   News apps to Google need.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:07.920]   I stopped installing this one, installed Currents, then they kind of let that one go
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.920]   and put newsstand.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.960]   Newsstand, which is not okay.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.880]   It's not rolled out to me yet.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.600]   I think it's maybe not my news drunk.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.480]   I think it's a bit of a waste.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.040]   They have tremendous power for Google news and they're not really using it.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.120]   I'm down low news and weather again.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.120]   I'm installing it.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.120]   I don't have it yet.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.480]   Oh, I don't see it in the app.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.240]   So it's not everywhere yet.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.920]   Yeah, it seems to be rolling out gradually.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.040]   So you might not see it on your phone or tablet right away.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.880]   I really like circa for when I do.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:38.880]   I do too.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.880]   Like, brown news.
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.400]   The Guardian app is also great, but Google doesn't want the material design.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.320]   Maybe it's just an example of what material design should look like.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:52.160]   Speaking of Android, the Google Search app for Android updated with navigation cards
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.760]   that look like the ones in Google Maps.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:59.160]   So if you search for destination or directions between two locations and just the Google Search
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:05.960]   app, it'll get these navigation cards that display a map that outlines the trip with
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:11.720]   the approximate travel time, distance, suggested and alternative routes, desired mode of transportation,
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:12.920]   and step-by-step directions.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.520]   That's all just in the Google Search results without having to launch maps.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.400]   Of course, you can just tap on the card to launch maps if you want to do that.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:25.000]   And finally, Google+ users can now import their videos into their YouTube account.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.600]   So you've auto uploaded videos to Google+ or you want to back them up to YouTube, you
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:33.400]   want to publish them on YouTube, you can go in YouTube, go to the uploads page and click
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.880]   on the import button.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.280]   And then you've got a chooser.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:40.080]   You can choose any of your Google+ videos and bring them on into YouTube.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:43.120]   And you can publish them on YouTube if you want.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:52.040]   So that's kind of a nice benefit of having Google+ and YouTube kind of merged.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.040]   And that's all I got.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.240]   Import video.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.240]   Import video, yeah.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.480]   There you go.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:05.200]   I have a lot of video, all of it trivial and dumb because it's a camera-phone video.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.400]   But maybe I should put it on YouTube.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.400]   Why not?
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.400]   Why not?
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:16.840]   OK, that's the change log play the drums.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:24.080]   All right, since you're the master of accents, the thing I wanted you to try out today is
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.560]   you see the thing about how you can cool Google now into responding to you with a British
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.200]   accent if you use a British accent.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.200]   Really?
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.200]   I've tried it myself.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.240]   I want to see if you the master can make this happen.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.240]   OK, Google.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.880]   That's why everything's responding now.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:41.880]   Stop it.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:42.880]   Oh, no.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.880]   Hey, stop it.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:45.880]   Pop it.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.760]   Oh, I hate it when that happens.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.480]   I'm British.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.080]   What are you going to do now?
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.720]   All right, have a look.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.720]   Oh, dear.
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:56.720]   Let's close that.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:57.720]   OK.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:05.200]   How can we get there?
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.400]   Is it in the OK Google that you have to do British?
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:12.280]   After you say, if you say Google, ask a question in your normal California accent.
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.320]   And then ask the next question in a British accent.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.800]   And according to this, unless I was being fooled by this video, it answers back to you
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.800]   at a different point.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.680]   It doesn't seem right.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.520]   How tall is Wilte Chamberlain?
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:32.000]   Wilte Chamberlain is seven feet, one inch tall.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.240]   How tall is Neville Chamberlain?
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.800]   Oh, it won't know that.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.200]   Let me do something.
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:44.360]   It can answer.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.920]   How tall is the queen?
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:53.440]   Elizabeth, the second is five feet, four inches tall.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.440]   Oh, she's tall.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:58.160]   I didn't think it was that tall.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.160]   I doubt that works.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.360]   How does it all be?
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.040]   It could be faked up.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.360]   Hello, Governor.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.160]   How tall is Mary Poppins?
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:13.040]   I'm going to get this corrected before I go to London.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.520]   They're going to just chase me out of the town.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:17.840]   All right.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:20.600]   I think you were punked.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.600]   I can't--
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:29.000]   What's the weather in London?
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.720]   OK, Google.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.440]   Where's the nearest place to get bangers and mash?
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:39.000]   Oh, you have to do stuff.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:39.600]   It'll talk, though.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.600]   How long is the Golden Gate Bridge?
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:51.080]   Golden Gate Bridge has a length of 8,980 feet.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.000]   I don't think that.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:52.520]   I think--
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.040]   That was--
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:53.840]   Where was it?
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:55.560]   I can't just do an accident without nowhere.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.600]   I can't do it.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:58.600]   I'm not even going to try.
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:59.100]   Let's see.
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:00.200]   This is boy Genius Report.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.560]   How long is the Golden Gate Bridge?
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.560]   Oh, he asked the same question.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:10.600]   Golden Gate Bridge has a length of 8,980 feet.
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.120]   OK, Google.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.680]   How long is the Golden Gate Bridge?
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:17.120]   That's the worst.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.400]   Yeah, yours was better.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.960]   Golden Gate Bridge has a length of 8,000.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.120]   That is bogus, bogus, bogus.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:23.600]   Is that the bogus?
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.200]   Yeah, you think it's bogus.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.800]   Absolutely bogus.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.360]   Yeah, your accent was definitely heavier.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.920]   Absolutely bogus.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.440]   That is edited to change the fact
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.920]   that they change the settings in the middle of that.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.360]   That's ridiculous.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.360]   You just can't trust anything on the internet.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.520]   No.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.280]   My favorite can't trust its story of the day.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.400]   It's all over in my world.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:48.680]   The independent reports that the times of London
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.880]   in its new office has speakers up,
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.000]   and they're going to put in the sound of clicking typewriter
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.960]   to motivate the staff.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:00.400]   The staffies don't even know what a typewriter sounds like.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:01.880]   What's that noise?
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.320]   Do we have woodpeckers?
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:06.440]   Up in the smell of ink and gin in the middle of the day.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:07.560]   There you go.
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.600]   And sweat.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.000]   Yes.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.720]   Amazon buys Twitch.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:15.160]   We thought, in fact, reported as if it were true that Google was--
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.600]   --you're going to buy Twitch.
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.600]   No.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.680]   You know, the stories have varied.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.440]   TechCrunch said that Google blinked.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:34.440]   That Google somehow didn't bid enough, or--
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:39.240]   and TechCrunch was the one who reported that Google had acquired them.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.360]   The price is the same.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.080]   A billion dollars.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:48.960]   Actually, the deal, Amazon says, was $970 million in cash.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.360]   Wow.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:55.640]   And the rest was in a retainer of fees
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:59.920]   to people in the company.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.000]   But Forbes says the reason that they backed off
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.200]   because of antitrust fears.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:05.760]   Yes.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.600]   Rightly so.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:08.920]   Rightly so.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.360]   Although, well, I don't know.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.520]   That may not be fair.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.560]   I think there's enough competition in that space.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.560]   But why would Amazon--
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:16.600]   What's the beat to this?
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.920]   I mean, I see the-- well, the space of watching people
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.160]   play video games.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.120]   No, it's--
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.880]   Antitrust.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.600]   First of all, that makes no sense.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:34.560]   I've never seen a company yet drop a bid for fear of antitrust.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.640]   And Google itself bought Motorola.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.960]   I mean, companies don't act in fear of antitrust.
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.160]   They act, and then if they get turned down,
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:42.880]   they don't do it.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:48.120]   But T-Mobile and Sprint Comcast and Time Warner,
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.760]   I don't think companies act that way.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.440]   That doesn't sound right.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.800]   I mean, really, XM and Siri--
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.760]   these are all things that you would have thought on the face
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:57.760]   of it.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.960]   There's no way they're going to get those through.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.200]   And I think you can make a strong case that Twitch is just
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.960]   one of many streaming services.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.200]   That's not.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.080]   So you think that's a face-saving rumor
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.040]   because they lost the deal?
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.640]   Yeah, I think they lost the deal.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.640]   And it could be that the Twitch folks wanted more money,
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.440]   or it could be they didn't want to work for Google.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.000]   Remember, then they're just a small part
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.840]   of a bigger operation called YouTube.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.480]   But Amazon, they're probably the run of the place.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:27.440]   In fact, I was wondering why Amazon--
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.040]   I mean, it's--
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:30.880]   I'm also wondering that.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:33.920]   --Amazon's clearly moving towards creating content.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.960]   They do shows now.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.960]   In fact, my suspicion is that they
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:43.000]   would like to get the hashettes of the world out
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.680]   of the publishing business and just publish direct.
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.280]   Why not control the content?
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:53.560]   But they don't really have a platform where they don't have
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.040]   a live streaming platform at all.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:02.360]   And so I'm not sure what the overall--
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.880]   it made so much sense to tie it to YouTube, where really,
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.880]   watching people game is a big part of YouTube.
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:11.160]   A billion dollars is a lot for Amazon.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:14.560]   They only have about $5 billion in cash.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.160]   Yeah, that's a 20%--
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.640]   Yeah, that's a lot of money.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:24.200]   They say they're not going to move Twitch to Seattle,
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.080]   that they're going to leave them in San Francisco,
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.080]   that they're going to pretty much--
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.680]   You have to move.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.840]   It's like, yeah, it's not that many employees.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:31.840]   Yeah, it's--
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:37.400]   I don't know.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.200]   I still don't get it.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.760]   I know I'm in an old fart.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:41.960]   I know it.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:45.080]   This discussion makes me feel older than any other discussion
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.520]   we have.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.640]   Just don't get Twitch.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.160]   You know, it's funny.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.840]   I get Twitch much more than I get YouTube.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.000]   I don't get YouTube, but I do understand Twitch.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.080]   I get that.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.080]   Of course, remember, this is the guy I spent nine hours
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.320]   last night playing, day and blow three.
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.160]   But I would rather play than watch somebody play.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:03.280]   But there are a lot of reasons why you'd watch somebody play.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:06.240]   In fact, I often do see Twitch videos before I buy a game,
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.040]   because I want to see what the game looks like.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.320]   Well, I get that.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.560]   The biggest thing I think that's happening-- and Chad's probably
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.240]   a better guy to ask about than this on this than me.
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.240]   But the biggest thing I think is happening
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:18.040]   is it's not really about the gameplay.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:21.520]   The most successful ones are humorists.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.680]   They're funny.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:24.480]   And the gameplay is just an excuse.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.720]   It's just a stage on which they can perform.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.960]   Is that right, Chad, do you think?
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:29.760]   Absolutely.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.200]   None of these people are experts at the game.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.800]   Well, some are, but few.
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:34.600]   Very few.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.240]   Yeah, you're not talking thresh here.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.520]   I would say, yeah, maybe two or three out of 100.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.680]   Some of them-- the ones I see Michael watching,
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.080]   it's not even about the gameplay.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.320]   He's not learning gameplay.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.480]   It's a humor.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:47.960]   Absolutely.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.240]   It's like red versus blue.
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.880]   It's like machinima.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.880]   It was not worth the trouble.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.800]   But the joke I wanted to do was I
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:00.960]   wanted to go make one on me playing solitaire.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.600]   And there's people that are so entertaining
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.160]   that they can do that.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:04.840]   That they play--
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:05.680]   Right, that's exactly right.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.640]   That they play Kim Kardashian's Hollywood--
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:08.760]   The game doesn't matter.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:09.760]   iPad game.
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.040]   And it's hilarious every moment of it.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.040]   If you're funny--
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.640]   There's a lot of comedic material there.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.720]   But yes, if you're a personality,
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.360]   they're just using the game as a thing to rip off.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:19.640]   That's what I think is a stage.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:20.800]   But they're talking about the game
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.280]   and they're making fun of the game.
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.960]   And they make the people do stupid things.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.640]   Well, if you look at it, if you think about it,
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:30.200]   I mean, the biggest game currently on Twitch right now
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.400]   is League of Legends.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.760]   That is not a funny game.
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.440]   There's nothing built into that game
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:35.960]   to make it funny or entertaining.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.320]   Well, let's really drive Jeff Batty.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:42.600]   Let's just watch a little Twitch TV right now.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:43.720]   What do you say?
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:47.920]   Who's the best League of Legends?
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.840]   I mean, that's the biggest game right now.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:50.400]   Right now, yeah.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.880]   26,000 people right now.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:56.760]   And ladies and gentlemen, you may hear some profanity here
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.440]   because most of this stuff is fairly profanity.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:00.880]   Is that life?
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:03.280]   Oh, first, let's have pancakes.
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:04.800]   I wish.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:08.120]   And this, by the way, is where the money comes from.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:11.080]   Amazon may just see it as an ad platform.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.720]   They don't have.
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.560]   And there you go.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.560]   Come on.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.360]   By the way, there's no skip button on this.
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.040]   No, it's a 30-second pre-roll that you can't skip.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.040]   Oh, man.
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.800]   You know, it's really bad they started the game
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.360]   and then they went to the ad.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.840]   Yeah, they let you know that you can watch the stream
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.320]   but first, after this ad is done.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.800]   Pancakes.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.880]   All right, here we go.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.560]   Let's listen and watch.
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.480]   This is 26,000 people.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.720]   More people are watching this right now
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:37.960]   than are watching us.
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.520]   [LAUGHS]
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.800]   OK.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.120]   So he's got some rap music.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.880]   Is that-- that's not part of the game?
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.800]   Nope.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.800]   So this guy's not even saying funny things.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:52.640]   Now, I'm not sure if this is perhaps a tournament.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.040]   And he's not saying anything because--
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.440]   Maybe because he's actually playing.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:57.840]   Right, he's truly trying to play.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:02.120]   This is Nightblue 3 playing.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.240]   Play wasn't worth the TP just because, like,
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.400]   not getting much out of it.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.960]   I mean, I would say the same, you know,
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.520]   not getting much out of that TP.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.200]   So--
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:14.080]   He sounds like he's 12.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.000]   Probably here.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.120]   AD is actually really strong.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.560]   So this is a guy who's actually playing.
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:19.800]   I can't get to any farming.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:20.400]   That's funny.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.320]   And people are watching this because they're
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.720]   learning about League of Legends.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.720]   Yeah, like, he's saying-- he's also saying games--
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:29.680]   like, AD is an AD carry, which is a specific type.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.680]   He's farming, so he's trying to get the minions
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.600]   to get more gold so he can level up his character label.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.360]   Why would you do this chat instead of playing the game?
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:41.240]   Lots of people who are watching this can't afford
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:44.800]   the same type of perks he has.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.600]   So you're watching a high-level player?
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:46.960]   Right.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:49.440]   And also, he's very skilled.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:50.920]   And I mean, that's why you watch sports.
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:52.320]   Like, why wouldn't you just go out play school?
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.080]   League of Legends may not be a good example.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:57.360]   That is very true.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.920]   It's hard to parse everything into Twitch into one stream.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.160]   And on top of that, one 30 second stream.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:03.640]   Right.
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:05.880]   I mean, let's watch Rabbit Bong play.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:06.920]   Rabbit Bong.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:08.120]   Hooray.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.000]   So she's cute.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.320]   Sure.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:12.160]   Does that help?
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.160]   Yes.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:16.800]   She also has a face cam, which is known to--
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.080]   That draws more people.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:18.640]   Draw a lot more people.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.240]   There's a chat room here, by the way, on the left.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:22.440]   She's streaming that.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:22.840]   Yeah, you're up.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:24.400]   You're up.
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.160]   And she's wearing a low-cut--
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.520]   I'm going to experience two.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:27.960]   --jumper.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.360]   You're level 14.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.160]   You're right, Jeff.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.840]   I'm too old, too.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:35.440]   You've also gone-- it's like, into the deep end.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.960]   And you're expecting to watch 30 seconds worth
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.480]   and understand the whole community.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.080]   I mean, it's not going to happen.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.080]   That's like the argument about Christianity.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:46.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:49.520]   I am in too deep.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:52.920]   Well, I'm just looking for something.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:55.640]   Let's look at some of the most popular channels.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:56.360]   Here's--
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:56.800]   I know.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:57.320]   I know.
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:59.480]   I'm not criticizing.
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:56:59.960]   I know.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:00.520]   No, you want to know.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.480]   You want to get it?
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.440]   Minecraft might be more appropriate, right,
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:08.720]   because that's-- do you see more humor in Minecraft?
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:09.440]   There can be.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.640]   But also, streams are more--
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:15.240]   I mean, humor is very good.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:16.640]   Yeah, that's always going to happen.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:17.040]   Right.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:20.240]   But streams, you have so much time to fill that--
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.560]   That's a lot of dead time.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:22.360]   Yes.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:23.640]   And some of the viewership of this
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.720]   is just on in the background, or people actually
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:28.000]   like watching it glued to it.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.240]   Most of it's in the background.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:34.640]   Reddit says the funniest Twitch user is Wishand, W-S-H-A-N-D.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.840]   You ever hear of him?
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.280]   He might not be live right now.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.280]   Right.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:38.880]   But one hell of a journey.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.360]   But you can't watch a--
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:41.360]   Yeah, you can.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.720]   It doesn't have to be streaming.
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:46.760]   Let's search for Wishand.
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:50.160]   Wishand-- Wishand Dice.
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:53.120]   No sleep is always good for some late night laughs.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.000]   Is that his Reddit?
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:55.160]   OK.
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:55.760]   Well, we got to--
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.920]   You're a L-I-R-I-K.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:59.280]   Well, you haven't made me laugh.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.000]   Now, there-- OK.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:01.880]   But there is a guy.
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:02.280]   Get this.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.120]   Entertaining.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.000]   Be entertaining.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.760]   There is a guy on Twitch who streams the Oregon Trail.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:10.400]   Now, that's got to be--
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.360]   nobody's trying to get better at the Oregon Trail
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.640]   unless he's in fourth grade.
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.440]   One of my favorites is Man versus Game.
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:17.560]   I like that.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.120]   Who plays-- he's like going through basically
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:23.520]   like every game from his childhood, from basically any time.
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:26.200]   And he has to beat it, and then he moves on to the next game.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.360]   I like that idea.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:32.680]   Another one of my favorites is Sevedis, who does Minecraft stuff.
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.800]   The thing is, is that you were mentioning people,
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.760]   and I'm just like--
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:37.280]   I don't know.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:37.880]   You don't know these people.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:39.360]   I know the people that I like.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:40.560]   You know the YouTube people.
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:41.880]   Or do you watch Twitch?
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.080]   I watch Twitch.
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:45.560]   I stream on Twitch once a week.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.560]   This guy-- you do?
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:47.160]   What do you stream?
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.120]   Minecraft?
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.160]   Yeah, Minecraft.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:53.400]   I've been doing the Sims 3 a lot.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.040]   Modern Minecraft is normally what I do.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:00.040]   And yeah, from 7 PM to 10 PM.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:00.760]   Wow.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:01.480]   Yeah, it's a three hour--
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.880]   So you're playing it anyway.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.480]   Why might as well just stream it?
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.040]   Sure.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.920]   Well, yeah.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:12.760]   I mean, there's definitely a very different atmosphere
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:13.880]   when you're streaming.
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.720]   Here's Monotone Tim playing Roller Coaster 2.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:22.520]   You probably just click into this highlight.
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:26.560]   So he'll have 15 minutes or so of prep time
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:28.040]   so that people can tell he's live,
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.360]   and then they'll join the chat room.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.200]   So he's probably playing something.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.440]   No, this is the-- this is the--
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.120]   Yeah, this is the video-- yeah.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:34.720]   Fought.
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:38.200]   It's a video on demand of what happened in the past.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:39.600]   So you'll probably want to set ahead.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:41.800]   Because it's saying hold on.
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:42.360]   Right.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:42.720]   There.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:43.640]   Here we go.
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:48.920]   Even elementary school teachers and whatnot,
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:50.160]   they had to know.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:59.280]   Like, no, I am the world's most gifted fourth grader.
[00:59:59.280 --> 00:59:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:00.800]   You know what?
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.800]   I'm old too, Jeff.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.360]   I'm not a twit.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.360]   I'm old too.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.000]   This is terrible.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   This is like old people try to understand
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.240]   this newfangled gaming thing.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.240]   It is.
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.440]   I don't think I'm terrible for it.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.800]   I mean, I'm just saying, it's making me feel old and out of it.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.320]   I'm not making for other people doing it.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.360]   I just feel like--
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.120]   All right.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:19.640]   Oh.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.200]   One more.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.280]   This is from Gomory in our chat room.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.480]   He says, this video, if you watch this,
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:30.440]   this is why Twitch is worth $1 billion.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:35.880]   Day seven, fish versus fish in Street Fighter.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.080]   Oh, but first an ad about something.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.400]   [WHISTLE]
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.560]   It feels like watching the director's commentary of a movie.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.760]   Not even that good, because it's not a movie you know
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.080]   or a director you care about.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.080]   So it's not that.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:50.580]   Yeah.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.080]   It's--
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.640]   But the handsome viewers commentary on a movie.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.280]   The way you're setting it up, though,
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.960]   is basically setting up to fail.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.120]   I mean, you don't go in and expecting to watch--
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.240]   Because I want it to fail.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:01.240]   I know.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.720]   30 seconds worth of it.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.240]   I'll take half a billion for Twit.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.600]   And I think it's twice as valuable.
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.880]   All right, here we go.
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.760]   Fish versus fish.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.160]   Playing Street Fighter.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.480]   You know, Twitch plays Pokemon.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.040]   Oh, so these are actual fish.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.040]   Those are fish planes.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.000]   This is pretty funny.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.760]   So these are-- this is a fish tank in the upper left hand
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.260]   corner.
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.880]   And on the fish tank, they have created a grid
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:32.080]   for the different moves forward, backwards,
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.960]   and then strikes.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.760]   And so basically what you're seeing on the right
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.480]   is the actual Street Fighter's fighting,
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.520]   according to random fish swimming around.
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.920]   And of course, not much is happening,
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.440]   because the fish aren't really very aggressive.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:52.320]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.320]   He actually won.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.280]   But how long can you watch this?
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.520]   It's funny for--
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.280]   No, it's good.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:02.800]   I got it.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.440]   It's funny.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.360]   That's good.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.560]   And I'm done, because I don't think
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.400]   it's going to be any different for the next four hours.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.400]   Oh.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:16.440]   I want to do a video of Gamer Kids watching Twig.
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.480]   Yeah, they would really-- what are they talking about?
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.240]   Oh, they're so stupid.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.240]   They're a potato.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.240]   Oh.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.040]   Oh, then what happened?
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.120]   When are they going to be funny?
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.600]   Is there going to be a joke?
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.560]   This is entertainment.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.200]   I'm just kidding.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.320]   I'm just messing around with this.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.720]   I've wasted 37 years of my life trying
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.440]   to learn how to do broadcasting.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.480]   And these kids-- these kids today--
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.080]   they don't know professionals when they see them.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.400]   OK, well, there you go.
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.720]   I think it makes sense if Amazon could have had--
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.280]   I mean, they can monetize it.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.920]   It's just a strange business.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.800]   I think what's interesting to do, a bigger skill,
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:04.200]   the coincidence of story saying, but a long felt
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:07.240]   that the real fight here is not Google versus Facebook
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.000]   or Google versus Microsoft.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.440]   It's Google versus Amazon.
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.800]   And we see that fight interesting.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:14.840]   Wow.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.760]   And so we see this week.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.280]   So fine.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.520]   So Google lost Amazon got it.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.040]   We certainly didn't have one with other companies
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.600]   where they say, oh, I got you.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.200]   Fine.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.480]   We also see Amazon entering the ad business
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.400]   and trying to get more serious about that, which may
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.920]   your right Leo indicates something about this ad.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:35.880]   It's all about the ads.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:36.380]   It is.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.080]   It's content and ads.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.320]   And our audience and ads.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:43.520]   And then Google bought Zinc, a pretty high end,
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:48.800]   a very high end, special effects in the cloud company.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:49.600]   Well, that makes sense.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.640]   They need to buy more of this stuff for Chromebooks.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.140]   Right.
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:56.200]   And they're going to move-- well, that's just Chromebooks, too.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.000]   It's also their movie.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.640]   It's now served on the Amazon cloud, not on--
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.680]   I'm just going to get a brew.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:09.160]   We have big brew and move it over there.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.800]   It's because I moved over so I didn't get a sunlight coming
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.320]   from the room.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.320]   It's all right.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.120]   And--
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.600]   So Zinc's, if stuff has been used in Looper and Star Trek
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.480]   into darkness--
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.040]   And so imagine if you could take that kind of functionality
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:27.480]   and bring it down to cloud-based stuff for you or me.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:28.720]   That's pretty powerful.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.000]   It ran on Amazon Web Services.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.560]   Obviously, it'll be running on Google services.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.560]   So it could just merely be that Google wants a proof of concept.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.280]   See, you can do this on our cloud.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.280]   But I bet you it has to do with Chromebooks and the ability
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:46.640]   to do more with Chrome OS.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:50.480]   Well, the more they move high-end activities to the cloud--
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.360]   Well, that's one of the main reasons you buy a computer
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.960]   is to edit video.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.480]   Can't do that on a Chromebook or can you?
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.760]   Can you?
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.840]   Wouldn't that be something?
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.400]   All right, your turn, Gina, what story do you like on all this?
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:09.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:16.680]   Cyanogen joining up with Google, Amazon, and HTC
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.160]   folks to build something unnamed from--
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.680]   They're not going to put on the right--
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.920]   I'm going to put on the right now because they don't know
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.960]   anything.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.600]   They're building something really cool, but we don't know--
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.960]   We don't know what it is.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:28.800]   OK.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.400]   That's good?
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.280]   Yeah, that's pretty good.
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.160]   That's pretty good.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.600]   We'll talk-- we do the Diaspora story.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.680]   Oh, yeah, that's interesting.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.360]   That's kind of-- yeah, well, Diaspora is-- oh, so just
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.480]   a little recap.
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:43.400]   That was the first Kickstarter project I ever donated to.
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.160]   They were formed a few years ago.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.320]   It was a bunch of college kids who said,
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.200]   we can do a better Facebook, and it will be,
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.880]   and this is the key, distributed.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.280]   Yeah, it's going to be a federated system where everybody
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.240]   can run a node, anybody who wants to can run a node,
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.160]   and they're all federated together.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.640]   They did, in fact, do it, I guess.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.920]   They got it up.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.640]   I mean, that's surprising.
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.600]   One, I thought it was long gone.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.360]   But apparently--
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:09.920]   Oh, it exists.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.280]   It does exist.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:15.320]   And is being used by terrorists.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:15.720]   Right.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.200]   I mean, this goes back to our conversation we had last week,
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:21.800]   where Twitter was removing links to the ISIS video,
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.000]   the beheading video, because they
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.720]   have that sort of centralized control.
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.480]   But Diaspora, because it's a federated network,
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.400]   ISIS said, OK, well, we're just going to distribute this video
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.000]   here.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.280]   And there isn't one central controlling body
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.720]   that can remove all the links.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.400]   In fact, if you go to join Diaspora,
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.920]   the first thing they say is, you can't join here.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:43.400]   You have to find a pod, or set up your own pod.
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.160]   Not a node, right a pod.
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:48.600]   And if you have a pod, or you join another pod,
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.520]   then they will federate.
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:53.160]   And these are all the Diaspora-hosted pods.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:56.840]   There's actually a pretty good lead list.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.680]   Yeah, there was this great conversation on Twitter,
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.680]   and I wish I could find it.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.280]   It was between Dave Moran and Chris Messina
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:06.200]   and a few other people talking about the dream
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:09.600]   of the federated network and the federated protocol,
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:13.880]   and how email is really the only federated network that we have.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.080]   What does federated mean?
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.400]   Meaning that there's no central one body that
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.640]   owns it and controls it.
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.040]   So with email, everybody sets up their own separate email
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.760]   server, or maybe someone provides it for you,
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.920]   like Google or Microsoft or Yahoo or whatever.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.400]   But they can all talk to one another.
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.920]   We all receive messages basically the same way
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.560]   using a standard protocol, and it's not controlled.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.040]   Once an email is sent, it's not like any one person
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.360]   can delete the email from everywhere.
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.640]   It's just a network of nodes that send messages to and from
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.080]   one another.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.920]   They can all understand one another.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.640]   And it works, right?
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:53.240]   Unlike Twitter or Facebook, where there's a centralized
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:55.760]   canola in this one company and whatever.
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:59.200]   This was Evan Prodromo's goal with StatusNet.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:07:59.800]   Yes.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.600]   In fact, we ran a StatusNet server.
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:05.120]   It was a Twitter federated Twitter.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:08.120]   We ran the Twitter army for a while.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.440]   And you could post something on Twitter army that would then
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:14.560]   go to status.net and other places.
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.360]   I think it's a great idea, because it's decentralized.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:20.240]   Anyway, the problem with diaspora is it's open source.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:24.200]   So anybody can host a pod, including the bad guys,
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.560]   whoever that might be.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.560]   Right.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.440]   I mean, that's a feature or a bug, depending on how you look at it.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.520]   You can do about it.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:30.800]   Right.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:35.480]   It's like saying, hey, Linus Torvalds, there's terrorists
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.040]   using Linux.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.600]   You've got to stop them.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:38.960]   Right.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.600]   That's not--
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:40.320]   You can't stop it.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:40.960]   Right.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.760]   Nothing you can do about it.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.680]   But it goes back to the discussion we had last week,
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:49.640]   is it does open this necessarily breed bad behavior.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:50.560]   No.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.360]   It breeds all behavior.
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:53.360]   Some of it will be bad.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.320]   Some of it will be good.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:57.080]   Humans are humans.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:00.800]   Until we perfect humanity, we're not going to be able to say--
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.400]   Well, but in other systems in society,
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:06.040]   we manage to deal with norms.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:09.680]   So I don't go on the street and start yelling at somebody.
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.200]   But that's what makes somebody a terrorist,
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.680]   is they don't care.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:22.040]   But terrorists couldn't disrupt normal everyday life.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:23.040]   That's what they do.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.800]   Real life, they may be canned online.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.480]   Yeah, they do.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.040]   That's the whole--
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.360]   Not a queen of what I'm saying.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:32.520]   But I'm trying to say, is there a step change here that
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:38.040]   says that it's absolutely uncontrollable,
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:42.760]   or will we develop norms and mechanisms
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:45.880]   to affect bad behavior more?
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.560]   Yeah, but norms only work to the point
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.240]   that somebody's willing to obey them.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:58.920]   And people who like terrorists, who have a strong mission
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.640]   to the point that they're willing to violate norms,
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.680]   norms aren't going to protect against terrorists.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.000]   Leo, if I go on the streets of New York
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   and I start screaming and I would never do this
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.320]   in just a second example, a racial, a racist word,
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:16.840]   I would get shouted down, stared down, attacked, accused.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:19.960]   People would stand up for right behavior against me.
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.240]   Unless you were holding a gun while you did it.
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:22.760]   True.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:22.960]   True.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.400]   Then norms wouldn't help.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.840]   Then you would have to have the police come and get you.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.600]   All right, so come down from the level of terrorists.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.160]   I wasn't saying that that opened this breeds terrorism.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.600]   I said it breeds bad behavior.
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.760]   So-- and I'm asking the question.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:37.560]   I'm not answering the question.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:38.640]   I'm asking the question whether that
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:42.240]   is a necessary condition.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.800]   Because on the street, we have the open street.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.200]   And I have free speech in this country.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:45.960]   I can say anything on what.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.960]   But if I went out there spewing this,
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.800]   and as long as I didn't need my meds,
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:50.800]   then I was just a hateful person.
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.400]   People would yell at me and scream at me.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:52.880]   And they would--
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.040]   Well, they do that on Twitter too.
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.600]   But it doesn't stop you.
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:56.400]   It doesn't stop you.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.040]   I mean, they--
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:02.200]   You get-- if you're a troll or a bad person in comments
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.920]   or whatever, people will yell back.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:08.480]   No, no, because what we said-- no, what we say is,
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.920]   don't feed the troll, ignore the troll, block the troll,
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.760]   let the troll keep on doing whatever the troll wants to do.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:16.960]   So what would the metaphor in Times Square would be?
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:18.720]   We would all just walk around this person
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.360]   screaming the horrid word.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.720]   I don't think it's actually--
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:23.200]   I think this actually happens.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.280]   No, not New York.
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:24.720]   No.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:25.560]   Really?
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.880]   I was walking across 44th Street today.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.280]   Some bozos all unhappy.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.680]   He can't turn right.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.360]   Light turns.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.600]   He still tries to come in the intersection.
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.720]   I stand right in front of his ass.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:35.600]   I pointed him.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:40.080]   I pointed at the traffic light like an a-hole New Yorker
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.080]   that I am and say, tough.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:44.680]   Because he was violating the law.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.200]   By God, I stood up for that.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.480]   And he was getting in the way--
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.640]   You're lucky to get run over.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.680]   Well, that's church.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:55.840]   But I had my norm moment right there.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.400]   I think the world is the world.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:02.560]   And the open, closed, whatever, if you have gathering places
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:05.600]   for people, whether virtual or real,
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.680]   you're going to have bad behavior,
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:13.040]   the problem is that the norms have to be backed up
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:18.440]   by more than just goodwill because goodwill isn't going
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.520]   to stop somebody who's actively negative, right?
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.520]   No, no.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.920]   You can have criminals in either case.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:25.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:28.120]   What I'm trying to ask is I'm going to get asked to get--
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:31.560]   Well, kind of that middle ground guy who's not a criminal
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.640]   but just wants to act out.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:33.160]   Bad behavior.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.480]   Does it be bad behavior?
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.680]   So let's do-- OK, so--
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.600]   Oh, say things.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.880]   People walk around in New York City naked.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.360]   Nobody stops them.
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.200]   Or just insulting people out of nowhere.
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.840]   There's lots of people who do that, right?
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.240]   You're a fat.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.800]   You're really ugly.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.880]   You're fat, right?
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:56.840]   That wouldn't happen unless there were meds needed in New York
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:57.280]   City.
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.520]   But it happens all over online.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.720]   And there isn't that much shutting down.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:01.840]   Because there's no friction.
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:02.880]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.560]   And our response-- right, there's no friction.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.080]   Our response is--
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.040]   Well, just consequences.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.320]   There's no consequences.
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.640]   But because you can't enforce the friction,
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.520]   it's a big difference.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.400]   If you say to me, I'm fat on Times Square
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.120]   and I yell back at you, I'm right there.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.680]   It doesn't matter if I yell at you on Twitter.
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:23.760]   So ergo, don't open this digitally.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.880]   Mean that we are stuck with bad behavior.
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.280]   We're stuck with one of two extremes.
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.240]   Either you're open and you have bad behavior.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.880]   Or you're controlled, whether it's
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:34.160]   by Facebook's control or Mike Elgin's control of Google+,
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.240]   and that's the only way you're going to have good behavior.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.760]   Is that what we're stuck with?
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:38.960]   I hope not.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.560]   I pray not.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.320]   Is I like open--
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.160]   I don't know.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:45.360]   I feel like the world is filled with bad behavior, Jeff,
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:46.200]   all the time.
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:48.680]   And if you wish, you can watch television news every night
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.720]   and get your stress level--
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:51.720]   No, no.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:57.640]   That's because television news over amplifies isolated
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.880]   situations.
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.960]   So does Twitter.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.680]   I'm not so sure it's over amplified.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.880]   It's amplifying.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:04.440]   Well, no, it is.
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.040]   Any broadcast medium is an amplifier.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.680]   Yeah, well, that's one.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:12.040]   I don't know.
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.720]   No, I think you're saying this is why we can't have nice things.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.000]   Yeah, yeah, right.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.720]   Which is the title of a book coming out, right?
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:20.560]   I think.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.200]   Yeah, it just came out.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.160]   Which is-- I think it's pretty much the same premise.
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.680]   And I think we can have nice things.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.520]   And we just-- people are people.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.560]   They're going to be bad.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.040]   They're going to be assholes.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:32.840]   There always will be--
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.000]   We deal with it better in real life.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.680]   And so my question is, will we come up with ways
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.680]   to deal with it better, literally?
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:40.720]   Or is that impossible?
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:41.560]   Is that a logical--
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.120]   No, I'm sure we will.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.640]   But there's no way we can eliminate it.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.040]   There will be bad behavior.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:48.400]   No.
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.120]   Distancing.
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:50.560]   It's the separation.
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:51.720]   It's the distancing.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.680]   It's the lack of face to face, right?
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.680]   My wife is at her scariest when we're in the car.
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:58.160]   That's right.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.080]   When she gets upset.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:14:59.600]   That's right.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:00.200]   You know, the road rage.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.760]   I mean, things come out of her mouth.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:02.600]   That's right.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.160]   Scares me.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.880]   At 17 years, we've been married.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:07.440]   She scares me just in the car.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.320]   It's the-- and she'll say it.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.320]   This is the place where I'm at.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:09.880]   Because it's safe for her.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:10.400]   It's safe for her.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:10.880]   Please, say it.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:11.400]   It's safe for her.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:11.960]   Because it's safer.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.640]   And no one ever hears what she's saying.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:14.560]   The windows are up.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.200]   I mean, I say to her, why don't you--
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.520]   you know, when we're sitting next to the other car,
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.040]   why don't you roll down your car and say this?
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.560]   And I'm just going to get this out.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:25.040]   And it's like that on Twitter and online.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.760]   There's no consequence.
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.520]   Yeah, but you know, there may be people-- in fact,
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.480]   I guess they probably are-- who think one of us
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:34.600]   might be a horrible person online
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.840]   and would like to shut us down.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:42.080]   So-- well, I just saw--
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.560]   two seconds ago, I saw somebody.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.840]   Somebody did a ridiculous treat against me.
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.720]   I'm not going to give them the attention.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.560]   And I don't know where somebody in the organization,
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.080]   I respect.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:51.920]   I think it has brains.
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.240]   Just somebody says, oh, boy, isn't that fun?
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:54.960]   Who knows better?
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:57.720]   It's stupid.
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:00.240]   But that's the kind-- our norm right now
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.160]   is to incur-- not just to not create fiction,
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.240]   it's to grease the skids.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:05.760]   Right.
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:06.760]   Right.
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.080]   So why is it digital?
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.080]   I mean, what I'm hoping this-- I hope the answer is,
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.880]   it was the same with the telegraph, damn it.
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:17.600]   People-- people had sex fantasies
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.600]   with thoughts and dashes.
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.440]   And then we figured it out and got used to it,
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.360]   and we figured out our norms.
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.160]   The same with cameras, the same with everything else.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.880]   My hope is it'll be the same with online.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.280]   I believe it will be.
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:32.000]   What I'm reaching for is assurance
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.360]   that there's a path to civility even with openness.
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:37.960]   I can't--
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.440]   There's always going to be people
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.400]   who call in the SWAT squad on somebody, right?
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   That's not going to be--
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.600]   We'll never have complete harmony.
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.280]   We'll never have complete--
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.040]   That's the nature of life.
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.560]   I want that way.
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:55.080]   Life is full of irritants.
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.640]   If you don't want that, you should get a vat for yourself
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.040]   and a feed tube.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.200]   You know, I often think about this
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.160]   from the tech perspective of, you know,
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:07.480]   if email is the one true open social network,
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:10.840]   anybody can send me a message if they have my email address.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.400]   However-- and they can say whatever they want,
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.400]   however they want.
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.680]   But I have an email client that helps me control
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:16.480]   that experience.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.840]   I have spam filters and other filters
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.360]   that I've set up and other--
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.000]   But still stuff gets through.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.080]   Still stuff gets through, sure.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.240]   But--
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:25.880]   But--
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:26.800]   That was the point--
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.320]   And no norms are protecting you.
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.520]   That's just open.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.680]   Well, but hold on.
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.040]   Hold on.
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.440]   It's a really good point, you know?
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.400]   Because I hardly ever get the kinds of insults in email
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.520]   that I do get on Twitter.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:38.040]   OK?
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.800]   Now, there's an obvious reason for that.
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:42.680]   Because on Twitter, I'm showing off for people.
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:43.360]   Twitter's public.
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:43.880]   Right.
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:44.360]   It's a public--
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.480]   But I got an email just last week.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:46.320]   I kept the show last week.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.560]   Somebody saying to me, and the first line of the email,
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.200]   I think you're a dick.
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.720]   And I did email them back.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:56.440]   I said, why would you think that I would read past that?
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:57.600]   And I didn't.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.880]   Well, see, why do you even respond?
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:17:59.800]   See, I said, see.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.200]   Why do you even respond to that?
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:01.760]   I don't know.
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.560]   I said, save your keystrokes and buy all that.
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:07.640]   But my response to that is to delete key.
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:08.440]   But that's-- yeah.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:11.560]   But that's-- there's done you created no friction
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.080]   to bad behavior.
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:13.800]   But I don't know.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.760]   Well, then, then, how do we ever get good behavior?
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.960]   If you don't create friction to bad behavior.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.960]   I can pretty much guarantee you that responding to the guy
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.480]   does not help the situation.
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:28.360]   I've had cases where I've called people on their behavior
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:29.760]   and they've backed off.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.000]   Yeah, I do.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.880]   Because what I'm trying to do, I'm trying to argue is,
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:35.480]   listen, if the person is a true dick,
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:36.840]   then there's no curing them.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:39.160]   If they need their meds, that's for doctors to do.
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:41.920]   But if what I'm saying is, if otherwise,
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:45.320]   nice and intelligent people are acting like dicks online
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.280]   and are encouraged to do so, and there's
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.480]   no friction against that, in fact,
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.080]   there's greasing of their behavior in that case.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:52.360]   Right.
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.880]   There's a perverse positive feedback loop.
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.800]   There's actually a positive feedback loop.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.040]   We do get rewarded, especially in the performative
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:04.120]   sort of sphere where snark and quips and criticism actually
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.840]   kind of gets you more attention or, you know,
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:07.800]   an employee out of girls.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.240]   You do, as the worker, the girl is built.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:11.520]   I guess it's true that the nature of Twitter
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.000]   promotes that kind of thing.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.040]   That's probably true.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:20.720]   And all I'm trying to ask is, is that necessary?
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.000]   Is that the end?
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.080]   Is there no hope other than Twitter
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.280]   deciding that it has to improve things,
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.920]   of the four brands, and it starts killing stuff?
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.240]   Which I'm not arguing for.
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:33.240]   We've all called for Twitter to have better tools.
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:37.120]   Mm-hmm, yeah.
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:40.720]   Not just tools to mute, but tools to block ban.
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:42.480]   Right, which is genius, genius trying to correct,
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.320]   genius suggestion for this is trying
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.360]   to create a level of friction.
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:47.320]   Right.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:49.440]   Make it so-- or a different way.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:52.680]   Genius trying to suggest a way to disconnect
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:56.240]   the circuit of the feedback loop or some people.
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.040]   If they get less attention, if they know they get less attention,
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.560]   maybe they'll do it less.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.840]   In the real world, I will confront somebody.
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.960]   But in the digital world, I will not.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.320]   I just-- I just delete it.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.040]   It's easy enough to delete it.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.120]   I don't have a lot of evidence that there's anything to do.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.360]   By the way, I don't always do that.
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.480]   I often-- that's my policy.
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:18.080]   I often get, you know, steam comes in my day years
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.360]   and I respond.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.240]   And it's almost always a mistake.
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:22.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:26.520]   So I know what the-- from me-- and I'm not saying it for anybody
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.320]   else, but for me, the right thing to do is
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.880]   hit the delete key or the block key.
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:31.240]   And--
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:36.240]   No, I'm saying is, as a society-- we're building a society
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.240]   online, and as a result of that, are we
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.920]   building a better society?
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:44.920]   And I wish we would.
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.080]   I like it.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.520]   You're right.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:51.840]   But meanwhile, they ask for others, nothing you can do.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.840]   If terrorists want to use it, you're stuck.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:54.840]   Well, I'd say no.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.760]   In their case, they're going to the proprietors
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:59.520]   and notifying them and asking them to--
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:20:59.520]   Well--
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.520]   Because--
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.520]   Because--
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:04.560]   Yeah, but what you could do is just start your own pod,
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.760]   the ISIS pod.
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:08.240]   It could-- and what could well?
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:08.740]   Yes.
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:09.440]   And run a server.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.480]   And then you could try to shut people down.
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:13.800]   But that's part of the problem, is by the way,
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:14.560]   is this whack-a-mole.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:18.480]   It's very hard on the internet to shut down speech.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.600]   And ISIS is the ultimate troll.
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.000]   Yeah, I mean, that kind of troll.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:22.920]   Yeah, that's the point.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.480]   There is no-- there is no civility there.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.840]   That's the point.
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:30.840]   So societal norms are not an issue there.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:31.840]   No.
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:32.840]   No.
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:35.240]   And that rests out on--
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:36.960]   we can't rule everything by the edge case.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.320]   That's the problem with technopanic.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.320]   Right.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:40.320]   The edge case is--
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:40.820]   Right.
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:42.280]   There's lots of middle ground where
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.120]   you could have some effect.
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.120]   Right.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:49.320]   So I guess my use case here is people
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:52.120]   who would never do this otherwise, who
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:56.640]   are-- or are decent, smart, civilized people, who either
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:59.040]   say something snarky or to me just as bad.
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.520]   Well, I don't do that myself.
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:01.920]   But they yell, fight, fight.
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.400]   And they encourage and think it's funny.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.240]   So they don't think of the feelings
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:07.680]   or impact on the other human being.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:12.360]   How do we appeal to that human nature of those people?
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.720]   Just channel the--
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:17.360]   just channel the Dalai Lama, whatever he would do.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.640]   What about that?
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:21.400]   I mean, really seriously, instead of yelling back at them.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.600]   You're asking how to encourage thoughtfulness
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:29.680]   given a tool that's built to be instantaneous off the cuff,
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.640]   the first thing that came to mind, right?
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:34.760]   I mean, there's a conflict between building
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:37.920]   a super usable, easy product, especially with Twitter,
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.520]   140 characters, directly from SMS, whatever,
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:46.960]   and asking smart people to think before they react to something.
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.960]   It's tough.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:52.360]   I mean, this is part of what we're doing to think of
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:56.960]   is trying to get people to think about the results
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:57.960]   of their actions.
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:58.960]   That's what you're doing.
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:22:59.960]   That works.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:00.960]   Let's think about that.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:01.960]   Well, I mean, mindfulness and thoughtfulness
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:05.960]   isn't really an easy sell, right?
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:09.960]   But you're doing it in such a gentle, nice way.
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:10.960]   You're watching.
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:11.960]   I didn't even think about that.
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:12.960]   It's a positive feedback loop.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:14.960]   But we're sitting next to somebody who's really doing--
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.960]   is actually doing something about it.
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:17.960]   Yeah, I mean, I hope so.
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.960]   If we can make it fun-- a fun enough--
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.960]   what we're trying to do is sort of package the broccoli,
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:24.960]   you know, in a Snickers bar, or I don't know how you--
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.960]   but I want to make it kind of a fun, delightful experience.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:30.960]   But the core of it is, hey, think about what's going on here
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:31.960]   and what your--
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:35.960]   Is that really what the purpose of ThinkUp was?
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:37.960]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:38.960]   Making your time online more meaningful.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:39.960]   We all spend this time online.
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:42.960]   We all spend our attention in certain ways, right?
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.960]   And are they making our lives better?
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.960]   Are they making other people's lives better?
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.960]   Are we using these platforms the best way that we can?
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:52.960]   And it's absolutely-- from the very beginning.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:57.960]   So what are the insights-- give us kind of the story behind
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.960]   on some of the insights that you offer and how you think that
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.960]   that is a part-- I know it is, but I want to hear your rationale,
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:07.960]   your logical steps when you chose what insights to create.
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.960]   Yeah, we can look at my ThinkUp as you want.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:10.960]   I got it up here.
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:11.960]   Yeah, sure.
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:12.960]   I mean, you know what's--
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:15.960]   So you look at mine, and I say, I often use the Upward.
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.960]   But so you reward me for certain tweets.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.960]   You say, this has got a lot of retweets and favorites.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:21.960]   That means it's good.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.960]   I want to do more of that behavior.
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:26.960]   Yeah, I mean, we definitely-- so first, this is extremely
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:27.960]   difficult to quantify.
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.960]   It's extremely difficult to quantify thoughtfulness
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.960]   and meaningfulness, right?
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.960]   Because that's such a subjective thing.
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:35.960]   But yeah, part of what we do with ThinkUp is let you know
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:36.960]   how are people reacting to this?
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:37.960]   Are they liking it?
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:38.960]   Are they amplifying it?
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.960]   Are they replying to it?
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:43.960]   So even when it's a bad, even when it's bad, even when it's bad,
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:46.960]   if you're saying, hey, hey, Jarvis, a lot of people
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.960]   retweeted that.
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:48.960]   Are you sure you like that?
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:49.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.960]   And that's part of the challenge, right?
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.960]   Because if you didn't mention, you know, you got me.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:54.960]   Oh, Jesus.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:55.960]   Oh.
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.960]   Oh, dear.
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:58.960]   Oh, dear.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:04.960]   Well, in that case, you retweeted someone and you got their
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:07.960]   message out to a bunch more people because you've got a bigger
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.960]   audience than that person.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:09.960]   Thanks a lot, Leo.
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:10.960]   I don't know.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.960]   You see what happened there.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:13.960]   He followed me.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:14.960]   I don't have any control over that.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:15.960]   Oh, that was, I didn't even look.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:16.960]   I saw it go by.
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:17.960]   He followed me.
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:18.960]   I don't.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:19.960]   What can I do?
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:20.960]   I'm lovable.
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:21.960]   Right.
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:25.960]   So it says that I replied to Henry Blodgett 10 times last week
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.960]   and saying that we had a real conversation.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.960]   And that's a good thing.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:30.960]   Yes.
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:31.960]   Yes.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.960]   And again, this is a really hard problem and just even kind of
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:38.960]   wording our headlines and commentary about whatever happened.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.960]   The point is to sort of bring a kind of thoughtful thoughtfulness
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:42.960]   to it.
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:43.960]   What do people react to?
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:44.960]   Who's following you?
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.960]   That kind of thing.
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:50.960]   Because for the last week, I've, you know, I said last week and last
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.960]   week, I wasn't going off Twitter, but I've really tried to pull
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:54.960]   back.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:59.960]   And I'm doing the Dr. Strangelove thing on certain conversations.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.960]   I might have a smart ass line.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:04.960]   I might have to say it and I just say, nope, I couldn't do it.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:08.960]   I got a lot of replies to what I said.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.960]   As a laptop user, as a laptop using six foot four inch fly,
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:15.960]   frequent flyer, I sit in trap solidarity with victims of seat
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:16.960]   back recliners.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:19.960]   So you know what I have to say about that topic.
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:20.960]   And it caused discussion.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:23.960]   The discussion, there were a few trollish comments, but most all
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.960]   at all, it was an honest.
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:26.960]   You know, that's one way.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:27.960]   Interchange.
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:31.960]   One way to foster the kind of behavior you want online is to
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:33.960]   reward the good behavior.
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:37.960]   Not merely to punish the bad behavior, but have a wonderful
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.960]   conversation.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.960]   And people look at that and go, oh, you look, if you don't just
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:43.960]   snark at them, you can actually have a good conversation.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.960]   That's one way.
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:51.960]   So Facebook gets crap for trying to have a pleasant environment.
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:52.960]   They might do it clumsily.
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:57.960]   They might go badly, but it is truly a social environment, a
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:58.960]   Thanksgiving table.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:26:59.960]   That's what they're trying to be.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.960]   That's why the Pew study was off, I think.
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.960]   And you can say it's too controlled.
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:05.960]   Mom never lets us really talk.
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:07.960]   She always gets mad if we start to argue about anything.
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.960]   We can't talk politics at home.
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:10.960]   It's no fun here.
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:13.960]   You could say all that stuff and it can be perfectly legitimate
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:14.960]   and plain against Facebook.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.960]   But that's what Facebook is.
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:19.960]   It's not an open platform.
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:21.960]   This tweet.
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:22.960]   22 replies.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:23.960]   Wow.
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:25.960]   This is a...
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.960]   Casper mattress 900 bucks.
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:28.960]   Packers blanket 50 bucks.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:30.960]   Fort made from Casper Mattrix bucks.
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.960]   That was a great one.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:33.960]   I'm really happy.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:35.960]   Credit to that to Lisa.
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:36.960]   That's her joke.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.960]   But that's her son in the Casper box.
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:41.960]   I love Aziz.
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:43.960]   He's gone.
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:44.960]   Hey, let's take him.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:45.960]   This is a good conversation.
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:52.960]   As always, this show is full of them.
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:54.960]   I'm full of it.
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.960]   Thank you.
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:57.960]   Let's take a break.
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:00.960]   We're going to get to your picks.
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:02.960]   What do you think of Tint, by the way?
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:03.960]   Is that anything interesting there?
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:04.960]   Have you seen that, Gina?
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:06.960]   No, it's Tint.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:07.960]   Tint.io.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.960]   This is more of the...
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:13.960]   I think this is more of the stuff Kevin Marx was talking about,
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:16.960]   which is getting your data localized.
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:19.960]   And this is kind of what you were talking about,
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:22.960]   federating communications, a protocol for personal data
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:23.960]   and communications.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:26.960]   So you could federate your social media,
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:29.960]   federate your blog posts, things like that.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:30.960]   I think there's...
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:31.960]   You know, there may be...
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:34.960]   There may be there is a technological solution we could find
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:35.960]   somewhere out there.
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.960]   Yeah, but the user experience has to be...
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:39.960]   Yeah, this is...
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:45.960]   Can you run MongoDB on your PHP 5.4 Apache stack?
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:46.960]   You can have an AC2 instance.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:47.960]   No sense.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:48.960]   No support.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:49.960]   No support.
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:51.960]   And then you're good to go.
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.960]   Just SSH into the server and start it up and you'll be good.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:55.960]   Good.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:59.960]   I wish the world were full of people who knew how to do that.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:02.960]   That would be a good world.
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.960]   It'd be a different world.
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:05.960]   Well, it'd be different.
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.960]   But I like those people.
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.960]   That's how I got into this, you know, is that I really...
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.960]   I just like geeks.
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:13.960]   And I feel comfortable with geeks.
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:16.960]   And I want to talk about SSH and LAMP stacks.
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.960]   What else I want to talk about this?
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:19.960]   Look at this.
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:20.960]   Look at this little box.
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.960]   This little box could change your world.
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:27.960]   This can mean that your printer, no matter what, even a USB printer that's not on the network,
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:33.960]   suddenly is not only a network printer, but a Google Cloud print compatible network printer.
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:38.960]   You could print to your, you know, five-year-old USB printer that never even heard the word,
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:43.960]   you know, Wi-Fi from any Android phone, tablet, Chromebook, a Kindle Fire.
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:46.960]   This is the Landtronics X-Print server.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:51.960]   And what it does, it will take any printer, almost any printer, about 4,000 top brand printer.
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:30:00.960]   And turn it into a network printer that is compatible with Google for cloud print and Android printing.
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.960]   It's very easy, too.
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:04.960]   There's no software to install anywhere.
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:05.960]   There's no upgrade.
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:08.960]   You just take it out of the box, plug it in, and you're printing.
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.960]   There is a web interface.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:13.960]   If you want to do advanced configuration, but I can almost promise you, you won't need to.
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:19.960]   One X-Print server can support multiple printers and virtually unlimited Android devices.
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:21.960]   It's 149.95.
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:24.960]   They also make an air print version, but this is the cloud print version.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:31.960]   And it supports up to 10 network printers and eight USB printers all at the same time.
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:36.960]   It's got one USB port, but you just put a hub on there and you can just plug eight printers into it.
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:39.960]   You want to know more, exprintserver.com/twit.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:43.960]   And if you use the offer code "twit", you'll get free shipping on your order.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:48.960]   We, the folks at Landtronics have been selling a lot of these because it's such a great idea.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:53.960]   And if you compare it with other print servers, it's a very affordable price.
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:57.960]   And the idea that gives you Google Cloud Print, I don't know if you've ever used Google Cloud Print,
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:01.960]   but it means I can print to my printer at home anywhere I am if I can get online.
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:02.960]   It is awesome.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:07.960]   exprintserver.com/twit.
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:10.960]   And the offer code is "twit" from Landtronics, the exprintserver.
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:12.960]   Really cool stuff.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:17.960]   Let me add something to that if I may, because I have my cloud life and I use Google Cloud Print
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:25.960]   and I bought a new printer because I want other functionality like scanning to my Google Docs 3640.
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.960]   But it goes to sleep.
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:36.960]   And so even for a certified Google Cloud Print printer, I need the Landtronics because it'll wake it up
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.960]   when I'm off somewhere a week not printing.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:40.960]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:50.960]   Even with Cloud Printer, Landtronics is helpful because it's always awake for me on my network at home.
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:51.960]   That's awesome.
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:56.960]   And having a network printer is so nice because it means you don't have to put it next to the computer.
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:59.960]   You can put it in a closet or somewhere.
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:00.960]   Right.
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:01.960]   Yeah.
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:09.960]   Before we get to the tip tool and pick of the week, did you see this recode is now saying we're going to do native advertising?
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:12.960]   My tweet was at to recode.
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:13.960]   Oh, no.
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:17.960]   Does this mean that they're struggling or does it just, what does it mean?
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:20.960]   No, it probably means that advertisers are saying, why don't you play along?
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:21.960]   Why don't you do this too?
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:23.960]   God, you know, of course, advertisers are saying this.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:24.960]   We'll be very careful.
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:29.960]   From the day we started doing, I started doing whatever I do, people have come along and said,
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:32.960]   "Hey, would you mind if we did a show about our product?"
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:35.960]   And I've always said, "No, what are you crazy?"
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:41.960]   We do ads. You want to buy an ad? You can buy an ad, but I'm not going to do content that looks like it's editorial,
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:46.960]   but it's advertisements, advertorial. That's what we used to call it.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.960]   I'm sure that the two of them will make sure it's labeled well and all that.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:51.960]   It is.
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:52.960]   It is.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:54.960]   You know, here's the, I don't want to talk about this.
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:33:02.960]   I guess we talked about the big world in the issues last week, but Ethan Zuckerman, who's a brilliant guy at MIT Media Lab.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:11.960]   And one of the founders of, oh crap, old homepage maker company.
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:13.960]   It will occur to me in a minute.
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:14.960]   Next site.
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:17.960]   Ethan's, no, no, no, no. Are you earlier than that?
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:20.960]   Oh, tripod.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:22.960]   Tripod, thank you very much.
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:25.960]   Who needs memory when you have Google and Leo? And in a chat room.
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:30.960]   So Ethan wrote a piece in the Atlantic two weeks ago, I think it was,
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:34.960]   saying that accepting advertising on the web was the web's original sim.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:38.960]   And usually it's said that the original sim on the web was giving away content for free.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.960]   So here was a sim matching the sim.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:44.960]   And I disagreed with Ethan respectfully because he's brilliant.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:47.960]   And it's a really smart piece. And I wrote a blog post in response.
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:54.140]   response. But here's the - the nub, the nub of my view of this, is we haven't begun to
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:59.160]   innovate with advertising at all. The only innovations we've seen so far are basically
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:05.260]   computerizing the processes we already have of buying mass advertising message opportunities
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:08.900]   and creating pop-ups, which by the way, Ethan is responsible for having to help create pop-ups.
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:17.280]   -Oh yeah. He wrote that article. Yeah. -Yeah. And - and he's sorry. And - and so it's going
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:21.680]   to sound odd coming from a journalism prof, but we need to innovate in advertising. We
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:25.220]   need to find truly new ways for companies to market and hope that, by the way, that
[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:29.520]   media is part of that new method. And advertising agencies aren't going to do it because they
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:33.040]   sell the old stuff and advertisers aren't going to do it. And media companies haven't
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:38.280]   been doing it, but we have to rethink advertising because if it doesn't work and if it collapses
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:44.760]   and dies, then media goes with it and we need its support. So I was sad - that's why I
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:49.360]   was sad to see Ricode take the - you know, jump on the bandwagon and I'm not blaming
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:53.400]   them for it. I bet the advertisers forced them to and said, "We've got a RFP here and
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:57.800]   we want you to run these things." And they probably had a staff meeting and said, "Let's
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:03.880]   figure out how to do it as best we can." But it's an old advertorial stupid, let's fool
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:09.120]   the reader model and we've got to go move past that. And where are the innovators in advertising?
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:09.960]   I don't see them yet.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:16.320]   So here's what Ricode does. Normally there's a black banner on the content, but sponsor
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:21.080]   content will have a blue banner that says sponsor content. And what Walt Mossberg says
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:25.240]   in his article about this is, "Hey, don't ignore those. Those are going to be great
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:28.960]   articles full of good material." It's just written by a sponsor.
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:30.960]   Yeah, just not one of our journalists.
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:34.960]   Yeah. And they're also saying, "We're not going to try to trick you. We're going to make
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:36.520]   it very clear that it's sponsored content."
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:39.320]   And we're not going to have our journalists right then, which some places.
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:44.600]   Both things are very important. But your point about Forbes, and you never know whether you're
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:48.240]   going to reshare a link that you see from Forbes on Twitter because you never know if
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:52.640]   it's real journalism or sponsored content, that's going to be true on Ricode unless they've
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.960]   got some way of indicating on Twitter. And what is so?
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:59.680]   If it values their links.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:06.680]   In a link, if you link to something on Twitter and you say, "I saw this on Forbes, Twitter
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:10.520]   has got a truncate," even if you put a clue in the URL as the New York Times does, it
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:15.760]   says paid post. at whitetimes.com. Well, I guess truncated. It's gone.
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:22.720]   Right. If I ever, I will shut this place down if we ever have, can't survive without doing
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:26.320]   that. That's not ever going to happen.
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.320]   Ever.
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:32.920]   Gina Trapani, you must have a tip for us.
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:38.280]   I do. This was for fellow Chromecast lovers, such as myself. I still have been living in
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:42.240]   New York eight months now. I still haven't unpacked any other. There's just the Chromecast
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:48.120]   plugged into my TV at this point. I'm just too lazy or something. Two new apps on Android
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:54.480]   and iOS added Chromecast support. Watch ABC, which surprised me. I mean, does the official
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:57.640]   ABC app really want you to why they do now?
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:01.160]   They didn't use to. They used to not like, I mean, wasn't it all work?
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:06.360]   Go out of it, block it. Yeah. So when Google TV came out, like, Hey, watch your web browser
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:12.080]   on TV. They like the ABC.com would detect are you on Google TV and block the content.
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:16.360]   I would say not support in your device. Well, now we've seen them come total 180. Now you
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:19.800]   can cast a bachelor's in paradise right.
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:24.960]   Wait a minute. I'm not going to let you skim by that.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:31.120]   Gina, we find out about your TV tastes every week. She's got a kind of print.
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:34.360]   I'm proud of my diversity.
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:43.080]   Mma. Bachelor. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Listen, what is your worst worst TV?
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:49.360]   confession. I think the bachelor, the bachelor franchise is definitely the one or the day
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:58.120]   she watched all of the Kardashian. Actually, defense. She binge watched binge watched the
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:03.160]   Kardashian. That's as bad as five minutes is bad enough. We we found out when Steve
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:08.040]   bomber left Microsoft, he binge watched 100 episodes of The Good Wife in two weeks.
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:13.920]   The Good Wife is a great show. I know. But two weeks, 100 episodes. That's a lot. That's
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:18.720]   a lot. I don't feel so bad about playing Diablo for nine hours last night.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:24.720]   Listen, once the baby goes to sleep, I get to do whatever I want. And if it's the bat
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:28.760]   to learn paradise, that's what it is. You earned it, baby. What is what is your dad?
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:32.440]   Is this something you watch with your wife? Not to not to bring her into the scary. Oh,
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:39.480]   she judges. She's so whole. Interesting. She. Oh, yeah. She can't even she. I have to sort
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:45.400]   of do it around her schedule. I mean, right now there's very little TV on she and I are
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:49.760]   watching Orphan Black together. Okay. But when I get the TV alone or the tablet or the
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:55.000]   phone, I'm yeah, I'm sneaking their Kardashians with that. So yeah, yeah, she she actually
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:04.440]   she questions being in my presence during that though. She's not very judgy, but in that
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:14.240]   in this case, she she makes an exception. Mm hmm. It's justified. It's justified. So
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:19.120]   thank you. What was the tip? I forgot. Oh, Chromecast. Watch it. Oh, you said another
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:25.200]   one. What else? NPR one. Oh, I love NPR one. Much better suited to public intellectuals.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:31.440]   NPR one also now has a Chromecast support. So the bachelor or NPR? What's the bachelor
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:35.760]   NPR? It's the whole spectrum, guys. Yeah. Well, I think that you're one of the most important
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:40.280]   moments in the history of TVs to switch to the digital was that was when ABC, there was
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:45.440]   ABC again, decided to stream vet desperate housewives the morning after. And that was
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:51.800]   saying to every single affiliate, that heck with you, every man for himself. Yeah. And
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:57.000]   we got we got to go with this new thing. Sorry, I know we're screwing you about. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:03.040]   And so TV networks are highly pragmatic. And that's why I think that's really interesting
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:06.560]   to point that out, Gina, that ABC wasn't played a lot before. And the fact that they
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:12.920]   are now says a lot about over the top. It does now. Let me just say the experience isn't
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:16.800]   great. You still have to sign in with your cable providers. You still have to go through
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:21.560]   the ads, which I'm actually found with the ads. But you know, it's not your Netflix or
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:28.480]   your Hulu even, but it's something. Right. So there you go. Baby steps, Chromecast.
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:33.600]   Jeff, do you have a number for us? Yeah, it was kind of a quiet week. But the one I came
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:40.160]   up with was that Google's mobile search revenue last year was $8 billion. And, and you know,
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:45.160]   the rest of media all say that you can't make any money on mobile, but somehow Google does.
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:52.320]   It's 8 billion compared to how much they make on the rest of it. I think it's like,
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:55.560]   what's it? 30 by the last year? Okay. So it's like a third.
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:00.760]   It's a it's a good chunk. Yeah. And they figured out how to make it work.
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:04.760]   It has to. I mean, otherwise, I mean, mobile is where everybody's going. Yeah.
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:10.240]   Desktop advertising doesn't matter. So both Facebook and Google seem to have licked it.
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:14.840]   Yep. We haven't in media. I still hear media companies say,
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:15.840]   huh? What's the real?
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:22.720]   My tool is a tool you all know, but it's dropped its price considerably. We thought it might when we
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:29.160]   heard that Google was dropping the cost of Google Drive and Microsoft dropping the cost of Microsoft
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:35.840]   OneDrive and Flickr offering a terabyte of storage for free Dropbox, which of course is in,
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:42.160]   you know, solely in the business of storage is now a terabyte for its $10 a month.
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:45.760]   It used to be a hundred megabytes. In fact, I was when I saw what Google,
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:49.160]   Google Drive, which is also comparable price. When I saw they did that,
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:52.240]   I thought that kills Dropbox. Well, they're going to, they're hanging in there.
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:57.320]   But as Paul Thorett pointed out today on Windows Weekly,
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:00.920]   it's tough for Dropbox because that's their business for Google and Microsoft.
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:03.920]   It's just a sideline. But you know, Lee, I was thinking about this.
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:08.160]   I wonder how many people hit what was a hundred megabytes before?
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:10.720]   Oh, yeah. Nobody needs all that storage.
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:18.160]   I'm not sure that there, you know, what's the what's the incremental bit of those who did the upsell?
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:20.440]   Not a hundred megabytes, by the way, a hundred gigs. I apologize.
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.640]   I mean, a hundred gigs. Oh, I said, I know it's two.
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:28.720]   Very good. So, so how many people are they losing who were doing the what's the opposite of an upsell?
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:33.280]   An up by above the hundred gig.
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:39.280]   Maybe maybe people weren't moving over because after all Dropbox is tied into things like to do text
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:44.840]   and other apps on your phone in ways that these other solutions aren't.
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:50.440]   But new buyers are going to be less likely to go to Dropbox when they've already got a terabyte from
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:54.280]   Google Drive or somebody like that.
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:43:00.440]   I think the falling price of hard drives is part of the part of the engine of this.
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:01.560]   What's a hard drive?
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:03.640]   Definitely. I wouldn't I wouldn't know myself.
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:08.000]   But that's because you have hard drives in the sky.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.560]   You're still on hard drives. I do. I do.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.960]   All kinds. I just read that.
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:20.360]   If you heard about whiskey tango, Fox truck, the book, the book, I just ordered it on Audible.
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:21.600]   I can't wait. Is it good?
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:25.480]   I just listen to it on Audible and it's and the performance is great.
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:27.200]   It's not the book because you're going to love it.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.360]   I can't wait.
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:36.760]   But it's not very sci-fi-ish, but one of the little sci-fi tricks is that the computers in it are organic.
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:44.880]   Which really starts to make you think interesting ways that we presume that there is these hard elements making things.
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:48.720]   And it's kind of throw it's a throw away. I'm not spoiling anything.
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:50.680]   It's a techno thriller. Gina.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:54.880]   Oh, this looks amazing. I'm reading the Amazon listing here. This sounds great.
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:44:01.600]   It's very good. And it's somewhat I even though it's somewhat dystopian about publicness and privacy and data and all that stuff,
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:05.120]   I enjoy the hell out of it. It's wonderfully written.
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:09.760]   It's just just word choices and little phrase. It turns a phrase that are just delightful.
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:11.360]   The body. I'm so excited.
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:13.920]   You know, is what it is with the characters.
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:17.680]   But and the writing and the performance in the audiobook is excellent.
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:20.880]   And this and the hero is named Leo. So I got to like that.
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:21.960]   There you go.
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:24.080]   He's a whatever it is.
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:29.760]   An unhinged trust to foreign. What's a trust to foreign trust fund?
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:33.440]   Oh, trust to far. He's a he's a flinty trust.
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:41.840]   He's a flinty trust to far in whiskey Tango Fox drop by David Schaeffer.
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:43.840]   Yeah, I saw the New York Times article.
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:46.240]   A review which said it's probably the book of the summer.
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:48.880]   So I immediately got it on Audible. And it's probably my next book.
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:51.960]   And that was not an audible ad.
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:53.520]   Nor was it native advertising.
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:58.800]   Somebody said, Leo, you do native advertising every time you do an audible ad because you have book pics.
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.840]   That's not that's different.
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:05.440]   That's an ad in which content has been inserted, not a not content in which an ad has been inserted.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:08.080]   It's exactly the opposite of native advertising.
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:14.320]   Well, I mean, in some fairness, radio host red spots.
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:19.040]   Or in a sense what native advertising wants to be because they want to be in the voice.
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:19.320]   Right.
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:22.000]   But a good radio pro like you
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:24.600]   changes your voice. No, it's time to talk about it.
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.120]   Yeah, you know, it's an ad.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:31.200]   And you're saying it outright and you're giving every possible signal that you can try not to make it.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:35.200]   Yeah. But I do have to do the ads because there's no one else to do them for me.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:36.320]   Well, yeah.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:39.040]   The only issue is is anyone confused?
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:43.760]   No one if you sat down and quizzed anyone watches the show or listens to the show,
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:47.480]   even listens without the visual cues that you have on the screen.
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:52.360]   I don't think you would have any one who'd be confused about
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:55.320]   whether or not this is turned into this. We can mattresses.
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:58.840]   And one of the things we do is we make sure that people like Jeff and Gina,
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:03.320]   the co-hosts who are on all of our shows are never asked to read ads.
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:05.400]   The ads are read by staff and staff analysis.
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:08.680]   Well, when I toss in and say something about the principle,
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:09.400]   I'm like to stop you.
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:09.880]   Not my rule.
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:15.480]   I ain't going to stop you, but we never would ever require you or ask you to.
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:20.040]   Furthermore, we often ask our hosts whether they'd be OK with that ad.
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:23.560]   We actually, I say often because I realize that we never asked you if you have a problem with
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:26.040]   Casper mattresses, but I don't think you do.
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:29.160]   I think you're the one who has a problem with sleep.
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:32.280]   I do. I didn't do it at 2.30 AM.
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:37.000]   You stay up with it. Well, because then you're you're ready and going home to your pillow.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.560]   Because I have such an uncomfortable buckwheat pillow waiting for me.
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:46.280]   No, I was I was using the buckwheat pillow during my nine hour marathon.
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:49.320]   I don't know why I don't want to know what you're doing with it.
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:52.520]   No, I'm kind of with you. In fact, when we first started doing ads on this network,
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:57.480]   a lot of people outside the US who were not used to that kind of host right ad were kind of upset
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:02.040]   because hosts in the, for instance, the UK never read ads.
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:07.000]   Because most of the most of the stations there are government runs.
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.200]   So they don't have ads at all.
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:08.680]   They have it.
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:17.320]   Yeah. But in fact, frankly, I if but it's because what's no one else, I had to read the ad.
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:21.080]   And none of our advertisers have radio ads or TV ads.
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:24.120]   So I just had to read the ad.
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:28.360]   That would that would so not work on this network to throw on a 30.
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:32.760]   Yeah, I feel like it'd be more of an interruption than what we do, even though it gets quicker.
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:36.440]   I can see the video. Do you get your requests to use an advertisers 30s?
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:37.960]   I'd be glad to if they asked me to.
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:40.840]   Yeah. Nobody's ever asked because you've now.
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:43.320]   Of course, they far prefer the native advertising.
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.720]   Now I'm feeling guilty. No.
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:55.400]   I just want to I just want to be able to pay the rent dinner and go shopping.
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:00.280]   I just want to live with video games, video games.
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:03.800]   Hey, it's $60. There's no, no, you know, those are expensive video games.
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:05.640]   I got to pay your Comcast.
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:09.320]   I just paid two not one, but two college tuitions.
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:11.800]   That's fun.
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:13.640]   Hey, I got that ready for next year.
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:14.520]   Yeah, that's fun.
[01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:17.000]   That's going to go on for three more years.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.080]   You thought it was going to be sick and paid.
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:22.680]   Yeah, it should have been sick.
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:26.280]   Abby took time off and now I'm screwed.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:28.440]   They're actually now the same year.
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:29.960]   They're both soft.
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:31.160]   And cost goes up too.
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:31.800]   That's the other good.
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:32.120]   What?
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:33.320]   Who?
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:33.640]   Who?
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:34.520]   You get the prices.
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:39.000]   There was some school that Jake looked at some time ago where, and I forget which one it was,
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.480]   but if you if you got accepted, they froze the position.
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:43.880]   I like that.
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:44.680]   That would have been cool.
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:45.720]   Yeah, four years and out.
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:50.200]   That school is now out of business, ladies.
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:59.480]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor at a school that teaches people how to be good citizens,
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:01.400]   a city university of New York.
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:06.440]   He's offices there on Times Square, and we are really glad to have him as part of the show,
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.680]   the last public intellectual.
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:09.960]   No, don't say that.
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:12.600]   I make no such claim.
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:14.520]   He writes books, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:15.080]   Ever.
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:17.080]   I'm a schmucka schlob.
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:18.120]   He blogs.
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:20.280]   He meets with presidents, world leaders.
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:24.360]   He goes to the world economic forum in Davos.
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:27.800]   What more could you ask for?
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:30.520]   Gina Trappani and I are public geeks.
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:31.960]   I'm proud to be a public geek.
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:33.960]   I aspire.
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.400]   You should you are a public geek.
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:36.280]   I'm a very amazing.
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:37.160]   You're on.
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:42.040]   See, I have to sit for my webcam like a couple hours a week, but you're just out there all the time.
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:44.360]   You know what?
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:49.800]   The best part about my job is I get to talk with people like you, and so it's not hard.
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:51.000]   It's fun.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:51.880]   It's like sitting down.
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:57.560]   I said I arranged my life so that I would get to sit down and talk to really great people
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:59.720]   about really interesting stuff for hours a day.
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:01.400]   Have a good chat.
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:01.720]   Wow.
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:03.480]   How did that happen?
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:04.360]   It's good.
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:05.080]   We're pretty lucky.
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:05.720]   Yeah, we are.
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:11.720]   Gina Trappani is, of course, at Think Up and you must go and get your free trial available now at ThinkUp.com.
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:13.240]   Do do do.
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:14.680]   It makes you a better tweeter.
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:16.600]   A better face.
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:17.400]   We're doing our job.
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:17.960]   It does.
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:18.840]   Sure.
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:22.200]   I had no idea that that was kind of the thinking, but you're absolutely right.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:22.520]   It does.
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:23.720]   I swear I don't get it fully now.
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:24.680]   Yeah.
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:28.360]   I mean, it's a disconnect between it, what analytics are and what they should do.
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:29.560]   And we're definitely struggling with it.
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:34.360]   I mean, we're trying our best and we're just at the beginning stages, but yeah, that's the idea.
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:37.160]   But of course, it's a Neil Dash and Gina Trappani.
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:39.400]   Of course, it's going to be like a good thing.
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:40.120]   I see this.
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:41.000]   Of course.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.160]   They're trying to take over the world and improve it.
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:43.800]   Of course, they are.
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:45.480]   Would you get a Neil on this show sometime?
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:46.920]   He would love?
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:47.400]   Yes.
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:47.880]   Absolutely.
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:48.120]   He'd love to do that.
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:48.120]   Yeah.
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:51.080]   I think he'd be intrigued about that this week that people say, "In Neil, you should be able to
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:54.760]   build more shows," and he mentioned, "Twig," and how we'd like to disagree with him, which I'm going to
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:55.720]   disagree with you on that.
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:57.960]   We don't like to disagree with you.
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:50:59.080]   We have to stop that.
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:50:59.320]   Yes.
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:01.160]   Chad, make it no.
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:03.080]   Next week, let's see if we can get a Neil on.
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:03.320]   Yeah.
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:04.200]   I would love to have him on.
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:08.760]   You know, I never, I didn't really push forward because, you know, he's my business partner and I didn't want to kind of
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.200]   overrun the joint with...
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:14.920]   I've known a Neil for ages, as I think most people in the business have.
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:18.840]   I met him first when he was working for...
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:20.440]   Six apart.
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:21.080]   Six apart.
[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:28.840]   And I was a big, I used Vox, they're kind of the consumer version, but I also used the, in fact,
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:34.360]   before it even came out, their blog platform, which I was escaping me now, TypePad.
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:35.480]   TypePad?
[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:36.120]   Yeah.
[01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:37.480]   And they lived in Petaluma, you know.
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:38.280]   They were local.
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:42.520]   You know, I just thought I thought of the Christmas present, you can get a Neil now.
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:43.320]   What's that?
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:43.640]   What's that?
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:45.320]   A love story in dots and dashes.
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:47.640]   Yeah.
[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:48.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:50.680]   Ben and Mina Trot, there's the names I was looking for.
[01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:51.000]   Yes.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:51.400]   Oh, right.
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:51.960]   Ben and Mina.
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:53.560]   Well, I was like, they ever lived in Petaluma.
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:54.520]   It lived in Petaluma.
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:55.080]   That was so funny.
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:55.720]   That's so funny.
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:57.640]   And that was an early beta user of TypePad.
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:51:58.440]   I loved TypePad.
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:51:59.320]   Wow.
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:00.280]   Yeah, we'll get a Neil on.
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:01.320]   I would love to have him on.
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:01.880]   Good.
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:02.840]   You're all out of a lot of fun.
[01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:03.160]   Good.
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:04.760]   All right.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:05.640]   Thanks, Gina.
[01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:06.040]   Thanks, Jeff.
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:07.480]   Thanks to all of you for joining us.
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:09.160]   We do this week in Google.
[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:10.680]   It's my last show of the week.
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:12.360]   This is my Friday night.
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:13.160]   Good for you.
[01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:13.800]   Yeah.
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:14.360]   1 p.m. Pacific.
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:15.480]   The place in video games.
[01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:17.320]   You got it, baby.
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:19.560]   He's heading for the Casper Mathras before you.
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:21.640]   I got the mattress in front of the TV.
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:23.400]   The joysticks all fired up.
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:25.320]   I got my big gulp.
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:28.520]   My hot pockets.
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:29.080]   I'm ready.
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:29.960]   One question.
[01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:33.320]   You get home after 23 hours straight of game playing.
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:34.920]   What does Lisa say?
[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:37.640]   She was fast asleep.
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:38.520]   We haven't spoken.
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:39.480]   No, but what she said today.
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:40.280]   So you got home.
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:41.240]   You did what?
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:41.800]   I didn't get home.
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:42.440]   I was at home.
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:43.800]   I was in my office playing.
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:44.360]   I was home.
[01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:46.440]   I mean, you were called upstairs.
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:48.040]   The next day she says, "Where were you?"
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:48.680]   What did you say?
[01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:49.000]   No.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.120]   She knows what I was doing.
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:50.600]   Did she laugh?
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:51.960]   No, she came in about 9 o'clock.
[01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:53.400]   She said, "At 9 o'clock,"
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:55.240]   she said, "Well, so are you going to play this all evening?"
[01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:56.040]   And I said, "Yeah."
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:58.040]   So I said, "Do you want to watch something we can watch?"
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:52:59.080]   So she said, "No, that's fine.
[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:00.520]   I just wanted to check in."
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:01.640]   "What did you do?"
[01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:02.120]   You watched.
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:03.800]   We have 18 TVs.
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:04.840]   It's not like--
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:05.720]   I know, but she did.
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:06.840]   She think you're nuts.
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:07.720]   Do you think I'm nuts?
[01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:11.240]   That's love.
[01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:12.120]   She loves me.
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:14.120]   And she knows-- and I don't do this all the time.
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:17.160]   I'm not like a hardcore gamer once in a while.
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:19.560]   Once a year, once every two years,
[01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:20.680]   there's a really good game.
[01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:22.600]   It turns out this game I played all the way through
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:23.160]   on the PC.
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:26.120]   But I really like it on the console.
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:27.960]   The last one was Bioshock Infinite.
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:29.880]   It's only once in a while.
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:30.920]   Most games I get them.
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:31.880]   I don't like them that much.
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:33.000]   And I play like watchdogs.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:33.960]   I thought it was going to be great.
[01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:35.400]   So I'm not a big-time gamer.
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:36.680]   But every once in a while,
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:39.880]   I don't know if it has to do with my life situation or the game.
[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:40.840]   I think it's more the game.
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:42.840]   I just get into a game and I play it all the way to the end.
[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:43.560]   And then that's done.
[01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:46.600]   And my thumbs stop working.
[01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:48.360]   And I hop.
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:50.520]   And I'm done.
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:51.960]   And I don't play anymore until next time.
[01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:54.040]   I should stream it on Twitch.
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:55.000]   You should.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:55.800]   You should.
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:56.360]   Oh, you--
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:58.280]   That's what I thought you were going to say you did.
[01:53:58.280 --> 01:53:59.000]   I was shut up.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.600]   It's built into the Xbox One.
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:01.080]   I could.
[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:02.600]   You should have.
[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:03.160]   Jesus.
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:03.480]   Yeah.
[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:04.600]   OK. I'll do that tonight.
[01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:05.800]   Next time.
[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:06.360]   Next time.
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:07.640]   Oh, you still got some more in?
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:07.880]   Yeah.
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:08.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:09.560]   Oh, no, I'm not done yet.
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:11.880]   I just created the just Diablo just took over.
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:14.040]   There's a big twist in this game.
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:15.480]   And the big twist just happened.
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:18.760]   And now I'm going to play.
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:21.960]   And I'm going to try to be funny while I'm playing.
[01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:22.680]   Do voices.
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:23.960]   And watch.
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:24.840]   This is--
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:27.000]   Gina, I think we just unemployed ourselves.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:27.880]   Yeah, I was going to say.
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:29.800]   I kick myself every moment.
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:31.000]   Because we did this a little bit when
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:33.880]   the last one I really like.
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:34.440]   Skyrim.
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:35.400]   Skyrim came out.
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:36.280]   I love Skyrim.
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:38.120]   And we broadcast it live.
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:38.760]   And it was so much fun.
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:40.680]   Brian Brushwood inspired me because he does the same thing.
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:44.200]   And if I had just known this was going to be the next big thing,
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:46.600]   I would have fired you all and just done that.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:49.080]   I had a couple of gamers with some personality.
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:50.120]   What was I thinking?
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:51.160]   We're good looking.
[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:52.680]   Talking about intellectual stuff.
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:53.640]   Nobody wants that.
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:56.840]   I think that was the most oxymoronic thing you've ever said, Gina.
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:01.800]   That was a triple oxymoron.
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:03.640]   Gamers with personalities were good looking.
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:04.120]   I--
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:06.120]   Oh man.
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:07.640]   And shots fired.
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:08.680]   That's not good.
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:11.080]   And he wonders why people are mean to him on Twitter.
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:12.040]   Woo.
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:13.640]   People are without a little something.
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:14.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:16.920]   I feel left out people.
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:18.280]   I'm sad.
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:20.520]   Actually, you know what happens at 11 p.m. tonight.
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:24.360]   BioShock comes out, the original BioShock on the iPad.
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:26.920]   I might be doing that instead.
[01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:32.120]   Ladies and gentlemen, we do this show in between video games,
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:34.440]   1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Time,
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:37.880]   2000 UTC every Wednesday on Twitter.
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:40.440]   And I hope you'll watch live if you can't on-demand audio
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:43.160]   and video made available after the fact with that TV/tweig.
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:48.360]   And all the podcast platforms and Stitcher and iTunes and all that stuff.
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:52.840]   Somebody said, well, you never mentioned Instacaster, Downcast,
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:56.760]   all of them, all of those.
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:55:59.640]   And I encourage you to subscribe.
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:03.640]   Because you know what? This is our big thinkers show.
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:07.000]   This is a show where we learn, we discuss, we talk.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.480]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:13.880]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
